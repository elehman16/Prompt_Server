Investigations have shown that 90% of VT and VF events occur within the first 48 hours after PCI. Not being benign, such arrhythmias result in a considerable increase in morbidity and mortality rate of patients undergoing primary PCI.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>In previous studies, using both EPO and darbepoetin revealed that erythropoietin-stimulating agents with a higher first dose (&#x0003e;20,000 IU) or total dose (&#x02265;30,000 IU) improved LV ejection fraction more significantly when compared with that of lower doses (&#x0003c;20,000 IU).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> High-dose EPO was superior to placebo, statistically improving LV ejection fraction by 1.02% and LV end systolic volume by &#x02212;4.61 mL in patients with acute STEMI, and it was generally well tolerated. The adverse effects reported in patients receiving high-dose EPO were essentially consistent with those in the placebo group. Therefore, in this study, we administered the dose of 33,000 IU of EPO.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In the clinical setting for patients, episodes of ventricular arrhythmias arose and continued for 12&#x02013;48 hours after the onset of MI.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In this study, occurrence of arrhythmias was monitored for 24 hours after PCI, and results showed significant differences in this regard. Burger et al<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> suggested beneficial effects of pretreatment with EPO on high-risk patients; although, treatment in the sufferers of coronary artery occlusions usually starts after the onset of symptoms.</p><p>The role of EPO in the protection of the heart from injury has been studied extensively in animal models, and it is increasingly becoming obvious that EPO provides significant protection against cell death and cardiac dysfunction.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In rodent models, EPO has been reported to decrease mortality.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Nevertheless, the controversy about administration of EPO continues in human studies. Nakamura et al<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> demonstrated that short-term therapy with low-dose rh-EPO could improve LV function and decrease the size of infarct with no noticeable effects on neointimal hyperplasia in PCI-treated coronary arteries. Ferrario et al<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> showed that administration of short-term high-dose EPO in the early phase of PCI-treated AMI could ameliorate LV function and diminish the size of infarct, while hemoglobin and hematocrit values remained normal. However, In REVEAL administration of 60,000 IU rh-EPO after PCI in patients with STEMI was successful neither in the reduction of the size of MI nor in attenuation of cardiac remodeling.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Similarly, a study on patients with non&#x02013;ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes receiving a single bolus of rh-&#x003b1;-EPO did not show any positive clinical effects or changes in cardiac enzymes levels. Despite numerous research, the effects of EPO on the human cardiac electrophysiology have remained unidentified thus far.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>This study demonstrated that administration of high-dose rh-EPO after PCI can significantly reduce arrhythmias in patients with STEMI, and when types of arrhythmias were analyzed, the incidence of significant arrhythmias in the placebo group was more than 2-fold in comparison with the EPO group. Such finding is in agreement with the initial observations of Hirata et al,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> who detected PI3-kinase&#x02013;dependent reductions in VF after myocardial ischemic/reperfusion in dogs, and that of Burger et al<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> who demonstrated EPO-mediated reductions in ventricular arrhythmia through increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in cardiomyocytes during myocardial ischemic/reperfusion in mice. Another research on rats showed that a single bolus dose of 5000 U/kg EPO at the time of resuscitation from VF could maintain the hemodynamic efficacy of chest compression and enable the return of spontaneous circulation with greater aortic pressure.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>As shown in animal models, antiarrhythmic effects of rh-EPO are applied through PI3-kinase&#x02013;dependent pathways and through several plausible mechanisms. First, on reperfusion conditions, activation of phospholipase C (PLC) through membrane &#x003b1;-adrenoreceptors of the myocardial cells augments the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphospate (IP3), which in turn triggers IP3 receptors on sarcoplasmic reticulum and releases Ca<sup>2+</sup>. An elevation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels initiates slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that lead to a delayed afterdepolarization, generating many arrhythmias such as VF. Moreover, PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphospate (PIP2) to form IP3. Given that PIP2 is a similar substrate for PI3-kinase and PLC, rh-EPO may prevent lethal arrhythmias through activation of PI3-kinase pathways that decreases PIP2 levels and results in the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload by IP3.</p><p>Second, oxygen-derived free radicals participate in the creation of reperfusion arrhythmias; therefore, rh-EPO may decrease reperfusion arrhythmias through averting the release of free radicals from neutrophils or act as a radical scavenger.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The third mechanism for antiarrhythmic effects of EPO is possible augmentation in nNOS. Burger et al<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> declared that the EPO-mediated declines in arrhythmias were probably in part mediated by nNOS, as there were not any noticeable antiarrhythmic effects subsequent to treating nNOS (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice with EPO.</p><p>Finally, pervious researchers have found evidence for antiarrhythmic effects of EPO that is possibly attributable to decrease in the size of myocardial infarct. Our findings were in accordance with that of Burger et al and showed that antiarrhythmic effects of EPO were not related to its anti-ischemic effects; because, in our study, the ischemic factors (CK-MB and STR percentage) had no significant changes, whereas the occurrence of arrhythmias was significantly decreased in the EPO group.</p><p>There are some concerns about the safety of administration when high doses of EPO are used. Some of the reported adverse effects for EPO are as follows: hypertension, seizure, elevated hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, and potential thrombogenic and carcinogenic effects.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Moreover, EPO can enhance the formation and reactivity of the platelets and red blood cells.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In this study, levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin remained within normal ranges after 2 weeks of administration. There were no significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate between the 2 groups within 2 weeks. Therefore, it seems that administration of EPO with this dose can be considered safe in patients with STEMI. In other studies, however, EPO has been administered with a dose of nearly twice more than 33,000 IU, and no adverse effects have reported.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>As a limitation, this investigation was a pilot study examining a small population of patient; therefore, the authors suggest the aforementioned results be considered cautiously.</p><p>This study demonstrated that treatment with EPO could reduce the incidence of significant arrhythmias after PCI in patients with STEMI. Although, our findings require a comprehensive investigation in order to be translated into clinical practice, they may support the use of rh-EPO as a cardioprotective agent in the treatment of patients with MI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank staff members of the Coronary Care Unit 1 (CCU1) in Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran.
