Targeting neglected cognitive aspects may provide a useful route. We tested a cognitive-training paradigm using positive mental imagery (imagery cognitive bias modification, imagery CBM), developed via experimental psychopathology studies, in a randomized controlled trial. Training was delivered via the Internet to 150 individuals with current major depression. Unexpectedly, there was no significant advantage for imagery CBM compared with a closely matched control for depression symptoms as a whole in the full sample. In exploratory analyses, compared with the control, imagery CBM significantly improved anhedonia over the intervention and improved depression symptoms as a whole for those participants with fewer than five episodes of depression and those who engaged to a threshold level of imagery. Results suggest avenues for improving imagery CBM to inform low-intensity treatment tools for depression. Anhedonia may be a useful treatment target for future work.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>cognitive-bias modification</kwd><kwd>Internet health</kwd><kwd>mental imagery</kwd><kwd>cognitive therapy</kwd><kwd>anhedonia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Many treatments have been developed for depression, but people are often unable to access them, and even if they can, the treatment may be ineffective: Even our best (psychological or pharmacological) are successful for only about 50% of depressed individuals (<xref rid="bibr36-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Hollon, Stewart, &#x00026; Strunk, 2006</xref>). There is increasing recognition that to reduce the huge global burden of depression (<xref rid="bibr89-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2008</xref>), we need to develop interventions that are not only more accessible (e.g., Internet-delivered psychological therapies; <xref rid="bibr4-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Andersson, Riper, &#x00026; Carlbring, 2014</xref>) but also more effective and resource efficient (<xref rid="bibr49-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin &#x00026; Rabbitt, 2013</xref>). A key strategy is the identification and targeting of clinical mechanisms that current treatments fail to improve (e.g., <xref rid="bibr44-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Insel, 2012</xref>) and greater personalization of treatments (e.g., <xref rid="bibr29-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Fu, Steiner, &#x00026; Costafreda, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Johansson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin &#x00026; Blase, 2011</xref>). Cognitive science offers one route to develop more effective, targeted treatment tools by identifying both the key cognitive mechanisms involved in the maintenance of a disorder and a potential means to modify them.</p><p>In depression, promising targets for intervention are offered by the cognitive biases that characterize the disorder&#x02014;dysfunctional patterns in interpretation, attention, and memory (e.g., <xref rid="bibr32-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Gotlib &#x00026; Joormann, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr58-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Mathews &#x00026; MacLeod, 2005</xref>). These have been the target of cognitive-training paradigms referred to as cognitive bias modification (CBM), which aim to retrain dysfunctional biases and thus improve symptoms (<xref rid="bibr52-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Koster, Fox, &#x00026; MacLeod, 2009</xref>). Although in its early stages, interest in clinical applications of CBM paradigms has accelerated in recent years, with new domains of disorder and populations coming under investigation (<xref rid="bibr55-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Lau, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr90-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Woud &#x00026; Becker, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We have developed a specific CBM paradigm as a potential treatment tool or adjunct for use in depression that focuses on two cognitive targets: mental imagery and interpretation. This &#x0201c;imagery CBM&#x0201d; involves repeated practice in generating positive resolutions via mental imagery when confronted with ambiguous stimuli, with the aim of instilling a more adaptive bias to automatically imagine positive resolutions of novel ambiguous information in everyday life (e.g., <xref rid="bibr42-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Mathews, Dalgleish, &#x00026; Mackintosh, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Mathews, Mackintosh, &#x00026; Dalgleish, 2008</xref>). The paradigm emerged from the experimental literature on modification of negative interpretive biases (<xref rid="bibr57-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Mathews &#x00026; Mackintosh, 2000</xref>), and in its development for depression, there has been increasing emphasis on the mental imagery component (<xref rid="bibr38-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &#x00026; Deeprose, 2009</xref>). Depression has been associated with a deficit in positive future imagery (<xref rid="bibr39-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, Moulds, &#x00026; Steele, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr62-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Morina, Deeprose, Pusowski, Schmid, &#x00026; Holmes, 2011</xref>). Thus, depressed individuals may particularly benefit from the repeated practice in generating positive mental images that is encouraged by imagery CBM. Furthermore, mental imagery has been relatively neglected in depression and, thus, may provide a new and promising avenue for treatment development (<xref rid="bibr87-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">We&#x000df;lau &#x00026; Steil, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A series of experimental studies with healthy participants (<xref rid="bibr37-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Coughtrey, &#x00026; Connor, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &#x00026; Shah, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr41-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes &#x00026; Mathews, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Nelis, Vanbrabant, Holmes, &#x00026; Raes, 2012</xref>) and dysphoric individuals (<xref rid="bibr64-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Pictet, Coughtrey, Mathews, &#x00026; Holmes, 2011</xref>) established the effects of imagery CBM in modifying interpretive bias and increasing positive affect in the laboratory. Furthermore, they demonstrated the importance of the instructions to use mental imagery (as opposed to verbal processing) for these effects. A single case series of imagery CBM completed daily for 1 week by seven depressed participants in their own homes provided initial evidence of clinical efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression (<xref rid="bibr8-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &#x00026; Holmes, 2010</xref>). Two subsequent preliminary randomized clinical studies (<italic>n</italic> = 13 per condition, again home-based) demonstrated a greater reduction in symptoms of depression when imagery CBM was compared with a control condition (<xref rid="bibr54-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Lang, Blackwell, Harmer, Davison, &#x00026; Holmes, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr82-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Torkan et al., 2014</xref>). <xref rid="bibr88-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Williams, Blackwell, Mackenzie, Holmes, and Andrews (2013)</xref> investigated a combination therapy of imagery CBM, delivered via the Internet, followed by Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT). The combined intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 38) was compared with a wait list (<italic>n</italic> = 31) and showed a significant benefit on symptoms of depression after both the imagery CBM and the iCBT components.</p><p>Our aim in the current study was to build on these results and further develop imagery CBM &#x0201c;from the lab toward the clinic&#x0201d; as a potential low-intensity treatment tool for depression. We extended the cognitive-training schedule from 1 to 4 weeks, doubling the number of training sessions completed at home from 6 to 12, and developed an Internet-delivered version. We also extended the follow-up from 2 weeks to 6 months. We aimed to recruit a larger sample of participants with current major depression than used in previous studies, and to carry out the study within the more rigorous evaluative framework of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the potential clinical efficacy of the imagery CBM in reducing symptoms of depression.</p><p>The trial also allowed us to examine mechanisms such as specific cognitive processes and symptoms influenced by imagery CBM. For example, the positive mental imagery aspect of the intervention suggests one potential clinical target that had previously not been explored: anhedonia. Anhedonia, the loss of interest in or enjoyment from activities, constitutes, alongside depressed mood itself, one of the two core diagnostic features of depression (<xref rid="bibr3-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). However, anhedonia does not respond well to current first-line treatments (pharmacological or psychological) and is predictive of poorer treatment outcomes (<xref rid="bibr83-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Treadway &#x00026; Zald, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr84-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Uher et al., 2012</xref>). Imagery CBM involves repeatedly imagining oneself engaging in a broad range of activities that resolve with positive outcomes (e.g., going to work, meeting a friend, getting up in the morning). Many of the training scenarios specify one or more positive emotions to be imagined, for example, enjoyment, pleasure, interest, or excitement. The repeated practice in imagining, enjoying, and gaining pleasure from activities during the imagery CBM may therefore lead to an increased ability to anticipate positive emotional outcomes from activities in daily life, something that may be particularly problematic in depression (<xref rid="bibr23-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Dunn, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr74-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Sherdell, Waugh, &#x00026; Gotlib, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Early indicators of how to match patients to treatments, or patient stratification (<xref rid="bibr29-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2013</xref>), are also important in development of experimental treatments. Potential treatment responders may be identified as falling into a particular clinical subgroup, or, alternatively, there may be more subtle indicators of patient engagement with the intervention that may be identifiable, such as early performance on a task (e.g., <xref rid="bibr14-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, Chen, &#x00026; Guastella, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Eberl et al., 2013</xref>). There may be large variation in treatment adherence and fidelity in Internet-delivered interventions (cf. <xref rid="bibr13-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Christensen, Griffiths, &#x00026; Farrer, 2009</xref>), and studies have been criticized for the failure to investigate this (<xref rid="bibr50-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Kiluk et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore sought to assess such aspects in the current study.</p><p>This article first focuses on the main outcome of the trial, change in symptoms of depression, and then addresses other outcome and process variables relevant to understanding the transition from experimental psychopathology research to a clinical trials framework. Our primary hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2167702614560746">1</xref></sup> was that participants who completed the imagery CBM intervention (imagery condition) would demonstrate a greater decrease in symptoms of depression during the 4 weeks from baseline to posttreatment than would participants completing a closely matched (i.e., active) control version of the program (control condition). Secondary hypotheses were that there would be greater improvements in cognitive targets from baseline to posttreatment and that improvements would be maintained at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Consistent with our interest in positive imagery and emotion, in further exploratory analyses we investigated the effect of imagery CBM on anhedonia. We also examined for whom (on the basis of baseline measures) the imagery CBM may be more effective and the role of active engagement in the training on outcomes.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2167702614560746"><title>Method</title><sec id="section2-2167702614560746"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>We conducted an RCT with two parallel groups.

In addition, participants had to be able to give informed consent, to access the Internet-based intervention, and to attend the research center for assessment appointments. We excluded participants who met criteria for a current psychotic or substance-abuse disorder, had a history of mania or hypomania, had started or changed dose of antidepressant medication during the past month, were currently receiving psychological therapy, or were involved in other current treatment trials.</p><p>Entrance to the trial was via self-referral. On contacting the research team, potential participants completed a set of screening questionnaires, including demographics and the Beck Depression Inventory&#x02013;II (BDI-II; <xref rid="bibr6-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Beck, Steer, &#x00026; Brown, 1996</xref>), via the study Web site. Participants scoring 14 or above on the BDI-II were invited for the eligibility assessment. In July 2012, we amended the protocol to include a brief structured telephone screening interview for all participants who scored 14 or above on the BDI-II, which was designed to screen out those participants who obviously met exclusion criteria.</p><p>The eligibility assessment took place at the research center. Participants gave written informed consent, after which a researcher conducted the SCID interview and collected information about current and past treatments for mental health. Ineligible participants were debriefed and provided with information about accessing local mental-health services, if appropriate. Eligible participants were invited to return for a face-to-face baseline assessment at the research center (see the Trial Sites and Approvals section in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2167702614560746">appendix</xref>).</p><p>Ethical approval was provided by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee South Central&#x02013;Oxford C (11/SC/0278).

Six sessions were in an auditory form in which participants listened to audio recordings of descriptions of everyday situations (approximately 10 s each) and were instructed to imagine themselves in the scenarios &#x0201c;as if actively involved, seeing them through your own eyes&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr42-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>). As in previous studies, the descriptions were initially ambiguous as to their resolution but always ended positively. The other 6 sessions used stimuli in a picture-word form in which participants were presented with ambiguous photos of mostly everyday scenes paired with a caption of a few words that resolved the ambiguity in a positive way (<xref rid="bibr43-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Mathews, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr64-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Pictet et al., 2011</xref>). Participants were instructed to generate a mental image combining the picture and the words.</p><p>Each of the 12 sessions started with reminder instructions and a practice example followed by 64 training stimuli arranged into eight sets of 8 with a self-paced break in between each set (cf. <xref rid="bibr8-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &#x00026; Holmes, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr54-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2012</xref>). After each stimulus, participants were asked, &#x0201c;How vividly could you imagine the scenario described?&#x0201d; Responses were made on a scale from 1 (<italic>not at all vivid</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely vivid</italic>). No individual training stimulus was repeated, so that during the course of the study (12 sessions at home plus the practice session), participants were presented with 416 unique auditory stimuli and 416 unique picture-word stimuli. Participants were scheduled to complete a session of the CBM every day during the 1st week, starting with an auditory session and then alternating between this and the picture-word paradigm, and then 2 sessions in each of the following 3 weeks (1 session of each paradigm). The scheduled order of sessions was the same for all participants. Participants were able to exit a session and resume it at a later time if necessary. If a participant missed completing a session on the scheduled date, the session remained available to complete on a later date.</p><p>The intervention in the control condition was identical in all but the following aspects. First, we aimed to remove the training contingency between ambiguity and positive resolution (following <xref rid="bibr54-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2012</xref>). To this end, half of the auditory training scenarios resolved positively and half resolved negatively. Similarly, half of the pictures had positive captions and half had negative captions. Second, we aimed to remove the mental imagery component of the training. To this end, in the auditory paradigm, participants were asked to &#x0201c;focus on the words and meanings&#x0201d; of the training scenarios and after each scenario were asked, &#x0201c;How difficult was it to understand the meaning of the description?&#x0201d; In the picture-word paradigm, participants were instructed to generate a sentence combining the picture and word, and after each picture-word combination they were asked, &#x0201c;How difficult was it to make a sentence combining the picture with the words?&#x0201d; For both paradigms, responses were made on a scale from 1 (<italic>not at all difficult</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely difficult</italic>).</p><p>The computer system for delivering the interventions via the Internet was built using model-driven tools developed at the University of Oxford&#x02019;s Department of Computer Science (<xref rid="bibr21-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Davies, Gibbons, Welch, &#x00026; Crichton, 2014</xref>). Participants accessed the intervention from the study Web site using their Web browser, and the HTML interfaces were implemented using Java Server Pages and JavaScript technology.

There was a high completion rate for the Internet-delivered CBM, and participant feedback was positive. In our planned analyses, we did not find the expected superiority of the imagery CBM over the control condition in reducing symptoms of depression (our primary outcome measure), reducing negative interpretive bias, or increasing vividness of positive future imagery. Participants in both conditions showed equal improvements on all these measures.</p><p>However, exploratory post hoc analyses revealed that participants in the imagery CBM condition experienced a greater improvement in anhedonia (a subgroup of depressive symptoms related to the loss of interest in or enjoyment from activities) over the intervention compared with those in the control condition. Furthermore, within the subgroup of participants with fewer than five episodes of depression, there was a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of depression as a whole in the imagery CBM condition compared with the control condition. Finally, we found that the more vividly participants in the imagery CBM condition reported imagining the training scenarios during the intervention, the more their symptoms of depression reduced. Participants in the imagery CBM condition who engaged to a threshold level of imagery vividness experienced a greater reduction in symptoms of depression as a whole than did participants in the control condition. Vividness ratings in just the initial practice session also predicted subsequent reduction in symptoms of depression. These results from the trial highlight potentially fruitful pathways for further development of imagery CBM as a low-intensity treatment tool in the context of depression.</p><p>In reflecting on the results of the current study, it is worth noting some points of RCT methodology, as the majority of CBM research has taken place within the context of experimental studies. The close adherence to a clinical trials framework is a strength of the current study (<xref rid="bibr50-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Kiluk et al., 2011</xref>). We had a sufficiently large sample, with good adherence rates and data coverage, to provide robust estimates of effect sizes and also a relatively &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; sample, for example, with many previous depressive episodes and concurrent comorbidities. We carried out face-to-face diagnostic assessments with all participants and, thus, have a well-characterized sample, which is often not possible with Internet RCTs (<xref rid="bibr5-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Andersson &#x00026; Titov, 2014</xref>). However, it is also worth noting that in using relatively broad inclusion criteria, rather than the more restrictive criteria often used in efficacy RCTs (e.g., <xref rid="bibr86-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">von Wolff et al., 2014</xref>), we obtained a comparatively heterogeneous sample, which may have increased the variance and decreased the signal-to-noise ratio in comparison with standard efficacy RCTs. For example, we did not exclude participants from analysis on the basis of depression severity or suicidality.</p><p>Prior to the present trial, our experimental studies in nonclinical samples had demonstrated increased positive affect as an outcome of imagery CBM, compared with a control condition (<xref rid="bibr37-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Coughtrey, &#x00026; Connor, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &#x00026; Shah, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Nelis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr64-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Pictet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Rohrbacher, Blackwell, Holmes, &#x00026; Reinecke, 2014</xref>). Consistent with these prior results, exploratory post hoc analyses of the present results revealed a significantly greater reduction in anhedonia over the 4-week intervention in the imagery CBM condition compared with the control condition. Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression that is relatively resistant to current first-line therapies but is predictive of poorer treatment outcomes (<xref rid="bibr83-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Treadway &#x00026; Zald, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr84-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Uher et al., 2012</xref>) and is recognized as an important but neglected clinical target in its own right (e.g., <xref rid="bibr44-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Insel, 2012</xref>). Although, in the current study, we did not find the expected between-groups difference for reduction in symptoms of depression as a whole, the indication that imagery CBM may contribute to reducing anhedonia is worth pursuing, as neither current psychological nor current pharmacological treatments are adequate in this regard.</p><p>Our exploratory post hoc finding that the imagery CBM was more effective than the control condition in reducing symptoms of depression among participants with fewer than five episodes of depression (albeit not in the full sample) suggests that the positive imagery aspect of the intervention may be more useful for individuals whose depression is less recurrent. This contrasts with psychological treatment studies that target relapse prevention, which have tended to find greater usefulness for people with more (rather than fewer) episodes of depression (e.g., <xref rid="bibr10-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Bockting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr81-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale et al., 2000</xref>). However, this subgroup analysis in our RCT was not specified prior to the trial, and clearly this finding needs replication. A future trial could include number of depressive episodes as a stratification variable with a planned subgroup analysis (<xref rid="bibr80-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Were a precise number of depressive episodes to be of interest, a structured assessment, such as a timeline (e.g., <xref rid="bibr17-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Crane et al., 2014</xref>), may be useful.</p><p>The more vividly participants reported imagining the positive training scenarios during the imagery CBM, the more their symptoms of depression were reduced. Vividly imagining the training scenarios is thought to be an active ingredient in the effects of the imagery CBM. Several previous studies (<xref rid="bibr37-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Coughtrey, &#x00026; Connor, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &#x00026; Shah, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Nelis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr82-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Torkan et al., 2014</xref>) have shown that only when participants were instructed specifically to imagine the positive training scenarios (e.g., as opposed to processing the information verbally) did they show positive changes in mood and cognitive bias. Our current vividness findings suggest that in the measurement of adherence to computerized interventions (cf. <xref rid="bibr50-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Kiluk et al., 2011</xref>), it is important to include measures of &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; adherence (i.e., engaging with the intervention; here, vividness of imagery) rather than simply &#x0201c;passive&#x0201d; adherence (e.g., going through the motions of completing sessions; cf. <xref rid="bibr7-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Bendelin et al., 2011</xref>, in relation to iCBT).</p><p>Vividness ratings made for just the first eight training scenarios in the initial practice session of the imagery CBM were predictive of reduction in symptoms of depression. This makes it unlikely that enhanced vividness was a secondary consequence of symptom improvement rather than being an active agent. If so, it seems important in future research to identify people who may need further training in imagery prior to starting the intervention (cf. <xref rid="bibr54-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr78-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Steel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The critical question remaining is that of why the main primary outcome analyses of BDI-II scores failed to reveal any differences between groups. It may be that neither the imagery CBM condition nor the control condition had any beneficial effects on depression overall or, alternatively, that both conditions were equally effective. In the absence of a no-intervention (e.g., wait list) control, we have no direct evidence that the change in symptoms of depression was any greater than in the absence of any intervention. In recent meta-analyses, <xref rid="bibr18-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Cuijpers et al. (2012)</xref> reported a pre- to posttreatment effect size (<italic>g</italic>) of 0.39, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.74], in waiting-list/care-as-usual groups, and <xref rid="bibr72-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Rutherford, Mori, Sneed, Pimontel, and Roose (2012)</xref> reported an effect size (<italic>d</italic>) of 0.51 [0.27, 0.74] over wait lists with a mean duration of 10 weeks. Lack of overlap between these CIs and those for the within-groups effect sizes in our imagery condition (and limited overlap for the control condition) during a similar time period (1-month follow-up: <italic>d</italic><sub>imagery</sub> = 1.16, [0.85, 1.48], <italic>d</italic><sub>control</sub> = 0.90, [0.61, 1.20]; 3-month follow-up: <italic>d</italic><sub>imagery</sub> = 1.15, [0.81, 1.49], <italic>d</italic><sub>control</sub> = 0.92, [0.60, 1.24]) suggests that greater change occurred in the current trial than would be expected during the same time with no intervention. The within-groups effect sizes in the current RCT are in the same range as those reported for change in symptoms of depression from pre- to posttreatment in trials of Internet-delivered psychological therapies for depression, with Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>s of 1.35, 0.95, and 0.78 for therapist-supported, administrative-supported, and unsupported therapies, respectively (<xref rid="bibr68-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Richards &#x00026; Richardson, 2012</xref>). However, any inferences from these indirect comparisons can be regarded only as hypotheses for testing in future studies.</p><p>Even if it is granted that both groups showed some improvement, it remains unclear why there were no differences in BDI-II change between the imagery CBM condition and the control condition. Our previous experimental studies all found differences between groups assigned to similar interventions and control conditions (<xref rid="bibr37-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Coughtrey, &#x00026; Connor, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &#x00026; Shah, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Nelis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Rohrbacher et al., 2014</xref>), including those with clinical samples (<xref rid="bibr54-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr82-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Torkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr88-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). However, these previous studies also showed a differential effect of imagery CBM versus the control condition on cognitive targets (e.g., measures of bias), which we assume is the mechanism driving mood change. In the current trial, we did not find differential change in cognitive targets between conditions; thus, differential effects on symptom outcomes may not be expected (<xref rid="bibr16-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, Notebaert, &#x00026; MacLeod, 2014</xref>). Symptom change was related to the extent of change in cognitive targets, although measurement of these at only pre- and posttreatment limits attributions of causality (<xref rid="bibr53-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer, Wilson, Fairburn, &#x00026; Agras, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr60-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Mogoa&#x0015f;e, David, &#x00026; Koster, 2014</xref>). Comparison of the within-groups effect sizes for BDI-II change in the current RCT with those from studies investigating a 1-week imagery CBM intervention (<xref rid="bibr8-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &#x00026; Holmes, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr54-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr82-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Torkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr88-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that we obtained both less improvement than expected in the imagery condition and more improvement than expected in the control condition. There are a number of differences between the previous studies and the current RCT that may account for this unexpected finding.</p><p>The current study was conducted within a clinical-trials framework, including prospective registration, independent randomization and robust allocation concealment, intention-to-treat principles for our main analyses, and blinding of outcome assessors (<xref rid="bibr61-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Moher et al., 2010</xref>). This was not the case for previous studies in which, for example, the outcome assessors were not blind to participant allocation, thereby potentially allowing for more demand effects. Furthermore, a clinical trial may attract different participants, with different expectancies and experiences, which can have an impact on outcomes and the ability to detect between-groups effects (cf. <xref rid="bibr73-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Rutherford &#x00026; Roose, 2013</xref>). From this perspective, it is possible that we were overoptimistic in our expectation of a medium between-groups effect size and that anticipation of a small between-groups effect size (as we found in the current per-protocol analysis for the BDI-II) would have been more realistic. Given the low-intensity nature of the intervention (the median session duration was just less than 20 min, which means that for most people, the 12-session intervention came to less than 4 hr in total), a small between-groups effect size may in fact still reflect a cost-effective intervention technique and, thus, be worth pursuing. However, the sample size required to have adequate power to detect such an effect (<italic>N</italic> = 788 for 80% power at 5% significance level) was beyond the scope of this initial trial.</p><p>The current study also differed from previous research in the duration, schedule, and location of the active intervention. It may be that the more an intervention moves from the confines of tightly controlled laboratory sessions, the more the individual variation in adherence to the intended manipulation and, thus, the smaller any between-groups effects will become. Furthermore, it is possible that most of the within-session learning happens in the early sessions and, thus, an increase in the number of sessions and the length of the schedule (as in the current trial) leads to diminishing returns (cf. <xref rid="bibr25-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Eberl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr76-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Stafford &#x00026; Dewar, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, our control condition may have benefitted by the extension of the training schedule. This condition may have contained some of the active components of the intervention, for example, the exposure to ambiguous information (which theoretically may activate the potential competing meanings; cf. <xref rid="bibr15-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, Nanthakumar, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Mathews, 2012</xref>) and the experience of this ambiguity being resolved, both positively and negatively, which may enhance cognitive flexibility (anticipation that either outcome is possible). From the experimental single-session literature, one might expect a control condition with no imagery instructions and no valence-specific training contingency to exert little impact on cognitive bias during a single session and, thus, be considered &#x0201c;inert.&#x0201d; However, factors having no impact within single-session studies, such as reflective processes that take more time to consolidate and exert effects, may gain in importance during longer periods. Clinical translation of CBM could benefit from moving beyond regarding CBM interventions as simply repeated instances of single sessions and considering more broadly the mechanisms by which differential engagement in the intervention could influence clinical outcomes (cf. <xref rid="bibr8-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &#x00026; Holmes, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr77-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Standage, Harris, &#x00026; Fox, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A major limitation of the current study is the lack of a no-intervention (e.g., wait list) control; thus, we do not have direct evidence that the change observed in our participants was more than would have been observed in the absence of any intervention. However, a broader perspective of the psychological treatment field suggests that simply finding another psychological treatment with superior efficacy to a wait list may not be the optimal solution. Numerous treatments that are better than a wait list (<xref rid="bibr19-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Cuijpers, van Straten, Bohlmeijer, Hollon, &#x00026; Andersson, 2010</xref>) already exist, and it has been argued that psychological treatment development could benefit from moving away from a reliance on wait list controls and instead carrying out more rigorous tests against appropriately matched control conditions (<xref rid="bibr11-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Boot, Simons, Stothart, &#x00026; Stutts, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Furukawa et al., 2014</xref>), as in CBM studies (<xref rid="bibr16-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, Notebaert, &#x00026; MacLeod, 2014</xref>). However, CBM researchers may benefit from consideration of whether a control condition used in an experimental study to isolate one specific mechanism is always the most useful control condition for a trial aimed at establishing clinical efficacy. The development of control conditions that are similar to the placebos used in pharmacological trials, as in superficially resembling the intervention but containing none of its active ingredients (as may have occurred here), may be a useful way forward.</p><p>Our choice of primary outcome&#x02014;depressive symptoms as measured by the BDI-II&#x02014;was broad. An intervention may target a specific process very effectively, but if success is evaluated primarily via a broader measure of disorder, this could lead to underestimation of its effectiveness (<xref rid="bibr66-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Reardon, 2014</xref>). In the case of positive imagery CBM, the underlying cognitive model (i.e., repeated simulation of positive outcomes; <xref rid="bibr38-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &#x00026; Deeprose, 2009</xref>) and current findings suggest that in future studies, a measure of anhedonia may be worth exploring as a more specific primary outcome measure (rather than depressive symptoms as a whole). It would be useful to include separate measures of anhedonia in addition to that provided by BDI-II (<xref rid="bibr20-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our findings are in one sense negative: They did not support the proposal that positive imagery CBM is an effective treatment for depression. However, there is also some suggestion from exploratory analyses that imagery CBM may have potential as a technique to improve anhedonia or to help individuals with less recurrent depression or those who engage to a threshold level of imagery. We consider each of these possibilities in the following paragraphs. It is worth noting that the field of CBM is young and currently in the early stages of clinical translation (<xref rid="bibr16-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, Notebaert, &#x00026; MacLeod, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Fox, Mackintosh, &#x00026; Holmes, 2014</xref>). An unexpected result, as in the current RCT, can be informative in a variety of ways, as we have discussed. For example, there may be wider implications for the field concerning the choice of control condition or of outcome measurement in moving from the lab to the clinic.</p><p>In future work, researchers should seek to explore and extend implications of the current RCT. Various methodological options are worthy of consideration. A brief &#x0201c;run-in&#x0201d; phase for adherence to the treatment requirements (i.e., to engage to a threshold level of imagery) might be used prior to randomization&#x02014;a strategy beginning to be used in some pharmacological RCTs (<xref rid="bibr31-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Geddes et al., 2010</xref>). The training itself could also be refined. Specifically, we suggest the need for evaluation of improved versions of imagery CBM suitable for real-world (rather than lab) training environments. For example, participants may be guided to achieve higher standards of vivid positive self-referent imagery prior to entry into the main phase of the intervention and maintain this during the course of the intervention via feedback processes.</p><p>Such improved imagery CBM versions would need to be evaluated in comparison with different types of control conditions that are more convincingly inert in the longer term (e.g., by avoiding any emotional material, or without resolving ambiguity either positively or negatively). Nonetheless, the apparent improvement seen in the present control condition raises interesting questions about idiosyncratic ways in which participants may engage with training delivered via the Internet. The common practice of using equal frequencies of negative and positive resolutions of ambiguity as a control condition in CBM may require reconsideration when used in more prolonged interventions, and the potential benefit of inducing a more flexible emotional response style needs to be further evaluated.</p><p>The results of the current RCT suggest that the efficacy of imagery CBM within a sample of depressed individuals with few prior episodes of depression should be investigated. In fact, within the general population, a slight majority of patients with major depression may fall below the split point in the current study of five episodes, given that the median number of lifetime depressive episodes is four (<xref rid="bibr47-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Judd, 1997</xref>). In a heterogeneous disorder such as depression, identifying particular subgroups of patients for whom an intervention may be particularly helpful, or patient stratification, is an important part of treatment development (<xref rid="bibr48-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin &#x00026; Blase, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The potential for imagery CBM to improve anhedonia, as indicated in the current RCT, should be followed up, given that this core symptom of depression poses a major challenge to current treatments (<xref rid="bibr44-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Insel, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr83-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Treadway &#x00026; Zald, 2011</xref>). A useful first step may be to better characterize the effects of imagery CBM by using richer measures of anhedonia that relate to its various facets (e.g., anticipation vs. experience of pleasure; <xref rid="bibr23-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Dunn, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Pizzagalli, 2014</xref>). If it is indeed the case that imagery CBM can improve anhedonia, then it may have particular value as an adjunct to current treatment approaches (psychological or pharmacological) that improve other symptoms of depression while leaving anhedonia relatively untouched. An experimental psychopathology approach could be used to investigate whether imagery CBM and treatment approaches such as iCBT or antidepressants do in fact work via complementary mechanisms, given that treatments often do not combine in an additive manner (<xref rid="bibr12-2167702614560746" ref-type="bibr">Browning et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, a consideration of outcome measures, alongside refined methodology as discussed earlier, would allow researchers to assess whether the preliminary indications of benefit seen here can be replicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Holmes_Blackwell_et_al_Supp_Tables.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e2104" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the Lupina Foundation for their support of this research.

Research and development approval was obtained from Oxfordshire Primary Care Trust and Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust to act as participant identification centers. All recruitment and face-to-face assessment procedures took place at the main research site, the Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford. In April 2013, the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, was added as a subsidiary site for remote collection of remaining follow-up data and for conducting data analyses. The relevant management approvals were obtained for both sites.</p></sec><sec id="section27-2167702614560746"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization took place at the baseline assessment after completion of all baseline questionnaire measures. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups, imagery cognitive bias modification or control, within the constraints of stratification by gender and baseline Beck Depression Inventory&#x02013;II score (mild-to-moderate score of 28 or less vs. severe score of 29 or more). The researcher who carried out the baseline assessment assigned participants to their allocated intervention via a Web-based randomization system written by the clinical trials software development team in the Oxford Cognitive Health and Neurosciences Clinical Trials Unit and hosted by the University of Oxford Medical Sciences Information Management Unit. Randomization was carried out using a secret allocation table, generated by the University of Oxford Centre for Statistics in Medicine, with a variable-length block structure to ensure that allocations were balanced and could not be predicted by trial staff.</p></sec><sec id="section28-2167702614560746"><title>Blinding</title><p>Blinding of participants to allocation was achieved by having only those aspects of the study interventions that were common to both conditions (e.g., schedule of sessions and general nature of tasks, such as listening to scenarios, responding to pictures) in the study information. Participants were debriefed about the nature of the two different study conditions at the end of the trial (once they had completed the 6-month outcome measures) and, thus, did not know the specifics of the other condition until they had finished the trial. In the face-to-face posttreatment assessment, a researcher blind to participant allocation was assigned to administer the outcome questionnaires, and blinding was achieved for at least the primary outcome with one exception (due to an administrative oversight). Thus, the trial can be considered &#x0201c;double blind.&#x0201d;</p><p>The trial database was maintained as blind until all data collection, checking, and cleaning for the main efficacy analyses had taken place; after this, participant condition was downloaded from the randomization service and inserted into the database.
