FSS worsening occurred most frequently in the pyramidal domain, in both subgroups of patients with 24-week CDP (see Supplementary Figure 2 online).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec10-2055217316676644"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the ADVANCE study, continuous treatment with peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;mcg every 2 weeks over 2 years reduced the proportion of relapses associated with residual disability by more than half, compared with delayed treatment (placebo in the first year of the study), indicating a positive treatment effect of peginterferon beta-1a on relapse recovery. The effect on residual disability was in fact greater than the effect of peginterferon beta-1a on overall relapse rate in the ADVANCE study, i.e. 37% reduction in ARR over 2 years with peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks compared with delayed treatment,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and in the overall study population (regardless of relapse status) there was&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;70% reduction in relapses with incomplete recovery (see Supplementary Figure 3 online). It does not appear to be the case that peginterferon beta-1a simply reduced relapse severity, and thereby lessened the likelihood of residual deficits, since similar proportions of patients in each treatment group had relapses with&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1-point increase in EDSS score. Despite this apparent lack of treatment effect on relapse severity clinically, treatment might be associated with improved recovery due to some effect on the initial forming lesion(s). More plausibly, later events involving recovery could be effected. Alternatively, if treatment creates a modification in the overall process of cumulative residual disability, the apparent effects of each superimposed attack may be modified.</p><p>Among patients with 24-week CDP, overall reduction in risk of 24-week CDP in the peginterferon beta-1a every-2-weeks group was largely driven by reduction in CDP resulting from relapses with incomplete recovery. This may be attributable, in part, to a reduction in total number of relapses in the peginterferon beta-1a group; however, our analysis indicates that improved recovery when relapse does occur was also a factor. Indeed, we found that relapses were not a surrogate marker for CDP in the ADVANCE study, whereas relapses with incomplete recovery were, according to the Prentice criteria. Given the apparent little difference between treatment groups in rates of CDP independent of relapse, we suggest that relapse recovery accounts for this differential treatment effect.. Much of the CDP seen in this trial did occur free from relapse, as reported in a few other trials looking at phenotypes of worsening patients,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> suggesting a role for understanding clinical phenotypes in drug development.</p><p>A sensitivity analysis showed that rates of association between relapse and CDP were very similar when the window for determining that association was extended from 90 to 180 days. This confirms that our analysis was not likely to have underestimated the contribution of relapses to CDP. In fact, the vast majority (57/59 (97%)) of cases of incomplete relapse recovery had onset of 24-week CDP within 14 days. Therefore, it appears that our results reflect residual disability related to relapse (and conversely, relapse recovery when relapse is not followed by CDP) rather than simply fluctuation in EDSS scores over time. Furthermore, the majority of patients with CDP had simultaneous worsening in one or more FSS during the confirmation period for 24-week CDP. This helps support our assumption that recorded changes in CDP were due to the protocol-defined relapses, rather than impairment fluctuating across multiple domains. The functional system most commonly affected was the pyramidal system. Prior studies of FSS have shown that motor system involvement (pyramidal and cerebellar scores) are likely paramount in worsening patients in the mid-range of EDSS scores,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> so recovery in these domains could be an important factor in determining whether relapse leads to CDP. However, there may be inherent difficulties in using the EDSS for measuring motor system problems due to relapse without recovery, given the sensitivity of this scale.</p><p>The ADVANCE population appears to be representative of MS trial populations, in terms of relapse recovery independent of treatment effect, as residual disability in the placebo group was highly consistent with that in two recent trials of dimethyl fumarate, DEFINE and CONFIRM;<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> approximately 20% of patients in the placebo groups in each of these trials had onset of 12-week CDP within 180 days following relapse (see Supplementary Table 1). This is also similar to a previous analysis of pooled data from placebo groups from several trials, in which 28% of patients were found to have a residual deficit of&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 EDSS point an average of 64 days after exacerbation.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Our findings can be viewed in the context of different MS phenotypes described by recently proposed terminology defining active disease as relapse, progression of disability, or new MRI activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Worsening disease is defined as documented increase in relapse frequency or disability. Some but not all relapses result in worsening (incomplete recovery).<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Assessment of relapse recovery was highlighted in this consensus report as an area for future research.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>This analysis highlights the relevance of relapse recovery as a useful additional measure of treatment effect. Relapses with incomplete versus complete recovery may be a more appropriate endpoint than relapse rate for MS clinical trials, in recognition that quality may be more relevant than quantity of relapses in predicting clinical outcomes,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> as overall relapse frequency after the first few years of MS may be a poor predictor of long-term outcome.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A previous analysis of patient-reported outcomes in ADVANCE showed that CDP due to incomplete relapse recovery was an important factor in driving the negative impact of MS on health-related quality of life, having a greater impact than CDP independent of relapse, or relapses that did not lead to CDP,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> further highlighting the value of improving relapse recovery.</p><p>Early analyses suggest that effects on relapse recovery may help to differentiate treatment options. In our current analysis of ADVANCE data, peginterferon beta-1a demonstrated potential to improve relapse recovery, whereas analysis of MSCRG study data, using the same method to test Prentice criteria, indicated that intramuscular interferon beta-1a had no effect on CDP beyond that explained by reduction in relapse rate.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> An effect on outcome after relapse has been demonstrated for some other treatments; however, mechanisms may differ as none have demonstrated recovery in the way that peginterferon beta-1a improved recovery in this study. In the AFFIRM study, a significantly lower proportion of patients on natalizumab had residual EDSS worsening following relapse, compared with placebo. This coincided with a significant reduction in relapse severity with natalizumab compared with placebo,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> suggesting that the effect on relapse recovery was driven by a &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; effect against severe relapses, whereas in ADVANCE peginterferon beta-1a improved relapse recovery rates despite similar relapse severity across groups. In a post-hoc analysis of the TEMSO study, teriflunomide reduced the rate of relapses with sequelae, but this did not appear to be attributable to improved relapse recovery since the risk of sequelae per relapse was found not to be modified by treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, caution should be exercised in attempting to compare treatment effects on relapse recovery, since the assessments described above are based on post-hoc analyses and all used different definitions for recovery/residual effects. Further study of treatment effects on relapse recovery, ideally recorded as a pre-specified endpoint and assessed using standardized definitions, could provide valuable information to help guide treatment decisions. Longer-term data may also permit more thorough analysis of the relationship between relapse recovery and long-term disability, as this has only been the subject of a few long-term studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-2055217316676644" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, the effect of peginterferon beta-1a on risk of CDP may be attributable to improvement in recovery from relapses, as well as an overall reduction in risk of relapses, thus limiting further disability progression. Although our positive findings are modest, and the underlying reasons for this association remain unclear, models for studying this effect are new and we believe will be valuable going forward, particularly in drug development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The ADVANCE study was funded by Biogen (Cambridge, MA, USA).
