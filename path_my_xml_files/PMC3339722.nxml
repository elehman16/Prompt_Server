The search for the ideal adjuvant and a local anesthetic with wide margin of safety, minimal motor blockade, and prolonged period of analgesia continues till date.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Ropivacaine produces a greater differential blockade with less toxic effects,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] but moderate concentrations of ropivacaine (0.25&#x02013;0.375%) cause unwanted motor blockade in the initial postoperative period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] We undertook the study to assess the efficacy of ropivacaine 0.1% with the addition of clonidine (1 mcg/kg) to that of ropivacaine 0.1% and 0.2% in providing analgesia following single-shot caudal epidural block in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. The sample size was based on the previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The calculation revealed that 15 subjects per group were needed to detect a difference in the duration of analgesia as small as 1.5 times the standard deviation with the power of 0.8 and significance level of 0.05. The sample size was increased by 30% (20 per group) to account for the skew deviations of the variables in the study.</p><p>After approval of the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent from parents, children in the age group of 1&#x02013;6 years under ASA status I and II, scheduled for subumbilical surgeries were enrolled in the study. Children with bleeding disorders, neuromuscular diseases, bony abnormalities of the spine, and infection at the site of caudal analgesia were excluded from the study. Sixty children were randomly allocated in to three groups: group A, group B, and group C based on picking lots from a sealed bag. All children received 0.5 mg/kg of midazolam orally as premedication 30 min prior to induction of anesthesia. The intraoperative monitors included electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, and end tidal carbon dioxide. Inhalational induction was done with 8% sevoflurane in oxygen and intravenous access was secured. Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg was administered intravenously for analgesia. Anesthesia was maintained with 1&#x02013;2% sevoflurane in oxygen&#x02013;nitrous oxide (1:3) mixture. The airway was maintained using a face mask, laryngeal mask airway, or endotracheal tube. Maintenance of the airway was left to the decision of the anesthesiologist. No additional fentanyl was given.</p><p>After induction of anesthesia, the children were placed in the lateral decubitus position. The caudal space was identified and the appropriate drug was injected, as per the group, using a 22G needle. The preparation of drug was done by one anesthesiologist and the caudal block was performed by another. The latter also monitored the intraoperative variables and scores. Group A received 1 ml/kg of 0.1% ropivacaine, group B received 1 ml/kg of 0.1% ropivacaine with clonidine 1 mcg/ kg, and group C received 1 ml/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine. The surgical incision was made 5 min after caudal placement of the drug and the duration of surgery was noted. The intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were monitored and documented every 5 min till awakening. The duration of anesthesia was noted in all the three groups. The pain score and motor block were noted at extubation. The degree of motor blockade was assessed by Bromage scale every 10 min and the time taken for complete recovery of motor blockade was recorded. The heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pain score, and sedation score were assessed in the postoperative period for 2 h. Pain score was assessed using face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] and was noted at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. The follow-up in PACU and ward for FLACC scale was noted separately by the anesthesiologist in the PACU and a nurse in the ward who were blinded.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>FLACC Score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-185-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The time from caudal placement of drug to the first recording of a FLACC scale &#x0003e; 3 was taken as the duration of analgesia. Rescue analgesia was provided with paracetamol suppository 40 mg/kg whenever the pain score was recorded as &#x0003e;3. The number of rescue analgesic doses required for 24 h were also noted. Respiratory depression was defined as a decrease of SpO<sub>2</sub> to &#x0003c;93%. Hypotension was defined as mean arterial blood pressure 30% less than the baseline value and was treated with a bolus of 10 ml/kg crystalloid. Bradycardia was defined as heart rate less than 15% from the base line value. The sedation score was graded as 0 for awake, 1 for mild (arousable by voice), 2 for moderate (arousable to pain), and 3 for unarousable. The sedation score was assessed every 15 min and documented for 2 h in the PACU. The data collected were tabulated and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests by a statistician.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The age, weight, and the duration of surgery in the study groups were compared using the independent t-test. The type of surgery was compared between the three groups using the Pearson's chi-square test. The study groups were comparable with respect to age, weight, and duration of surgery [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The type of surgery was similar in all the three groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The duration of analgesia between the groups was compared using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. The mean duration of analgesia was 243.7 &#x000b1; 99.29 min in group A, 590.25 &#x000b1; 83.93 min in group B, and 388.5 &#x000b1; 82.35 min in group C. The duration of analgesia was significantly prolonged in group B compared to groups A and C with the P value of 0.001 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The motor scores at extubation were compared using the Pearson's chi-square test. The motor blockade at extubation was observed in all the children of group C with a duration of 30.6 &#x000b1; 7.8 min [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>] and none of the children had motor blockade in group A and group B. The pain score was compared using the Pearson's chi-square test. There was a significant difference in the pain score of children in group B at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h postoperatively when compared to group A and group C. At 8 h, only 3 children in group B had pain score more than 3 compared to 18 children in group C and all 20 children in group A [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. The requirement of rescue medications was compared between the three groups using Pearson's chi-square test and it was found to be significant with group B receiving less number of analgesics, followed by group C and group A. One child in group B received two rescue medications compared to group A, in which 15 (75%) children received two rescue medications, followed by group C where 8 (40%) children received two rescue medications [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Demographic data and duration of surgery in the three groups expressed as mean with standard deviation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-185-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Type of surgeries in the three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-185-g003"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The mean duration of analgesia in the three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-185-g004"/></fig><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Motor blockade in different groups expressed as number of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-185-g005"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Pain score more than 3 at different time intervals prior to rescue medication</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-185-g006"/></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The number of rescue medications received by children in different groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-185-g007"/></fig><p>The mean heart rate and blood pressure at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min in the intraoperative period between groups were compared using the ANOVA test.

A volume of 1 ml/kg was chosen in all the three groups as only subumbilical surgeries were included, requiring T10 and below levels for analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The dose of clonidine was based on the studies in the pediatric population though no ideal dose of clonidine via the caudal epidural route is yet recommended.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The different doses of ropivacaine along with clonidine 1&#x02013;2 mcg/kg have been studied in children for single-shot caudal epidural to enhance the quality of analgesia in the postoperative period. Ivani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] reported an increased duration along with improved quality of analgesia with the addition of clonidine (2 mcg/kg) to ropivacaine 0.1% compared to plain 0.2% ropivacaine alone. Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] found that the mean duration of analgesia was 8.5 h with 0.25% plain ropivacaine and 13.4 h with 0.25% ropivacaine and clonidine 2 mcg/kg. In our study, the mean duration of analgesia was 590 min in the clonidine&#x02013;ropivacaine group, which was significantly prolonged compared to plain 0.1% and 0.2% ropivacaine.The requirement of rescue medication was less in the clonidine&#x02013;ropivacaine group. Luz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] compared ropivacaine 0.1% and 0.15% with bupivacaine 0.2% and concluded that ropivacaine was less effective in providing postoperative analgesia. Bosenberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] compared the efficacy of caudal ropivacaine 1, 2, and 3 mg/ml and found the pain score at 4 h higher in 0.1% compared to 0.2 % and 0.3% ropivacaine. We found similar results in our study.</p><p>Khalil <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] compared varying doses of ropivacaine in caudal anesthesia and found motor blockade with 0.2% ropivacaine in the early postoperative period. We also observed postoperative motor blockade in children who received 0.2% ropivacaine. The persistence of motor blockade in the postoperative period is undesirable in children. Though the blockade was observed only for a short duration, the advantage of using ropivacaine with better sensory and motor discrimination was lost with use of 0.2% ropivacaine and the duration of analgesia was also less compared to the ropivacaine&#x02013;clonidine group.</p><p>Epidural administration of clonidine can cause bradycardia due to parasympathetic predominance and hypotension as a result of inhibition of preganglionic sympathetic fibres. Eisenach <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] reported decrease in mean arterial pressure and heart rate within 15&#x02013;30 min after injection of clonidine in the epidural space. In our study, the mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the clonidine group were less compared to plain ropivacaine. However, none of the children required intervention as the hemodynamic parameters were not below the defined criteria.</p><p>Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] noted significant sedation when 2 mcg/kg clonidine was added to caudal bupivacaine and concluded that the sedative effects in children reflected the improved quality of analgesia offered by clonidine. Various other studies have however shown the absence of significant sedation with use of clonidine at 2 mcg/kg in the caudal space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In our study the children had only mild sedation which was not significant statistically.</p><p>To conclude, the addition of clonidine 1mcg/kg to 0.1% ropivacaine provided increased duration and better quality of pain relief with no motor blocakade and sedation compared to plain 0.1% ropivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
