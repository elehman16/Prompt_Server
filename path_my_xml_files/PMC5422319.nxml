Two definitions of CID were used; each was a composite of three outcome measures typically associated with COPD. Definition 1 (D1) comprised a &#x02265;100 mL decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), a &#x02265;4-unit increase in St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire, and a moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation. In Definition 2 (D2), a &#x02265;1-unit decrease in transition dyspnea index replaced FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using D1, IND/GLY significantly reduced the risk of first or sustained CID versus either TIO (hazard ratio 0.72 [0.61, 0.86], <italic>P</italic>=0.0003 and 0.73 [0.61, 0.89], <italic>P</italic>=0.001) or SFC (0.67 [0.57, 0.80] and 0.63 [0.52, 0.77], both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

Exacerbations, exertional dyspnea, worsening of symptoms, and deterioration of health status each contribute to disease severity.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>The endpoints routinely used in COPD clinical trials tend to evaluate the effects of treatments on improving spirometric and/or clinical parameters. Many patients, however, do not improve, developing instead acute and/or sustained deterioration of their disease. Indeed, deterioration in lung function, health status, and exacerbation frequency are all predictors of COPD worsening and/or mortality.<xref rid="b2-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These, too, are therefore important outcome measures as they reflect the impact of treatments on preventing disease progression, which in itself is a major goal in COPD management.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Since COPD is a multidimensional disease, composite endpoints that evaluate the effect of treatments not only on lung function but on COPD symptoms and exacerbations, as well as on general health status and quality of life, may be more sensitive to the effects of therapeutic interventions than individual measures, enabling a more comprehensive view of the overall disease. A recent publication described the development and use of one such endpoint in COPD patients. Termed clinically important deterioration (CID), it was used to assess, as a composite measure, the rate of deterioration in lung function, exacerbation rate, and health status following treatment with different classes of COPD medication.<xref rid="b7-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Using the CID endpoint, the authors demonstrated that the dual bronchodilator, umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) reduced the risk of first or sustained CIDs versus either placebo or bronchodilator monotherapy.</p><p>Dual bronchodilation with fixed-dose long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>- agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combinations are often used as treatment options in patients with high symptom burden, since they prove more effective than current standard of care therapy with single-agent LAMAs or LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations.<xref rid="b8-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Treatment differences between dual bronchodilators and either a single LABA or LAMA or a LABA/ICS, however, are often smaller than the differences seen versus placebo, so using a composite endpoint may provide a more sensitive means with which to compare active treatments.</p><p>The LABA/LAMA combination indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) has demonstrated significant improvement in lung function, dyspnea, quality of life, and exacerbation rates versus both the LAMA tiotropium (TIO) and the LABA/ICS salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC) in COPD patients.<xref rid="b8-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In this analysis of studies from the IND/GLY (IGNITE) program, we describe the effect of IND/GLY versus both TIO and SFC on the risk of CID in COPD using patient data from three large randomized clinical trials.

A sustained CID using D1 was defined as a &#x02265;100 mL decrease from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> on two consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart or on &#x0003e;50% of all subsequent visits; a &#x02265;4-unit increase in SGRQ total score from baseline on two consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart or on &#x0003e;50% of all subsequent visits; or a moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation occurring after the first dose of study medication.</p><p>In Definition 2 (D2) of a first CID, the FEV<sub>1</sub> lung function component of D1 was replaced with a component measuring breathlessness: the transition dyspnea index (TDI). The definition of a CID for this component was also defined as a reversal of its widely used MCID; hence, a CID was defined as a &#x02265;1-unit deterioration in TDI from baseline, and this was considered a sustained CID if it was present on two consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart, or on &#x0003e;50% of all subsequent visits.

Sustained CIDs were also observed versus both comparators using D1, and versus SFC but not TIO using D2.</p><p>Subgroup analyses largely confirmed our findings. Apart from an apparent gender discrepancy versus TIO, and relatively high data variability in the subgroup of patients with higher baseline eosinophil count, the findings across the subgroups were generally consistent with the overall results, showing benefits in favor of IND/GLY versus either comparator.</p><p>Composite measures in the form of prognostic indexes have long been used in COPD to categorize patients and predict survival. The BODE index, a multidimensional tool incorporating body mass index, degree of airflow obstruction, functional dyspnea, and exercise capacity was first described by Celli et al in 2004.<xref rid="b16-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> They hypothesized that this composite endpoint would be better able to predict COPD-related hospitalization and mortality than its individual components or the customary endpoint of FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements alone.<xref rid="b16-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Since then, several other COPD indices have been described, which predict not only survival but disease-related hospitalization or exacerbations, disease severity, and even positive outcomes in clinical trials.<xref rid="b17-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> What distinguishes the composite endpoint of CID from these indices is that it can be used to compare different active treatments since it measures the relative deterioration in disease following an intervention, and as such could have utility in clinical trials as a means of monitoring disease worsening. As COPD is a usually progressive disease, some patients do not respond to treatment and for these patients treatments that prevent disease worsening and/or maintain stability would clearly be of value. Using an endpoint such as CID, which measures disease worsening rather than the usually analyzed improvement, would facilitate the identification of such treatments. Further validation of CID as an endpoint was shown in a recent post hoc analysis of data from two 3-year studies (TORCH and ECLIPSE), where long-term outcomes in terms of lung function, health status, exacerbation risk, and mortality were significantly worse in patients who had experienced an early CID (ie, within 6&#x02013;12 months of follow-up).<xref rid="b20-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While composite indices have not been frequently used in respiratory trials, they have been standard measurements in many cardiovascular outcome studies where their value has been clearly demonstrated to differentiate between effective therapies.<xref rid="b21-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The data from this analysis, along with that of other analyses and from other therapeutic areas, suggest that a composite index may be more sensitive to detect treatment benefit, than a single measure such as FEV<sub>1</sub>. At the current time, however, most are likely too cumbersome to be routinely used in clinical practice.</p><p>When we examined time to first CID for the individual components of each CID definition, we observed that the strongest driver of CID in each of the analysis populations was lung function, with time to first FEV<sub>1</sub> CID event significantly longer in IND/GLY-treated patients versus TIO- or SFC-treated patients (both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-copd-12-1325">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-copd-12-1325">S2</xref>). This finding was not unexpected given that the treatments under study were bronchodilators whose most prominent effects are those related to lung function. Nevertheless, each of the other individual component measures also appeared to influence the risk of CID, albeit with relatively more variability.</p><p>In our analysis, we included two definitions of CID in order to provide a degree of sensitivity and some validation of CID as an endpoint. D1 has been described and used previously,<xref rid="b7-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> showing that UMEC/VI reduced the risk of CID versus either placebo or bronchodilator monotherapy.<xref rid="b7-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b23-copd-12-1325" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For D2, we replaced FEV<sub>1</sub> with TDI, and did so to have a definition of CID composed solely of &#x0201c;clinical&#x0201d; endpoints rather than lung function. This definition appeared to be less sensitive than D1, and there was greater data variability, as evidenced by the larger CIs. This was not surprising, however, as TDI and SGRQ were measured relatively infrequently during the studies compared with FEV<sub>1</sub>, and this likely contributed to the smaller between-treatment differences observed for these endpoints. The latter probably also accounted for the variability observed in the results of sustained CID as, by definition, sustained CID would require more frequent measurement. Nevertheless, it is unclear why IND/GLY, using D2, significantly improved sustained CID versus SFC in LANTERN/ILLUMINATE but not versus TIO in the SHINE study, particularly since baseline dyspnea was similar in both populations. Prior exacerbations were slightly higher in SHINE than in LANTERN/ILLUMINATE, but were low in both study populations. However, while background ICS use was allowed to be continued in SHINE, it was discontinued in LANTERN/ILLUMINATE. It is possible, therefore, that such differences in background treatments may have affected a composite index designed to assess strictly clinical variables.</p><p>We recognize that there are limitations to our analysis. First, this analysis used data from clinical trials of relatively short duration (26 weeks) that had not been designed to assess treatment deterioration. Second, the exacerbation frequency of patients in our studies may have been relatively low, so our findings may not be applicable to patients at higher risk of exacerbation and the analysis should be repeated in patients at higher risk. We also acknowledge that currently there is no universally accepted definition of CID, and the thresholds we used to define a CID event were based on the inverse of the MCIDs of the component endpoints. Whether these are valid thresholds, in which positive or negative clinical benefit can be measured using the same increment of change, is not known and needs to be investigated in larger prospective trials; indeed, it may be the case that the threshold signifying a CID may vary with disease severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our data support the use of the CID endpoint as a means of monitoring disease stability versus worsening in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Prevention of disease deterioration is of obvious clinical benefit, and a measure that can differentiate between treatments in this regard has application to clinical practice. Using the CID endpoint, we have shown that dual bronchodilation with IND/GLY offers significant benefits over treatment with a single-agent LAMA or a LABA/ICS both in terms of the incidence and time to CID, with some evidence of sustained efficacy. Therefore, these data support the use of dual bronchodilation in the studied patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><sec><title>Component analyses</title><p>In order to verify the main analysis results and to test the validity of using a composite endpoint, the time to first or sustained clinically important deterioration (CID) for each of the separate components of the composite endpoint were examined.</p><p>Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves for time-to-event data were generated for both data sets to illustrate patients&#x02019; times to CIDs or sustained CIDs, and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and <italic>P</italic>-values for treatment comparisons were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Covariates included in the model were treatment group, gender, age group, baseline COPD severity, ex-smoker (yes/no), and eosinophil count at baseline (&#x0003e;300 or &#x02264;300 cells/&#x000b5;L). In addition, the log rank tests were used to compare the curves for treatment comparisons, and the <italic>P</italic>-values are presented alongside Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves.
