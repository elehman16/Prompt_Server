It is one of the commonest endocrine and metabolic conditions in children and adults. It is estimated that approximately 285 million adults (5&#x02013;15% T1D) and 480&#x02005;000 children (95% T1D) worldwide suffer from diabetes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Recent reports suggest that the incidence and prevalence of T1D are increasing in many countries, at least in the under 15-year age group with the predicted number of new cases of childhood diabetes in Europe increasing to 24&#x02005;400 in 2020 from 15&#x02005;000 in 2005.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Despite the rapid advancements in insulin pump technology and the ongoing development of more physiological insulin preparations, achieving optimal glycaemic control while avoiding hypoglycaemia<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> remains a challenge for many people with T1D.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over the last decade, which enables users to view real-time interstitial glucose readings and receive alarms for impending hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia, thus facilitating appropriate changes in insulin therapy, is a major step towards improved diabetes monitoring. Several recent studies have shown a clinical benefit of CGM on reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> and the burden of hypoglycaemia<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> in those using the device at least 6 of 7&#x02005;days. The combination of real-time CGM with insulin pump therapy (sensor augmented insulin pump therapy) with the ability to temporarily suspend insulin delivery at preset glucose levels (threshold based pump suspension) has also shown to reduce the burden of hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The development of a closed-loop system that combines glucose monitoring with computer-based algorithm dictated insulin delivery, may provide further improvements in glycaemic control while reducing hypoglycaemia and represents a realistic treatment option for people with T1Ds.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Closed-loop differs from conventional pump therapy, characterised by preprogrammed basal delivery, through the use of a control algorithm which directs subcutaneous insulin delivery according to sensor glucose levels. The role of the control algorithm is to translate, in real-time, the information it receives from the glucose sensor and to compute the amount of insulin to be delivered by the pump.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of closed-loop under laboratory conditions and shown promising results. These include evaluations using a randomised design by our group in youths,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Insulin and glucagon coadministration have also been evaluated.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref></p><p>In contrast to studies conducted in the clinical research facility with carefully controlled conditions, closed-loop at home is exposed to considerably more varied meal and exercise patterns, and other life-style modifiers. Participants may overestimate or underestimate carbohydrate content and may undertake unplanned activity and/or exercise. People using insulin pump therapy are advised to use temporary reductions or increments of basal insulin delivery to meet these demands but this requires a degree of planning and user intuition and interaction. Since closed-loop systems modulate delivery of insulin in a glucose responsive fashion,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> they may be able to achieve better glucose control than preprogrammed basal rates of conventional pump therapy.</p><p>We have recently completed three short-term home closed-loop studies under free living conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006075TB1">table 1</xref>). Two studies evaluated overnight closed-loop glucose control in adolescents (3&#x02005;weeks) and adults (4&#x02005;weeks) and one study evaluated day and night closed-loop control in adults (1-week). During both overnight studies, closed-loop achieved significantly better glucose control than standard insulin pump therapy combined with real time CGM without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>

Ability to use study devices will be formally assessed using competency assessment and additional training provided as required.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Treatment optimisation period</title><p>There will be a minimum of 4-week optimisation period for all participants. The participant will be invited to attend the research centre at weekly intervals during this period. The data from study insulin pump and CGM device will be downloaded and will be used for treatment optimisation. The visits will be conducted by a professional pump educator possibly accompanied by a member of the study team and will follow a written curriculum. During the optimisation period formal tests will be undertaken to assess the adequacy of basal and bolus setup of participants usual insulin pump therapy. At the end of the optimisation period participant's compliance of using the study CGM and study pump over preceding 14&#x02005;days will be assessed. To proceed with the study participants need to demonstrate correct use of study insulin pump including the use of bolus calculator over 90% of meal boluses and at least 10&#x02005;days&#x02019; worth of CGM data during past 14&#x02005;days of the optimisation period.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Eligible participants will be randomised to the order of the two study interventions using web-based permuted blocks of four randomisation based on computer-generated random code with study centre considered as a factor.

Over 1&#x02005;h participants will be provided with relevant training required for safe and effective use of the study intervention. This will include training on connection and disconnection of the closed-loop system and switching between closed-loop and usual pump therapy. Particular attention will be paid to meal bolus procedure during treatment periods and the use of study devices during exercise. During closed-loop period the meal bolus procedure will include entering the amount of carbohydrates eaten and glucose level via the user interface of the computer algorithm device (smartphone). During sensor augmented pump therapy, participants will enter the information directly into the bolus calculator residing on insulin pump. The method of calculation of the meal bolus is identical between the two treatment periods and will utilise the bolus calculator of the study pump and will include a correction insulin dose for high or low glucose levels. Competency on the use of study devices will be assessed by the study team. Only participants who demonstrate competency on use of study devices will be allowed to continue to the home study phase. During this visit participants will have a blood test for HbA1c and will be asked to complete questionnaires as outlined below.</p><p>Participants will be allowed to go home at mid-afternoon. They will be advised to continue with study treatment at home over the next 3&#x02005;months. Participants will be asked to download the data from the study pump and CGM device at regular intervals and will be allowed to drive while using study devices and adhering to usual precautions and country specific rules and regulations. Participants will be advised to discontinue automated closed-loop insulin delivery and follow their usual insulin pump therapy for periods of exercise in the first 2&#x02005;weeks of closed-loop use. After first 2-week of use by participants who usually undertake exercise, closed-loop system may be applied during moderate exercise if practicable. During the first 2&#x02005;weeks of each study period each participant will be advised against international travel. During the rest of study period travel inside European Economic Area will be allowed while closed-loop system is in use.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Contact during 3&#x02005;months home study period</title><p>Participants will have identical planned contacts with the study team during the two treatment periods.

The CGM receiver is inserted into the translator which translates a serial USB protocol into a Bluetooth communication protocol and powers the CGM receiver when USB communication takes place. The translator uses rechargeable batteries to supply power.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014006075F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Design of Florence D2A automated closed-loop system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006075f02"/></fig><p>Every 12&#x02005;min, the system calculates a new insulin infusion rate which is automatically sent to the study insulin pump. The calculations utilise a compartment model of glucose kinetics<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> describing the effect of rapid-acting insulin analogues and the carbohydrate content of meals on glucose levels.</p><p>The control algorithm will be initialised using preprogrammed basal insulin delivery downloaded from the study pump. Additionally, information about participant's weight and total daily insulin dose will be entered at setup. During closed-loop operation, the algorithm adapts itself to a particular participant. The treat-to-target control algorithm aims to achieve glucose levels between 5.8 and 7.3&#x02005;mmol/L and adjusts the actual level depending on fasting versus postprandial status and the accuracy of model-based glucose predictions.</p><p>The closed-loop system can operate on battery power over 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;days without recharging. The smartphone uploads data on a server using a 3G/GSM communication to ease data transfer and downloads data from study devices during the sensor augmented pump therapy when the closed-loop control is disabled. The software residing on the smartphone comprises a bolus wizard, used during the closed-loop intervention to deliver meal and correction boluses, The bolus wizard comprises identical calculation procedures as bolus wizard residing on the study pump.</p><p>The CGM receiver provides hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia alarms, the insulin pump provides standard alarms, and the smartphone alerts the user about aspects related to closed-loop operation such as when closed loop started, stopped or terminated. The smartphone also visualises sensor glucose, insulin delivery, carbohydrate content and other relevant data.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Safety precautions during closed loop</title><p>Participants will be trained to perform a calibration check before breakfast and evening meal.
