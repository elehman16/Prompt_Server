Its novel design<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> allowed simultaneous assessment of adding various therapies to standard of care (SOC; androgen deprivation). The trial recruited patients commencing long-term hormone therapy (HT) for high-risk, locally advanced, or metastatic prostate cancer (CaP), either newly diagnosed or after failure of previous local therapy. Results from STAMPEDE&#x02019;s docetaxel comparison showed major improvements in survival.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> A companion meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> combining data from other major international trials<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> confirmed the usefulness of that combination, changing world-wide practice.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Here, we report outcomes after SOC plus either celecoxib (Cel) or Cel and zoledronic acid (ZA; Data Supplement).</p><p>Cox-2 inhibition is associated with inhibition of carcinogenesis,<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and case-control studies have shown a reduced risk of CaP.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> ZA has known anti-CaP effects, demonstrated both clinically in later-stage disease<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and in vitro.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The first-generation bisphosphonate clodronate improved survival when used concurrently with long-term HT for metastatic CaP.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The anticipated mechanisms of action of Cox-2 inhibitors such as Cel and bisphosphonates such as ZA were considered complementary, allowing targeting of both bone progression and the underlying molecular changes that lead to progression.</p><p>The MAMS design uses increasingly stringent hurdles at interim analyses to determine whether recruitment to a comparison should continue through to fully powered survival analysis. Interim analysis was performed on failure-free survival (FFS), primarily driven by rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA).</p><p>In 2011, at the second, preplanned activity analysis, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed data, including those on toxicity and FFS. The observed safety of Cox-2 inhibition &#x000b1; ZA was not questioned; closure to recruitment to both Cel-containing arms was recommended because of insufficient activity on FFS, guided by a protocol-defined activity target of a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.92. The Trial Steering Committee agreed that Cel should be stopped in both arms. The ZA was continued because the ZA comparison was continuing. On the committee&#x02019;s recommendation, comparative FFS data for the Cel-only arm were published; follow-up continued as planned.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Release of survival data was intended to follow publication of survival data for the docetaxel, ZA, and docetaxel + ZA comparisons, which started recruitment simultaneously and passed through all intermediate analyses.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> For the purposes of understanding, we also include some information on contemporaneously randomly assigned patients allocated to SOC + ZA; this is updated information on a subset of patients reported previously.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> We also contextualize our findings on Cel + ZA with summary information from the docetaxel arms in STAMPEDE, because that treatment is now an increasingly used SOC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>The trial, detailed previously,<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> was run according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, with relevant regulatory and ethics approvals.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>A MAMS platform approach was used.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Eligible patients had CaP that was newly diagnosed and either metastatic, node positive, or high-risk locally advanced (with &#x02265; 2 of T3/4, Gleason 8 to 10, and PSA &#x02265; 40 ng/mL). Eligibility criteria also included that the patients had been treated previously with radical surgery or radiotherapy (RT) now relapsing with high-risk features. All were initiating long-term HT within 12 weeks before random assignment. Patients were required to be fit for chemotherapy with no history of severe cardiovascular disease. All gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Random Assignment and Masking</title><p>A computerized algorithm implemented minimization-based random assignment (random element, 20%), stratifying for hospital, age, presence of metastases, planned RT use, nodal involvement, WHO performance status, planned HT type, and regular aspirin and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Allocation was 2:1:1 for open-label SOC-only, SOC + Cel, and SOC + ZA + Cel.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Treatment</title><p>HT was lifelong for patients with metastatic disease and &#x02265; 2years for patients with nonmetastatic disease. HT was with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists or orchidectomy; patients with nonmetastatic disease could receive oral anti-androgens alone; patients with metastatic disease could undergo orchidectomy. RT was encouraged for patients with nonmetastatic disease 6 to 9 months after random assignment.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Cel was given orally 400 mg twice a day for 1 year after regulatory authority advice after withdrawal of another Cox-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib. ZA was planned for &#x02264; 2 years, given as outpatient infusions at 4 mg/15 min on approximately 66 occasions, starting once every 3 weeks for six cycles then once every 4 weeks. The protocol described modifications for adverse events (AEs). Either treatment was to stop for intolerable AEs or an FFS event.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Follow-Up</title><p>Follow-up, including PSA tests, was every 6 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks to 2 years, every 6 months to 5 years, then annually. Additional tests were at the investigators&#x02019; discretion. Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> was used to grade AEs; serious AEs were reported promptly by sites.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Primary and Secondary Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measure, survival, was time from random assignment to death from any cause. The intermediate primary outcome measure, FFS, was time from random assignment to first evidence of either biochemical failure; local, lymph node, or distant metastatic progression; or death as a result of CaP. Biochemical failure was determined as a rise in PSA &#x02265; 4 ng/mL and 50% above the lowest reported PSA within 24 weeks after random assignment, or failure to decrease by 50% from the starting PSA during this time. When possible, the cause of death was determined by blinded central review. Death as a result of CaP was recorded when classified by the reviewer as definitely or probably CaP; the site investigator's determination was used for 11 of 584 deaths (2%), with insufficient data available for central review; deaths without reported cause were classified as non-CaP.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical Design and Analysis</title><p>We assumed a median FFS of 2 years and a survival of 4 to 5 years for control subjects and targeted a 25% relative improvement (HR, 0.75) in FFS and overall survival (OS) for each pairwise comparison of research arm to control arm. The Stata program nstage (Stata, College Station, TX) allowed the MAMS design with three intermediate activity analyses on the basis of FFS and an efficacy analysis on the basis of survival. The latter had 90% power and a 2.5% one-sided &#x003b1;, requiring approximately 400 control arm deaths; the former each had 95% power and increasingly stringent one-sided &#x003b1;s of 50%, 25%, and 10%, requiring approximately 114, 216, and 334 FFS events, respectively, and expressed as lack-of-benefit stopping guidelines.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Only patients randomly assigned contemporaneously were compared head to head for each pairwise comparison. Patients were included in the efficacy analyses according to allocated treatment on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, unless stated.</p><p>Accumulating data were reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Patients allocated to the Cel arm who still met the eligibility criteria when accrual stopped prematurely were offered complete withdrawal and re-random assignment to an ongoing arm (this is not one of the primary comparisons reported here); five accepted and contribute here only a short period of data from random assignment to withdrawal from their original allocation. Standard survival analysis methods were used for analyses of time-to-event data in STATA version 14. Patients without the relevant event were censored when last reported event free. Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for stratification factors (with the exception of hospital and planned HT), were used to estimate most relative treatment effects, with HR &#x0003c; 1.00 favoring the research arm. Flexible parametric models<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> with five degrees of freedom for the baseline hazard function and five degrees of freedom for the time-dependent effect and adjusted for stratification factors were used to estimate medians, 5-year event rates, and restricted mean survival time. Restricted mean survival time took primacy if there was evidence of nonproportional hazards. The likelihood ratio test was used to test for the presence of treatment-subgroup interactions. Fine and Gray regression models were used for competing risk analysis of CaP-specific survival. All confidence intervals are at 95%. Prespecified analyses examined consistency of treatment effect by stratification factors, categorized Gleason score (&#x02264; 7, &#x02265; 8, or unknown), timing of random assignment (newly diagnosed or recurrent after previous local therapy), and, as a continuous variable, pre-HT PSA. A <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; .10 was taken to be indicative of possible heterogeneity. A preplanned subgroup analysis of M1 patients at random assignment was included in the statistical analysis plan and the complementary M0 group. Sensitivity analyses dividing patients by whether they could have received the maximal duration of Cel (earlier), or not (later), were considered (Data Supplement).</p><p>Median follow-up was estimated by reverse censoring on death, in which survival is treated as the event and death as censoring.</p><p>Preplanned exploratory factorial analyses of ZA and Cel, with and without an interaction term, drew in data from those patients randomly assigned contemporaneously to SOC + ZA.</p><p>The safety population for analysis of AEs grouped patients according to treatment started, with sensitivity analysis on an ITT basis.

These two Cel comparisons show no overall evidence that Cel, alone or combined with ZA, improved survival or FFS compared with SOC. However, a preplanned subgroup analysis suggested the possibility of benefit in terms of both survival and FFS for SOC + Cel + ZA over SOC alone in M1 patients at random assignment, although the test for interaction was not significant at a traditional 5% significance level.</p><p>Importantly, follow-up continued after accrual to Cel stopped. There is no bias in the reporting time of these comparisons; we report them, as planned, straight after survival results from the other arms that started contemporaneously. Data return rates are good, with most patients known to be alive having reported data in the past year.</p><p>Although recruitment to these comparisons was terminated early, there are still three quarters the number of control arm deaths that would have triggered this survival analysis had the comparisons passed all three interim analyses (n = approximately 300 of 400).</p><p>Results for the combination of Cel and ZA are intriguing and unexpected, given that we observed no evidence of improvement in OS or FFS with the addition of either Cel or ZA alone. Unfortunately, no further comparative data that would help directly in interpretation are expected. No other powered randomized controlled trial combining bisphosphonates and Cox-2 inhibitors are listed on trial registers; studies listed are nonrandomized or small or they terminated early. Our data fall short of definite evidence that this is a real effect; tests for interaction typically lack power, particularly in subgroups and where accrual is terminated early. Rather, they are hypothesis generating and provoke further research. Biologically, an effect by directly targeting tumor and/or host cells, particularly of stromal and immune lineage, is not implausible.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>The observed effect on survival of combined Cel and ZA in the metastatic setting is of similar magnitude to that reported for docetaxel in the STOPCaP (Systemic Treatment Options for Prostate Cancer) meta-analysis,<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> although the observed effect on FFS is much less pronounced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> and Data Supplement). There are reports of anticancer activity with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac,<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and STOPCaP suggests an overall benefit of bisphosphonates in metastatic disease, albeit driven by one trial of sodium clodronate.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Summary Data From this Article and for Doc and ZA From Meta-Analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCO.2016.69.0677t3"/></table-wrap><p>We defined survival as the definitive outcome measure, D, and FFS as the intermediate outcome measure, I. When this trial was first designed, some fundamental principles and assumptions were adopted, following the process for MAMS designs: (1) a treatment that does not improve I is unlikely to sufficiently improve D; (2) an improvement in I may not translate into an improvement in D; (3) therefore, a failure to improve I by a prespecified amount can be used as a triage for D, to allow early stopping of recruitment, but success in improving I does not remove the need to continue recruitment to reliably assess D; (4) I does not need to be a surrogate for D in the strictest sense, but only on the causal pathway; and (5) arms whose recruitment is stopped because of failure to improve I will continue to be followed up, and D will be reported soon after that for contemporaneously initiated arms.</p><p>When the trial launched in 2005, these assumptions were still thought to be reasonable with our choices for I and D. With the hindsight afforded by a decade of new knowledge and new data, we now realize that in CaP and in some other cancers, and with some interventions, there might be more discordance between FFS and survival in some circumstances.</p><p>FFS was the interim outcome measure for Cel and ZA. The vast majority of patients respond to HT with a fall in PSA values; we were specifically looking for an enhancement of the time to treatment failure by the addition of these agents, which legitimizes FFS as an outcome measure because response was not an appropriate outcome. The primary outcome measure is OS, which is not dependent directly on PSA values, although PSA values will have affected treatment decisions for clinicians along the way. The multistage approach in a MAMS trial does not require a perfect surrogate outcome measure, but one on the causal pathway, as FFS is for survival. Overall, there was minimal effect on FFS, and this translated into minimal effect on OS. In this regard, FFS was an acceptable choice. For the comparisons added later in STAMPEDE, we used the same definition of FFS treatment in both the abiraterone comparison and the enzalutamide plus abiraterone comparison in STAMPEDE, but allowed treatment to continue using all three types of progression (biochemical, clinical, and radiologic); for the new metformin comparison that opened in STAMPEDE in September 2016, we have chosen not to use a PSA-driven outcome measure as the intermediate outcome measure.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Interpretation is further complicated by early cessation of Cel treatment when recruitment stopped at the second activity analysis (Data Supplement), which meant that fewer patients could receive the planned duration of their allocated treatment. Long-term estimation of the treatment effect on FFS of SOC + Cel versus SOC-only in the Cel comparison is consistent with our previous publication,<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> when Cel failed to pass its second intermediate activity threshold.</p><p>At random assignment, RT was stated as part of the treatment plan for approximately one quarter of M0 patients across all arms. Around the time recruitment to these comparisons was stopped, data were emerging from NCIC-CTG-PR.3/MRC-PR07 and SPCG-7 that RT improved survival for men starting long-term HT for M0 CaP.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Herein, the reported use of RT in the control group met expectations, but it was lower in both research arms. This preferential omission of RT from the Cel-containing arms complicates the findings, and a more favorable signal may have been observed had RT not been preferentially omitted for unrecorded reasons.</p><p>Approximately one half of the patients died, mostly as a result of CaP. There were several deaths with cardiovascular causes, but these occurred proportionally more in the combination arm.</p><p>One stratification factor at random assignment was the use of NSAIDs and/or aspirin, included only because of these Cel comparisons. Both comparisons had much improved FFS in patients receiving NSAIDs and/or aspirin at baseline, but this did not translate into evidence of a difference in survival. Baseline use of NSAIDs and/or aspirin likely related to underlying, pre-existing comorbidities, but this effect deserves further exploration.</p><p>Our data show no evidence of a survival advantage in adding Cel alone for all men starting long-term HT for the first time. We previously also showed no evidence of a survival advantage in adding ZA alone for the same patient group. Overall, the combination of Cel and ZA had no effect. Preplanned subgroup analyses may provide a hypothesis for future studies to investigate adding Cel in settings in which ZA is already part of the SOC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the Cancer Research UK, Medical Research Council, Novartis, Sanofi, Pfizer, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Astellas Pharma, National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Network (formerly National Cancer Research Network), and the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research.</p></fn><fn id="fn2" fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial information: NCT00268476 and ISRCTN78818544.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>See accompanying Editorial on page <related-article id="d38e947" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1200/JCO.2017.72.2793">1501</related-article></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>D.P.D., C.C.P., and G.A. acknowledge support from the NIHR to the Royal Marsden NHS Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research Biomedical Research Centre</p></ack><sec id="s20"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p><bold>Conception and design:</bold> Malcolm D.
