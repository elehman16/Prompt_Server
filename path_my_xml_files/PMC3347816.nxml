A sedentary lifestyle makes children and adolescents vulnerable in adulthood to chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Improving the health status in this vulnerable age group can be effective in prevention of epidemics of non-communicable diseases in developing countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref> Among the negative consequences of reduced physical activity is the growing trend of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the age group of children and adolescents during the past two decades, which of course are also due to changes in dietary habits, i.e., consumption of more fast foods and snacks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref> During the past two decades, the prevalence of obesity has increased, both in advanced nations and in developing and third world countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref> For example, in England during the past two decades, the number of obese 6- and 15-year-old children and adolescents has doubled and trebled, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref> The accelerated trend of overweight in children and adolescents should be considered as an alarming sign,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref> because most of them will develop obesity in adulthood and obesity predisposes them to many chronic diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, depression, etc.).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref> In our country, overweight and obesity in children and adolescents has a growing trend and its relationship with lifestyle, including inactivity has been shown too.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref> Some studies, through implementing regular training programs, such as holding training sessions at regular intervals and on a temporary basis, with various educational programs, including promoting self-confidence, physical activity training, modifying dietary habits and diet therapy, have been able to achieve useful outcomes in improving health indices in obese children and adolescents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref> Since various studies in different countries have shown that the effects of reduced physical activity in increasing the prevalence of obesity and overweight in children and adolescents are significantly more than the effects of changes in dietary habits,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref> inclusion of physical activity training programs together with other programs (nutritional therapy and behavioral therapy) seems necessary. Then, achieving the best method of education can have the most prominent impact on controlling and treating obesity in children and adolescents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this study, which was conducted as a non-pharmacological clinical trial for a period of six months (from 15 May to 15 November 2007), the target population consisted of 6 to 18-year-old children who were referred by physicians and schools to the Pediatrics Clinic of Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. They were randomly selected and placed in three groups. Sample size was calculated 105 in view of the quantitative nature of the variables at 105. Hence, 35 individuals were assigned to each group. The criteria for inclusion in the study were obesity and access to computer or video player (for film-based education). If the subject had thyroid diseases, hormonal abnormalities, mental retardation and severe physical disability that would hamper physical activities, the individual was excluded. Special recording files were created for all subjects and primary data including sex and age were recorded. Then, the required indicators were measured and recorded. All examinations were performed by the same team, which included a physician and a nurse. At the beginning, the weight of individual was measured by a scale in kilograms. The weight was measured in light clothing and without shoes. Then, height was measured in standing position next to a wall, with heels, hips, shoulders and head tangent to the wall. By dividing weight of individuals (kg) by square of height (m<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>), their body mass index was calculated and recorded. Waist circumference was measured from the point between the distance of 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> ribs to the anterior iliac spine in meters. Also, hip circumference was measured at the femoral trochanters and the ratio of the two was calculated and recorded as waist-hip ratio (WHR). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured using a sphygmomanometer in mmHg. To make the study blind, the person who conducted measurements of indicators was not aware of the positioning of samples in the group in question.</p><p>In the first group, nutritional recommendations and behavioral therapy was performed in 10 sessions under supervision of the relevant expert in the form of monthly nutritional and behavioral treatment, and they took part in physical activity training classes twice a week. In the second group, nutritional recommendations and behavioral therapy was like the first group and the presentation of physical activity training was done by giving them educational CDs. In the third group, diet therapy and behavioral therapy was done as in the previous groups and physical activity training and nutritional education were done by face-to-face method. This program continued for 3 consecutive months and at the end of the third month, once more the indicators of each of the samples were evaluated and recorded. Analysis of data was performed by SPSS<sub>15</sub> software. To compare the achieved changes between the three groups with different therapeutic methods, we used variance analysis test (ANOVA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0003"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, 105 children and adolescents in 3 groups of 35 were studied; their physical and general particulars are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. This table shows the primary data relating to each group. No significant difference existed among the three groups before intervention except in their WHRs. Comparison of variables under the study in three groups (the group participated in physical training classes, the group trained via CD, and the group undergone exercise recommendations) showed no significant difference in physical activity training with the three methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">Table 3</xref> shows mean and standard deviation of each of the variables in each of the educational groups before and after intervention. Mean height in all three groups before and after the intervention showed a significant difference (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Mean BMI in the group participated in physical activity classes and in the group undergone education withCD showed a significant reduction after intervention compared to those before intervention. Mean systolic blood pressure in the group participated in physical training classes and mean diastolic blood pressure in the group undergone education with CD showed a significant

sec-type="discussion" id="S0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings showed that using the method of education with CD can also be as effective as face-to-face education and participating in physical training classes in reducing BMI of children and adolescents with overweight and obesity, and no significant difference was seen among the three methods of physical activity training.</p><p>Reduction of physical activity associated with changes in food and behavioral habits of children and adolescents has led to increase in overweight and obesity, turning into a serious problem in today's communities. In recent years, the amount of physical activity of our children and adolescents has been inadequate and although the participation of girls in exercise activities has been on the rise in recent years, it is still significantly less than that in boys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref> Other find-ings showed that nearly 60% of children and adolescents spend more than 4 hours in a day watching television<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref> whereas the maximum amount of time allowable for such sedentary activities is 2 hours daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref> Given that increase in walking and reducing the amount of television watching has an important role in weight reduction in children,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref> more attention must be paid to this matter. In a study conducted by Gorely and colleagues, 7-11 year-old children, in comparison with the control group, had increased physical activity after a 10-month intervention by physical training educational CD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref> As obesity can cause physical as well as mental disease in children and adolescents, it can also predispose them to chronic diseases of adulthood; therefore, the necessity of appropriate planning to weight control is of special importance. Individuals dealing with health of children and adolescents must use different methods to encourage families to improve their lifestyles and increase their children's physical activity, as well as their own. The important point about this matter is continued participation and physical activity of family members and emphasizing daily activities, rather than specialist and champion sports. In light of the fact that different studies have demonstrated the effect of reduced physical activity in increasing the prevalence of obesity of children and adolescents, even more than nutrition, it is necessary to integrate methods of physical activity training, including exercise accompanied by nutritional therapy and behavioral therapy. Therefore, achieving the best effects of educational methods for physical activity and also finding the most appropriate method of presenting this education can be a suitable solution in programs for control and treatment of obesity in children and adolescents. Hence the present study was designed with the aim of comparing three methods of physical activity training in this age group so that the obtained results can be extended to schools and the community. Given that parents are too busy to take their children to exercise classes and the time limitations of children and adolescents for participating in exercise classes, the use of educational methods such as CD made in this program can increase the level of physical activity in children and adolescents. It is recommended that wider studies be performed in the community so that the results can be further extended to the community.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The cost of this study was paid by Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></ack><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>Authors have no conflict of interests.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Daley</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>School based physical activity in the United Kingdom: can it create physically active adults?</article-title><source>Quest</source><year>2002</year><volume>54</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>21</fpage><lpage>33</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="confproc"><collab>Physical activity in Iranian youth</collab><year>2005</year><conf-name>Proceeding of the 17th Congress of Updates in Pediatric</conf-name><conf-loc>Iran, Tehran</conf-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kelder</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>Klepp</surname><given-names>KI</given-names></name><name><surname>Lytle</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Longitudinal tracking of adolescent smoking, physical activity, and food choice behaviors</article-title><source>Am J Public Health</source><year>1994</year><volume>84</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>1121</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8017536</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kelishadi</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Childhood overweight, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome in developing countries</article-title><source>Epidemiol Rev</source><year>2007</year><volume>29</volume><issue>62</issue><fpage>76</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0005"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van Mil</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Goris</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Westerterp</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physical activity and the prevention of childhood obesity-Europe versus the United States</article-title><source>Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord</source><year>1999</year><volume>23</volume><issue>Suppl 3</issue><fpage>S41</fpage><lpage>S44</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10368001</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0006"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Popkin</surname><given-names>BM</given-names></name><name><surname>Richards</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Montiero</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Stunting is associated with overweight in children of four nations that are undergoing the nutrition transition</article-title><source>J Nutr</source><year>1996</year><volume>126</volume><issue>12</issue><fpage>3009</fpage><lpage>16</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9001368</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0007"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reilly</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dorosty</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemic of obesity in UK children</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>1999</year><volume>354</volume><issue>9193</issue><fpage>1874</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10584727</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0008"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dietz</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The obesity epidemic in young children.
