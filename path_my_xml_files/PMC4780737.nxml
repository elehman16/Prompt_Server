Immediately before receiving treatment, patients received a cleansing enema. Using an anoscope, four 1 mL injections were administered (1 mL in each quadrant [posterior, left lateral, anterior, and right lateral] of the submucosa of the anal canal), ~5 mm above the dentate line, without the use of anesthesia. The procedure for patients receiving sham treatment was similar, except that no substance was injected. At 1 month, patients with no persistent adverse events but persistent FI (CCFIS &#x02265;10) were offered one retreatment procedure. Patients and study investigators were blinded to treatment administered during the first 6 months post-injection. During this 6-month period, patients underwent a clinical anorectal assessment and proctoscopy at 3 and 6 months.<xref rid="b25-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The study was approved by the ethics committees and institutional review boards of all participating centers.

The primary end point and the FIQL coping/behavior subscale, chosen based on the significant improvement reported during the pivotal study,<xref rid="b25-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> were further analyzed by subgroups, which comprised baseline and demographic characteristics (ie, sex, age, body mass index, severity of FI, duration of FI, history of urinary incontinence, number of FI episodes, and cause of FI) and use of prior FI treatment modalities (ie, dietary avoidance, fiber supplementation, antidiarrheal medications, bowel habit training, biofeedback, and surgery).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For analysis of the primary end point, efficacy was evaluated in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population for each of the subgroups. As prespecified in the study protocol, odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were generated for each comparison between NASHA/Dx and sham treatment using the logistic model, with baseline number of FI episodes, sex, and treatment center as covariates. For the primary end point, missing data were handled with the primary imputation method. In this prespecified scheme, baseline diary data were carried forward to 6 months for patients who were withdrawn from the study for any reason before or at the 6-month visit and did not have valid 6-month diary data. If a patient had not withdrawn from the study before the 6-month visit but had no valid diary data at 6 months, the most recent data were carried forward for them. For analysis of the FIQL coping/behavior subscale, change from baseline to 6 months was calculated in the ITT population for each subgroup using the prespecified imputation method of last observation carried forward. Least-squares (LS) means were estimated for NASHA/Dx and sham treatments in a given subgroup using the analysis of covariance model with baseline FIQL subscale score, sex, and treatment center as covariates. Differences in LS means, corresponding 95% confidence intervals, and <italic>P</italic>-values were generated from the same analysis model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>A total of 206 patients (NASHA/Dx, n=136; sham, n=70) were included in the ITT population.

For patients with a CCFIS of 10 to 15 and duration of disease &#x02264;5 years, indicators of mild-to-moderate disease, treatment with NASHA/Dx was significantly favored compared with treatment with sham (LS means difference in FIQL subscale score, 0.21 [<italic>P</italic>=0.0371] and 0.25 [<italic>P</italic>=0.0289], respectively). Patients with an obstetric etiology of FI had a greater change in the FIQL coping/behavior subscale following treatment with NASHA/Dx compared with sham treatment (LS means difference, 0.32; <italic>P</italic>=0.0384). Patients without a history of treatment consisting of any one or more of antidiarrheal medications, bowel habit training, biofeedback, or surgery were also significantly more likely to respond to NASHA/Dx versus sham treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ceg-9-041">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results of a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial in patients with FI showed that injection with NASHA/Dx decreased the number of FI episodes by at least 50% in 52.7% of patients at 6 months compared with 32.1% of patients receiving sham treatment.<xref rid="b25-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Previous studies have suggested that treatment response in patients with FI may be affected by demographic and baseline disease characteristics, including age, severity of disease, and type of FI.<xref rid="b20-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b26-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Because clinical trials may be designed to select for a homogeneous population of patients with FI, rather than for specific baseline or demographic characteristics,<xref rid="b31-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> post hoc analyses may provide insight into the profile of patients who may derive the maximum benefit from a specific treatment. This post hoc responder analysis of data from the randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical study of NASHA/Dx in patients with FI<xref rid="b25-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> was conducted to examine demographic and baseline disease characteristics, including previous FI treatments, that might be predictive of treatment success.</p><p>Regardless of subgroup analyzed, there was a general trend in favor of NASHA/Dx versus sham for the treatment of FI. Interestingly, patients who had symptoms consistent with mild-to-moderate FI at baseline (ie, CCFIS &#x02264;15,<xref rid="b28-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> duration of FI &#x02264;5 years, exposure to few prior FI treatment modalities), and those in whom the primary cause of FI was obstetric-related were more likely to benefit from treatment with NASHA/Dx compared with sham treatment. A similar profile of subgroup responsiveness was observed for the FIQL coping/behavior subscale, where patients with mild-to-moderate FI at baseline (CCFIS &#x02264;15, duration of FI &#x02264;5 years, exposure to few prior FI treatment modalities) and an obstetric etiology of FI had a significant change in the FIQL coping/behavior subscale score at 6 months. These data suggest that the optimal patient population for treatment with NASHA/Dx may be patients with mild-to-moderate FI, and that reductions in FI episodes may translate into meaningful enhancements in some FI-related quality of life measures. It should be noted that there were no changes in other FIQL subscales (ie, lifestyle, depression, and self-perception) at 6 months in the overall population,<xref rid="b25-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> although significant improvements were observed at 12 months in all of these domains.</p><p>The potential treatment benefit observed with NASHA/Dx in patients who had an obstetric FI etiology is interesting and may be related to the nature of the trauma incurred during childbirth. As a neurologic etiology of FI following childbirth (eg, pudendal neuropathy) is different than a sphincter tear during childbirth, it would be valuable to further understand potential treatment benefits for this obstetric-related FI population when subgrouped by etiology. However in the current study, additional data on the etiology of obstetric trauma were unavailable for further analysis of potential differences. Maintenance of anal pressure in the anal canal is important for continence,<xref rid="b32-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> as anal pressure has been shown to decrease in many patients following vaginal delivery for at least 6 to 10 weeks compared with anal pressure before childbirth.<xref rid="b33-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Further, mechanical or neurologic damage to the anal sphincter following vaginal delivery (eg, forceps delivery, tears) is not uncommon and has been shown to affect 35% of patients with no previous pregnancies in one study;<xref rid="b32-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b34-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> instrumentation-assisted vaginal delivery has been significantly associated with FI 5 to 10 years after childbirth.<xref rid="b35-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> These data are not entirely surprising, given that normal anorectal function relies on the neuromuscular integrity of the anal canal and surrounding sphincter muscle.<xref rid="b32-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The benefit observed in patients with obstetric damage may be related, at least in part, to the mechanism of action of NASHA/Dx. The dextranomer microspheres establish a scaffold for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and collagen to grow around, stabilizing the tissue near the injection sites, and sealing the anal canal to an extent,<xref rid="b20-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> thus restoring anal pressure.<xref rid="b32-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b37-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Obstetric trauma and injury is a risk factor for FI,<xref rid="b39-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and these findings suggest that this patient population may be likely to benefit from treatment with NASHA/Dx.</p><p>The inclusion of a sham control arm in this study was a strength that allowed for control of selection and response biases by investigators and patients. The assessment of subgroup responsiveness under such randomized, controlled conditions was, therefore, clinically meaningful. Nevertheless, this analysis has limitations. Due to the post hoc nature of the assessments, one limitation is that the study was not specifically powered to test for efficacy in various subgroups. Further, some of the subgroups had a small number of patients, thus limiting ability to interpret the results. Another limitation is that durability of response with NASHA/Dx has been shown for up to 3 years,<xref rid="b40-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> but data for sham treatment beyond 6 months are lacking in the current study because patients in the sham treatment arm were offered open-label treatment with NASHA/Dx after the short (6-month) blinding period and were excluded from further analysis.<xref rid="b25-ceg-9-041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Finally, given that post hoc analyses are hypothesis-generating endeavors, the results described herein warrant a well-powered, prospective, controlled study in patients with mild-to-moderate FI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Injection with NASHA/Dx is an efficacious treatment for patients with FI, and data suggest that patients with mild-to-moderate FI may represent the population that would be most likely to respond to treatment. Future prospective studies are warranted to support these findings and help identify the factors that determine responsiveness to injectable bulking agents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Technical editorial and medical writing assistance was provided, under the direction of the authors, by Sophie Bolick, PhD, for Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, PA, USA.
