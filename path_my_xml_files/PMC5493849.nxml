Besides the pathological factors, the occurrence and exacerbation of hypertension are also associated with many factors of lifestyle and behaviors. Thus hypertensive patients&#x02019; Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is not only influenced by the disease itself but also by many subjective factors such as health literacy and self-management efficacy, especially in the deeper part of southwestern China and thus is less developed compared to the other places. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the HRQL of hypertensive patients and health literacy and self-management efficacy as well as how they affect the HRQL, so as to provide a theoretical reference for improving the HRQL of patients with hypertension in less developed areas.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This was a cross-sectional study of baseline data from a clustered randomized controlled trial. The study design had passed a cross-national peer review and accepted grants by the China Medical Board. It was also registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-OOR-14005563).</p><p id="Par3">A standardized questionnaire adapted from a previous validated WHO questionnaire was used for the survey which included detailed questions about patient&#x02019;s socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported information.</p><p id="Par4">Patients&#x02019; HRQL was measured by the Mandarin version of the 36-item Short Form. We used the validated Mandarin version of the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale to assess patients&#x02019; self-management efficacy. The validated three-item Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS) was used to measure the patients&#x02019; health literacy.</p><p id="Par5">A structural equation model was constructed, and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 was taken as significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">Demographic characteristics, health literacy and self-management efficacy have all significant effects on HRQL. Age, education level, self-management efficacy and health literacy were significantly related to the HRQL. The constructed model had a good fit for the data according to the model fit indices. Based on the model, health literacy (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.604, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.029) and Self-management efficacy (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.714, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018) have a significant impact on HRQL. Demographic characteristics were inversely related to HRQL (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.419, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007), but have a significant impact on health literacy (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.675, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.029) and self-management efficacy (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.379, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.029). At the same time, self-management efficacy was positively correlated to health literacy (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.413, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par7">Age, education level, self-management efficacy and health literacy were all related to the HRQL of patient with hypertension, which means that patients who are more elderly and have lower education level, low self-management efficacy and poor health literacy get worse HRQL. This may imply the necessary to introduce routine assessment of health literacy and self-management efficacy into assessment procedures for hypertensive patients&#x02019; health management. Such assessment can help professionals to identify the population at greatest risk for poor health outcomes and low well-being in the future. In clinical practice, effective interventions such as direct guidance and education to raise the self-management efficacy and enhance health literacy might improve the HRQL of patients with hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par8">Retrospectively registered Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=9948">ChiCTR-OOR-14005563</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par9">Name of registry: Effects of the integrated delivery system and payment system of community-based intervention on rural patients of chronic diseases in Qianjiang District, China</p><p id="Par10">Date of registration: Retrospectively registered 23 November 2014.</p><p id="Par11">Date of enrolment of the first participant to the trial: 5 July 2012</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Effect</kwd><kwd>Health literacy</kwd><kwd>Self-management efficacy</kwd><kwd>HRQL</kwd><kwd>Hypertension</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001547</institution-id><institution>China Medical Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11-069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par41">Hypertension is a common disease of the cardiovascular system that causes approximately 71 million deaths worldwide each year; the mortality rate was 26.4% in 2000, and is expected to rise to 29.2% by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Results of the fourth national health services survey in China have shown that great changes have taken place in the structure of 2-week sickness prevalence rates, with chronic diseases making up a growing proportion of this rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, chronic diseases have become the leading cause of ill health in China. Among chronic diseases, hypertension affects the most patients and the rate of increase of patients with hypertension is the most rapid. This growth of patients with hypertension in China is occurring at a higher speed in rural areas than urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, hypertensive patients in rural areas have the characteristics of low health literacy and poor self-management ability, as hypertension has been effectively controlled in low percentage of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The complex nature of disease and the feeling of being ill will diminish quality of life and result in decreased satisfaction with daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Health-related quality of life (HRQL), which refers to perceived physical and mental health and function, is an important health indicator in medical interventions and health surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is an assessment of how the individual&#x02019;s well-being may be affected over time by a disease, disability, or disorder.</p><p id="Par43">The current concept of health-related quality of life acknowledges that subjects put their actual situation in relation to their personal expectation. The latter can vary over time, and react to external influences such as length and severity of illness, family support, etc. As with any situation involving multiple perspectives, patients&#x02019; and physicians&#x02019; rating of the same objective situation have been found to differ significantly. Consequently, health-related quality of life is now usually assessed using patient questionnaires. These are often multidimensional and cover physical, social, emotional, cognitive, work- or role-related, and possibly spiritual aspects as well as a wide variety of disease related symptoms, therapy induced side effects, and even the financial impact of medical conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life_(healthcare)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life_(healthcare)</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par44">Additionally, health-related quality of life research may be used as the final step in clinical trials of experimental therapies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life_(healthcare)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life_(healthcare)</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par45">HRQL of hypertensive patients is not only affected by the disease itself but also by some subjective factors such as health literacy, self-management and psychological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The interaction of the various factors increases the complexity and the difficulty of research. Although numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have investigated the objective factors, few studies have evaluated the subjective factors and mechanism of interaction. Saleem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] evaluated the association between HRQL and disease state knowledge among hypertensive patients in Pakistan. The results of this study suggested that hypertension knowledge was weakly associated with HRQL. Jayasinghe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] explored the HRQL of a large number of hypertensive patients in Australia. The study results indicated that patients with different gender and age showed different physical and/or mental characteristics. Vathesatogkit et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] examined and compared the effects of different health states on HRQL in a Thai population. The researchers found that awareness of diabetes and hypertension negatively influenced the mental component summary (MCS) but not influence the physical component summary (PCS). The study results indicated that sex and age were related to HRQL. However, most of the research conducted has focused on the influence of objective factors and ignored the role of subjective factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, relevant research of the pathway of how these factors affect HRQL is lacking.</p><p id="Par46">Health literacy is the ability to obtain, read, understand and use healthcare information to make appropriate health decisions and follow instructions for treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy</ext-link>). Health Literacy has been defined as the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health. Health Literacy means more than being able to read pamphlets and successfully make appointments. By improving people&#x02019;s access to health information and their capacity to use it effectively, health literacy is critical to empowerment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par47">Many factors determine the health literacy level of health education materials or other health interventions: reading level, numeracy level, current state of health, language barriers, cultural appropriateness, format and style, sentence structure, use of illustrations, interactiveness of intervention, and numerous other factors will affect how easily health information is understood and followed. So Health literacy is one of the important factors that influence patients&#x02019; HRQL and whether they could obtain the health services they need.</p><p id="Par48">Self-management efficacy focus on the confidence in the ability to conduct self- management activities. At present, self-management efficacy has been widely concerned in the management of chronic diseases. It is an important factor that influence the self-management behavior of patients, which can improve the self-management ability by improving the self-management efficacy of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between HRQL and health literacy and self-management efficacy and how the factors affect the HRQL among hypertensive patients in rural western China.

Qianjiang has in total 30 communities and 24 of them are rural ones. The average town population size is about 12,000, and every town has around 10 villages. Rural people accounted for 80% of the total population. Over 90% of the rural people have enrolled in the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme, which allow them to get nearly 60%(2012) reimbursement of the total in-patient medical expenditure from the medical insurance fund.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and design</title><p id="Par52">This was a cross-sectional study of baseline data from a clustered randomized controlled trial.

However, to control the disease, it is not enough to focus on the disease itself and its treatment, in reality, the subjective factors such as health literacy and self-management efficacy also have great impact to the HRQL. To a certain extent, paying more attention to subjective factors is conducive to the prevention and control of hypertension. Therefore, in this study, we explored the influence of health literacy and self-management efficacy on HRQL in a rural population of southwestern China with hypertension, and analyzed how they affect the HRQL.</p><p id="Par87">Our findings indicate that patients who had higher health literacy and self-management efficacy get better HRQL. However patients who are more elderly with lower education level get worse HRQL.</p><p id="Par88">This study demonstrates that HRQL had a significant relationship with age, education level, health literacy and self-management efficacy. The findings are not completely consistent with those of other studies. Saleem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] explored the HRQL profile of a hypertensive population in Pakistan. The study found that education, income and locality had a significant relationship with HRQL, but there was no significant difference between different age groups. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found that hypertension markedly impaired quality of life, and comorbidity further deteriorated HRQL among people with hypertension in China. Zyoud et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] assessed adherence and HRQL in hypertensive patients in the Middle East; the results showed that patients with a high adherence had the highest HRQL. In this study, similar to patients of other regions and cultures, age and education level had a significant relationship with HRQL in terms of both physical and mental health. Our study did not find that yearly family income and yearly family medical costs influenced HRQL, which is not consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One possible explanation for these results is that all the hypertensive patients who participated in the program are in rural cooperative medical care, therefore, cost is not a big barrier for seeking medical advice.</p><p id="Par89">We found that self-management efficacy influenced the PCS, but had no effect on the MCS. By contrast, health literacy influenced the MCS, but had no effect on PCS. These findings are in accordance with those of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, some studies have shown that increased awareness of hypertension is related to lower HRQL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] also reported that patients with a high adherence had the highest HRQL. In the process of investigation, we found that at early stages of the disease when patients had mild symptoms they often did not take the initiative to learn about hypertension and did not accept medical treatment regularly. However, when obvious symptoms appeared, patients would learn about hypertension and accept expensive medical costs to treat comorbidities of hypertension, at a point when their HRQL had been irreversibly impaired. That indicates low health literacy is prevalent in the rural areas of southwestern China, and patients had not realized the importance of self-management. This observation was not in accordance with the study by Zyoud et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which found that participants with low HRQL were more likely to have lower adherence to anti-hypertensive medications. One explanation for these results might be the differences in health concepts and cultures of different regions and nations. However, this discrepancy has significant implications for the secondary prevention of hypertension. In the early stage of the disease, through self-management education, and through direct guidance and management of the disease, improvement of HRQL is still possible. In the advanced stages of disease, even if patients have a high self-management efficacy and cooperate actively with treatment, improvement of HRQL is limited.</p><p id="Par90">All indices suggest that the final structural equation model reasonably fits the data, and it is consistent with the theoretical constructs. The model revealed that health literacy was positively associated with HRQL. Hence, an increase in the health literacy predicted higher HRQL. Self-management efficacy is positive related to health literacy, and is indirectly related to HRQL. These findings lend further support to our viewpoint that improvement of the self-management predicts higher patient HRQL. Based on a structural equation model, we see that the greater the age of patients and the lower their education level, the lower is their HRQL.</p><p id="Par91">There are limitations in our study. First, this study is cross-sectional, therefore, the causal nature of the influencing factors cannot be determined. To further investigate the issue, a prospective design should be used. Second, the data that were derived from different data sources may lead to more generalized results at which we were not good enough. Third, because some of the data information is not detailed enough, we could not stratify the samples to do further analysis which may give a better explanation for the association between health literacy,self-management efficacy and HRQL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par92">Professionals working with hypertensive patients should be aware of the association between HRQL and health literacy and self-management efficacy in health management. This may also imply the necessary to introduce routine assessment of health literacy and self-management efficacy into assessment procedures for hypertensive patients. Such assessment can help professionals to identify the population at greatest risk for poor health outcomes and low well-being in the future. If low health literacy and self-management efficacy cause a decrease in HRQL among hypertensive patients, future interventions should focus on mitigating the negative effects of them.</p><p id="Par93">According to the characteristics of the hypertension itself, especially in the early stage of the disease, prevention before disease attack and health management is more effective than medical treatment. And good health literacy is absolutely a necessary condition of patients&#x02019; initiative prevention, as it can help people to realize how this disease attack and develop more healthy habits so as to help reduce the incidence or delay disease progression. Meanwhile, enhancing self-management efficacy can help patients to get healthy lifestyle, which would help avoiding hypertension deteriorating. Thus, the HRQL of patients with hypertension might be improved by encouraging patients to carry out better self-management and enhance health literacy, especially in the early stage of the disease. In clinical practice, with some kind of educational materials and effective interventions such as direct guidance for patients with low health literacy and poor self-management efficacy, we can improve health management in the society and mitigate the adverse health effects of low health literacy and poor self-management efficacy so as to help hypertensive patients to get better HRQL.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term><italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup></term><def><p id="Par12">Absolute fit index: chi-square</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AIC</term><def><p id="Par13">Information index: Akaike&#x02019;s InformationCriterion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BHLS</term><def><p id="Par14">Brief Health Literacy Screening</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p id="Par15">Bodily pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAIC</term><def><p id="Par16">Consistent Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criterion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFI</term><def><p id="Par17">Comparative Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Df</term><def><p id="Par18">Degrees of freedom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFI</term><def><p id="Par19">Goodness-of-Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GH</term><def><p id="Par20">General health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HL</term><def><p id="Par21">Health literacy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQL</term><def><p id="Par22">Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFI</term><def><p id="Par23">Incremental Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCS</term><def><p id="Par24">Mental component summary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MH</term><def><p id="Par25">Mental health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NFI</term><def><p id="Par26">Relative fit index: Normed Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p id="Par27">Physical component summary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PF</term><def><p id="Par28">Physical function</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RE</term><def><p id="Par29">Role limitations due to emotional problems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMR</term><def><p id="Par30">Root Mean Square Residual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMSEA</term><def><p id="Par31">Root Mean Square Error of Approximation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RP</term><def><p id="Par32">Role limitations due to physical problems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p id="Par33">Structural equation modeling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF</term><def><p id="Par34">Social function</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p id="Par35">36-item Short Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SME</term><def><p id="Par36">Self-management efficacy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRMR</term><def><p id="Par37">Standardized Root Mean Square Residual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLI</term><def><p id="Par38">Tucker-Lewis Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VT</term><def><p id="Par39">Vitality</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par40">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p><p>The authors wish to thank Chongqing Qianjiang health bureau for their assistance in field work, and the respondents who took the time to participate in the survey.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par94">The study was supported by grants from China Medical Board (Grant No: 11-069).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par95">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="Par96">CW developed the idea for this paper, participated in the creation of the study design, organized and took part in the data collection, carried out statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
