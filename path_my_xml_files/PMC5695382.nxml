A portion of patients eventually undergo appendectomy within a year, with 10%&#x02013;15% failing to respond in the initial period and a similar additional proportion with suspected recurrent episodes requiring appendectomy. Nearly all patients with appendicitis in the USA are still treated with surgery. A rigorous comparative effectiveness trial in the USA that is sufficiently large and pragmatic to incorporate usual variations in care and measures the patient experience is needed to determine whether antibiotics are as good as appendectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The Comparing Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial for acute appendicitis aims to determine whether the antibiotic treatment strategy is non-inferior to appendectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Analysis</title><p>CODA is a randomised, pragmatic non-inferiority trial that aims to recruit 1552 English-speaking and Spanish-speaking adults with imaging-confirmed appendicitis. Participants are randomised to appendectomy or 10 days of antibiotics (including an option for complete outpatient therapy). A total of 500 patients who decline randomisation but consent to follow-up will be included in a parallel observational cohort. The primary analytic outcome is quality of life (measured by the EuroQol five dimension index) at 4&#x02009;weeks. Clinical adverse events, rate of eventual appendectomy, decisional regret, return to work/school, work productivity and healthcare utilisation will be compared. Planned exploratory analyses will identify subpopulations that may have a differential risk of eventual appendectomy in the antibiotic treatment arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial was approved by the University of Washington&#x02019;s Human Subjects Division.

A recent meta-analysis reported incidental appendiceal neoplasm in 5 of 843 (0.59%) patients undergoing surgery.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The meta-analysis overall concluded that laparoscopic appendectomy remains the usual treatment for appendicitis and there is a &#x02018;poor evidence base overall with numerous areas of bias&#x02019;, limiting the use of the data for decision making.</p><p>The limitations of the existing data regarding antibiotics as a primary treatment for acute appendicitis have been systematically reviewed.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Most studies had small sample sizes; several did not have standardised imaging for diagnosing appendicitis, leading to inclusion of patients who likely had &#x02018;complicated&#x02019; appendicitis and patients without appendicitis; inexact and subjective outcome definitions and operation/reoperation criteria were used; there were limited or no laparoscopic options for surgery and, in some cases, inadequate antibiotic regimens allowed; and most had short follow-up (no studies reported following patients beyond 1&#x02009;year).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> While some studies evaluated outcomes including general pain scores and use of narcotic pain medication, no study used a validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) tool to measure the patient&#x02019;s experience in a standardised fashion. Other important outcomes to patients such as impact on work and school productivity, lingering symptoms, decisional regret and healthcare burden (such as emergency room care or future imaging) were not included in prior studies. Furthermore, prior studies regimented care in ways that are not consistent with care in the USA, such as requiring several days of inhospital convalescence. These limitations may explain the infrequent use of antibiotics as the primary treatment for appendicitis in the USA.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In addition to the need to address these limitations, there are additional, unresolved questions that make a larger, more definitive study of this treatment question important. First, there may be important subgroups of people with acute appendicitis who experience the treatment differentially. These might include older patients, who are at higher risk for surgical complications, those with possible appendiceal perforation detected on imaging or those with an appendicolith. The association between appendicolith and worse outcomes with antibiotics is unclear. Appendicoliths are found in up to 20% of appendicitis cases; a similar proportion is also described in autopsy studies of normal appendices.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In several paediatric studies and at least one adult study, appendicolith seemed to be associated with eventual appendectomy; however, since many trials did not include standardised imaging or criteria for requiring appendectomy following antibiotic therapy for appendicitis, it is unclear if the presence of an appendicolith actually confers a greater risk.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> There is currently no standard definition of &#x02018;complicated&#x02019; disease. In the USA, usual care for appendiceal abscess or phlegmon (inflammation so significant that surgeons are concerned for associated surgical morbidity) is antibiotics with consideration for interval appendectomy. Optimal treatment strategies for preoperative radiographic findings of appendiceal perforation are an area of controversy. The use of radiologic imaging to accurately determine perforation is limited; in prior randomised trials, patients with perforation were likely to have been inadvertently included due to a lack of imaging.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Finally, the European studies mandated the use of inpatient antibiotics at a time when there was a growing use of outpatient antibiotic regimens for similar conditions, such as acute diverticulitis.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> A recently completed, pilot randomised trial in the USA found that 14 of 15 adults randomised to antibiotics could successfully be discharged from the emergency department (ED) and receive all their care as outpatients, resolving their symptoms of acute appendicitis.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> One of the remaining questions is whether this total outpatient approach to antibiotics would be as good as appendectomy in usual practice.</p><p>Given these evidence gaps it remains to be determined if, from the patient&#x02019;s perspective, the antibiotic treatment approach is similar, definitively not worse, and perhaps even superior than the standard treatment of appendectomy. The Comparing Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial was designed to address this question and inform decision-making, focusing on commonly used surgical strategies and a range of antibiotic strategies, including total outpatient therapy, across a broad range of practice environments and a heterogeneous group of patients. These questions provide strong motivation for a pragmatic trial of antibiotics for acute appendicitis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Trial design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Stakeholder input in design, informed consent and protocol</title><p>A central feature of the CODA trial is its engagement of stakeholders in study conception, design, and implementation of the trial.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The Stakeholder Coordinating Center (SCC), established as a formal core within the study infrastructure, facilitates all engagement activities. The SCC engages representatives from the patient population of interest (those at risk for or who have had appendicitis), clinicians who are involved in appendicitis treatment (including emergency physicians, nurses and surgeons), leaders of professional societies (American College of Surgeons and American College of Emergency Physicians), representatives of Accountable Care Organizations, policy-makers, insurers and payers, researchers and leaders from large self-insured employers. Specific areas of protocol development informed by SCC included selecting primary and secondary outcomes. In addition to the routine clinical metrics that are assessed in any study of appendicitis treatment, other outcome measures important to patients (anxiety, quality of life&#x000a0;(QoL), time away from work, out-of-pocket expenses) and employers (time away from work and productivity at work) were included. Stakeholder input was particularly helpful in determining the primary analytic outcome, helping weigh the prior evidence showing no difference in rates of complications with an outcome metric that would &#x02018;sum up&#x02019; the impact of both treatments on the care experience of patients.</p><p>Because appendectomy was considered the standard and nearly universal therapy in the USA, advisors recommended a study that considered the non-inferiority of the antibiotics-first strategy. As one advisor said, &#x02018;the burden of proof is on the antibiotics treatment approach to demonstrate that it is as good as appendectomy&#x02019; (or not inferior by more than a small margin). Advisors also favoured a non-inferiority framework because the larger size required for this design would also allow for multiple planned subgroup analyses for patient groups of interest and the possibility that superiority of the PRO measure might be demonstrated.

We will evaluate difference in treatment effectiveness based on modality of receipt of antibiotics (all outpatient vs inpatient/outpatient). We will separately assess treatment effect heterogeneity by adding to the primary outcome model an interaction term between the categorical subgroup variable of interest and the indicator of treatment. We will use a global likelihood ratio test to examine if the treatment effect differs between key subgroups of interest.</p><p>An ITT approach will be applied in the primary analysis. We will conduct a secondary as-treated analysis of the primary outcome measure that appropriately accounts for patient-level or provider-level characteristics found to be differentially represented among patients who start in the antibiotics arm and who undergo appendectomy before 24&#x02009;hours of treatment or patients who are randomised to appendectomy but refuse the procedure and continue on antibiotics. We will consider a two-stage approach for this as-treated analysis: (1) to identify subgroups that are likely to require appendectomy and therefore should not be considered good candidates for treatment with antibiotics as primary treatment strategy&#x000a0;and (2) to estimate the complier average causal effect, which seeks to compare the outcomes of patients treated successfully in the antibiotic treatment arm (ie, did not ultimately have surgery) with patients randomised to the appendectomy arm who are similar in their expected compliance to assigned treatment.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;35</xref> We will use a maximum-likelihood mixture modelling approach to identify the optimal comparison group from the control arm for observed compliers in the intervention arm.

Morbidity events (using modified definitions from&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/acs-nsqip">National Surgical Quality Improvement Program</ext-link> (NSQIP) to accommodate non-operative care) are considered adverse events (AEs). AEs, SAEs and appendectomy after starting antibiotic treatment are identified through three approaches; EMR review, patient surveys and ad hoc reporting by any research or care team member. All SAEs are adjudicated by an independent safety monitor. SAEs and AEs are reviewed by the data and safety monitoring board&#x000a0;(DSMB) biannually (with the exception of death, which is reported to the DSMB within 24&#x02009;hours). An independent DSMB reviews the accruing data to (1) ensure that study conduct, enrolment and patient follow-up is adequate; (2) ensure that there are no serious safety concerns and (3) assess evidence related to patient-reported QoL. The analysis of accruing data is completed by the DCC, and interim analysis is presented to the DSMB with the primary goal of monitoring safety outcomes by randomisation group. Interim monitoring for SAE and AE will focus on the first 4&#x02009;weeks of follow-up. The DSMB will conduct interim analyses at 12, 24 and 36 months.</p><p>The CODA trial does not include a stopping rule if non-inferiority is met before complete accrual or if it is determined that non-inferiority cannot be demonstrated in interim analyses. We are not employing a stopping rule because there are important secondary outcomes (eg, rate of eventual appendectomy, complications, subgroup analysis) and understudied subgroups that require full enrolment.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior trials randomising patients with appendicitis to antibiotics compared with appendectomy focused on disease cure, with the primary outcome being the rate of appendectomy among antibiotic-treated participants. Previous studies of more than 800 participants randomised to antibiotics suggested that the treatment did not increase the rate of complications and offered as high as a 75% chance of avoiding appendectomy within a year.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9 12 37</xref> What remains to be evaluated is the comparative effectiveness of the two candidate treatments based on a comprehensive assessment of impact, including the full range of clinical outcomes and PROs that matter most to patients. CODA&#x02019;s pragmatic design aims to evaluate antibiotics in a heterogeneous population and practice settings in a large randomised trial, with a parallel observational cohort to assess selection bias. One of the greatest novelties of the CODA trial is its patient centredness, demonstrated both by the engagement of patients and other stakeholders as partners in selecting the topic, designing the proposal, developing the protocol and overseeing operations and in the selection of a QoL endpoint for the primary analysis.</p><p>CODA was designed to directly inform patient and clinician decision&#x000a0;making in the community, and several pragmatic features were added to make sure it accounted for the diverse aspects of the population, practice settings and practices in the USA. As a pragmatic trial, CODA has limited exclusion criteria and incorporates the many ways clinical care is delivered across sites of practice. The protocol allows patients in either study arm to leave the healthcare setting as soon as standard discharge criteria are met, including the possibility of completely outpatient care. CODA takes place in diverse study sites (academic, private, public, community and county hospitals) with patients from a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including both Spanish and English speakers. This enhances the generalisability of the findings, but may compromise study fidelity if patients in any one group have differential treatment preferences or prove more difficult to contact for follow-up. A downside to this approach is that, by including nearly all patients with appendicitis (including those with appendicolith and radiographic findings of perforation who may be at higher risk for requiring an appendectomy) and those undergoing total outpatient antibiotics (which clinicians have less experience with), there is a risk of subgroups with very different outcomes from the broader population and a skewing of the average study results. Using Thorpe&#x02019;s PRagmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary&#x000a0;rubric for pragmatic trials, the proposed study is considered highly pragmatic, intended to improve the generalisation and precision of decision-making beyond the prior randomised studies.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>The results from the European trials of antibiotics have not significantly changed care delivery in the USA and have been met with resistance, in part due to the evidence gaps cited earlier and concern about the fate of patients with recurrent disease.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> American patients may also have different expectations and resources that influence perception of treatment success and satisfaction with treatments. One particular protocol component of the European trials that may make them less applicable to the US experience is that prior studies all required an inhospital convalescence for a fixed period of time for both treatment arms that is double the length of stay that the average US patient experiences. CODA builds on the successful experience of emergency medicine clinicians to manage patients with potentially serious infections as outpatients using risk&#x000a0;stratification and long-acting parenteral antibiotics (eg, diverticulitis), and its effectiveness will be tested in different practice settings and populations. This novel treatment alternative offers avoidance of hospital admission and may substantially reduce costs compared with surgical treatment,</p><p>Stakeholder input is a key component of the emerging field of patient-centred outcomes research. However, including several types of stakeholders (patients, physicians, payers and purchasers) does not always result in consensus. The selection of an appropriate analytic outcome for the trial was an example. While prior studies focused on clinical outcome (eg, rates of appendectomy and surgical complications), patient advisors recognised that these outcome measures are specific to only one treatment arm (and to people treated with antibiotics who proceed to appendectomy) and that standardised measurements of QoL would be applicable to both and had yet to be rigorously assessed. The EQ-5D has been used in prior studies of appendectomy, but never in comparisons of these two treatments.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Using the EQ-5D as a primary outcome measure was highly relevant to many, but not all, patients. There is a possibility that the primary analytic outcome analysis (non-inferiority of the EQ-5D) could be positive, but other outcome domains might not be aligned. For this reason, multiple secondary analyses and exploratory endpoints have been selected a priori. Evidence in the field of decision-making suggests that patients want information on multiple domains, but we recognise that multiple outcome domains may also add confusion to interpretation of results and implementation in future practice.</p><p>As in all trials, patients are not required to stay in the treatment arms they are assigned to (non-adherence or crossover); for example, select patients in the antibiotics arm might not be willing to receive 24&#x02009;hours of antibiotics and opt for an appendectomy despite not meeting clinical trial protocol recommendations or patients randomised to appendectomy might refuse surgery. While the main analytic approach is an ITT framework, careful as-treated and secondary data analyses may be helpful in accounting for such non-adherence/crossover.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Detry and Lewis recommend both an ITT and a careful as-treated analysis to address crossovers in non-inferiority trials where non-adherence or crossover is present.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> A simple as-treated analysis is problematic because of potential differences in demographic or clinical characteristics that introduce bias in as-treated group comparisons. Our analytic approach proposed involves a two-stage as-treated analysis and potentially will yield conclusions that differ from ITT analysis. However, the ITT results will be considered the primary analysis and are robustly valid since they only depend on randomisation and do not depend on model assumptions required for observational comparisons.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>CODA began recruitment in the summer/fall of 2016 with&#x000a0;eight hospitals in Washington and California with additional hospitals across the United States planned to begin recruitment in 2017. It is possible that not all clinical sites will continue to contribute patients throughout the entire recruitment period (projected to be 3&#x02013;4 years). Substudies and ancillary studies are being proposed to focus on biomarkers, economic analysis, longer-term results and other predictors of outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, the CODA trial was designed to address critical knowledge gaps related to the treatment of appendicitis with antibiotics compared with appendectomy. CODA&#x02019;s stakeholder-informed design and operations, pragmatic design and inclusion of an innovative approach to outpatient antibiotics aim to inform choices in care for this common condition, and planned subgroup analyses allow for improved decision&#x000a0;making.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e717" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016117.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e719" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016117.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DRF conceived of the study and is the primary grant holder.
