Data based on all patients randomised to abatacept who entered the long-term extension to receive &#x02265;1 dose of abatacept, from year 1&#x02013;2 (n=297)* and year 2&#x02013;3 (n=295)&#x02020;.

Of these 139 patients, 135 had evaluable radiographs at years 1 and 2; 68% (92/135) remained non-progressors at year 2. Of the 92 patients with no progression at year 2, 91 patients had evaluable radiographs at years 2 and 3, of whom 76% (69/91) remained non-progressors at year 3. Overall, at year 3, 40% of patients had no radiographic progression from baseline. Cumulative probability plots of the distribution of change in TS over 3 years, at yearly intervals, show an improvement in radiographic progression with abatacept over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D</xref>). The proportion of patients with no radiographic progression increased during each year of abatacept treatment.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s20"><title>Discussion</title><p>Retention rates in long-term clinical trials provide an indication of the likelihood of patients continuing treatment over the long term in clinical practice. In the AIM trial in patients with RA with an inadequate response to MTX, high retention rates were observed over 3 years of abatacept treatment (approximately 70%) with low discontinuation rates due to loss of efficacy and safety. The yearly discontinuation rate decreased during year 3, indicating the likelihood of patients to remain on treatment over the long term.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Retention rates observed in anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy trials have been 61&#x02013;75% over 2&#x02013;3 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>IRs of SAEs, infections, serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune events reported during long-term abatacept exposure (cumulative period for all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of abatacept regardless of original double-blind randomisation group) were comparable with, or lower than, those observed during short-term abatacept exposure (double-blind period). Additionally, no unique or unexpected safety signals were detected with long-term exposure. Although it is considered inappropriate to make cross-trial comparisons of IRs, it may be noted that IRs of AEs and SAEs in this trial were within the lower range of IRs reported for other biologic therapies (such as TNF inhibitors) in similar patient populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> The overall IR of cancer in the cumulative period was 1.5/100 patient-years. This is consistent with previously reported IRs of malignancy in another trial of abatacept in established disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> and in comparator RA cohorts treated with conventional DMARDs (0.67&#x02013;1.77/100 patient-years).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>Improvements in disease status, HRQoL, physical function and radiographic inhibition were sustained over 3 years in a high proportion of patients who remained in the study and were treated with abatacept throughout this time. Despite the long disease duration and high disease burden at baseline, one-third achieved DAS28-defined remission and a 70% improvement in signs and symptoms, while more than half of patients had low disease activity by year 3. For DAS28-defined remission, 95% CIs did not overlap at years 1 and 3, suggesting a significant improvement between these time points. In addition, at year 3, nearly three-quarters of patients had achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function, and improvements in the SF-36 (MCS, PCS and all eight subscales) exceeded the minimum clinically important difference of 3 units.</p><p>Increasing inhibition of radiographic progression with abatacept treatment has previously been reported for each year of treatment over 2 years in the present study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Mean change in TS was reduced by approximately 50% in year 2 relative to year 1; further significant inhibition was observed at year 3 relative to year 2. Importantly, the majority of patients with no radiographic progression at year 2 remained free from progression at year 3. Evaluation of changes in radiographic progression by cumulative probability shows that the proportion of patients who showed either no radiographic deterioration or some improvement increased during each year of abatacept treatment.</p><p>LTE studies should be considered in the context of their limitations, as recently highlighted by Buch <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> In this study, baseline demographics, although typical for this type of analysis, indicate a population with more active disease than is generally observed in clinical practice. Additionally, efficacy analyses were based on as-observed analyses, which are vulnerable to the drop-out of patients who respond less well to treatment. However, discontinuations during the LTE of this trial were relatively low, and only 3.7% of patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, these data show that abatacept has an increasing disease-modifying effect on structural damage over time in the majority of patients who remain on treatment. Combined with the sustained clinical benefits, high patient retention rate and consistent safety profile observed over 3 years, these data support the long-term use of abatacept in patients with an inadequate response to MTX. This population continues to be monitored in the LTE of this trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Medicus International for their editorial assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold> This study and the editorial support provided were funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests</bold> JMK has received research grants from Abbott, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Centocor, Genentech, Merck, Pfizer, Roche and Human Genome Sciences and consulting fees from Abbott, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Centocor, Genentech, Merck, Pfizer and Roche.
