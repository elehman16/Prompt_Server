HIV is a retrovirus&#x02014;its genetic blueprint is made of ribonucleic acid (RNA). HIV infects human immune system cells and destroys them, leaving infected individuals susceptible to other infections. Early during the AIDS epidemic, most HIV-positive people died within ten years of infection. Then, in 1996, effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) was developed. ART consists of combinations of drugs that prevent viral replication by inhibiting essential viral enzymes such as reverse transcriptase (the enzyme that makes a DNA copy of the viral RNA; a viral enzyme called integrase inserts this DNA copy into the host cell DNA where it remains dormant until the host cell is activated) and protease (an enzyme needed for the production of new viral particles, which are released into the blood stream). Now, in industrialized countries, the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients treated with ART is similar to that of people with diabetes and other chronic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s5a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Although ART can reduce the number of viral RNA copies in the plasma (the liquid portion of blood) of HIV-positive patients to less than 50 copies/mL (the limit of detection of commercial assays), it is does not eradicate HIV. When very sensitive assays are used to detect viral RNA (for example, the &#x0201c;single copy assay&#x0201d; or SCA), most patients on ART have one copy or more of HIV RNA per mL of plasma. The origin of this low-level residual viremia (virus in the blood) is controversial. Residual viremia could arise from ongoing cycles of viral replication, in which case intensification of ART should reduce it. Alternatively, residual viremia could be due to HIV release from stable reservoirs such as latently infected resting immune system cells, in which case intensification of ART should have no effect on residual viremia. In this randomized, controlled trial (a study in which randomly selected groups of patients are given different treatments and the effects of these treatments compared), the researchers assess whether the addition of raltegravir (a drug that inhibits HIV integrase) to standard ART has any effect on residual viremia.</p></sec><sec id="s5a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled 53 HIV-positive patients who had been receiving ART containing several reverse transcriptase inhibitors and, in some cases, a protease inhibitor for at least 12 months and who had a plasma HIV RNA level below 50 copies/mL but detectable viremia by SCA. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either raltegravir or a dummy drug (placebo) in addition to their normal ART for 12 weeks. They were then crossed-over (swapped) to the other therapy for a further 12 weeks. At baseline, the trial participants had an average plasma HIV RNA level of 1.7 copies/mL. The HIV RNA level at weeks 10/12 (the average of SCA results at 10 and 12 weeks) was similar in the raltegravir group and in the placebo group and did not differ significantly from this baseline level. There was also no significant change in plasma HIV RNA levels from weeks 10/12 to weeks 22/24 after the patients crossed-over between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="s5a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>In this randomized, cross-over study, raltegravir intensification of ART for 12 weeks did not demonstrably reduce low-level residual viremia in HIV-positive patients receiving standard ART. It is possible that 12 weeks is too short a time to see an effect of raltegravir on residual viremia. Furthermore, although this is one of the biggest trials of this type done to date, it might be that insufficient patients were included in the trial to detect a subtle effect of raltegravir on residual viremia. Nevertheless, these findings argue against the hypothesis that residual viremia arises from ongoing cycles of viral replication and the infection of new cells. Instead, they suggest that residual viremia might be due to the release of HIV from stable reservoirs. If so, new therapeutic strategies designed to eliminate these reservoirs of latently infected cells will be required to cure HIV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s5a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000321">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000321</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the US National Institute of Allergy and infectious diseases on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/Pages/Default.aspx">HIV infection and AIDS</ext-link>, and on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/Treatment/Pages/default.aspx">treatment of HIV</ext-link>

In fact, using a real-time PCR assay that detects a single copy of HIV-1 RNA, more than 80&#x00025; of patients on combination ART had viremia of one copy/mL or more <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Maldarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This residual viremia does not measurably decay after up to 7 years of ART <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The causes and clinical implications of persistent low-level viremia in patients on ART are controversial (reviewed in <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Coiras1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>). Residual plasma viremia may arise from ongoing cycles of viral replication and infection of new cells, virus release from stable reservoirs, or both. If persistent viremia in patients who are receiving ART is mainly due to viral replication, intensifying therapy by adding a new, potent antiretroviral drug that blocks new cycles of replication should reduce residual viremia and prevent repletion of viral reservoirs, a crucial step toward HIV-1 eradication. Alternatively, if residual viremia is primarily due to HIV-1 release from stable reservoirs, such as latently infected resting CD4 memory cells or other long-lived cells, then treatment intensification with drugs that block only new cycles of viral replication would not be expected to reduce persistent viremia. Indeed, prior intensification studies of patients on suppressive three-drug antiretroviral regimens did not observe reductions in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels after the addition of antiretroviral drugs that block new replication cycles, including inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (RT), protease, and integrase <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Dinoso1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000321-McMahon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, these studies were small, single-arm trials of short duration that were not randomized or placebo-controlled and had limited power to detect changes in residual viremia. Larger, randomized, and placebo-controlled trials are needed to more definitely assess the impact of treatment intensification on residual viremia.</p><p>Raltegravir, the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved HIV-1 integrase inhibitor, is an attractive agent to study the effects of treatment intensification on residual viremia. The drug is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Steigbigel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000321-Lennox1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and blocks the virus through a mechanism different from those of other commonly prescribed antiretroviral medications, such as RT and protease inhibitors. If low-level residual viremia is the result of incomplete inhibition of HIV-1 replication by RT and protease inhibitors, then blocking a third viral enzyme with raltegravir might reduce HIV-1 RNA levels.</p><p>To assess whether raltegravir intensification lowers residual viremia in patients on combination ART, we conducted a multi-center randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group study A5244).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The NCT number for this study is NCT00515827.</p><p>The main inclusion criteria for the study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000321.s001">Text S1</xref>) were: (1) HIV-1 infected adults receiving ART for at least 12 months with two or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and either a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI); (2) plasma HIV-1 RNA levels below limits of detection for &#x02265;6 months using commercial assays; and (3) CD4 cell count &#x02265;200/mm<sup>3</sup>. Participants were also required to have documentation of a pre-ART HIV-1 RNA level of &#x0003e;100,000 copies/mL because detectable residual viremia is more likely in individuals with higher pre-treatment HIV-1 RNA levels <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Maldarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

The quantification limit is determined by the volume of plasma tested.

From prior data on assay and biologic variation in residual HIV-1 RNA levels <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Maldarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, we estimated that 18 evaluable participants in each treatment group would provide 80&#x00025; power to detect a 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> difference (1 standard deviation effect size) in the HIV-1 RNA level at weeks 10/12 between the two treatment groups using a Wilcoxon rank-sum two-sided test at a 0.05 level. We increased the target enrollment to 25 in each group with the expectation that some participants would discontinue study drug prior to week 12 and that treatment intensification might increase the proportion of participants who have HIV-1 RNA levels below the LLQ by SCA at weeks 10/12, which would affect statistical power. When averaging the week 10 and 12 measurements, if one or both measurements were below the SCA lower assay limits, the LLQ was used to compute the average and the primary endpoint was treated as below the averaged value. The primary endpoint was analyzed using the censored-data version of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which accommodates the fact that participants had different SCA lower limits due to varying plasma volumes. For analyses of secondary endpoints (such as the change in HIV-1 RNA value by SCA, CD4 and CD8 cell counts, and activation markers), treatment arms were compared using exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous endpoints or Fisher's exact tests for proportions. The within-participant effect of intensification was tested by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Hodges and Lehmann method. Associations between responses and predictors were assessed using rank-based Spearman correlations. Reported <italic>p</italic>-values were two-sided without adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>One hundred twenty-five patients were screened for the study, of whom 75 (60&#x00025;) had detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA by SCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000321-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Fifty-three patients from 19 different clinical research sites enrolled in the randomized clinical trial.

Although there was a trend toward an increased CD4 cell count during the period of raltegravir intensification, this change was not associated with an effect of raltegravir on T cell activation. CD4 and CD8 cell activation levels in blood, as determined by the percentage of CD38&#x0002b;/HLA-DR&#x0002b; cells, were not associated with the baseline level of residual viremia, and we did not find evidence that raltegravir intensification reduced T cell activation by this measure.</p><p>The findings of this study are consistent with the results of two smaller, single-arm trials. In a study of treatment intensification with 4&#x02013;8 weeks of efavirenz, atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir in nine HIV-1 infected patients, there was no effect of adding the additional agent on HIV-1 RNA level measured by SCA <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Dinoso1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Similarly, in a study of ten patients, there was no reduction in HIV-1 RNA level during 4 weeks of raltegravir intensification <xref rid="pmed.1000321-McMahon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In contrast, an earlier trial found that adding abacavir reduced the level of HIV-1 RNA in patients receiving indinavir plus efavirenz: of five patients with detectable viremia on this two-drug regimen, four had a decline in viral RNA level after adding abacavir <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Havlir1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, the two-drug regimen of indinavir plus efavirenz in this trial may not have blocked viral replication as effectively as current three-drug combination ART, which could explain why adding an agent lowered HIV-1 RNA in the early study but not in more recent treatment intensification trials. The results of the current trial are also consistent with other studies which find that there is no evidence for substantive HIV-1 replication in patients on three-drug combination ART, as assessed by the absence of viral evolution and the lack of accumulation of drug resistance mutations <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Sedaghat1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000321-Kieffer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>A recently published study of raltegravir intensification has been interpreted as showing that ongoing viral replication occurs in a subset of patients on combination ART. Buzon et al. found that 13 of 45 (29&#x00025;) patients on suppressive ART who were randomized to add raltegravir had a transient increase in 2-LTR circles&#x02014;an episomal form of HIV DNA&#x02014;which the authors interpret as reflecting persistent replication <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Buzon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although the findings of this study are important and provocative, its implications for understanding the effect of intensification on viral replication are uncertain for several reasons. First, of the 13 participants in whom 2-LTR circles were affected by raltegravir, five had detectable circles even before adding the drug, whereas none of the control patients had detectable 2-LTR circles at baseline, suggesting that the treatment groups may have differed at the outset of the study. Second, patients with prior antiretroviral treatment failure, who might have less complete viral suppression, were enrolled in the Buzon study, whereas such individuals were excluded from our study. Third, it is not clear why only a subset of individuals had an increase in 2-LTR circles. Patients who had an increase in 2-LTR circles may not have been on ART long enough to have achieved stable virologic suppression: individuals who became 2-LTR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> had received suppressive ART for a shorter time (mean 3.5 &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) of 2.5 years) than those who did not become 2-LTR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (mean 5.2 &#x000b1; SD 2.9 years) (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.075). In our study, patients had been on suppressive ART for a mean of 5.6 &#x000b1; SD 3 years (median of 5.5 years). The fact that increases in 2-LTR circles occurred mainly in patients who were on protease inhibitor-containing regimens suggests a mechanistic explanation independent of ongoing full cycles of viral replication, e.g., that the accumulation of 2-LTR circles is related to the stage at which different antiretroviral agents block HIV-1 rather than a reflection of complete cycles of viral replication. Finally, in the Buzon study, there was no effect of raltegravir intensification on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, as measured by a single copy assay; this finding is the same as the result we obtained. The absence of an effect on plasma HIV-1 RNA implies that raltegravir intensification does not reduce ongoing viral replication, unless the virus is replicating in a compartment that does not communicate freely with the plasma. Studies to address this possibility by measuring the effect of raltegravir intensification on important anatomic compartments, such as gut-associated lymphoid tissue, are ongoing.</p><p>In addition to examining the effect of raltegravir intensification on residual viremia, we examined the immunologic effects of this intervention. Because residual viremia might affect immune recovery, perhaps by triggering abnormal T cell activation and increasing activation-induced cell death, we assessed whether raltegravir intensification affected the CD4 cell count. We observed an increase in CD4 cell count during the period of raltegravir intensification. A raltegravir-based regimen was also previously found to be associated with greater CD4 cell count gains than an efavirenz-based regimen in a randomized study conducted in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Lennox1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, the increased CD4 cell counts during raltegravir intensification in the current study did not reach statistical significance and were not associated with a decrease in T cell activation; therefore, the CD4 cell rise may have been due to chance and should be interpreted cautiously. The change in CD4 cell count may be due to an action of raltegravir in a cellular or anatomic compartment that affects T cell homeostasis but does not influence plasma viremia or level of T cell activation in the blood; however, such a mechanism is speculative.</p><p>This study also allowed us to examine the relationship between residual viremia and T cell activation. Persistent viremia might explain the observation that T cell activation remains higher in patients who are receiving therapy and have HIV-1 RNA levels of &#x0003c;50 copies/mL than in uninfected individuals <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This persistent immune activation may have important clinical consequences; for example, persistent T cell activation is associated with lower CD4 cell count increases in patients receiving ART <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000321-Goicoechea1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000321-Gandhi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Hsue1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> or premature immunosenescence. If residual viremia is inducing T cell activation, one might expect a correlation between the level of viremia and extent of activation. However, in those participants who had detectable residual viremia, we did not find any associations between HIV-1 RNA level at study entry and markers of T cell activation. In addition, raltegravir intensification did not clearly decrease immune activation in the blood, as measured by the percentage of T cells that express CD38 and HLA-DR.</p><p>There are some potential limitations of our study. First, the duration of raltegravir intensification was 12 weeks, which may not have been long enough to see an effect of the agent on very long-lived reservoirs. However, if residual viremia arises from new cycles of infection, as opposed to release of virus from stable reservoirs, we would expect to detect an effect on HIV-1 RNA within the 12-week period of intensification. If there is ongoing HIV-1 replication, one would expect that both short- and long-lived cells would be infected&#x02014;it seems implausible that new infection would only occur in long-lived cells&#x02014;and, therefore, blocking infection of short-lived cells by adding raltegravir should reduce plasma viremia within a 12-week period. The absence of such an effect argues that residual plasma viremia does not primarily arise from complete cycles of HIV-1 replication and infection of new cells. A second limitation of our study is that the low HIV-1 RNA levels at study entry limit the ability to detect declines after intensification; as a result, our findings do not completely exclude the possibility that ongoing cycles of HIV-1 replication contribute to residual viremia. However, if adding raltegravir substantially reduced HIV-1 replication and residual viremia, we would expect that a higher proportion of patients would have HIV-1 RNA levels below the detection level of the single copy assay during intensification; we did not see such an effect. Finally, as noted above, we cannot exclude the possibility that there is ongoing viral replication in a compartment or compartments that do not contribute to plasma viremia and do not affect the level of T cell activation in blood. Studies of HIV-1 replication in other compartments, such as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, are required to exclude this possibility.</p><p>This study also has several strengths. First, unlike previous single-arm intensification studies, we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial, which limits confounding. Second, this study has a longer period of intensification than a recently published trial that examined the effect of 4 weeks of raltegravir intensification <xref rid="pmed.1000321-McMahon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Third, the sample size of the current study allows us to potentially detect smaller effects of intensification on HIV-1 RNA, CD4 cell counts and immune activation than previous smaller single-arm studies could discern. We were able to exclude, with 95&#x00025; confidence, a median reduction in HIV-1 RNA during raltegravir intensification of more than 0.5 copies/mL in our population. Finally, the cross-over design of the current study made it possible to conduct within-group comparisons of HIV-1 RNA levels before and after raltegravir intensification; the lack of an effect when the drug was either added or subtracted from the regimen strengthens confidence in our results.</p><p>In conclusion, in this randomized, double-blind cross-over study, 12 weeks of raltegravir intensification was not found to reduce low-level plasma viremia in patients on currently recommended ART. This finding argues against the hypothesis that ongoing, complete cycles of viral replication and integration are the main source of residual viremia. These results suggest that treatment intensification with raltegravir is unlikely to lead to eradication of HIV-1 infection, and that new therapeutic strategies to eliminate cellular or anatomic reservoirs will be required to cure HIV-1 infection <xref rid="pmed.1000321-Coiras1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000321-Richman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000321.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Study protocol.</p><p>(0.63 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000321.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000321.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000321.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the members of the ACTG 5244 team, including Randi Leavitt, Barbara Philpotts, Betty A.
