Demineralization by standardised HEC-gel, pH 4.7 at 37&#x000b0;C for 72 h, was alternated by rinsing in remineralization solution, pH 7.0 at 37&#x000b0;C for 72 h, total challenge time 432 h. The negative control group N was treated during remineralization cycles with saline; positive control group P was treated with remineralization solution; experimental group D1 was exposed to remineralization solution containing Denttabs<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-tablets with 1450 ppm F; experimental group D2 was exposed to remineralization solution and Denttabs<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-tablets with 4350 ppm F.

In the last decade many questions have been raised on the bioavailability of fluoride in oral fluids, and new formulations with different fluoride content are under investigation. Recently it has been demonstrated that elevated fluoride products enhance remineralization of advanced bovine enamel lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the long or even life long presence of the human dentition combined with dietary influences and individual tooth brushing habits may lead to the risk of erosive and/or abrasive lesions of enamel and especially of root dentin. It was therefore the aim of the development of an oral hygiene agent in tablet form to increase the fluoride availability in oral fluids and to substitute the abrading effect of many traditional toothpastes by a polishing action due to microcrystalline hydroxyethyl cellulose. The resulting product (Denttabs<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Prodentum, Berlin, Germany) is rapidly dissolved in saliva, and the fluoride bioavailability immediatedly after tooth brushing and 10 minutes after tooth brushing is higher (Median 165.2 ppm F<sup>-</sup>) compared to a conventional dentifrice foam/saliva mixture (Median 123.7 ppm F<sup>-</sup>) (Naumova et al., Fluoride bioavailability in saliva after using DENTTABS<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>compared to dentifrice, submitted).</p><p>The oral hygiene tablets have also been clinically tested, and the plaque reducing efficiency was similar to a conventional dentifrice in a field study as well as in a controlled clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The question remained whether an additional fluoride enhancement of remineralization could be expected for an elevated fluoride content of 4350 ppm versus 1450 ppm in Denttabs<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The higher fluoride concentration in 0.33 g tablets is equal to 1450 ppm F<sup>- </sup>per 1.00 g toothpaste as the common amount per application.</p><p>It was therefore the aim of this study to assess the relative efficiency of two fluoride treatments on demineralization and remineralization of human dental enamel in a pH cycling model. Qualitative and semi-quantitative polarized light microscopy of serial ground sections was used to detect the morphology of lesions and to assess the pore volume of de- and remineralization. Polarized light microscopy has been chosen as the method to determine the morphology of the different lesions because it allows distinguishing between the different lesion zones. Also the extent of the different lesions zones could be measured exactly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue</title><p>Twenty three completely impacted human third molars were used in agreement with GLP instructions governing the use of human tissue.

The same methodology including the 3D-reconstruction of artificial caries-like lesions and the assessment of the volume of the body of the lesion has been exploited for testing various toothpastes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and under different pH conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The size, volume and configuration of these artificial lesions differ greatly from the typical characteristics of natural early onset, arrested or progressing lesions. However, the lesion zones in polarized light according to Gustafson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] are the same, and artificially created caries-like lesions are widely used to detect the regulation of mineral deposition and dissolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and to determine the relative efficiency of fluoride toothpastes under pH cycling conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The data of the present study confirm the effects of fluoride on demineralization and remineralization of human enamel. It was found that the demineralization regime over 18 days created advanced caries-like lesions with homogeneous surface zones and high pore volumes of the body of the lesion. The extent was around 200 &#x003bc;m and different from the positive control teeth in pH cycling with standard remineralization solution with a depth around 120 &#x003bc;m.</p><p>The fluoride availability from 1450 ppm containing oral hygiene tablets in the remineralization solution was equal to 96 ppm (one 0.33 g tablet per 5 ml solution) what corresponds to the fluoride bioavailability from a conventional 1400 ppm F<sup>- </sup>dentifrice in saliva immediately after tooth brushing (Naumova et al., Fluoride bioavailability in saliva after using DENTTABS<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>compared to dentifrice, submitted). The elevated fluoride availability from the 4350 ppm containing oral hygiene tablets was 287 ppm what again simulates the bioavailability in saliva after tooth brushing with Denttabs<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>In both experimental groups of teeth the mineral loss decreased tremendously and the different extent of the body of the lesion was highly significant. The lesion depth of the conventional fluoride group D1 was around 70 &#x003bc;m, and the body of the lesion in the elevated fluoride group D2 was even smaller around 40 &#x003bc;m. The translucent zone did not differ in control groups and in the conventional fluoride group D1. However, this zone of demineralizing front was significantly more extended in the elevated fluoride group D2 representing mainly inhibition of demineralization in the inner part of the lesion in contrast to mineral uptake in the outer part of the human enamel lesion. There was also a sharp increase of laminations in close to half of all sections. In contrast, laminations were very rare in the remineralization group with no fluoride, and they were completely absent in the teeth with demineralization cycles only. In natural white-spot lesions laminations are attributed to short or long-lasting periods of different caries challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Ten Cate et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] showed that mineral uptake and loss occur at different depths within the lesions, and they assumed that fluoride-induced recrystallization has made the crystallites larger and less soluble in acid. Our PLM features confirm this hypothesis, and they demonstrate a clear dose response. The marked difference in the mineral structure of artificial incipient lesions, compared to that of sound enamel, gives rise to the phenomenon of simultaneous remineralization and demineralization. Quantitative microradiographic studies after application of higher fluoride concentration showed an increase in remineralization in the outer lesion and a decrease in demineralization in the inner part, resulting in a significant increase in mineral gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It has recently been discussed that with elevated external F<sup>- </sup>levels, the F<sup>- </sup>gradient might be higher, driving the fluoride deeper into the advanced lesion, in spite of the F<sup>- </sup>diffusion being slowed by adsorption onto and reaction with hydroxyapatite crystallites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. According to these results higher concentrations of fluoride are required to prevent the progression of artificial caries-like lesions. Therefore, the F<sup>- </sup>bioavailability in oral fluids simulated by the presented study design plays a significant role in enhancing remineralization of enamel caries lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, remineralization and demineralization of advanced human enamel caries-like lesions were found to benefit from higher fluoride concentrations (4350 ppm versus 1450 ppm) during oral hygiene tablet treatment in a pH cycling model.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
