Previous studies of the pharmacokinetic profile of montelukast have demonstrated that the 4-mg oral granules formulation (in children aged 6 to 24 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>], the 4-mg chewable tablet (in children aged and 2 to 5 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>], and a 5-mg chewable tablet (in children aged 6 to 14 years) provided systemic exposures similar to that of the 10-mg film-coated tablet, the clinically effective and approved dose in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we present pharmacokinetic data from two studies in healthy adult subjects to support use of the 4-mg oral granules formulation of montelukast as an alternate to the 4-mg chewable tablet formulation. The aim of both studies was to demonstrate bioequivalence between the oral granules and chewable tablet formulations of montelukast in the fasted state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The Formulation Biocomparison Study (Study 1, Merck Protocol 090) and the Final Market Image Bioequivalence Study (Study 2, Merck Protocol 183) were both open-label, randomized 3-period, single-dose crossover studies in which healthy adult subjects received a single 4-mg dose of the montelukast oral granules formulation fasted, a single 4-mg dose of the montelukast chewable tablet formulation fasted, and a single 4-mg dose of the montelukast oral granules formulation with food. During the assessment of the effect of food in the respective studies, the 4-mg oral granules dose was administered on 2 teaspoons of applesauce (Study 1) and 5 minutes after consumption of a high-fat breakfast consisting of 2 fried eggs, 1 slice of buttered white bread toast, 2 strips of bacon, 240 mL of whole milk, and 4 ounces hash brown potatoes (Study 2). Within each study, subjects were allocated to one of six treatment sequences using a computer-generated randomized allocation schedule. In both studies, each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 96 hours. Both studies were conducted following regulatory guidelines regarding bioequivalence available at the time the research was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>].</p><p>The protocol for Study 1 was reviewed and approved by Southern Institutional Review Board, Inc. (Miami, FL), and the study was conducted at Clinical Pharmacology Associates, Inc., in Miami, FL between March 26, 1999 and April 21, 1999. The protocol for Study 2 was reviewed and approved by Research Consultants Review Committee (Austin, TX), and the study was conducted at PPD Development&#x02014;Research Triangle Park Clinic in Morrisville, NC between June 3, 2000 and July 7, 2000. All subjects gave written informed consent before any study procedure was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>In both studies, healthy adult men and nonpregnant women between 18 and 45 years of age and within 20% of ideal weight for age and height were eligible. Subjects were excluded if they were current smokers (or former smokers who quit within 1 year before the first study visit), used any prescription or over-the-counter medications within 14 days, or used drugs or ingested food with known activities of inhibiting or inducing cytochrome P-450 metabolism within 30 days of the first study visit. Subjects were also excluded if they had any history of drug and/or alcohol abuse, or had any nonconventional dietary habits. Women agreed not to become pregnant during the study and to use double-barrier contraception methods for at least 14 days prior to the first study visit through at least 14 days following the last study visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>At the discretion of the investigator, subjects were either admitted to the clinical research unit the evening prior to each dosing day or in the morning at least 2 hours prior to the time of dosing. All subjects fasted for approximately 8 hours, except for water, before each dose until 2 hours postdose (Study 1) or 4 hours postdose (Study 2), and remained in the unit until the 24-hour plasma sample was obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Collection, Processing, and Pharmacokinetic Assay</title><p>Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of montelukast were collected in evacuated blood collection tubes containing sodium or lithium heparin as the anticoagulant at the following time points during each dosing period: predose (0) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours postdose. Blood was centrifuged immediately and the plasma fraction transferred to opaque cryotubes that were then covered with aluminum foil (to protect samples from exposure to light) and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until shipment on dry ice to Merck Research Laboratories (West Point, Pennsylvania, USA) for assay. Plasma concentrations of montelukast were determined using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay with fluorescence detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. When a calculated concentration was more than 10% higher than the upper limit of quantitation, the sample was diluted with control plasma and reanalyzed. The assay has a lower limit of quantitation of 3.0 ng/mL for montelukast; sample concentrations calculated more than 15% lower than 3.0 ng/mL (i.e., &#x0003c;2.55 ng/mL) were assigned a value of 0 ng/mL for estimating the pharmacokinetic parameters using noncompartmental methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic Methods</title><p>The primary pharmacokinetic parameters compared between treatments were the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from time = 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>) and maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>). Other pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) and apparent terminal half life (t<sub>1/2</sub>). Nominal plasma sampling times were verified against actual sampling times, with actual sampling times used for determination of all pharmacokinetic parameters. The C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> of montelukast were obtained by visual inspection of individual plasma concentration-time profiles. The AUC to the last quantifiable time point (AUC<sub>last</sub>) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The terminal elimination rate constant (&#x003b2;) for montelukast was determined for each individual by log-linear regression of terminal plasma concentration-time values. The AUC to the last quantifiable time point to infinity (AUC<sub>last-&#x0221e;</sub>) was calculated using the concentration from the last available time point (C<sub>last</sub>) divided by the corresponding &#x003b2; value. AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> represents the sum of AUC<sub>last</sub> and AUC<sub>last-&#x0221e;</sub>. Individual t<sub>1/2</sub> values were determined as t<sub>1/2</sub> = ln2/&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>Tolerability Methods</title><p>Tolerability was assessed by monitoring for adverse experiences as well as by evaluation of physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, laboratory safety tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis), and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using an analysis of variance (<sc>anova</sc>) model appropriate for a 3-period, crossover design containing factors for subject, period, and treatment. Since carryover effect was found not to be significant for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters, the factor was removed from the model.</p><p>A log transformation was applied to the AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>. In Study 1, the inverse transformation was applied to the t<sub>1/2</sub>, and use of the transformed data generally satisfied the assumptions of the <sc>anova</sc> model. In Study 2, however, the <sc>anova</sc> was applied to the ranks of the t<sub>1/2</sub> data (the inverse transformation was initially applied to t<sub>1/2</sub> but residuals from the <sc>anova</sc> model failed the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality).</p><p>Following regulatory guidelines regarding bioequivalence available at the time the research was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>], the formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for geometric mean ratios (GMRs) (oral granules/chewable tablet) for the AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of montelukast were within the prespecified comparability bounds of (0.80, 1.25). The effect of food on the oral granules formulation was evaluated by comparing the pharmacokinetics after administration of the oral granules formulation with and without food. For the food-effect assessment in Study 1, comparability bounds were prespecified as (0.50, 2.00) only for the 90% CI of the GMR (oral granules fed/oral granules fasted) for the AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> of montelukast; the 90% CI of the GMR for the C<sub>max</sub> of montelukast, however, also was computed. In Study 2, 90% CIs of the GMRs (oral granules fed/oral granules fasted) for the AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of montelukast were computed; comparability bounds were not prespecified.</p><p>Study 1 had 89% power overall that the 90% CI for both the AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> would be contained in the prespecified comparability bounds, assuming a true GMR of 1.0. This was based upon approximate within-subject standard deviation estimates (on the log scale) obtained using data from a previous study: 0.119 (ln ng&#x000b7;hr/mL) and 0.23 (ln ng/mL) for the AUC<sub>(0-&#x0221e;)</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of montelukast, respectively. Study 2 had 80% power overall that the 90% CI for both the AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> would be contained in the prespecified comparability bounds, also assuming a true GMR of 1.0. This was based upon approximate within-subject standard deviation estimates (on the log scale) obtained using data from Study 1: 0.187 (ln ng&#x000b7;hr/mL) and 0.289 (ln ng/mL) for the AUC<sub>(0-&#x0221e;)</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of montelukast, respectively, in the fasted state.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject Population</title><p>Twenty-four subjects were enrolled in Study 1, received all 3 doses of study medication, and completed the study.

Determination of bioequivalence between the 4-mg oral granules and 4-mg chewable tablet formulations supports the interchangeability of these formulations for use in 2- to 5-year-old patients.</p><p>The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the oral granules formulation was also evaluated in these two studies. In Study 1, administration of a single 4-mg dose of the oral granules formulation with applesauce, a food commonly consumed by young children, had no effect on overall drug exposure, as indicated by the nearly identical AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> values observed when the oral granules formulation was administered with and without applesauce.</p><p>Study 2 evaluated the effect of the oral granules formulation after consumption of a high-fat breakfast. Although it is unlikely that a meal with such a high-fat and calorie content would be consumed by 6-month- to 2-year-old patients, it is generally considered compositionally to maximally affect pharmacokinetics of the drug being evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. Although consumption of a high-fat breakfast had no evident effect on the extent of absorption, as indicated by the similarity between AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> values after administration of the oral granules formulation with and without food, the C<sub>max</sub>, however, was statistically significantly lower (36%) and the T<sub>max</sub> delayed (from 2 to 6 hours) after administration with a high-fat breakfast. Presumably, the rate of absorption was slowed due to the longer gastric emptying time caused by the high-fat content of the breakfast. This delay in absorption should not be clinically important for a chronically administered drug like montelukast, whose pharmacologic effects are more dependent on extent of systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) rather than on maximum peak plasma concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the 4-mg oral granules and 4-mg chewable tablet formulations of montelukast are bioequivalent when administered in the fasted state, supporting the interchangeability of these formulations. Single 4-mg doses of the oral granules and chewable tablet formulations of montelukast are generally well tolerated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Jennifer Pawlowski for her editorial assistance and submission of the manuscript.
