receiving different exercise programs. [Subjects and Methods] One hundred females with
chronic neck pain participated in this study. They were randomly allocated into 4 groups
(n = 25) on the basis of the exercises performed as follows: strength-endurance exercise,
craniocervical flexion exercise, combination of strength-endurance and craniocervical
flexion exercise and control groups. Pain, disability levels and changes in the muscle
activities of the cervical erector spinae (CE), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), anterior
scalenes (AS) and upper trapezius (UT) muscles were evaluated before and after the
interventions. [Results] After 12 weeks of exercise intervention, all three exercise
groups showed improvements in pain and disability. The muscle activities during the typing
task were significantly different from the control group in all three exercise groups for
all muscles except those of the extensor muscles in the craniocervical flexion exercise
group. [Conclusion] The results of this study indicate that exercises for the cervical
muscles improve pain and disability. The exercise programs reduced the activities of
almost all cervical muscles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic neck pain</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neck pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder that leads to significant disability in the
general population. In a 6-month period, 54% of adults suffer from neck pain, and 4.6%
experience limitations of important activities because of neck problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Borghouts et al. reported that 30% of men and 43% of women
were affected by neck pain at some time in their lives, and that the symptoms became chronic
among 10% of men and 17% of women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
prevalence of this condition increases with age and is greater in women than men<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Musculoskeletal disorders of the neck are very common among office workers. Various factors
have been identified as predisposing to neck pain, such as the duration of computer use,
sustained awkward posture, and prolonged working with a visual display unit (VDU)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
prolonged forward head posture is commonly adopted by this occupational group, and it may be
associated with musculoskeletal disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Biomechanically, sustained forward flexion of the neck results in
increased compressive loading on the cervical spine and a creep response in the surrounding
soft tissues. Also the source of pain is excessive loading of the cervical and shoulder
girdle muscles, especially in low-load repetitive work which promotes over-activity of low
threshold motor units<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other mechanisms,
such as nociceptor sensitization due to intra-muscular shear forces are also considered to
play a role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. These phenomena may
concurrently increase electromyographic activity of the cervical musculature, such as neck
extensor muscles and the levator scapulae. In addition, the superficial muscles of the
neck-shoulder region, i.e., the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene and upper trapezius
muscles, demonstrate increased activities compared to deeper postural stabilizers like the
deep cervical flexors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, several
studies have reported significantly lower maximal isometric strength of both the cervical
flexors and extensors in patients with chronic neck pain compared to healthy controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and one study also found weakness of the
neck rotator muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the activities of the deep cervical flexor muscles, such as
the longus colli and longus capitis, are impaired in persons with neck pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the findings of a
significant deficit in the ability to maintain low or moderate load by the CCF muscles
suggests that head and neck postural orientation is challenged under prolonged or repetitive
circumstances in neck pain patients. The CCF muscles may fatigue prematurely and be
incapable of controlling cranio-cervical orientation. This potentially exposes cervical
spine tissues to abnormal mechanical load<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Indeed, evidence is emerging that persons with neck pain tend to
adopt a more forward head position when distracted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This has been observed despite a lack of postural differences in
erect sitting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, retraining the deep cervical flexor muscles has been
shown to decrease neck symptoms and increase the activation of the deep cervical flexor
muscles during performance of a cranio-cervical flexion test<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This may improve the capacity of the cervical spine to sustain an
upright posture.</p><p>Physical exercise has been recommended as a treatment for musculoskeletal neck
disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. While several studies have demonstrated that pain can to some
extent be reduced by strength training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup> or endurance training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, one study
found no effect of physical training on nonspecific pain in the neck area<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent review showed limited evidence
for the efficacy of physical exercise in the treatment of symptoms of the neck and/or
shoulder due to the lack of high-quality research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. One meta-analysis concluded that there was unclear and
insufficient evidence in support of the benefit of strengthening exercises for neck
pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup> and the relative benefit of
different exercise approaches, such as cranio-cervical flexion of the deep cervical flexor
muscles. Although there is some evidence of pain reduction occurring following
strengthening, endurance or cranio-cervical flexion exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is not known how the training influences the muscle activities
of persons with chronic neck pain during working with a computer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized control trial compared outcomes among 3 neck muscle exercise programs and a
control group.</p><p>Subjects who participated in this study were females, aged between 20 and 35 with a history
of intermittent work-related neck pain lasting for more than 6 months. They worked with a
computer at least 4 hours each working day. The pain level at the time of examination
exceeded 30&#x02005;mm on a visual analogue scale of 0&#x02013;100&#x02005;mm. Subjects were excluded if they had
neck or shoulder pain from non-musculoskeletal causes, demonstrated neurological signs, or
had a history of malignancy, pregnancy, or menstruation at the time of examination.</p><p>This study received approval from the Mahidol University Institutional Review Board and is
in full compliance with International Guidelines for Human Research Protection, the
Declaration of Helsinki, the Belmont Report, CIOMS Guidelines and the International
Conference on Harmonization in Good Clinical Practice. All subjects received verbal and
written information about the study and signed a consent form.</p><p>We used a visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain. The extremes were &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pain
as bad as it could be&#x0201d;. The Neck Disability Index (NDI) used in this study was the Thai
version of NDI developed by Luckumnueporn et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. This outcome measure was translated in accordance with cross
cultural adaptation guidelines. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to obtain
electromyograms of the: upper trapezius (UT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, cervical erector spinae (CE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup> and anterior scalenes (AS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup> using pairs of standard adhesive surface electrodes.</p><p>EMG data were collected during standardized maneuvers to normalize of the EMG amplitude to
maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Each MVC task was performed for 10 seconds and repeated
3 times with 30 seconds rest between each repetition. MVC tasks for the normalization of SCM
and AS were performed in supine lying. The subjects flexed the chin and lifted the head so
that it just cleared the bed and held this position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the UT muscles, the subject performed shoulder elevation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the CE muscles, the subject raised
and held her head 20&#x02005;mm above the bed in prone lying<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neck muscle activities were measured by an 8-channel surface EMG device (Myresearch XP
master edition 1.06.64 program, Naroxon INC, USA<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> 2006) at a frequency of
1,000&#x02005;Hz. The EMG signals were recorded using bipolar Ag-AgCl surface electrodes. Subjects
were asked to sit on a chair with their backs supported in a comfortable position. The EMG
electrodes were attached to the skin with hypoallergenic tape at an inter-electrode distance
of 1&#x02005;cm; the inter-electrode impedance was kept below 2&#x02005;K&#x02126;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects who met the criteria were invited to participate in the study and were randomized
by the slot-drawing method into 4 groups: a strength-endurance exercise group (group 1), a
cranio-cervical flexion exercise group (group 2), a combined exercise group (group 3), and a
control group (group 4).</p><p>The strength-endurance exercise consisted of a progressive resistance exercise program for
the neck muscles, especially the superficial neck flexor and extensor muscles (SCM, AS and
CE). Neck flexion and extension were performed in the supine and prone positions,
respectively, with the head supported in a comfortable resting position. Subjects slowly
moved the head and neck through the total range of motion avoiding discomfort or symptom
reproduction. This exercise program included two phases. The first phase of 4 weeks and the
second of 8 weeks were recommended for initiating a weight program in untrained
individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In phase one, each
subject performed 12&#x02013;15 repetitions with a weight that they could lift 12 times on the first
training session (12 repetitions maximum) and progress to 15 repetitions. They were
maintained at this level for 4 weeks. In phase two, subjects performed 3 sets of 15
repetitions of the initial 12 repetitions at maximum load with one minute rest interval
between sets.</p><p>The craniocervical flexion exercise consisted of a low load exercise for the
cranio-cervical flexor muscles. Subjects lay supine and slowly moved the head to the inner
range of cranio-cervical flexion, guided by feedback from an air filled pressure sensor
placed suboccipitally behind the neck and inflated to a baseline pressure of 20 mmHg.
Subjects moved the head to increase the pressure to between 22 to 30 mmHg; and maintained
this position for 10 seconds in 15 repetitions. The subjects maintained the 10-second
contraction with no pain. Ten seconds rest was allowed between each contraction. The targets
of this exercise are the deep flexors of the upper cervical region, the longus capitis and
colli, rather than the superficial flexors, which flex the neck but not the head.</p><p>The combined exercise group performed both strength-endurance and cranio-cervical flexion
exercises. First, subjects lay supine and performed the cranio-cervical flexion exercise. A
five minute rest was then taken before performing the strength-endurance exercise.</p><p>Subjects in each group performed exercise every day for 12 weeks and kept a log book for
monitoring. Exercise compliance in this study was over 80% in all groups.</p><p>VAS and NDI were recorded before a copy-typing task. The sEMG were recorded in two sessions
during a copy-typing task lasting 5 minutes. After exercise training of 12 weeks, VAS, NDI
and sEMG were recorded again for all subjects. For the copy-typing task, subjects sat at a
standard office desk on an adjustable office chair. They could adjust the chair and desk
before the test to obtain the most comfortable position, but they were not allowed to move
between tasks. The visual display monitor and keyboard were positioned directly in front of
the subjects for the typing tasks. A copy-typing task was chosen over typing from a document
holder to eliminate movement of the head or the need to change head position from document
to screen as needed for eye-hand coordination activities. The copy-typing task was performed
continuously for 5 minutes.</p><p>After finishing data collection, subjects in the control group were advised to perform both
the strength-endurance and cranio-cervical exercises. In the strength-endurance exercise
group, subjects were trained in how to perform deep cervical flexor muscle (CCF exercise)
and subjects in the CCF exercise group were trained in how to perform strength-endurance
exercise.</p><p>The statistical analyses of the data were performed using SPSS version 17.0. The VAS, NDI
scores and the averages of root mean square (RMS) sEMG values were used in the analyses.
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05. One-way ANOVA was used to
identify differences in the characteristics of subjects using VAS, EMG and NDI values before
the exercise interventions among the 4 groups. Two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the
effects of group (exercise groups) and time (pre-and post-intervention) on the outcomes. A
post hoc multiple comparisons test with Bonferroni correction was used to identify
differences among groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristics</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group 1 (n = 25)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group 2 (n = 25)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group 3 (n = 25)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group 4 (n = 25)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.72 (3.11)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.40 (3.54)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.16 (2.96)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.32 (3.11)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.72 (7.76) </td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.56 (9.14)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.40 (5.91)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.28 (10.97)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.02 (7.26)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.16 (4.88)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.88 (5.47)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157.24 (6.41)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.32 (2.43)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.51 (5.51)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.24 (2.72)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.47 (5.93)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are expressed in means (SD) group 1 = strength-endurance exercise, group 2

cranio-cervical flexion (CCF) exercises for the cervical muscles as treatment interventions
for patients with chronic neck pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results were also in agreement with
previous studies that demonstrated that pain can be reduced by strength training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
and endurance training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, general exercises like strength and endurance
training, as well as specific exercises such as cranio-cervical flexion of deep cervical
flexor muscles have been shown to decrease neck symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the neck pain and disability index significantly improved after 12
weeks of exercise intervention in all the exercise groups. This indicates that exercise
caused the changes in VAS and NDI score of females who had chronic neck pain. This result
was in agreement with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup> which showed the same trend of decrease in
NDI score and VAS after exercise interventions. The improvement in pain and disability in
the three exercise groups were not only statistically, but also clinically significant. The
decrease in VAS was 16.32&#x02005;mm in the strength-endurance exercise group, 13&#x02005;mm in the CCF
exercise group and 44.6&#x02005;mm in the combined exercise group. The decreases in NDI score were
13.51 in the strength-endurance exercise group, 15.55 in the CCF exercise group and 13.52 in
the combined exercise group. The reductions in pain and neck disability were significantly
different among the control and all three exercise groups. There was a tendency of greater
reduction in neck pain in the combined exercise group compared to the strength-endurance
exercise and CCF exercise groups.</p><p>The muscle activities during the typing task showed differences between before and after in
all the exercise groups, but there was no significant difference between before and after
the intervention in the control group in both the right and left cervical erector spinae,
sternocleidomastoid, and anterior scalenes. This result indicates that the exercise
interventions caused changes in muscle recruitment during the typing task. The upper
trapezius muscle on both the right and left sides showed a significant reduction in muscle
activity after the interventions in all the exercise groups. There was a trend of increased
in RMS in the control group, which performed no exercise intervention, and there were no
significant differences among the RMS values of the three exercise groups. The subjects in
the control group had RMS values that were greater than those of the other groups. This
indicates that the exercise interventions of groups 1, 2 and 3 had the effect of decreasing
the RMS value, whereas, the control group showed no change in RMS values during the typing
task.</p><p>The mechanisms involved in the improvement in the strength-endurance exercise group might
have been improved coordination, increased motor unit recruitment, an increased firing rate
in each unit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, and an increase in the
number of capillaries in the muscle within 10 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, all of which would have contributed to improvement of muscular
fatigue in chronic neck pain. In the CCF exercise group, the benefits might have accrued
from a combination of improvement in neuromuscular efficiency and cervical motor control
strategies improving the deep cervical flexor muscle. Therefore, the decrease in of cervical
muscle activation seen in this study might have been effected by these combined mechanisms
operating on the neck extensor, superficial flexor and deep cervical flexor muscles.
Moreover, several studies have shown that people with neck pain demonstrate decreased
ability to relax the anterior scalene and sternocleidomastiod muscles following
activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The upper trapezius has
also been shown to have a reduced ability to relax following repetitive arm movements and
has reduced muscle rest periods during repetitive tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study revealed decreases in RMS of the cervical
erector spinae, upper trapezius, anterior scalene and sternocleidomastoid muscles which
might have improved the ability to relax the muscles and changed the motor control strategy
during the typing task.</p><p>This study provided evidence of an exercise effect on the pain levels, NDI scores and RMS
values of subjects who performed exercise for 12 weeks. The results of this study indicate
that pain levels and NDI scores decreased after exercise intervention. The reduction of RMS
after 12 weeks exercise intervention suggests that strength-endurance exercise and the
combined exercise are effective at decreasing the muscle activities of the upper trapezius,
cervical erector spinae (CE), sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and anterior
scalenes (AS) when performing tasks. CCF exercise is effective at decreasing muscle activity
in the superficial flexor muscles. The results should encourage therapists to prescribe
strength-endurance exercise, craniocervical flexion exercise and combined exercise for
patients with chronic neck pain.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it is not possible to generalize the results to the
general population because the subjects were females with chronic neck pain. Therefore, it
might not be possible to extrapolate the results to subjects with neck pain disorders of
other etiologies such as whiplash injuries.</p><p>Further study is necessary to investigate the effect of longer durations of training, such
as 6 months or more, because the muscle activities seen in this study showed no significant
difference among the exercise intervention groups. The effects might be varied in other neck
pain conditions, or in men. Moreover, the severity of neck pain such as mild, moderate or
severe pain may influence the muscle activities after exercise intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cassidy</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Carroll</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><etal> et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The annual incidence and course of neck pain in the
