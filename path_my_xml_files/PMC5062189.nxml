The major responsibility of an anesthesiologist is to provide adequate ventilation to the patient. There are wide variety of supraglottic airway devices available which are used for surgeries requiring general anesthesia, so as to avoid the hemodynamic response associated with endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Once the device is inserted, the cuff needs to be inflated to create a seal around the peri-laryngeal tissues. This is likely to cause tissue enema, venous congestion, and nerve injury.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Depending on the material from which the cuff is manufactured, they may absorb anesthetic gases, which can lead to increased mucosal pressure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In addition, it could lead to the potential risk of aspiration persists with the use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) Classic&#x02122;.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The other second generation newer airway device i-gel&#x02122; is a new supraglottic airway device designed to fit the peri-laryngeal and hypo-pharyngeal structures without the use of an inflatable cuff, made of a thermoplastic elastomer (styrene ethylene butadiene styrene) with a soft durometer (hardness) and gel like, provides a seal in patients with a wide range of anatomical variation. The claimed potential advantages include ease of insertion and use with minimal tissue compression and congestion, airway complications and stability following insertion. A previous anatomical study in cadavers has shown that the i-gel&#x02122; is capable of achieving a good peri-laryngeal seal without the requirement for an inflatable cuff.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It also has features designed to allow a gastric tube to be passed into the stomach.</p><p>As there are very few studies comparing the LMA Classic&#x02122; and i-gel&#x02122; where the device insertion was done by final year postgraduate students under the supervision of anesthesia consultants in a tertiary hospital, especially in South Indian population, we proposed to assess the ease of insertion and hemodynamic changes of these two devices in this population. The primary aim of the study was to compare ease of insertion, number and duration of insertion attempts among the two devices. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the hemodynamic response and SpO<sub>2</sub> during device insertion and during maintenance of general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted as randomized observational study in a Tertiary Teaching Hospital in South India. After getting ethical committee approval IEC/RC/11/66 and written informed consent, 100 adult patients aged between 18 and 50 years of either sex and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II, with Mallampati Grades I and II admitted in our hospital undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia (&#x02264;30 min) were enrolled in the study. Patients with hypertension, obesity, pregnancy and gastro esophageal reflex disease, history of any cardiovascular and renal disease were excluded from the study.</p><p>One hundred patients were randomly allotted into two groups each based on the computer-generated codes, Group A for (LMA Classic&#x02122;) and Group B for (i-gel&#x02122;). Preanesthetic assessment was done for all the patients fasting for 8 h before surgery and premedicated with tablet lorazepam 0.025 mg/kg, the night prior to the surgery as well as in the morning of the surgery, 1 h prior to the procedure, an intravenous access was established and slow infusion of crystalloids was commenced. Noninvasive monitors like electrocardiogram, Noninvasive blood pressure (BP), pulse oximetry were instituted and baseline values of heart rate (HR), BP, oxygen saturation SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded. While preoxygenating using 100% oxygen, intravenous injection glycopyrrolate 10 &#x000b5;g/kg, midazolam 0.03 mg/kg, fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg were administered. The size of the airway device used was decided based on the patient's body weight, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. For the LMA Classic&#x02122;, size 3 was used when the patient's weight &#x0003c;50 kg, size 4 for patients weighing 50&#x02013;70 kg and size 5 for patients weighing &#x0003e;70 kg. Whereas for i-gel&#x02122;, size 3 was used for patients weighing between 30 and 60 kg, and size 4 for patients weighing between 50 and 90 kg. Both devices were lubricated on the tip and the posterior surface as recommended by the manufacturers and the LMA Classic&#x02122; was fully deflated prior to insertion, using the LMA Classic&#x02122; cuff deflator.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced intravenously with 1% propanol (2 mg/kg) (2 ml of preservative free lignocaine 2% was added to 10 ml of propofol). Once an adequate depth of anesthesia was achieved (loss of eye lash reflex), LMA Classic&#x02122; or i-gel&#x02122; was inserted by a final year postgraduate student under the supervision of experienced anesthetist. We ensured the safety of our patients by training the postgraduate students to insert the devices successful on an airway mannequin before conducting the pilot study. Ease of insertion, number, and duration of insertion attempts were assessed by the insertion attempts (&#x0003c;2 attempts - good, &#x0003e;2 attempts - poor) and duration (time from picking up the device until attaching it to the breathing system in seconds). The LMA Classic&#x02122; is introduced by the classic method introduced by Dr. Archie Brain. Following insertion of the LMA Classic&#x02122;, air was introduced into the cuff for a good seal as recommended by the manufacturers. A successful airway placement was confirmed by bilateral symmetrical chest movement, square waveform on capnography.</p><p>Anesthesia was maintained with controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation using oxygen and nitrous oxide (50&#x02013;50%), halothane (0.5&#x02013;1.2%), atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Serial HR, BP, SpO<sub>2</sub> monitoring were done at the time of insertion, 1, 3, and 5 min following insertion and thereafter every 5 min till the end of the procedure and were recorded. Patients were reversed with injection neostigmine 60 &#x000b5;g/kg and injection glycopyrrolate 5 &#x000b5;g/kg. The device was removed when the reflexes were restored and the patient was able to respond to oral commands (eye opening, mouth opening). HR, BP, SpO<sub>2</sub> at the time of removal and 1 min after removal was also noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on previous studies where the standard deviation (SD) of 4.9 in Group 1 and SD of 17.7 in Group 2 mean difference = (Group 1 mean) &#x02212; (Group 2 mean) Mean difference[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] = &#x02212;9.58 duration of insertion attempts.

Saran <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have also observed a similar problem with size selection of i-gel&#x02122; in pediatric patients. The 100% success rate in insertion of i-gel&#x02122; in our study can be attributed to the prior training received by the final year postgraduate students under the supervision of anesthesia consultants in handling the supraglottic airway devices.</p><p>The duration of insertion time was significantly longer with LMA Classic&#x02122; compared to i-gel&#x02122;.

Since no cuff inflation is required in the i-gel&#x02122;, time required to achieve an effective airway was shorter, and does not require an introducer, the device can be simply pushed into place.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The mean insertion time observed by Durrani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was statistically insignificant.
