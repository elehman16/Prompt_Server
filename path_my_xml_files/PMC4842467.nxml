expiration-oriented breathing on pulmonary function and chest expansion. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty healthy male university students were divided randomly into
inspiration-oriented and expiration-oriented breathing groups. Their pulmonary function
and chest size during inspiration or expiration were evaluated and then re-evaluated after
15 minutes of breathing exercise five times a week for four weeks. [Results] The breathing
with mainly inspiration group (BMIG) showed significant differences in chest size during
inspiration (CSI), chest expansion values (CEVs), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) after
four weeks. The breathing with mainly expiration group (BMEG) showed significant
differences in all measured variables except CSI. Comparison of the groups after exercise
showed that the BMEG demonstrated differences from the BMIG in chest size during
expiration (CSE), CEV, and PEF. Comparison of the changes in variables after exercise
showed that the BMEG demonstrated significantly different changes in CSE, CEV,
FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and PEF. The BMIG showed a significantly different change in FVC.
[Conclusion] Although both groups demonstrated improvements in pulmonary function and
chest expansion, inter-group differences were observed. Therefore, inspiration- or
expiration-oriented breathing may be recommended differently according to the desired
outcome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Expiration</kwd><kwd>Inspiration</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Breathing is a physiological function that plays the important role of removing carbon
dioxide and supplying oxygen via the circulation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A number of studies on negative changes in the respiratory system
with advancing age have been published<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. To slow down these changes, deep and slow
breathing via yoga can be helpful; it can also reduce stress, anxiety, post-traumatic
stress, chronic pain, and depression<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This indicates that deep and slow breathing affects the autonomic nervous system differently
from habitual fast and shallow thoracic respiration<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study has also suggested that slow breathing can
activate parasympathetic functions and inhibit sympathetic functions to a greater extent
than fast breathing, which has no functional gain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are many exercise methods for the improvement of respiratory
function, and applying heavier loads to the diaphragm and inspiration synergist muscles can
improve muscle strength and endurance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Exhalation and inhalation exercises as well as combined exhalation and inhalation exercises
can help to improve pulmonary function<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
A previous study has suggested that visual feedback may also play a role in increasing
respiratory muscle activity and pulmonary function<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies on breathing effects and improvements to respiratory
function have been conducted, but no studies have been performed on the differences between
breathing with mainly expiration and breathing with mainly inspiration. Thus, this study
aimed to determine the effects of breathing with mainly expiration or inspiration on
pulmonary function and changes in chest expansion while breathing, and to provide a
foundation for determining which intervention method is suitable for use in lung disease
patients on a one-to-one basis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 20 healthy male university students who were informed about

accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>This study was designed to determine the effects on pulmonary function and chest expansion
values (CEVs) in breathing with mainly inspiration group (BMIG) and breathing with mainly
expiration group (BMEG). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups and the BMIG
performed a 15-minute breathing exercise five times a week up to the inspiratory reserve
volume (IRV), while the BMEG did a 15-minute breathing exercise five times a week up to the
expiratory reserve volume (ERV). The protocol for the breathing exercises was planned
without the need for any devices. The subjects were trained how to breathe up to the IRV or
ERV by a cardiopulmonary professor. After 2 minutes of either type of breathing, the
subjects rested for 1 minute. Thus, a total of five sets were performed. Both groups
performed their exercise for four weeks, and re-education was provided once a week to remind
them how to breathe. If the subjects felt dizziness or discomfort during the exercise, it
was stopped immediately.</p><p>A Cardio Touch 3000S (BIONET, Korea) was used to measure vital lung capacity during
pulmonary function examination. The subjects were seated on a chair in an upright position
during the examination to reduce compensation of the trunk and improve safety. To measure
vital lung capacity, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEV<sub>1</sub>), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured three times and the highest
values were used.</p><p>A tape measure was used to measure chest size after the subjects had removed their shirts,
and a single examiner measured all subjects to reduce rater error. All measurements were
performed in the upright sitting position. Chest size during inspiration (CSI) and chest
size during expiration (CSE) were measured in order to record the CEV based on the spinous
process at the tenth thoracic vertebra and the xiphoid process of the sternum<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed with the measured values to verify normalization.
To compare the results of both groups before and after the experiment, a paired t-test was
conducted. To compare the differences between both groups before and after the experiment,
an independent t-test was conducted. The significance level was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05 and SPSS
ver. 18 software was used for statistical processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After 4 weeks, the BMIG showed no significant differences in CSE and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC,

show improvements in muscle strength and endurance if they are trained in the same manner as
skeletal muscles<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, but can also improve
maximal inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, and pulmonary function<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current study aimed to measure and
verify any changes in chest and pulmonary functions when breathing with mainly inspiration
or expiration was performed, and to propose a suitable intervention and exercise method for
patients with lung disease.</p><p>A comparison of the results in the BMIG and BMEG before and after exercise showed that the
BMIG demonstrated significant differences in CSI, CEV, FVC, and PEF. The results of a study
of 10-week inspiration muscle exercises in patients with multiple sclerosis also showed a
similar result, with increased FVC and PEF<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, breathing with mainly inspiration contracted not
only the diaphragm, which is an inspiratory muscle, but also the inspiratory accessory
muscles, such as the sternocleidomastoid, scalenus, trapezius, pectoralis major, pectoralis
minor, and serratus anterior, thereby expanding the chest<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the BMEG showed no significant difference in CSI,
but did display significant differences in the other variables measured, because breathing
with mainly expiration contracts the rectus abdominis, transversus abdominis, obliques, and
internal intercostals<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There were no significant differences between the groups prior to the experiment, but
changes in the measured variables after the experiment showed that the BMEG displayed
significantly different increases in CSE, CEV, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and PEF, because
breathing with mainly expiration activated abdominal muscles that are not used during normal
breathing. In a previous study, pan flute blowing exercise was more effective for improving
the abdominal muscles than a diaphragm exercise and pan flute blowing exercise<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study of inspiration and
expiration breathing exercise methods that aimed to improve the pulmonary function of
patients with cervical spinal cord injuries showed that the expiration exercise group had
significantly higher pulmonary function in all evaluation indexes (except for
FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) than the inspiration exercise group<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study showed more significant differences in the BMIG,
which is likely to be related to increased chest wall expansion<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also showed
that the change in FVC was significantly increased in the BMIG as compared to the BMEG,
whereas the change in CEV was significantly decreased in the BMIG as compared to the BMEG.
This is likely to be a result of the fact that the subjects used thoracic breathing
habitually and then changed to abdominal breathing. CEVs were measured from the spinous
process at the tenth thoracic vertebra and the xiphoid process of the sternum<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, only the size of the rib cage
was measured. In previous studies, abdominal breathing has been shown to increase FVC<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, thoracic cage limitation, and deformation of the diaphragm<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A typical characteristic of patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is low FEV<sub>1</sub>, which aggravates
quality of life and is an important criterion of lung injuries<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, issues with pulmonary function or chest limitation
in patients should be resolved as soon as possible, and we propose that if a suitable
intervention method is applied according to our study results, treatment will be more
efficient.</p><p>This study has the following limitations. It was not a controlled experiment, and the
observed findings could have been affected by confounding factors such as motivation, the
experimental setting and procedure, and the investigator&#x02019;s conduct. In a future study,
patients with poor pulmonary function will be studied and changes in their pulmonary
function and chest expansion will be investigated according to the breathing methods
described here.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Daegu University Research Grant, 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Powers</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Howley</surname><given-names>ET</given-names></name></person-group>: Exercise physiology: Theory and application to fitness and performance.
