muscular strength of middle-aged obese women. [Subjects] The research subjects were
40&#x02013;50&#x02005;year-old middle-aged women with excess body fat (30%). [Methods] The subjects were
randomly assigned to two group, the experimental group and the control group. The
experimental group performed two types of exercise programs for 16 weeks. Aerobic physical
activity was performed 5 times per week, and anaerobic physical activity was performed
every two days, and the exercise program each day was composed of a warm-up, the main
exercise, and cooldown. The type of exercise focused on walking at a quick pace, and the
intensity of the exercise focused on long periods of exercise at low intensity with the
level of HRmax being 40&#x02013;60%. The weight training, which was useful for beginners, as a
type of kinetic load exercise, was applied with a composition recommended by the ACSM for
muscle fitness (intensity of 40&#x02013;60% of 1 RM and 10&#x02013;15 repetitions). SPSS version 16.0 was
used to analyze the data by ANCOVA and the t-test. [Results] The chest, leg, and abdominal
strengths were significantly increased in the experimental group, and this indicates that
compound physical activity is effective for improvement of muscular strength. [Conclusion]
In conclusion, there were significant differences between groups in terms of muscular
strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Therapy</kwd><kwd>Muscular</kwd><kwd>Strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Resistance weight training was reported to have a positive effect on the reduction of body
fat by increasing muscle tissues; maintenance of muscular strength and increase of fat-free
mass; and reduction of blood lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, emphasizing the necessity of
resistance weight training as an effective method for weight control, controling the
interset rest time during weight training can have a significant have a positive effect on
the change of blood lipid concentration and body construction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Likewise, weight training increases BMR, improves insulin reaction,
increases bone density or prevents its loss, and prevents the loss of muscle mass and
muscular strength resulting from aging, which emphasizes the importance of weight
training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, weight training
is reported to increase muscle strength and transversal area of muscle not only in men, but
also in women who are middle age/old aged. From this viewpoint, it is recommendable that an
exercise program for the safest and most efficient weight loss should be composed of
contents that comprehensively combine aerobic exercise with resistance weight training based
on the person&#x02019;s level. Even recently conducted precedent studies found that compound
training with aerobic exercise and resistance weight training aimed at middle-aged women
with obesity had a positive effect on body composition and blood lipids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study reported
the importance of dietary therapy as well as exercise therapy and stated that exercise
therapy without considering dietary therapy could not reduce body fat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, there have been more than a few findings regarding the effect of compound
exercises</p><p>on middle-aged women with obesity who had experienced health risks due to exposure to
various adult diseases and illnesses, but the number of studies is still insufficient;
further, more specific and diverse experiments and research are necessary with regard to how
dietary exercises and resistance weight training can be mixed into an ideal compound
physical activity program that is suitable for a person&#x02019;s own characteristics. The purpose
of this study was to investigate the effect of a compound physical activity program on
muscular strength in obese women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(%fat)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.5&#x000b1;3.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">154.3&#x000b1;2.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.2&#x000b1;2.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.9&#x000b1;5.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physical activity</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.3&#x000b1;4.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">153.2&#x000b1;2.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.2&#x000b1;3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.5&#x000b1;2.9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The subjects of this study were the obese women.

rate of over 30% obtained using a bioelectric impedance method. The subjects had not
participated in physical activity or training for at least 6 months. They were randomly
assigned to two groups, the experimental group, n=20, and the control, n=20 (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The experimental group performed two types
of exercise programs for 16 weeks. Aerobic physical activity was performed 5 times per week,
and anaerobic physical activity was performed every two days; the exercise program each day
was composed of warm-up, the main exercise, and cooldown. The compound physical activity
method used to reach the objective of this study was determined based on exercise
prescriptions, such as the intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise suggested by the
ACSM (2009) after implementing an exercise load test. The type of exercise focused on
walking at a quick pace, and the intensity of the exercise focused long periods of at low
intensity rather than short periods of exercise at high intensity with the level of HRmax

(intensity of 40&#x02013;60% of 1RM and 10&#x02013;15 repetitions) recommended by the ACSM for muscle
fitness, and circulatory weight training, which was useful for beginners, was also used and
was designed to stimulate the glodbal muscles. In regard to exercise methods, exercise were
performed with 15 repetiions and 2&#x02013;3 sets by each exercise with an intensity of 40&#x02013;60% of
1RM, and the subjects trained for 40&#x02013;50 minutes, with a break of 30 seconds between events

for promoting physical strength in men and women of all ages including children. Weight
training is an physical activity that raises contractible or extensible contraction by using
fixed or adjustable resistance and utilizes free weight equipment including barbells or
dumbbells, or contractible or adjustable resistance machines. Moreover, the effect on muscle
strength of weight training has been shown in precedent studies. Weight training reportedly
results in statistically meaningful increases in muscle strength and muscle endurance
meaningfully in statistics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
statistically significant increase in muscle strength and endurance was also reported in
another study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, weight training was found to enhance isometric muscle function, which
hints that there would be various factors relating to this finding. The improvement of
muscle strength can come with the increase of muscle size as a priority. If no physical
activity is performed for a long time, muscle area and muscle strength decrease rapidly.
Hypertrophy of muscular fibers results from the activation of protein synthesis. Analysis of
the changes in muscles and muscle endurance revealed that training efficiency is influenced
by the difference in exercise intensity with regard to motor unit recruitment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The motor unit of fast-twitch muscle fibers contains more muscle fibers than the motor
units of slow-twitch muscle fibers. Therefore, fast-twitch muscle fibers have an outstanding
ability to add more. It was reported that selective recruitment was not determined by the
locomotion speed but by the power level required by muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the program provided in this study exhibits a
difference in the selective recruitment aspect of muscle fiber, and this phenomenon had an
influence on the change in training effect. This indicates that the change in muscle
strength and muscle endurance caused by resistance training is critically influenced by
exercise intensity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>WW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Change of blood lipid profiles and body composition
