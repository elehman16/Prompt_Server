There is no clear consensus which anaesthesia is associated with less incidence of POD for older patients. We aim to assess whether regional anaesthesia results in lower incidence of POD comparing with general anaesthesia (GA) among older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>RAGA-delirium is a pragmatic, multicentre, prospective, parallel grouped, randomised controlled clinical trial comparing RA or GA for hip fracture surgery. A total of 1000 patients who are 65 years or over and who are having planned hip fracture surgery in nine clinical trial centres of China will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either anaesthesia for the surgery. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of POD at day 7. The secondary endpoints will be the subtype, severity and duration of delirium, postoperative acute pain score, incidence of other postoperative non-delirium complications, quality of life and cost-effective outcomes. Randomisation will be performed at the patient level using computer-generated assignment. Outcome assessors will be blinded from intervention assignment. Assessments will be conducted before surgery, intraoperatively, postoperatively, during the hospital stay, at 30-day, 6-month and 1-year postoperative intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential impact of study</title><p>This study will provide clinical evidence with a more robust methodology to help anaesthetists in selecting appropriate anaesthesia for older patients with high risk for POD.

The aetiology of delirium remains poorly understood, but studies have highlighted some pre-existing and precipitating factors such as anaesthetic agents that may be associated with predispose to POD.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p>Anaesthesia may be classified into regional anaesthesia (RA) or general anaesthesia (GA). GA involves inducing sleep or loss of consciousness and is achieved by either inhalational agents or intravenous anaesthetic agents. RA involves an injection of local anaesthetic inside the spine (neuroaxial block) or around the nerves (peripheral nerve block) to prevent pain in the leg with the hip fracture. Older patients with hip fracture can be frail and often have many multiple medical comorbidities associated with advanced age<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, which places them at high risk of morbidity and mortality after anaesthesia. There is no up-to-date prospective data<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and clear consensus as to whether which anaesthesia can lead to better patient outcomes undergoing a surgery. At present both RA and GA are administered during surgery for elderly people. However, the eventual choice of anaesthetic regimen used is based on the preference and experience of the anaesthetist alongside discussion with the patient and their carers rather than evidence-based decision-making.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recently, a Cochrane systematic review based on six studies including a total of 624 participants claimed no difference in the risk of acute confusional state was found between different anaesthetic regimens. However, current reviews were based on old and low-quality evidence, such as poor allocation concealment, assessor blinding or small sample sizes;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> thus any estimate of effect still remain uncertain.</p><p>Over the last 20 years, the elderly population is growing fast in most parts of the world<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and the number of older people undergoing surgical procedures has increased.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Hip fractures are a global health problem, with over 1.6&#x02009;million patients suffering hip fractures worldwide each year,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> of which 680&#x02009;000 occur among the 70&#x02009;million elderly people in China.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> 50% of total global hip fractures will occur in Asia by the year 2050.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The majority of people with hip fracture are elderly and are treated surgically, which requires anaesthesia.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, no studies have yet investigated the effect of RA and GA on the POD in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery in China. The selection of an optimal anaesthesia regimen that can achieve the ideal anaesthetic effect during operation while reducing the influence on postoperative brain function in elderly patients is a challenge for anaesthetists and calls for a high-quality multicentre clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a pragmatic, multicentre, prospective, parallel grouped, randomised controlled clinical trial with cost-effective analysis.

In both groups, patients will receive anaesthesia according to local practice. The type of medication, dosage and additional pain medication will be based on clinical protocols of each study centre and be documented in detail in the medical record and in the Case Record Forms (CRFs). Experienced and qualified anaesthetists will be designated to perform the RA or GA. Prior to the study, study personnel are trained to follow the study protocol in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) principles.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Recruitment and grouping</title><p>Patients will be recruited through the department of orthopaedics. All possible candidate patients for the trial will be provided with information sheets and informed about the aim of the trial, the treatment allocations, the workflow and the randomisation procedure. Written informed consent will be obtained from patients in the first instance. If the patient is assessed and deemed not have the capacity to provide written informed consent then their legally authorised representative and/or caregivers will be approached to give agreement on behalf of the patient according to GCP.</p><p>During the screening visit (between 1&#x02009;week and 1&#x02009;day before operation), the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed. If all criteria are fulfilled and informed consent is given, the patient will be included as candidates. Trained members of the research team will enrol participants and implement the assignment of participants to either anaesthesia groups according to the centre randomisation the day before surgery. Group assignment will be revealed to members of the anaesthetic team only when the patient enters the operating room.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Preanaesthetic assessment</title><p>After a patient has given informed consent, preanaesthetic assessment will be conducted including demographics, medical history, physical examination, cognitive status, comorbidities, current medication use and assessment of preoperative quality of life.

Data collectors will receive specific training of using of CAM, DRS-R-98, MMSE and other tests used in this trial and will be blinded to the group allocation.</p><p>Premedication for anaesthesia will not be encouraged before surgery. Any medication impairing cognitive function will be avoided.</p></sec><sec id="s2f4"><title>Anaesthesia procedure</title><p>GA group: For patients assigned to receive GA, anaesthesia will be induced with propofol (or etomidate), sufentanil (or fentanyl) and will be maintained with either intravenous (propofol), inhalational (sevoflurane or isoflurane with or without nitrous oxide) through laryngeal mask airway, tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation or combined intravenous&#x02013;inhalational anaesthetics. Iliac fascia &#x02018;3-in-1&#x02019;, femoral nerve block or posterior lumbar plexus block, single nerve block or continuous nerve block are recommended blocking methods.</p><p>RA group: Regional anaesthetic techniques for the surgery include epidural anaesthesia, spinal anaesthesia and combined spinal and epidural, with or without additional peripheral nerve block according to anaesthetist experience. The type and dosage of local anaesthetic depend on anaesthetist experience as well. No sedative is administrated in RA group. Any medication impairing cognitive function, like midazolam or dexmedetomidine, will be avoided in both groups.</p><p>On the day of surgery, data collection will be performed and recorded with assessment of intraoperative and perioperative parameters as well as serious adverse events (SAEs). For perioperative information, data will be collected for duration and types of anaesthesia and surgery, doses of analgesics, sedatives and anaesthetic agents, intraoperative fluid balance, including blood or clotting products transfusion and postoperative analgesic consumption and use of drugs with anticholinergic properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2f5"><title>Postoperative observation and follow-up</title><p>Following surgery, patients will be sent to the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) of each clinical centre for continuous routine vital signs monitoring, they will be discharged from PACU to the orthopaedic ward after they are assessed to have recovered from anaesthesia. Both groups will receive routine postoperative care on orthopaedic ward. Postoperative analgesia such as intravenous, epidural, nerve block analgesia and oral analgesics can be administered, according to the local procedures of each clinical trial site, aiming to maintain a VAS pain score &#x02264;30&#x02009;mm, but any postoperative sedatives will be avoided.</p><p>During the postoperative visits, the primary and secondary endpoints, adverse events (AEs) and SAEs will be assessed and documented, including CAM, DRS-98-R (if applicable), VAS, analgesic use (if applicable), sedative use (if applicable), postoperative morbidity and laboratory results, such as serum haemoglobin, haematocrit, leucocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, serum creatinine and urea concentrations, serum sodium and potassium and serum glucose concentration.</p><p>A daily delirium assessment will be performed for all randomised patients who will be followed up for 7&#x02009;days after surgery or until discharge from the hospital. Over these 7&#x02009;days, daily clinical assessments will be continued to evaluate duration of delirium until the symptoms of delirium are resolved or until the patient is discharged for patients who are delirious while daily assessments are discontinued for patients who are not delirious by day 7.</p></sec><sec id="s2f6"><title>

Previous published incidence of POD diagnosed using CAM ranged from 28% to 50% in the elderly patients (age 65) during hospital stay for hip fracture surgery. Observational studies in China estimated 3-day POD incidences of 11.1%&#x02013;23.3%.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref> Assuming that the 7-day GA Group in the present study will have a similar average delirium incidence as in previous 3-day studies, we adopted a conservative estimation of 7-day postsurgery POD incidence undergoing GA of 26% and a reduction of 30% POD in group RA. Then 441 patients should be needed for each group to give power (1-&#x003b2;) of 0.80 and the significance level of 0.05 (two sided). Losses to follow-up for the primary outcome are estimated to be 10.0%. Thus, a total of 1000 patients will be recruited from the nine clinical trial centres in China.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses will be performed with SAS (SAS Institute) by the statistician team of the trial. Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan will be developed to describe all analyses that will be performed. Data will be primarily analysed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and additional evaluation per protocol will be compared with those of the ITT analysis.</p><p>All tests will be two sided and statistical significance will be considered at p&#x0003c;0.05. All parameters will be calculated and presented with estimates and 95% CIs. Differences between groups will be calculated. Primary outcome (the 7-day incidence of POD) will be analysed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. Continuous secondary outcome measures, if normally distributed, will be tested using Student&#x02019;s t-test, otherwise Mann-Whitney test will be employed. Categorical outcome variables will be tested with a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. The time-to-event data, such as delirium-free duration or discharge from hospital will be tested using a log-rank test. Safety and tolerability data will be summarised by treatment groups and will include the number of patients, the rate of occurrence, the severity and relationship to interventions.</p><p>Possible confounding factors include demography, fracture characteristics, type of surgery and perioperative and postoperative complications. Stratification will act as a fundamental adjustment method for controlling the most essential confounders. Subgroup analysis according to variables relevant to the risk of POD (age, existing cognitive impairment, preoperative delirium) will help to define the risks of POD. Baseline measurements of the outcome variables, together with factors such as age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities and patient preference, will be included as covariates. Model-adjusted ORs between the two treatment groups will be estimated and tested with logistic regression for adjusting baseline measures to compare differences between groups in the primary and in the secondary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>Ethical and management considerations</title><p>The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and GCP. Monitoring will be predefined in a study-specific monitoring manual, and will be conducted by Clinical Research Unit of The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University according to approved standard operating procedures. The monitor will verify the enrolment of patients, check the informed consent forms, verify the source data and entries into the CRF and regularly supervise the progress of the trial to assist the local investigators in conducting the study according to the protocol, as well as to meet regulatory and ethical requirements. In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee, the site investigator will report SAEs to the PI and the IRB of the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.</p></sec><sec id="s2g4"><title>Trial status</title><p>The current protocol is version 1.1. The randomised trial, which commenced in September 2014, is currently in the phase of participant enrolment and follow-up. To date (31 August 2016), 968 patients have been screened and 399 patients have been randomised in this study. Recruitment of patients is about 50% slower than expected, so the recruitment period of this trial will be extended from January 2016 to July 2018.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The RAGA-delirium trial is to allow us to detect whether RA given to older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery is related to a significantly lower incidence of POD. Hip fracture will present a real social and economic challenge as the population ages and the number of fractures increases. Both RA and GA are widely used in hip fracture surgery. Currently available evidence is controversial as to whether GA accelerates the cognitive impairment or whether RA reduces POD. A study examining elective surgery suggests no difference in POD when RA and GA are compared.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, the results require verification as the study was underpowered (n=29 per group).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> A recently published result of a clinical trial shows a contradictive conclusion that the 30-day mortality was marginally reduced for spinal anaesthesia 7/164 (4.3%) vs 5/158 (3.2%) (p=0.57), while at 1&#x02009;year it was lower for GA 20/163 (12.1%) vs 32/158 (20.2%) (p=0.05). Methodological rigour in particular regarding randomisation allocation concealment and assessor blinding of these studies was suboptimal.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The numbers of participants included are insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Large randomised trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>In the present trial, a more robust methodology is adopted to decrease risk of potential bias. First, we are one of the few academic clinical research teams equipped with web-based central randomisation in China.</p><p>Usage of computer-generated assignment to assign randomisation to recruited patients to each group; additionally covariate adaptive randomisation is also possible using the method of minimisation to assess the imbalance of sample size among several covariates.</p><p>Clinical trials display greater difficulty instituting &#x02018;blinding&#x02019;, we require data collectors and outcome assessors to remain blinded to group allocation in order to prevent subsequent differential cointerventions or biased assessment of outcomes to minimise performance bias and a Hawthorne effect.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These measures ensure grouping balance against bias in all the respects except the intervention each group received.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
</p><p>Other strength is the pragmatic and multicentre design. We adopted a pragmatic design with the aim of depicting the outcomes of anaesthesia methods in real-life routine clinical practice which are more representable of clinical practice and producing results that can be generalised. Therefore, the anaesthesia methods for both groups will not be restricted to one or two specific methods in the trial.</p><p>On the other hand, however, the pragmatic and multicentre design may limit the accuracy of measurement of interventions and the plausibility of comparison. Unlike randomised clinical trial for medications, there is variation in interventions performed by anaesthetists in different centres due to the operational characteristics of anaesthesia. Furthermore, there is variability in the surgical interventions performed in various centres due to surgeon variability and numerous other variables. This compromise of sample and result homogeneity could introduce biases influencing both arms, but their effect will be diluted with large sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study will provide clinical evidence on the safety of RA and GA in older patients for hip fracture surgery. We propose to contribute to the emerging literature by developing a more robust pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. The results of the trial are expected to help anaesthetists in selecting appropriate anaesthesia in a specific subgroup of patients and especially those at high risk for POD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e254" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016937.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e255" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016937.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors have made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work, or the acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data.
