As a result of the need to increase efficiency with cost containment, the stress on optimizing operation room (OR) efficiency increased. OR efficiency is regulated by several factors; 2 of the most important factors are anesthesia-controlled time (ACT) and turnover time.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The time required between the end of surgery till extubation is of special interest to anesthesiologists because it is affected by anesthesia agents administrated.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it is essential for anesthesiologists to choose appropriate agents to avoid prolonged extubation to improve the efficiency of OR. In Taiwan, Diagnosis Related Groups has taken a growing part in hospital billing system since 2010, and previous billing system is no longer valid for current anesthesia in the OR. Owing to predetermined payment for each case, the most cost-effective anesthetic technique should be determined. Anesthetic techniques with lower cost and shorter ACT are required to remain competitive in the operating field.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) via a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system with propofol has been shown to provide more rapid emergence compared to other anesthetic techniques in several kinds of surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> There were studies discussing the surgical condition in the field of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) comparing propofol via TCI and inhalation anesthetics.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> However, these studies did not compare the time required for extubation. FESS is one of the major surgeries performed by otolaryngologists in our hospital, so larger amount of data could be acquired. Therefore, we performed this retrospective study to compare the ACT between TIVA with propofol/fentanyl and DES anesthesia in FESS.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (TSGHIRB No: 100&#x02013;05&#x02013;168) of Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (Chairperson, Professor Pauling Chu) on August 29, 2011.</p><p>This retrospective study retrieved information from the electronic database and the medical records of Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH; Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China). A total of 717 patients (ASA class I&#x0223c;III) who received elective FESS under TIVA or desflurane (DES) from January 2010 to December 2011 was included. For the purposes of this study, the following times (minutes) were calculated: waiting for anesthesia time, arrival in the OR to anesthesia was introduced; surgical time, incision to surgical completion and application of dressings; anesthesia time, start of anesthesia to extubation; extubation time, surgery complete and dressings applied to extubation; total OR stay time, arrival in the OR to departure from the OR; postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay time, arrival in the PACU to discharge from the PACU to the general ward; and ACT, arrival in the OR to discharge from the OR. All time intervals were documented as electrical medical records by an OR nurse and were confirmed with the operator and the presiding anesthesiologist. Exclusion criteria were patient younger than 18 years, emergent surgeries, combined inhalation anesthesia with TIVA, other inhalation anesthesia besides DES, failure to extubate, patient not sent to the PACU, or incomplete data.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Patient groups</title><p>No medication was administered before induction of anesthesia; however, regular monitoring, such as electrocardiography (lead II) and measurement of pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), was performed. In all patients, anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl. The patients were then intubated and maintained with the anesthetics DES or propofol and the analgesic fentanyl.</p><p>TIVA was induced using intravenous (i.v.) fentanyl (2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg) and 2% lidocaine (1.5&#x0200a;mg/kg). Subsequently, continuous infusion of propofol (Fresfol 1%) was delivered using Schneider kinetic model of TCI (Fresenius Orchestra Primea; Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany) with the effect-site concentration (Ce) of 4.0&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL. For DES anesthesia, the patients were induced with i.v. fentanyl (2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg), 2% lidocaine (1.5&#x0200a;mg/kg), and propofol (1.5&#x02013;2&#x0200a;mg/kg). When patients lost consciousness, 0.6&#x0200a;mg/kg of rocuronium was administered, followed by endotracheal intubation and administration of i.v. dexamethasone (5&#x0200a;mg) to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (in all patients). For TIVA, anesthesia was maintained using TCI with a propofol Ce of 3 to 4&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL under an oxygen flow of 300&#x0200a;mL/min. In patients anesthetized with DES, anesthesia was maintained using 8% to 12% DES (inhaled concentration) in an oxygen flow of 300&#x0200a;mL/min under a closed system without nitrous oxide. Ce for TCI propofol was adjusted at the range of 0.2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL and DES 0.5% according to the hemodynamics. If 2 increments or decrements were unsuccessful, the range of Ce for TCI propofol and DES was increased to 0.5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL or 2%, respectively. Ventilation rate and maximum airway pressure were adjusted to maintain the EtCO<sub>2</sub> pressure at 35 to 45&#x0200a;mmHg. Cisatracurium (2&#x0200a;mg) or rocuronium (10&#x0200a;mg) was administered as required to antagonize the return of neuromuscular function.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>At the end of the operation, DES or propofol was discontinued, and the lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen at a fresh gas flow of 6&#x0200a;L/min.

These findings were consistent with several of our previous studies showing that general anesthesia using TCI system with propofol could achieve faster extubation than using DES in different surgeries.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>In our study, the average extubation time was 0.8&#x0200a;minutes faster in TIVA group, and the average OR exit time was 0.9&#x0200a;minutes earlier in TIVA group. Although the differences were statistically significant, the time saved may not be sufficient for additional operation. McIntosh et al<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> revealed that each 5-minute reduction in intraoperative time should be treated as reducing costs, and the reduction is approximately 20% larger than the cost per 5&#x0200a;minutes of OR time. However, the reduction of anesthesia related time in OR does not necessarily equal to improvement of OR productivity unless there are sufficient case-numbers to fill a workday. Therefore, the reduction in ACT, as reported in our study, may not be sufficient to schedule additional operation and could be reasonably treated as having no economic benefit.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p><p>We also reported a significant lower percentage of prolonged extubation in TIVA group. Prolonged extubation would decrease OR efficiency and occurred in 15% of all cases.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Therefore, monitoring the incidence of prolonged extubation was recommended as an economic measure.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Because prolonged extubation after surgery would cause slowing of work flow, having OR members staying idly waiting for extubation, and the surgeon have to wait longer for the next operation.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> When surgeons rate anesthesiologists&#x02019; attributes on a scale from 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;no importance" to 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;a factor that would make me switch groups/ hospitals," their average score is 3.9 for &#x0201c;patient quick to awaken."<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Epstein et al<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> studied the relationship between prolonged extubation and OR cost, and concluded that prolonged extubation time should be treated as resulting in proportionally increased variable costs. The risk factors of prolonged extubation including prone position, prolonged surgical time, significant blood loss, larger volume of crystalloid and colloid infusion, procedure, or surgeon. <sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In addition, more than half of the cases with prolonged extubation occurred during cases on regular workdays and in an OR with &#x0003e;8 hours of cases and turnover.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The result was consisted with the previous reports, as we showed prolonged extubation was associated with anesthetic and surgical time. Another study conducted by the same group showed that the mean time from end of surgery to exit OR is at least 12.6 minutes longer in cases with prolonged extubation.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In our study, we showed that the mean time to departure from OR to PACU was 15.7 and 16.6 minutes in TIVA and DES, respectively, which might be because of the paramedical factor.</p><p>The influences of different anesthetic agents and techniques on OR stay time have been extensively studied to provide better combination of anesthetic agents and anesthesia techniques to reduce OR cost without affect patient safety. Propofol has become popular in general anesthesia, especially in the ambulatory surgery or examine procedures. It is often used in combination with remifentanil because both drugs provide rapid induction and emergence with faster recovery of normal activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> However, remifentanil will become available in Taiwan recently, and propofol is cheaper in Taiwan than it is in America or Europe.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Several previous studies have shown that general anesthesia under TIVA by TCI with propofol and fentanyl was cost-saving and achieved faster emergence in both short-term and long-term surgery when compared with DES and sevoflurane anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>Some studies compared inhalation anesthesia with propofol-based TIVA and failed to show any significant clinical difference in terms of extubation.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Dolk et al<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> reported that there was shorter emergence time and reduced drug costs for DES anesthesia compared with propofol delivered by TCI in knee surgery. The differences may have been caused by using nitrous oxide as an adjuvant to anesthetics, which reduced the requirement of DES during maintenance period and facilitate early emergence. Another study reported by Mahli et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> showed that there was no significance in extubation time between propofol-based TIVA by TCI system and DES anesthesia in ear, nose, and throat surgery. The difference might be because of the fact that DES maintenance flow rate of oxygen was different: 1&#x0223c;4&#x0200a;L/min versus 300&#x0200a;mL/min in our study. For the purpose of smooth emergence, we turn off anesthetics later than in breast, gynecologic, ear, nose, and throat and spine surgeries to prevent coughing and straining during extubation; this may take several minutes. In addition, using close circuit anesthesia in the DES group would also prolong the neuromuscular blockade and delay the extubation times.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> The gas flow during emergence may also affect the time of extubation in DES group. As a retrospective study, the cases we collected were performed under routine clinical protocol, using 6&#x0200a;L/min of fresh gas flow during emergence. In our serial retrospective studies<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> TIVA delivered by TCI system has the advantage in predicting the propofol effect-site concentration at return of consciousness.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Moreover, TCI system could calculate the time required to reach such concentration, and therefore improve the OR efficiency. The dosage of opioids may also have an effect on extubation time. Fentanyl 2 to 6&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg intravenous bolus injection is the suggested dose for anesthesia induction. FESS is considered as a less invasive procedure; therefore, we choose the lower limit of suggested dosage for our clinical practice. Finally, we have a much larger numbers of cases (a total of 717 vs. 40 cases), which may decrease investigators&#x02019; bias and reflect the better reality of our clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations. First, retrospective study may lead to bias considering standardization and comparability of study groups. However, considering the purpose of this study, retrospective analysis of data offered a major advantage, namely that anesthetic management was performed by attending anesthesiologist according to clinical demands and was not by a study protocol. The study, performed under clinical conditions, reflects more precisely the clinical relevant benefit.</p><p>Second, hemodynamic profiles between these 2 groups were not recorded and compared in our study. Mahli et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> reported that mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were higher in TIVA group than in DES group. We do not have solid data, but this result differs from our clinical experience, although we use intravenous fentanyl bolus injection rather than remifentanil administrated with TCI system. In addition, in our clinical practice, the fentanyl dosage was higher in the TIVA group than the DES group.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Finally, we did not use anesthesia depth monitors such as bispectral index (BIS) in our common practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Because, in the practice of most anesthesiologists in Taiwan, BIS is not routine used during minor surgeries such as breast cancer surgery or FESS. Moreover, before our collected data period, many studies have suggested an absence of benefit of BIS monitoring during clinical anesthesia. However, in 2014, Punjasawadwong et al<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> concluded that BIS reduced time for eye opening, response to verbal command, time to extubation, time to orientation, and reduced anesthetics requirement. Recently, Stein et al<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> suggested that processed EEG monitors may be a useful adjunct undergoing a TIVA to prevent awareness but the cost was increased. Therefore, the cost effect of BIS still needs to be investigated in the low-risk patients (younger and health patients) who are receiving minor surgery (such as breast surgery and FESS) and short time anesthesia especially in TIVA.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results showed that propofol-based TIVA by TCI reduced the mean time on extubation and reduced the incidence of prolonged extubation relative to DES in FESS. Decreased prolonged extubation may have potential benefit on OR efficiency, whereas the significant statistic reduction of extubation time may not have a clinical effect on increasing OR efficiency in our retrospective study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ACT = anesthesia-controlled time, ASA = American Society of Anesthesiology, Ce = effect-site concentration, DES = desflurane, EtCO2 = end-tidal carbon dioxide, OR = operation room, PACU = postanesthetic care unit, SD = standard deviation, TCI = target-controlled infusion, TIVA = total intravenous anesthesia.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>IRB: The Ethics Committee of Tri-Service General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China) (TSGHIRB No: 100-05&#x02013;168) approved the study</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Institution: Institutional Review Board of Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Address: #325, Section 2, Chenggung Road, Neihu 114, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Phone: 886&#x02013;2&#x02013;87923311Ext.10552,17672,17673</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Email: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="mailto:tsghirb@ndmctsgh.edu.tw">tsghirb@ndmctsgh.edu.tw</ext-link></p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Attestation: Zhi-Fu Wu and Chueng-He Lu.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Attestation: Chueng-He Lu, Zhi-Fu Wu.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Attestation: Zhi-Fu Wu and Yung-Chi Hsu.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Attestation: Tien-Chien Liu and Zhi-Fu Wu.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Attestation: Nan-Kai Hung and Zhi-Fu Wu.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Attestation: Tien-Chien Liu and Nan-Kai Hung.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>Authors&#x02019; contribution: T-CL author helped collect and analyze data, prepare the manuscript, and write the manuscript; H-CL and C-HL helped design the study, conduct of the study, and prepare the manuscript; Y-SH, N-KH, and C-HC helped in data collection and analysis, and approved the final manuscript; Z-FW helped design the study, conduct the study, prepare the manuscript, and is responsible for archiving the study files.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Junger</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Klasen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
