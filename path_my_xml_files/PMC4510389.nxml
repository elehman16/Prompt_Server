We started from the heuristics developed by Nielsen in 1990 and developed a modified set of 15 heuristics. The first 5 heuristics of this set are the same as those of the original Nielsen set, the next 5 heuristics are improved versions of Nielsen's, whereas the last 5 heuristics are new. We present two evaluation studies of our new heuristics. In the first, two groups compared Nielsen&#x02019;s set with the modified set of heuristics, with each group evaluating two interactive systems. The Nielsen&#x02019;s heuristics were assigned to the control group while the experimental group was given the modified set of heuristics, and a statistical analysis was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the modified set, the contribution of 5 new heuristics and the impact of 5 improved heuristics. The results show that the modified set is significantly more effective than the original, and we found a significant difference between the five improved heuristics and their corresponding heuristics in the original set. The five new heuristics are effective in problem identification using the modified set. The second study was conducted using a system which was developed to ascertain if the modified set was effective at identifying usability problems that could be fixed before the release of software. The post-study analysis revealed that the majority of the usability problems identified by the experts were fixed in the updated version of the system.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research is supported by the University of Malaya High Impact Research Grant UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/FCSIT/05 from the Ministry of Education Malaysia.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="11"/><page-count count="27"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autism is one of the five disorders under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which includes autism, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett syndrome and pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It is a neurological disorder characterised by impairment in social communication and restricted or repetitive behaviour, the symptoms of which appear during the first three years of a child&#x02019;s life, and the impairment will take its toll during the later course of life. The behavioural changes caused by ASD may vary from child to child: one may be very verbal, bright and enthusiastic, while another may be non-verbal and intellectually challenged [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Innovation and advancement of information and communication technology have marked the start of the use of technology in the training and development programmes for children with ASD [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These children are visual learners and the use of human-computer interaction (HCI) principles has increased significantly in recent years in the design and development of interactive systems for those affected by ASD [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These days, children look beyond mere usable systems as they are attracted to systems that can provide a more interesting environment and are fun to use. Hence, evaluation needs to be carried out to assess not only the system usability but also user-friendliness and ease of use. There are two types of evaluations: the first is the summative evaluation, which is used to assess the success of systems once they are completed; and the second is the formative evaluation, which is performed during the design and development of systems to ensure they can meet user requirements.</p><p>The focus of formative evaluation is to identify and fix usability issues during the early stage of designing a system, and heuristic evaluation is one of the techniques that falls under the category of formative evaluation. It is an evaluation approach in which an expert applies the knowledge of typical end users and evaluates a system based on a set of recognised usability principles, so-called the &#x02018;heuristics&#x02019;, to find out the usability problems in the system [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This method of evaluation has gained popularity in the community of HCI since it was first introduced by Nielsen in the year 1990 [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the current trend is to develop and evaluate more specialised heuristics for new technologies and systems. Researchers have typically developed their own set of heuristics by modifying Nielsen&#x02019;s heuristics together with design guidelines, market research, requirements documents of a specific product, expert reviews, researchers&#x02019; own experience in the area of research or a combination of these items [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is a need to have specialised heuristics tailored to the interactive systems for children with ASD that can be used to identify and fix usability problems during the early stage of designing a system. However, based on the existing studies, we could not find any specialised heuristics that were applicable to systems for children with ASD.</p><p>In this study, we use the existing guidelines for interactive systems designed for children with ASD and adapt the original set of heuristics by Nielsen to create a modified set of heuristics for these systems. The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: we first provide the details of related work in the areas of interactive systems for children with ASD and heuristic evaluation; secondly, we provide a description of the method used to develop the modified set of heuristics; thirdly, we present the two studies carried out along with their results indicating the effectiveness of the modified set, and finally the paper is concluded with discussions on the findings of this research.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Related Work</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1. Interactive systems for children with ASD</title><p>The challenge of caregivers of children with ASD is helping them to attain the goal of living a happy and satisfying life [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Education plays a vital role in achieving this goal as &#x0201c;there is no known cure for autism &#x02026; it is important to view autism as one form of mental disability that will require special teaching and guidance rather than a psychiatric illness requiring therapy&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Interactive systems for children with ASD are defined as systems that respond in real-time and in a personalised manner by understanding the behaviours of each child [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is a software-based solution that engages the interest of children in a comprehensively designed system focusing on specific behaviours. At present, the applications of interactive systems have been proven to change the lives of children with ASD [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The outcomes evidently show that the employment of these systems helps the affected children to interact, socialise, communicate and learn in novel ways. Various reviews [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have been carried out on teaching different skills to children with ASD by using interactive systems. Nearly all the studies in the above-mentioned reviews demonstrated improvement in the learning of these children after they had used the interactive systems. In this paper, our emphasis is to create a specialised set of heuristics to meet the purpose of formative evaluation of interactive systems for children with ASD so that an engaging system can be developed.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2. Heuristic evaluation</title><p>Jakob Nielsen in collaboration with Rolf Molich, developed a set of 10 usability principles called heuristics to evaluate if elements present in a user interface, for instance menu, dialogue boxes, help, etc., follow the principles [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. He named them heuristics because they resembled the rule of thumb rather than a set of user interface guidelines. This technique is based on the inspection in which evaluators are given some scenarios and are asked to explore the given interface using an identified set of 10 heuristics [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Practitioners had reported that heuristic evaluation allowed them to discover significant numbers of problems during various stages of design processes [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, it is also an inexpensive and a formative technique to evaluate interfaces. One of the advantages of using this usability inspection is the flexibility to adapt a predefined set of heuristics for a specialised domain [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The purpose of having these adapted heuristics is to discover usability problems in a system from the domain-specific perspective and fix them before end users start interacting with it. Researchers have adapted and created a specialised set of heuristics for various domains, and a brief description is as the following. In their research, Mankoff et al. [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] carried out informal surveys and pilot studies with the experts and created a modified set of heuristics for ambient displays. Baker et al. [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] created a new set of heuristics to evaluate collaborative technologies based on an existing framework called mechanics of collaboration [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This framework covers small-scale actions and interactions that group members must perform in order to get a task done in a collaborative fashion. Clarkson and Arkin [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] created a list of heuristics for human-robot interaction; they came up with an initial list of heuristics via brainstorming and synthesising the existing lists of potential heuristics. They also conducted pilot studies, consulted other domain experts, and used other informal techniques to finalise the initial heuristics. Kientz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] developed a set of derived heuristics for persuasive health technologies by reviewing the existing usability guidelines and related heuristics. Pinelle et al. [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also used a similar approach to create heuristics for video games.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Method</title><p>In this research, we selected the existing guidelines in designing the interactive systems for children with ASD and used the heuristics of Nielsen to create a specialised set of heuristics for the evaluation of systems for these children. The user interface of an interactive system for children with ASD is important in the overall success of the system; the review of guidelines can reveal various guidelines which play a vital role in the design of user interface for these children.

Compilation of guidelines</title><p>A search on guidelines related to the design and development of interactive systems for children with ASD was carried out in different bibliographic databases; however, the search was restricted to research articles, dissertations, books and technical essays. Researchers of various studies had recommended guidelines for the design and development of systems for children with ASD, based on their research work on ASD. We compiled a list of the guidelines recommended by the researchers of the reviewed studies, three of which were found to meet our criterion. These relevant studies had used different terminologies (characteristics, features, or guidelines) in the design of systems for children with ASD.

Winograd [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] discussed 8 guidelines for designing a learning environment for children with ASD. Lastly, 18 guidelines were discussed in [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] on designing an application for children with ASD.

We calculated the average mean values to obtain the Light&#x02019;s Kappa as the final consistency index involving all the experts. The resulting kappa indicates a fair consistency (p-value &#x0003c; .05, k = .4), and this is in line with the estimates of IRR obtained from the coding of similar constructs in previous studies. The strong consistency (on answer = 1, i.e. &#x02018;Agree&#x02019;) is found among the experts for heuristics 10 and 11. The consistency is reduced by a modest amount of error variance due to difference in the rating of different experts: i) heuristics 5, 6, 14 and 15 for question 1, ii) heuristic 14 for question 2 and iii) heuristic 15 for question 3.

During the evaluation, for each heuristic, participants were asked to write a brief description of all the problems related to that category together with severity ratings between 0 and 4, where 0 corresponded to &#x02018;not a problem&#x02019;; 1, &#x02018;cosmetic problem&#x02019; and 4, &#x02018;usability catastrophe&#x02019;.</p></list-item></list>

Since the number of problems identified by the 10 experts in all the heuristics involved ratio variables, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was used to measure the consistency of the experts. Unlike Kappa, which quantifies IRR based on agreement or no agreement among the experts, the ICC considers the difference between the values of consistencies among the experts to compute the IRR estimate. This indicates that a lower difference among the experts, i.e. low inconsistency will result in a higher value of ICC while a larger difference, i.e. high inconsistency will result in a lower value of ICC.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>5.4.2.

Hypothesis to analyse effectiveness of the modified set</title><p>The following three hypothesis tests were conducted to statistically validate the outcomes from Section 5.4.2.

</p><p>H1 &#x02013;The modified set of heuristics is more effective than the original set in problem identification: The heurisitics of the modified set were compared with the heusitics in the original set using a form of repeated measure. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test the differences between the modified and original set of heuristics. The test of differences between groups of heuristics was conducted repeatedly while the other conditions such as the systems and the experts remained the same and hence, we applied the Split-plot ANOVA (SPANOVA). The SPANOVA is used to test the differences between two or more independent groups whilst subjecting participants are repeatedly measured [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There are certain assumptions that needs to be taken into account when performing SPANOVA test:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Each sample is independently and randomly selected.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The distribution of the response variables follows a normal pattern.

The significance of results is checked through P-value at the level of 0.05.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>SPANOVA involves modelling of data using a linear model [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] which is implemented in statistical packages such as SPSS.</p><p>The heuristics in both the original and modified sets have been grouped as following for the purpose of statistical analysis:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>First 5 heuristics in the original set</p></list-item><list-item><p>Second 5 heuristics in the original set</p></list-item><list-item><p>First 5 heuristics in the modified set</p></list-item><list-item><p>Second 5 heuristics in the modified set (improved heuristics)</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We used SPANOVA to examine the rate of problem identification by 4 independent groups under the same conditions (systems and experts). For this hypothesis, Groups 1 and 2 were merged and termed the &#x02018;original set&#x02019; while Groups 3 and 4 were merged and termed the &#x02018;modified set&#x02019;.</p><p>H2 &#x02013;The 5 improved heuristics in the modified set will be able to identify a higher number of usability problems than the corresponding heuristics in the original set: The analysis of the 5 improved heuristics was based on the same variables from Section 5.4.3 and groups formed in H1; the SPANOVA test was used to examine the rate of problem identification between Groups 2 and 4.</p><p>H3 &#x02013;The 5 new heuristics will contribute to the identification of problems using the modified set: A repeated measurment test was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the five new heuristics. In the pre-test, we measured the problems which were identified by the original set as well as the first ten heuristics of the modified set (five original and five improved heuristics). In the post-test, we measured the problems identified by all the fifteen heuristics of the modified set. The pre-post test anlysis would reveal the effectiveness and contribution of the five new heuristics in the overall problem identification. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to create a model of data and a mediated method [<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0132187.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to prove the effectiveness of the new heuristics. For the mediated method, the model as shown in <xref rid="pone.0132187.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> is analysed with the assumption a = 0 (null-hypothesis), where a is the degree of effect of the new huristics on the post-test.

The average severity ratings of all the problems in both of the systems by the control group show that they are minor, whereas the average severity ratings of the problems found by the experimental group show that most of the problems are major.</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>5.5.3.

The frequently violated heuristics include responsiveness, consistency, minimalist and control. Responsiveness heuristic was more frequently violated than the remaining four heuristics of the modified heuristics. This finding indicates that the response of the systems is important to keep the attention of users; otherwise, they may be distracted by other interactive systems installed on the computer. There are various inconsistencies in the systems that may distract the users, and this is evidenced by the number of times the heuristic was violated. Another frequently violated heuristic is minimalist. The analysis of problems related to this heuristic shows that there are a few places in the systems where the users are shown a lot of unnecessary information. These children could be overwhelmed by the large amount of information, which might slow them down in using the systems. The analysis of the control heuristic shows users could not move freely from one part to another in the systems or repeat activities as many times as they like.
