Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have become widely adopted as effective and well-tolerated glucose-lowering agents since the introduction of sitagliptin in 2006 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A potential association between DPP-4i treatment and pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer was suggested in 2009, based on studies in rats carrying the human islet amyloid polypeptide transgene treated with sitagliptin, in which increased pancreatic ductal turnover, ductal metaplasia, and isolated pancreatitis were observed (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although subsequent preclinical studies have not confirmed this finding (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), this potential association has triggered intense interest and clinical assessment. Pharmacovigilance efforts, epidemiological studies, and meta-analysis of randomized control studies with DPP-4is have suggested a small increase in or no increased risk of pancreatitis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) or pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but they all have methodological limitations.</p><p>The Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) assessed the long-term cardiovascular safety of adding sitagliptin to usual care, compared with usual care alone, in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease during a 3-year median follow-up period (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). We describe the presentation, features, and incidence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer cases confirmed in TECOS, and perform a meta-analysis of these events with two recently reported DPP-4i cardiovascular safety trials, the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus&#x02014;Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 trial (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and the Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>The TECOS study (Clinical trial reg. no. NCT00790205, clinicaltrials.gov) rationale and design (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) as well as its primary outcomes and safety measures (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) have been reported previously. Briefly, 14,735 participants from 38 countries were enrolled in the study between December 2008 and July 2012. Eligible participants were &#x02265;50 years old with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> values of 6.5&#x02013;8.0% (48&#x02013;64 mmol/mol), and on stable-dose monotherapy or dual-combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea, or insulin with or without metformin. Study subjects were randomized double-blind to sitagliptin or placebo at dosing appropriate for their estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &#x0003c;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were not eligible for enrollment. Patients with a history of pancreatitis were not excluded from the study. Treatment for type 2 diabetes and its comorbidities was provided by usual care providers based on local guidelines. The addition of any antihyperglycemic agents, other than a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist or an open-label DPP-4i, was permitted, but rosiglitazone use was discouraged. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised 14,671 participants with a median follow-up period of 3.0 years (interquartile range 2.3&#x02013;3.8, maximum 5.7). Overall, 95.1% of participants allocated to receive sitagliptin and 94.1% allocated to receive placebo completed the study, with premature study medication discontinuation occurring in 26.1% and 27.5% of participants, respectively. Vital status was determined at study end for 97.5% of participants. The study was managed and all data were adjudicated and analyzed by academic partners (Duke Clinical Research Institute and the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit).</p><sec id="s3"><title>Event Ascertainment and Adjudication</title><p>A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated all cases of pancreatitis and cancer reported by investigators, recorded as adverse events, or identified in source documentation for other events. The CEC was independent of both the sponsor and the TECOS Executive Committee, and remained blinded to study treatment assignment. Information related to pancreatitis events was collected systematically in the trial database, including relevant symptoms, laboratory and imaging data, concomitant medication usage, and the investigator&#x02019;s suspected etiology of the event. Relevant hospital and clinic records as well as laboratory and imaging reports were also requested for CEC review. All such cases were first reviewed by a gastroenterologist and then forwarded to the CEC for a second phase of independent review and finalization of adjudication. To confirm a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, medical records or a clinical narrative prepared by the study sites had to document symptoms (abdominal pain or vomiting) and objective evidence of pancreatic inflammation&#x02014;either elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase or lipase more than three times the upper limit of normal for the assay or in patients with chronic pancreatitis, enzyme elevations more than two times the upper limit of normal) or evidence of pancreatitis documented by imaging (abdominal computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound showing diffuse and inhomogeneous gland enlargement) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc15-2780/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). Confirmed cases were further characterized as either &#x0201c;severe,&#x0201d; if there was evidence of organ failure (i.e., systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood &#x0003c;60 mmHg, serum creatinine level &#x0003e;2 mg/dL after rehydration, or estimated gastrointestinal blood loss of &#x0003e;500 mL in 24 h) or local complications demonstrated on imaging (i.e., pancreatic necrosis, abscess, or acute pseudocyst), or &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Information related to malignant/neoplastic events was also collected systematically in the trial database. Investigators reported classification (malignancy vs. benign neoplasm), primary site, type, stage, and extent, as well as the date of onset and whether the malignancy/neoplasm was clinically evident prior to randomization. Relevant hospital and clinic records, and laboratory, imaging, and pathology reports were requested for CEC review. All such cases were first reviewed by an oncologist and then forwarded to the CEC for a second phase of review and finalization of adjudication. Charter-defined malignancies included new malignancy or first recurrence during the study period of a previously diagnosed malignancy. All confirmed charter-defined malignancies were categorized by site or type. Confirmed pancreatic cancers were also subcategorized as pancreatic endocrine or exocrine tumors, or as uncertain types of pancreatic malignancy. No patient had both pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer confirmed during the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics from the adjudication process are presented to provide a sense of the nature of these events in the TECOS study. Definition of the per-protocol population is provided in the study protocol (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, continuous variables are summarized as the median (interquartile range), and categorical variables are categorized as number (percentage). The baseline characteristics of patients in whom pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or neither were diagnosed were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>, and Fisher exact tests.</p><p>The time-to-pancreatic-event analyses used Cox proportional hazards regression models and are presented as hazard ratio (95% CI).

The per-protocol end points are those that occurred before a major protocol violation in patients who took at least one dose of study medication. Event rates are shown as the number and as events per 100 patient-years of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier rates over the first 3 years for pancreatic events are plotted separately for the sitagliptin and placebo groups in the ITT population.</p><p>Meta-analyses were performed on data from the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial, the EXAMINE trial, and the TECOS study using random-effects models on summative data for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer outcomes. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I<sup>2</sup> index. Odds ratios and 95% CIs are shown with forest plots. Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2.0 software (Biostat, Inc., Englewood, NJ) was used for these analyses.

Differences in baseline characteristics among these participants were generally minimal, but smoking history differed by category (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015). For those with pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or no pancreatic event, the proportions of participants who were current smokers were 23%, 13%, and 11%, respectively. Participants with pancreatic cancer were more likely to have smoked previously (65%) than those with pancreatitis (31%) or no pancreatic event (40%). Additionally, there was a similar imbalance with respect to racial distribution, particularly a lower representation of pancreatic cancer among Asians and perhaps an increase in pancreatitis among blacks. The average age of those with confirmed pancreatic events was 66 years.</p><p>Confirmed acute pancreatitis events are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The 7,332 participants assigned to receive sitagliptin had 21,508 patient-years of follow-up, whereas those assigned to receive placebo had 21,325 patient-years of follow-up. Among participants randomized to receive sitagliptin, pancreatitis developed in 23 participants (0.3% of the ITT population, 0.107/100 patient-years) compared with 12 participants who received placebo (0.2% of the ITT population, 0.056/100 patient-years; hazard ratio 1.93 [95% CI 0.96&#x02013;3.88], <italic>P</italic> = 0.065), with these participants having 25 and 17 events, respectively. Four participants in the sitagliptin group experienced a severe pancreatitis event (two fatal events), with no severe events in the placebo group.

The TECOS study demonstrated, on a background of usual care, that there was no difference between treatment groups in the rates of major cardiovascular events, heart failure, or death from any cause. This study examined whether there was an association between the use of sitagliptin and pancreatic disease.</p><p>The overall rate of confirmed acute pancreatitis was low (0.095 events/100 patient-years) with a numerically increased but not statistically significant risk for acute pancreatitis with sitagliptin therapy (0.107/100 patient-years for sitagliptin treatment vs. 0.056/100 patient-years for placebo treatment). The clinical presentation of acute pancreatitis with regard to symptoms and onset during the study period was similar in the two treatment groups. Recurrent episodes of pancreatitis occurred in two participants treated with sitagliptin (both had one recurrence) and two participants treated with placebo (one with a single recurrence and one with four recurrences). Cases of confirmed severe acute pancreatitis were rare, but numerically greater with sitagliptin treatment compared with placebo treatment (four vs. zero, including two fatal cases). For both fatal cases, an etiology other than study treatment was suspected. Pancreatitis is often associated with multiple risk factors, and it is unclear to what extent sitagliptin contributed to the pancreatitis in each case. That said, the finding of other potential etiologies should not provide reassurance that treatment with sitagliptin was perhaps not a contributor, as the alternative hypothesis would be that treatment with sitagliptin magnifies the penetrance of risk factors on pancreatitis development and severity.</p><p>The per-protocol analysis of individuals with recent or ongoing treatment with study medication provides a similar result for the ITT analysis with a modestly lower point estimate for risk and wider CI (hazard ratio 1.80 [95% CI 0.86&#x02013;3.76], <italic>P</italic> = 0.12). With the small number of events, it is not possible to ascribe particular risk factors for acute pancreatitis for the population as a whole (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc15-2780/-/DC1">Supplementary Appendix</ext-link>). Although a history of pancreatitis was not a TECOS exclusion criterion, the risk of acute pancreatitis with sitagliptin exposure in those participants with a history of pancreatitis cannot be estimated as this information was not recorded systematically at baseline.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer was also an uncommon event in the TECOS study (0.054 events/100 patient-years). Numerically, there were fewer cases of pancreatic cancer with sitagliptin treatment than with placebo treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant. The per-protocol analysis for pancreatic cancer essentially eliminates the discrepancy between arms. Although the median 3-year follow-up period during the TECOS study is longer than in many other diabetes outcome trials, it is insufficient to permit a robust assessment of the long-term risk of pancreatic cancer.</p><p>SAVOR-TIMI 53 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and EXAMINE (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) are two recently reported, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular safety trials of DPP-4is that evaluated saxagliptin and alogliptin, respectively. These trials have important differences with the TECOS study Both the SAVOR-TIMI 53 and EXAMINE trials enrolled patients with a wider range of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at diagnosis and a shorter duration of study treatment exposure. The SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial used different criteria in the adjudication of pancreatitis, whereas the EXAMINE trial did not adjudicate cases of pancreatitis and reported no cases of pancreatic cancer. These factors preclude head-to-head comparisons of the rates of pancreatitis and could impact on the meta-analysis presented here, which means that these findings should therefore be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The primary goal of the Tecos study was to examine the cardiovascular safety of sitagliptin. The trial demonstrated unequivocal evidence for no increased risk of major cardiovascular events, heart failure, or all-cause mortality. Sitagliptin was associated with good tolerability and glycemic efficacy. These analyses of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer from the TECOS study, and the meta-analysis with two other large, well-conducted studies involving other members of the DPP-4i class of drugs, provide prescribers and patients greater precision around the question of pancreatic safety. Although conclusions are limited by the small numbers of events over a limited period of follow-up, information collected from these double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials provide the most robust data available currently to quantify the risk of pancreatic outcomes associated with DPP-4i therapy. It may be that some cases of subclinical pancreatitis could have been missed, but similar findings from the three trials suggest that there is a small increased risk of acute pancreatitis with DPP-4i therapy. For sitagliptin, the magnitude of excess risk based on the results of the TECOS study is estimated to be &#x0223c;1 additional case/1,000 patient-years, although severe and fatal cases occurred in the sitagliptin group. If this difference had been statistically significant, the number needed to harm would have been 1,974 to have 1 additional affected individual with pancreatitis. Pancreatic cancer, a condition that is almost uniformly fatal, occurred in roughly half as many participants as pancreatitis, and the risk did not appear to be increased with sitagliptin. Longer-term pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiological studies of DPP-4is will be required to provide greater insights into the pancreatic safety of this drug class.</p></sec>
