Initial entry criteria for the previous 2 double-blind clinical trials required that patients aged &#x02265; 18 years met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for FM, had a body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and had a score &#x02265; 50 on a 100-mm pain visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline. All patients began treatment in the extension study with SXB 4.5 g/night (administered in 2 equally divided doses) for at least 1 week, followed by possible serial 1.5 g/night dose increases to 9 g/night (maximum) or reductions to 4.5 g/night (minimum).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 560 FM patients enrolled in this extension study, 319 (57.0%) completed the study. The main reason for early discontinuation was adverse events (AEs; 23.0% of patients). Patients were primarily middle-aged (mean 46.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.8 years), female (91.1%), white (91.4%), with a mean duration of FM symptoms of 9.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.7 years. Serious AEs were experienced by 3.6% of patients. The most frequently reported AEs (incidence &#x02265; 5% at any dose or overall) were nausea, headache, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, vomiting, sinusitis, diarrhea, anxiety, insomnia, influenza, somnolence, upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, urinary tract infection, and gastroenteritis viral. Maintenance of SXB therapeutic response was demonstrated with continued improvement from controlled-study baseline in pain VAS, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total scores, and other measures.

Consequently, it has been challenging to characterize its etiology and to identify a single treatment that addresses all of its manifestations. The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for FM focused on chronic widespread pain and tenderness at 11 or more of 18 tender points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. By design, the recent 2010 ACR diagnostic criteria integrated widespread pain with other important clinical domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and abandoned tender-point examination. The 2010 ACR criteria identify combinations of clinical features, including chronic widespread pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and dyscognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The move to involve domains other than pain in these criteria is in line with the 2009 OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials) international guidelines for important research domains in fibromyalgia studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which also included low pain threshold (allodynia), psychological factors (anxiety and depression) and physical function. Additionally, OMERACT worked with physicians and FM patients to develop consensus regarding core symptom domains that should be assessed in FM clinical trials, and screening tools have also been developed with the same methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These core domains include pain, tenderness, sleep disturbance, fatigue, patient global assessment, and multidimensional function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Only a few medications have demonstrated efficacy relative to placebo in reducing pain, but none have shown efficacy across all outcomes including functional impairment, fatigue, sleep disturbance and quality of life (QoL). The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran for the treatment of FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] based on randomized clinical trials lasting up to six months. Extension studies of all three drugs have further suggested that long-term tolerability and efficacy are consistent with that observed in the clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Amitriptyline has been widely prescribed for FM and is recommended across existing FM treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] but it was never formally evaluated by US or European Union (EU) regulators for FM. While a recent meta-analysis suggested that amitriptyline was superior to duloxetine and milnacipran in improving pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue and QoL in FM at minimum dosages of 10 and 50 mg/day, the methodological quality of the amitriptyline studies was considered poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and tachyphylaxis has been reported to arise in less than three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, meta-analyses of currently approved medications have shown only modest efficacy for pain and have not shown efficacy on other domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and population studies have not demonstrated that FM medications have had any meaningful effect on outcomes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Sodium oxybate (SXB) is the sodium salt of &#x003b3;-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), an endogenous metabolite of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with central nervous system (CNS) depressant properties. As an oral solution, SXB (Xyrem&#x000ae;) is approved in the US, the EU and Canada for treating cataplexy and various symptoms in patients with narcolepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. SXB taken orally (Alcover&#x000ae;) is approved in the EU for treatment of alcohol withdrawal and, as an intravenous adjuvant (Gamma-OH&#x02122;, Somsanit&#x000ae;), is also approved as a sedating anesthetic. Because of its ability to modify sleep in narcolepsy, the effects of SXB on sleep physiology have been studied. SXB increased slow-wave sleep (SWS) and reduced sleep fragmentation in patients with narcolepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A phase 2 study in FM patients reported that treatment for eight weeks with SXB 4.5 and 6 g/night decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and improved morning fatigue, and that the 6-g dose also improved afternoon, evening, and overall fatigue; reduced wakefulness after sleep onset; and increased SWS and total non-REM sleep compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the past few years, SXB has been evaluated in several placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; however, it is not approved for this indication in the US, the EU, or in Canada.</p><p>Beneficial effects of SXB in the treatment of FM were demonstrated in two 14-week, phase 3, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies with 548 and 573 patients, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In these trials, patients were given SXB 4.5 or 6 g/night or placebo in two doses (at bedtime and 2.5 to 4 hours later). SXB was shown to be effective for two primary clinically relevant efficacy endpoints: pain severity, defined as the proportion of patients achieving &#x02265;30% reduction on the pain visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline to week 14; and functionality, defined as the proportion of patients achieving &#x02265;30% reduction in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score from baseline to week 14. A 30% reduction in pain is recommended as a clinically relevant outcome in chronic pain trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and a 14% change on the FIQ is considered clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes of fatigue, patient global impression of change (PGI-c), 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS), and Jenkins Sleep Scale (for sleep quality) were also demonstrated.</p><p>The adverse-event (AE) profiles observed with SXB in these studies were similar to those reported with SXB in patients with narcolepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There were no deaths, and the most common AEs in SXB-treated patients, with an incidence &#x02265;5% and twice that of placebo in both studies, were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Given the chronic nature of FM, it is important to evaluate the long-term safety of SXB in patients with FM and to address questions about the duration of therapeutic response. The current open-label extension study was designed to assess the long-term safety and therapeutic response of SXB for a combined period of up to one year in patients completing the phase 3 placebo-controlled trials of SXB (14 weeks double-blind plus 38 weeks open-label extension study treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The long-term effects of SXB on QoL and daytime fatigue in patients with FM were also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and patient selection</title><p>This prospective, multicenter, open-label extension study of SXB for the treatment of FM was carried out at 130 sites (106 sites in the US, 7 in Germany, 6 in France, 6 in Spain, 3 in the United Kingdom, and 1 each in The Netherlands and Italy) between January 2007 and January 2010. The study was approved by the following institutional review boards (IRBs) or ethics committees: Quorum Review IRB (Seattle, WA, USA); The University of Texas Health Science Center IRB (San Antonio, TX, USA), Western IRB (Olympia, WA, USA), Research Development and Administration IRB (Portland, OR, USA), Riverside Research Ethics Committee (London, UK), Hospital General Gregorio Mara&#x000f1;&#x000f3;n Ethics Committee (Madrid, Spain), Bayerische Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Ethics Committee (Munich, Germany), Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana Ethics Committee (Rome, Italy), Medisch Spectrum Twente Ethics Committee (Enschede, The Netherlands), and H&#x000f4;pital H&#x000f4;tel-Dieu Ethics Committee (Paris, France). Each patient provided informed consent prior to study initiation. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.</p><p>Patients with FM who completed either of the two phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 14-week trials (studies 06&#x02013;008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and 06&#x02013;009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) evaluating the efficacy and safety of SXB 4.5 g/night and SXB 6 g/night were eligible to enroll in this open-label extension study designed to assess the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy of SXB. Within seven days of completing the phase 3 double-blind clinical trial, patients were enrolled in the extension study to receive up to 38 additional weeks of treatment, followed by two weeks of post-treatment follow-up. The total combined duration of treatment (double-blind phase and open-label extension) was up to 52 weeks. For consistency in this analysis, weeks of therapy are numbered to reflect the total combined exposure: weeks 1 to 14 were the phase 3 double-blind period, and &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; refers to the baseline at the start of the double-blind period.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Regardless of their prior allocation and SXB dose during phase 3 double-blind treatment, all patients entering the long-term extension were initiated on SXB 4.5 g/night, administered in two equally divided doses and remained at that dose level for at least one week. Subsequent dosage increases to achieve therapeutic response were permitted in increments of 1.5 g/night at intervals of at least one week, to a maximum dose of SXB 9 g/night. Dosage reductions to address safety and tolerability were permitted in multiples of 1.5 g/night at intervals of any duration, to a minimum dose of SXB 4.5 g/night. Patients unable to tolerate SXB 4.5 g/night were discontinued from the study. Individual dose titration was based on the investigator&#x02019;s impression of clinical effect and tolerability.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety evaluations</title><p>The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of SXB. Safety was assessed by the incidence of AEs including serious AEs (SAEs), clinical laboratory values, suicidality and depression assessments, electrocardiograms, vital signs and physical examination findings, including body weight. All observed or spontaneously reported treatment-emergent AEs were assessed by prespecified criteria for severity and seriousness, and recorded, along with findings from physical examinations, including vital signs and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (obtained at week 52 of the combined double-blind and extension periods). AEs were coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 9.1). To assess risk of suicidality and occurrence of major depression, portions of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] were administered at prespecified time points, as was the Beck Depression Inventory version II (BDI-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], in accordance with recommendations from IMMPACT (Initiatives on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evaluations</title><p>Clinical evaluations included overall pain severity, assessed by a pain VAS, and fatigue, also assessed by a VAS; both were administered every evening in an electronic diary. The VAS was a 5-cm line, with measurements converted to the equivalent of a 100-mm VAS for analysis (0 = no pain/fatigue to 100 = worst imaginable pain/fatigue). The mean changes in VAS scores from double-blind baseline values for pain and fatigue were determined weekly in the extension study from weeks 14 to 26, and monthly from weeks 30 to 50; week 52 was also assessed. The proportions of patients who achieved &#x02265;30% and &#x02265;50% reductions in overall pain VAS from baseline to extension-study endpoint were also determined in accordance with recommendations for chronic-pain trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The FIQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], PGI-c, and clinical global impression of change (CGI-c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] were performed at weeks 16, 18 and 22, and at the monthly visits during weeks 26 to 52. The FIQ, which is a patient self-report questionnaire that evaluates the impact of FM on daily life, has 10 subscales (physical impairment, did not feel good, work missed, difficulty with work, pain, fatigue, tired upon awakening, stiffness, anxiety and depression). The score for each subscale ranges from 0 to 10. An FIQ total score is the sum of the scores from the 10 subscales and it ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater impact of FM on functioning; a decrease in score demonstrates improvement. The proportion of patients who achieved &#x02265;30% reduction in FIQ total score from double-blind baseline to extension-study endpoint was also determined. The PGI-c asked patients to rate their FM since they started blinded SXB treatment on a 7-point scale (very much better, much better, a little better, no change, a little worse, much worse, and very much worse); thus, there was no baseline assessment for this endpoint. Responders for PGI-c were characterized by the proportion of patients who reported their FM as &#x02018;very much better&#x02019; or &#x02018;much better.&#x02019; The CGI-c was the investigator&#x02019;s assessment of change from baseline in the patient&#x02019;s overall FM condition; the CGI-c was analyzed as the proportion of patients rated by the investigator as &#x02018;very much improved&#x02019; or &#x02018;much improved.&#x02019; The SF-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] assessed the patient&#x02019;s QoL at weeks 18, 38, and 52; an increase in score indicates improvement. Specifically, physical functioning was assessed using the SF-36 PCS score, a prespecified secondary endpoint in the double-blind studies. The mental component summary (MCS) of the SF-36 was also evaluated.</p><p>The proportion of patients meeting composite response measures was also determined. The FM Syndrome Composite Response was predefined as the proportion of patients who achieved &#x02265;30% reduction in pain VAS, a PGI-c response of &#x02018;much better&#x02019; or &#x02018;very much better,&#x02019; and &#x02265;30% reduction in FIQ total score. The FM Pain Composite Response was the proportion of patients who achieved &#x02265;30% reduction in pain VAS and a PGI-c response of &#x02018;much better&#x02019; or &#x02018;very much better.&#x02019;</p><p>Changes from double-blind baseline in the FIQ &#x02018;tired upon awakening&#x02019; subscale and in the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] were determined at extension-study endpoint. The FOSQ is a patient-reported questionnaire that evaluates the effects of excessive sleepiness on daytime functioning; lower scores indicate greater difficulty in daily functioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Analyses of changes in safety and efficacy parameters were relative to the double-blind baseline, with study endpoint defined as the last available data at extension-study completion (week 52) or early discontinuation.</p><p>Data in summary tables (except AEs) are presented by final dose in the extension study; the final dose was defined as the last dose prescribed for the patient by the investigator.

Results from this study similarly provide evidence for the tolerability of SXB during exposure of up to one year, with maintenance of clinically important improvements in pain and other FM symptoms during that period. Of the 560 patients who entered the extension after completing either of the two phase 3 double-blind studies, 402 (71.8%) patients were treated for at least six months, and 210 (37.5%) patients received treatment for at least one year; more than half (57%) of the patients who were enrolled completed the study.</p><p>There were no deaths in this study. While SAEs were reported in 20 (3.6%) patients and led to discontinuation in six of these individuals, only three SAEs in two patients were considered related to treatment: accidental overdose, transient toxic encephalopathy (resulting from the accidental overdose) and gastrointestinal hypomotility. The most frequently reported AEs were similar to those observed in previous studies of SXB in patients with narcolepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and nausea, anxiety and dizziness were the AEs most often resulting in study discontinuation.</p><p>There appeared to be a linear dose response for overall AEs, but not for individual AEs, although evaluation of a dose&#x02013;response relationship for particular AEs was precluded by the open-label design and the allowance of flexible dosing throughout the study. However, the 9-g dose was associated with a higher incidence of nasopharyngitis, vomiting, somnolence, urinary tract infection and gastroenteritis, but there was no consistent pattern indicating that the incidence of these AEs was associated with increased doses. It should also be noted that compared with other dosage groups, the number of exposures to 9 g was lowest of all allowed dosages in the study. No abuse-related issues or signals of diversion were observed in the current study, consistent with the low levels of diversion, abuse and dependence that have been reported with use of prescribed SXB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Signs of suicidality and major depression were monitored closely, especially since FM patients have been reported to have a higher prevalence of major depression than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], as well as an increased risk of suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, in this study, there was no sign of increased suicidality in patients receiving long-term SXB. Additionally, no risk of increased depression was detected and, although depression was not formally evaluated as an outcome, it should be noted that relative to baseline, mean BDI-II scores improved, and a smaller proportion of patients at endpoint reported depression that was greater than &#x02018;minimal depression&#x02019; on the BDI-II.</p><p>Treatment with SXB was associated with a mean weight loss, consistent with what has been observed with SXB in a retrospective chart review of patients with narcolepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Weight loss was reported as an AE in 3.8% of patients, with one event of decreased weight graded as severe. Of note, the mean baseline BMI for patients enrolled in this study was 28.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a level considered pre-obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>With respect to therapeutic response, SXB provided clinically important improvements over the study duration across multiple FM domains identified as important by OMERACT, including pain, functioning, fatigue and tiredness. Both patient- and investigator-rated overall well-being assessments at the end of the study indicated long-term improvement. Importantly, not only did 68.8% of patients achieve &#x02265;30% reduction in pain compared with baseline, a clinically meaningful level of pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], but more than half (53.0%) of the patients achieved &#x02265;50% reduction, which is considered a substantial decrease in pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The pain, fatigue, sleep-related and functional benefits were also supported by substantial improvements on the FIQ, with proportions of patients achieving the 30% and 50% thresholds similar to those observed for pain. For perspective, note that a smaller (14%) change on the FIQ has been shown to represent the minimal clinically important difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The robustness of the response across individual outcomes was also reflected by the high proportions of patients who achieved the FM Syndrome Composite Response (50.3%) and the Fibromyalgia Pain Composite Response (52.4%). Composite measures, which represent a conservative assessment of response since they require that patients fulfill two or more criteria to be considered responders, have been reported only in clinical FM trials of milnacipran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and SXB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Several limitations of this study should be noted including lack of a placebo group since this was an open-label study. Common to such extension studies, patients remaining in the study generally represent a self-selected population of those who both tolerated the drug and achieved efficacy. Furthermore, this study used populations from previous clinical trials, which were restricted by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. For both of these reasons, the results may not be fully generalizable to the clinical setting.</p><p>An additional limitation is that the overall discontinuation rate of 43% does not enable a true assessment of efficacy in all patients at the one-year time point. However, applying a worst-case scenario in which discontinued patients are assumed to be non-responders (that is, did not achieve &#x02265;30% reduction in pain VAS) still suggests a substantial treatment benefit, with a responder rate at endpoint of 45.7%. Thus, it should be considered that the true response is likely to fall between this estimate and the 68.8% reported. It should also be noted that the overall discontinuation rate was consistent with those seen in other FM open-label extension studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The 7% discontinuations due to lack of efficacy suggests that the therapeutic effect that was maintained over the long-term and over multiple efficacy endpoints was clinically meaningful in the patients who tolerated the drug.</p><p>Overall, the long-term study results support those from the phase 2 and phase 3 controlled clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] in demonstrating a similar safety profile; similar improvements across multiple clinically meaningful FM domains were observed and maintained throughout the duration of the study. The demonstrated long-term effectiveness of SXB in FM should be viewed in light of its overall safety profile and potential risks of its use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The long-term, open-label (up to 38 weeks) safety profile of SXB in FM patients was similar to those observed in the phase 2 and phase 3 double-blind trials. Treatment with SXB was associated with clinically relevant improvements across multiple FM domains, including pain and functioning; these improvements were maintained during long-term treatment (up to 52 weeks). These data support the conclusion that SXB can provide long-term benefits in the multidimensional management of FM. While multidimensional efficacy is a desired goal of therapy, any therapeutic benefits should be weighed against other factors, including individual patient needs as well as potential risks.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACR: American College of Rheumatology; AE: adverse event; BDI-II: Beck Depression Inventory version II; BMI: body mass index; CGI-c: clinical global impression of change; CNS: central nervous system; EU: European Union; FIQ: Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; FM: fibromyalgia syndrome; FOSQ: Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire; GABA: &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid; GHB: &#x003b3;-hydroxybutyrate; IMMPACT: Initiatives on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials; MCS: mental component summary; MedDRA: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; MINI: Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview; OMERACT: Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials; PCS: physical component summary; PGI-c: patient global impression of change; QoL: quality of life; REM: rapid eye movement; SAE: serious adverse event; SD: standard deviation; SF-36: 36-item short-form health survey; SWS: slow wave sleep; SXB: sodium oxybate; US: United States; VAS: visual analog scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MS, SP, and IJR are consultants to and their institutions have received research support from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
