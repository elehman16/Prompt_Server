The most common cause of dizziness in general practice is peripheral vestibular disease. Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is a safe and effective treatment for peripheral vestibular disease that entails specific exercises to maximise the central nervous system compensation for the effects of vestibular pathology. An internet-based VR intervention has recently been shown to be safe and effective. Online interventions are low cost and easily accessible, but prone to attrition and non-adherence. A combination of online and face-to-face therapy, known as blended care, may balance these advantages and disadvantages.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A single-blind, three-arm, randomised controlled trial among patients aged 50&#x02005;years and over presenting with dizziness of vestibular origin in general practice will be performed. In this study, we will compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stand-alone internet-based VR and internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support (&#x02018;blended care&#x02019;) with usual care during 6&#x02005;months of follow-up. We will use a translated Dutch version of a British online VR intervention. Randomisation will be stratified by dizziness severity. The primary outcome measure is the Vertigo Symptoms Scale&#x02014;Short Form. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, adjusting for confounders. The economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective. We will perform an additional analysis on the data to identify predictors of successful treatment in the same population to develop a clinical decision rule for general practitioners.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The ethical committee of the VU University Medical Center approved ethics and dissemination of the study protocol.

Other causes of dizziness are cardiovascular diseases (7&#x02013;18%), neurological disorders (10&#x02013;15%) and psychiatric disorders (1&#x02013;17%).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> In the Netherlands, as well as in the UK and the USA, &#x0003e;90% of all patients with dizziness are treated by their general practitioner (GP) without any involvement of a specialist,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> mainly by reassurance, advice and symptomatic drug prescriptions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, none of the commonly prescribed drugs for vertigo have a well-established curative or preventive effect.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>According to a recent Cochrane review&#x02014;based on 39 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2441 participants&#x02014;there is moderate-to-strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is a safe, effective treatment for peripheral vestibular disease.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> VR entails that the patient carries out graded exercises for 10&#x02013;20&#x02005;min daily for 6&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks. These exercises include specific eye, head and body movements that stimulate the vestibular system and promote neurological adaptation to the altered input from the damaged labyrinth.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Performing these exercises may also help patients to overcome fear and avoidance of activities that provoke dizziness, and to regain skill and confidence in balance.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Importantly, when examining the 39 RCTs mentioned above,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> most RCTs were performed among a selected population (eg, participants with canal paresis, otolith disorder or acoustic neuroma resection) and were conducted in a secondary/tertiary care setting. Only 2 of the 39 RCTs included a population representative of patients seen in primary care, these showed that nurse-delivered VR and booklet-based VR effectively reduce dizziness.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Despite the evidence for the effectiveness of VR, a previous survey suggests that &#x0003c;3% of eligible primary care patients with dizziness ever receive VR.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This may be due to a lack of availability or access to VR or a lack of knowledge about VR by the GP.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> To date, access to VR usually involves a costly referral process to secondary care.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Also, finding suitable therapists can be difficult.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Prior to this proposal, we performed a survey among a sample of 1169 Dutch GPs to investigate the current use of VR in general practice.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Of the 426 responding GPs, 93% reported that they never used VR&#x02014;by themselves or by referral&#x02014;for the treatment of patients with dizziness. Not knowing how to perform the technique was the most mentioned reason by GPs not to use VR (92.4%). &#x02018;Takes too much time to execute&#x02019; (7.2%), &#x02018;doubts about the effectiveness&#x02019; (6.3%) and &#x02018;not recommended by national guidelines&#x02019; (4.5%) were other reasons mentioned by GPs for not using VR. Consequently, it is not only important to generate additional evidence for the effectiveness of VR in general practice, but also to consider alternative models of treatment delivery to support the GP.</p><p>In the past, VR has been successfully delivered via a booklet-based self-management programme. Booklet-based VR has been tested in two large primary care trials<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and a voluntary population of members of the Meniere's Society.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> All trials showed that application of VR resulted in a significant reduction of dizziness symptoms without any serious adverse events.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The internet could prove to be an alternative method to reach patients with dizziness in an inexpensive, easily accessible way. Booklet-based treatments are perfectly suited to be transformed into internet-based interventions. An online intervention can be tailored to the patients' individual needs, featured audio&#x02013;visual content and provided various means of motivational support (eg, discussion boards or personalised text messages).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Internet use by older adults is growing rapidly. According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), 80% of adults aged 65&#x02013;75&#x02005;years reported internet use in 2013, which is more than twice as much as in 2005.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A recent review by Aalbers <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> showed that internet interventions targeting lifestyle change in adults aged above 50&#x02005;years can be effective. The authors concluded that internet-mediated interventions hold great potential in implementing effective lifestyle programmes and are capable of reaching large populations of older persons at low costs.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> With these advantages in mind, an online VR intervention based on the VR booklet was developed in the UK.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The internet-based VR intervention has recently been compared to usual care in an RCT (Geraghty <italic>et al</italic> personal communication). The trial was conducted in a general practice population and included 296 patients. Patients in the online VR intervention group experienced significantly less dizziness and dizziness-related disability at 6&#x02005;months, compared to those in the usual care group. We will translate the British online VR intervention into Dutch. No alterations in the content of the translated programme will be made.</p><p>In addition to this, we will also investigate a different form of delivery in which the use of the online intervention is supported by a healthcare professional. Despite the advantages, unguided internet interventions can be associated with substantial attrition and non-adherence. A combination of online and face-to-face therapy (&#x02018;blended care&#x02019;) may reduce attrition and non-adherence, offering patients the best of both worlds.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> In one of the booklet-based VR trials,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> a subset of patients received additional telephone support by a trained vestibular therapist while performing the booklet self-managed programme. By focusing on addressing patient concerns, reassuring, encouraging adherence and ensuring proper use of the booklet, these patients demonstrated higher adherence to the treatment and a significant reduction in anxiety and depression. Face-to-face contact is likely to be even more effective than telephone support. In the Netherlands, physiotherapists with experience in vestibular therapy often make house calls, and they are used to encourage and reassure their patients when performing physical exercises. As such, they are perfectly suited to be the &#x02018;face&#x02019; of an online VR intervention.</p><p>The principal aim of this research project is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stand-alone internet-based VR and internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support (blended care) for patients with dizziness aged 50&#x02005;years and over in general practice in comparison with usual primary care. The online intervention that will be applied has been proved to be safe and effective for patients aged 50&#x02005;years and over (Geraghty <italic>et al</italic> personal communication). By assessing the benefits of blended care, we may be able to improve the treatment of older patients with dizziness. Furthermore, it will offer GPs a new&#x02014;immediate, easily accessible and inexpensive&#x02014;clinical tool for treating dizziness in general practice. Additionally, we aim to develop a prediction rule to help GPs to assess which patient groups are best suited for each type of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We will perform a single-blind, three-arm, RCT among patients aged 50&#x02005;years and older presenting with dizziness in general practice.

The ANH-VUmc includes a total of 50 active GPs. The network should be a sufficient source to attain our inclusion number. Other general practices in the Netherlands (primarily in and around Amsterdam) may be approached if inclusion numbers from the ANH-VUmc prove to be insufficient. Eligible patients will be identified by means of a validated search strategy<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> that selects from the electronic medical records those patients within the set age range who visited their GP because of dizziness in the past 2&#x02005;years. The GP will screen the selected lists of patients for potential exclusion criteria or other pertinent reasons for not inviting them, such as a terminal disease or a severe psychiatric disorder. The identified and screened potential participants will be sent a package by their GP containing a letter, a brochure with information about the trial and a contact form. If a patient is willing to participate, he/she can contact the research assistant by phone, email or by returning the addressed contact form. On making contact, the research assistant will provide additional information if necessary and check the eligibility criteria. These criteria are a good command of the Dutch language, access to the internet and an email account, persisting dizziness at time of inclusion that has been present for at least 1&#x02005;month, and that is exacerbated by performing head movements. If the participant is eligible, the research assistant will make an appointment for a visit at the participant's home. The research assistant will bring an informed consent form with an addressed return envelope. The participant will be able to ask questions about the trial and the informed consent form during this house visit. After the house visit, the participant will be given 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;weeks of time to consider if he/she wants to participate in the trial. During that time period, the research assistant will be available to answer any questions over the phone that might arise. To participate, the individual is required to sign the informed consent form and return it to the research team by using the addressed return envelope. After this signed informed consent form has been received by the research team, an email will be sent to the participant with a link to the intervention website.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation for our trial is based on the comparison between participants allocated to trial arm 1 (stand-alone internet-based VR) and those allocated to trial arm 3 (usual care). In Yardley <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> recent VR trial with VSS-SF as a primary outcome measure, booklet-based VR alone, compared with routine care, showed an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.45, favouring booklet-based VR. Assuming that stand-alone internet-based VR will produce the same effect size as booklet-based VR alone, we will need 80 patients per group to test a two-tailed hypothesis with &#x003b1;=0.05 and &#x003b2;=0.20. As attrition from internet-based interventions can be substantial,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> we will recruit a minimum of 100 participants per group (300 total sample) to allow for up to 20% attrition (80&#x000d7;100/80=100).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligible patients are required to:

The online software programme will randomly assign participants to one of the three arms. During the automated randomisation, patients will be stratified by dizziness severity according to their score on the VSS-SF. Participants with a VSS-SF score of &#x0003c;12 points will be classified as low severity patients, whereas participants with 12 or more points will be classified as high severity patients. Patients are automatically informed about their allocated group. When patients are allocated to trial arm 2 (blended care), an email will be sent to the principal investigator. The principal investigator will select and contact one of the trained physiotherapists, depending on the location of the patient. The physiotherapist will contact the patient within 24&#x02005;hours to plan the first therapeutic session. Since VR is a behavioural intervention, it is not possible for patients to be blinded to allocation. At 3 and 6&#x02005;months, they will receive an email&#x02014;and, if necessary, a reminder&#x02014;to complete follow-up measures online. If participants still fail to respond, an independent research assistant will call them to encourage them to fill out the questionnaires online. The research assistant analysing the questionnaire data will be blind to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Internet-based VR (trial arm 1)</title><p>VR entails specific exercises with the aim of maximising central nervous system compensation for vestibular pathology. Recently, specific components have been defined, namely compensation (using motion to habituate or reduce responsiveness to repetitive stimuli and to rebalance tonic activity within the vestibular nuclei), adaptation (using repetitive and provocative movements of the head and/or eyes to reduce error and restore vestibule-ocular reflex gain), substitution (promoting the use of individual or combinations of sensory inputs) and motor learning principles (changing movement behaviour). Additionally, deliberately provoking dizziness in a controlled context functions as a form of exposure-based behaviour therapy.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A VR booklet was developed by following principles of behaviour change, derived from cognitive&#x02013;behaviour therapy and self-regulation theory.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Self-efficacy is stimulated in the intervention by graded goal setting. This VR booklet was validated in three large trials.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The content of the booklet has been the basis for a recently developed stand-alone internet-based VR intervention. This intervention was developed by Dr Lucy Yardley,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> member of our research group and coauthor of this manuscript. A prototype version of the intervention was tested among 18 adults in the UK.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Participants were positive regarding how easy to navigate, visually appealing and informative they found the intervention. Think-aloud sessions provided valuable data for informing small amendments to further enhance acceptability of the intervention for target users.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The recently conducted large trial by Geraghty <italic>et al</italic> (n=296) (Geraghty <italic>et al</italic> personal communication) has shown that the British version of internet-based VR improves dizziness and reduces dizziness-based disability in older primary care patients. Patients in trial arm 1 will get access to a careful Dutch translation of this stand-alone VR intervention.</p><p>The intervention period will last 6&#x02005;weeks for every patient. In the first session, information about dizziness and a rationale for the VR exercises will be provided. These exercises represent the core of the intervention. The weekly &#x02018;timed exercise scoring test&#x02019; (TEST) will also be explained in the first session. VR exercises will be personalised for the patient and take into account his/her symptoms and balance capabilities. The online TEST is used to tailor the set of exercises. All of the exercises will have written instructions with video demonstrations, each performed by a male and a female model. In the first session, all six exercises (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>) are performed sitting down, afterwards the patients are asked to score how dizzy each respective exercise made them feel. The intervention uses these scores to automatically produce an exercise prescription for the coming week, custom built to the patient's dizziness symptoms. When performing the exercises while sitting no longer causes dizziness symptoms, the patient will be asked to perform the exercises standing up. By using this approach, patients will gradually increase the intensity of their exercises. Patients are asked to perform these exercises two times per day for 10&#x02005;min.

Previous research showed that symptom control strategies led to significant subjective health improvement and reduction of dizziness-related impairment.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Progressive muscle relaxation and breathing techniques can decrease dizziness-associated psychophysiological arousal, whereas cognitive restructuring (challenging negative dizziness-related thoughts) and problem solving may lessen dizziness-provoking anxiety.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In addition, the internet intervention includes particular features to increase engagement. Scientific studies supporting the effectiveness of VR are summarised in plain language to increase patients' expectations regarding the intervention content. Email messages will be used to remind patients to log in to the intervention each week. Since our intervention is aimed at older adults, the look and design of the internet-based VR programme is simple with large font sizes and use of bullet points instead of paragraphs wherever possible. Importantly, internet-based VR will be offered to patients in addition to their usual GP care (ie, the intervention does not replace usual GP care).</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Internet-based VR and physical therapy (trial arm 2&#x02014;blended care)</title><p>Patients in trial arm 2 (n=100) will receive the same intervention as the patients in trial arm 1 (n=100). This internet-based VR intervention is described in detail in the previous paragraph. In addition to the internet-based VR intervention, patients in trial arm 2 will receive two sessions by a trained physiotherapist. Although the advantages of a stand-alone internet-based intervention are numerous (eg, easily accessible, inexpensive, enormous reach and automated tailoring), unguided internet interventions can be jeopardised by substantial attrition (ie, a patient leaves the treatment before the treatment goals are achieved) and non-adherence (ie, a patient remains enrolled, but fails to attend the scheduled treatment). Previous research on depression showed that combining online sessions and regular face-to-face psychotherapy can increase adherence and effectiveness.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> Patients allocated to trial arm 2 will receive such blended care. The physiotherapeutic sessions will occur in week 1 and 3 of the 6-week intervention period and last for 45&#x02005;min each. During these sessions, the physiotherapist will (1) provide information about the background of dizziness and VR; (2) elicit and address doubts and concerns about dizziness and VR; (3) teach the patient how to use the online intervention; (4) describe and take the patient through a set of VR exercises; (5) advise on how to anticipate and cope with obstacles to adherence and (6) provide support and encourage adherence. The first session will focus on making the patient feel comfortable with the VR exercises. The second session will focus more on adherence to the treatment and will therefore be planned in the third week. Performing VR exercises can slightly increase the dizziness at first. During the second session, the physiotherapist will reassure the patient of the temporary nature of this exacerbation and encourage him/her to keep performing the exercises. The sessions will take place at the home of the participant. A physiotherapist, specialised in VR, will oversee that all participating physiotherapists adhere to the treatment protocol. We will conduct a process evaluation with the physiotherapists after the trial is completed.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Usual care (trial arm 3)</title><p>All included patients of trial arm 3 (n=100) will receive usual care by their GPs.

Recently, the results of the trial by Yardley <italic>et al</italic> (n=296) have illustrated the safety of internet-based VR (Geraghty <italic>et al</italic> personal communication). Eighteen hospitalisations were identified in a GP notes review undertaken at the end of the trial, 8 in the usual care arm and 10 in the intervention arm. None of these hospitalisations were related to dizziness. No dizziness/intervention-related serious adverse reactions were reported. Our version of the intervention will be a close Dutch translation of the British online VR intervention. Patients will be informed that minor side effects like a temporary increase of neck pain, nausea or dizziness may occur. They will be advised that these sensations are likely to disappear within 2&#x02005;weeks by performing the exercises more slowly. All adverse events that occur to a participant during this study, whether or not considered related to VR, will be recorded. The Medical Ethical Committee of the VU Medical Center will be notified within 15&#x02005;days in the case of the occurrence of a serious adverse event during the study. We will inform the participants and the Medical Ethical Committee if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of participation may be significantly greater than that was foreseen in the research proposal. The study will then be suspended pending further review by the Medical Ethical Committee. Serious medical complications as a result of our VR intervention are very unlikely.

From a wider perspective, the project has the capacity to illustrate how easily accessible interventions in primary care may relieve the burden on secondary/tertiary care, leading to better care at lower costs.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> VAvV wrote the manuscript.
