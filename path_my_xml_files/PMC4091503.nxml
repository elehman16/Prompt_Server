Further, patients may misinterpret symptoms of anaphylaxis and up to 50% may not seek emergency treatment during or after initial events.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>Nonetheless anaphylaxis rates in Australia are increasing, in line with worldwide trends.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;15</xref> Between 1993&#x02013;1994 and 2004&#x02013;2005 anaphylaxis hospitalisations in Australia increased from 3.7 to 10.8/100&#x02005;000 population; an average annual increase of 8.8%.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Much of this increase is attributed to food-induced anaphylaxis&#x02014;the most common cause of anaphylaxis in the community setting (and responsible for 30% of all fatal anaphylaxis cases).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Notably, Australia has the highest rate of food allergy in the world, with challenge-proven prevalence of more than 10% in young children.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Treatment of anaphylaxis requires prompt administration of epinephrine. Delayed epinephrine is associated with more severe reactions and fatal anaphylaxis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> Epinephrine autoinjector devices are often prescribed for patients with a history of anaphylaxis to allow early self-management of recurrent events, yet the majority of patients do not understand how or when to use them.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A survey of 1885 patients who had experienced anaphylaxis found 73% did not use epinephrine, and in this group 28% had not previously received a prescription for epinephrine.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Therefore, considering (1) the complexities of diagnosis and variations in signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis; (2) the uncertain yet increasing burden of disease; (3) the need for urgent epinephrine during anaphylaxis and (4) the likelihood for people to be unprepared for anaphylaxis in the community, the options for management of acute anaphylaxis in this setting warrant consideration. Patients may attend hospitals, call emergency services, try a medical practitioner or self-manage. However, there is increasing anecdotal evidence that some patients choose to attend their local pharmacy instead. This may be because patients or carers do not recognise the symptoms, or understand the treatment of anaphylaxis and instead seek (erroneously) to purchase antihistamines from their pharmacist. Those who do identify the need for immediate treatment may choose the pharmacist for reasons of urgent accessibility, familiarity, convenience and awareness that pharmacies stock epinephrine autoinjectors.</p><p>While there is good evidence for the roles of the patient, medical practitioner, emergency services and hospital personnel in the management of anaphylaxis,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> evidence for the role of the community pharmacist is scarce. Surveys of opinions about treating anaphylaxis, and epinephrine autoinjector technique exist,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;27</xref> but there is no research evaluating pharmacist practice or preparedness for anaphylaxis emergencies. We believe that patients will increasingly seek out pharmacists for anaphylaxis first aid. Given the unpredictable nature of anaphylaxis, the dramatic rise in food-induced anaphylaxis, the potential for first-time reactions to be fatal,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and the accessibility of pharmacists as a treatment destination, there is an urgent need to identify if pharmacists are ready to manage anaphylaxis. An important duality in anaphylaxis management must be considered&#x02014;first providing first aid when required, and second engaging the non-acute patient in discussion so they may be prepared for future events. The purpose of this study of Australian community pharmacist practice was to identify (1) their preparedness for acute anaphylaxis; (2) factors that impact on such preparedness and (3) willingness to engage the patient in a discussion about anaphylaxis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomised, cross-sectional, simulated patient study of pharmacist practice in Perth, Australia from April to May 2012.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting and recruitment</title><p>All Perth metropolitan pharmacies located within a 20&#x02005;km radius of the Perth Central Business District, and listed on the Pharmacy Registration Board of Western Australia Premises Register<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> were included in the sampling frame (n=334).

At the time of this research, availability of epinephrine autoinjector devices in Australia was changing. Original EpiPen was being replaced by new-look EpiPen and Anapen had been available as an alternative device for less than 2&#x02005;years. Thus we considered it important to identify if older or newer devices corresponded with better management, and each researcher applied one of these devices in their scenario request. Devices were allocated to researchers randomly. Original EpiPen was allocated to a female Master of Pharmacy student, aged 20&#x02013;25&#x02005;years. New-look EpiPen was allocated to a male Master of Pharmacy student, aged 20&#x02013;25&#x02005;years. Anapen was allocated to an experienced simulated patient actor (female, aged 40&#x02013;45&#x02005;years).

To aid recall, variables were ordered in sections to present a logical flow for recording that matched the anticipated flow of the scenario. Preparedness variables (broadly: allergy assessment, autoinjector demonstration, antihistamine recommendations) and demographic variables (broadly: pharmacy environment, pharmacist age and gender) were collected (see online supplementary appendix 1). Prior to use, the tool was evaluated for face validity in a group of 10 pharmacists and evaluated for usability in a round-table discussion during the training session. To reduce the potential for scenario and data collection fatigue, researchers were limited to a maximum of eight pharmacy visits per day, 5&#x02005;days per week. The tool was completed immediately after each pharmacy visit (away from the premises), and data subsequently entered to a database (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA). During the study, an independent auditor crosschecked a random sample of 30 completed tools against data entered in the database. The proportion of records in disagreement was 0.27%.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Scenario pilot</title><p>The final scenario and data collection tool were piloted in a random sample of nine pharmacies (3 per device).

One-way analysis of variance with post hoc pairwise analysis was used to evaluate differences in mean preparedness scores by autoinjector group.</p><p>Multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors impacting on anaphylaxis preparedness. We specified anaphylaxis preparedness score as the dependent variable. Pharmacy type and location; pharmacist gender, estimated age and how busy they were (as a ratio of total customers in store to total pharmacy staff); time of day the visit was performed; type of autoinjector demonstrated; and anaphylaxis engagement score were covariates. We used a backward automated model selection approach to identify significant factors impacting on anaphylaxis preparedness. We did not include antihistamine sales data in the model because fewer than half of all consultations resulted in a sale. Instead, advice provided with the sale of an antihistamine was analysed descriptively by epinephrine autoinjector group.</p><p>As there were no reliable estimates for expected SD in anaphylaxis preparedness score, we did not conduct a priori sample size calculations.

We found pharmacists were not fully prepared for anaphylaxis emergencies. Overall, they provided sound advice on anaphylaxis symptoms, the need for emergency care after epinephrine and the role of antihistamines. However, most pharmacists did not correctly demonstrate the epinephrine autoinjector and very few identified the need for an anaphylaxis action plan. Pharmacists appeared to be more at ease with the new-look Epipen than any other device, consistently scoring higher on all anaphylaxis preparedness measures (and thus overall score) when demonstrating this device. Despite being directly sought by the patient, pharmacists missed the opportunity to fully engage in a discussion about anaphylaxis, with less than half initiating the discussion unprompted. On average, just three of eight elements of anaphylaxis engagement were addressed. However, engagement remains vitally important: pharmacists who engaged in a discussion about anaphylaxis with the patient, also demonstrated a greater preparedness for anaphylaxis emergencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A key strength of the PRAC study was the use of simulated patient methodology. This technique is well described in the literature as a tool to measure true pharmacist practice, and overcomes the issues of participant bias that occur when pharmacists know they will be evaluated.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Simulated patient methodology has been adopted worldwide in pharmacy practice research,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;42</xref> and is an intrinsic part of quality use of medicines assessment in Australia.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>There are other strengths in our study design. Our random sample of 300 pharmacies represented over 70% of all pharmacies in the Perth metropolitan area. We defined anaphylaxis preparedness and engagement based on national and international pharmacy practice and anaphylaxis guidelines.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> The scenario and data collection tool were developed using a rigorous approach, with training, evaluation and pilot testing undertaken prior to the study. Finally, our study had sufficient power to detect a 10% or greater difference in mean anaphylaxis preparedness score between groups.</p><p>However, there are potential limitations with the PRAC study. As we did not seek ethics approval to conduct concealed audio or video recordings and instead relied on researchers to remember details of each encounter before completing the data collection tool, this study was subject to recall bias. Our results may understate pharmacists&#x02019; true preparedness scores, as simulated patient recall has been shown to underestimate real behaviour by 10&#x02013;20%.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Although pharmacists performed better overall using the new-look EpiPen, this effect may have been confounded by features unique to the simulated patient (eg, age, gender, personality and memory). We did not measure whether the pharmacist advised the anaphylaxis patient to lay flat. We acknowledge that an upright position is associated with fatal anaphylaxis, and not measuring this important element of advice may distort anaphylaxis preparedness. We included all points stated by the pharmacist, whether they were provided before or after the antihistamine &#x02018;prompt&#x02019; question. Although this may have overstated anaphylaxis preparedness or anaphylaxis engagement, we considered this aspect of the scenario important to allow pharmacists a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate their management of patients with anaphylaxis. For pharmacists to achieve all points required an extended consultation for which the pharmacist could not expect to be remunerated, and this may have affected willingness to engage in discussion. Furthermore, we did not include workload in our definition of busyness, and could not account for attitudes to provision of information where the pharmacist had not supplied the epinephrine autoinjector. Nonetheless, in this regard pharmacists performed admirably, providing advice for free and genuinely aiming to assist the simulated patient. Such practice mirrors the ethos of Australian professional practice standards, where the pharmacist's primary concern is the health and well-being of the patient.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>PRAC relative to other research</title><p>Anaphylaxis management in pharmacy practice has not previously been defined or holistically evaluated. Although aspects of pharmacist management have been assessed (using survey data), the evidence for anaphylaxis preparedness or engagement is limited by few studies. A retrospective survey of 1887 patients with food-anaphylaxis found pharmacists&#x02019; advice provision to be poor. In first-time epinephrine autoinjector supplies (similar to our recently diagnosed patient), 86.6% of pharmacists provided no advice, 13.4% provided information about epinephrine (7.7% in PRAC), 2.3% discussed the signs of an allergic reaction (64.9% in PRAC) and 13.3% provided autoinjector training (80.8% in PRAC).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Device demonstration accuracy in PRAC was just 17.3%, but this was better than or similar to demonstration accuracy in other studies (15.8% of school teachers,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> 2% of hospital doctors,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> 2% of general practitioners<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and 25% of physicians were accurate.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) In a small survey of pharmacists&#x02019; proposed actions, 55.6% of pharmacists were unsure or unwilling to administer an EpiPen in a hypothetical anaphylaxis emergency.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The main deterrent was concern about liability, and this adds an important dimension to anaphylaxis preparedness that could not be evaluated in our study.

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in practice this may be difficult. Furthermore the first episode of anaphylaxis can be fatal,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and pharmacists may be the closest health professional available in the crucial early stages, where treatment may save a life. Finally, it is impossible to control or predict the actions of a desperate person during a frightening, life-threatening emergency, and some will choose to attend a pharmacy. The recent death of a girl with acute anaphylaxis, who was refused treatment by a pharmacist in Ireland, highlights the importance of pharmacist preparedness.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p><p>The PRAC study demonstrates pharmacists are conversant with the symptoms of anaphylaxis, the need for emergency care after epinephrine and the role of antihistamines in anaphylaxis. However, the majority of pharmacists could not correctly demonstrate an autoinjector under everyday conditions, and therefore we should question their preparedness for emergency situations. Further the apparent lack of awareness of anaphylaxis action plans raises concern. Although the benefit of such plans in anaphylaxis has not formally been established,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>
<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> they are widely recommended and likely provide reassurance alongside the treatment algorithm they represent.</p><p>Pharmacists worldwide have the opportunity to practise their anaphylaxis preparedness every time they supply an autoinjector. New-look EpiPen was associated with significantly greater preparedness than other devices. In the absence of a clear difference in the proportion of correct device demonstrations compared to Anapen it is not possible to explain this irregularity and we caution against translating this finding to different levels of preparedness depending on the autoinjector. Although simply engaging the patient in a general discussion about anaphylaxis improves recall of life-saving preparedness points, pharmacists do not reliably do this. There has been a call for epinephrine autoinjectors to be made available in all public places where anaphylaxis might occur,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and pharmacies represent a logical choice for such a location. However, incomplete anaphylaxis preparedness limits the potential for this option. The &#x02018;Orange Cross&#x02019; scheme promoted through Community Pharmacy Scotland identifies pharmacies that stock high-dose and low-dose autoinjectors, where pharmacists are trained and prepared to provide emergency care in acute anaphylaxis.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Such a scheme offers a safe option for patients with anaphylaxis and may provide the infrastructure to support anaphylaxis practice guidelines for pharmacists.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Future research</title><p>Less than 20% of pharmacists correctly demonstrated all autoinjector administration steps on the relevant ASCIA Action Plan for Anaphylaxis.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> There is an urgent need to investigate the intricacies of autoinjector demonstration by pharmacists to identify the nature and significance of errors made in demonstration, and the relevance of this to anaphylaxis preparedness.</p><p>To improve anaphylaxis preparedness, we should improve anaphylaxis engagement. Research to develop and implement anaphylaxis practice guidelines for pharmacists is an important step in providing guidance for pharmacists on discussion as well as treatment of anaphylaxis.</p><p>To further safeguard patients with anaphylaxis in the Australian community, development and pilot of a programme similar to the &#x02018;Orange Cross&#x02019; scheme would be useful. A well-designed programme may also alleviate pharmacist concerns about liability and costs associated with provision of epinephrine as first aid for patients with anaphylaxis presenting to the pharmacy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Anaphylaxis in the community presents challenges in management. Pharmacists are a potential destination for patients with acute anaphylaxis. This covert assessment of pharmacist advice identified strengths and weaknesses in anaphylaxis preparedness. Pharmacists demonstrated reasonable knowledge of anaphylaxis symptoms and emergency care, but had poor epinephrine autoinjector technique and rarely discussed anaphylaxis action plans. Pharmacists who engaged their patients in a more comprehensive discussion about anaphylaxis were more prepared for anaphylaxis emergencies. Future research should evaluate the nature and significance of errors in pharmacists&#x02019; autoinjector technique. Development of anaphylaxis practice guidelines for pharmacists may improve consistency of advice and overall preparedness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e163" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005648.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e164" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005648.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Link Healthcare for providing the Anapen autoinjectors, and Alphapharm for providing the EpiPen autoinjectors used in the study.
