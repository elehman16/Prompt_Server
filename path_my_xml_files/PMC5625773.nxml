In clinical practice, however, care for the sexual side effects of treatment is often suboptimal or unavailable. The goal of the current study is to test a web-based intervention to support the recovery of sexual intimacy of prostate cancer survivors and their partners after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study team developed an interactive, web-based intervention, tailored to type of treatment received, relationship status (partnered/non-partnered) and sexual orientation. It consists of 10 modules, six follow the trajectory of the illness and four are theme based. They address sexual side effects, rehabilitation, psychological impacts and coaching for self-efficacy.</p><p id="Par3">Each includes a video to engage participants, psychoeducation and activities completed by participants on the web. Tailored strategies for identified concerns are sent by email after each module. Six of these modules will be tested in a randomized controlled trial and compared to usual care. Men with localized prostate cancer with partners will be recruited from five academic medical centers. These couples (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;140) will be assessed prior to treatment, then 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months after treatment. The primary outcome will be the survivors&#x02019; and partners&#x02019; Global Satisfaction with Sex Life, assessed by a Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information Systems (PROMIS) measure. Secondary outcomes will include interest in sex, sexual activity, use of sexual aids, dyadic coping, knowledge about sexual recovery, grief about the loss of sexual function, and quality of life. The impact of the intervention on the couple will be assessed using the Actor-Partner Interaction Model, a mixed-effects linear regression model able to estimate both the association of partner characteristics with partner and patient outcomes and the association of patient characteristics with both outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">The web-based tool represents a novel approach to addressing the sexual health needs of prostate cancer survivors and their partners that&#x02014;if found efficacious&#x02014;will improve access to much needed specialty care in prostate cancer survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">

Being in a relationship is associated with improved cancer survival and sexual relationships are an important source of resilience for patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among men with prostate cancer, treatment-related erectile dysfunction (ED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] has a detrimental impact on survivors&#x02019; lives, on their partners and on their relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although it is important for men and their partners to retain sexual viability after prostate cancer treatment, there are currently no guidelines for helping men and couples manage post-treatment sexual health. As a result, couples seldom receive the help they need in this aspect of prostate cancer survivorship.</p><p id="Par27">While sexuality has biopsychosocial components, current management of the sexual side effects of prostate cancer treatment focuses only on treating treatment-related physiologic dysfunction &#x02013; ED - with various erectile aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Studies indicate that many men who stand to benefit from these treatments do not utilize them if the psychosocial aspects of sexuality are not addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The psychosocial aspects of sexuality include feelings about one&#x02019;s sexual function, ability to feel pleasure, confidence as a lover and skill with which to navigate a sexual relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some psychosocial factors can become potentially influential barriers to sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment, such as unrealistic expectations of functional recovery, lack of knowledge about sexual rehabilitation, unresolved grief about sexual losses, couple conflict, and extensive family responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Studies have shown that this biopsychosocial approach to post-prostate cancer sexual recovery can be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Patients and providers frequently lack an understanding of the complexity of sexuality, and are uncomfortable with the subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Providers are generally unprepared for these conversations and are unaware of sexual health resources. At times, they are uncertain about some available therapies. For example, although there is increasing evidence supporting the safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in some prostate cancer survivors, many providers are unsure about when to initiate therapy, or how to appropriately monitor patients on TRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Access to sexual health expertise that focuses not only on physiologic ED treatments but also on the psychosocial aspects of sexuality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] is frequently unavailable. Many insurances do not cover medications and devices as well as sexual dysfunction diagnoses despite the fact that those diagnoses are a part of the mental health insurance codes and their coverage could facilitate access to sexual health treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As a result, the healthcare system does not adequately support patients and partners in their pursuit of sexual health after prostate cancer treatment.</p><p id="Par29">Recognizing the multiple, overlapping barriers to sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment, researchers are designing interventions specifically aimed at improving sexual outcomes. Although small in number, interventions that have attempted to address the psychosocial aspects of sexuality have shown a number of positive outcomes such as stress reduction, temporary improvement in sexual function, increased knowledge about rehabilitation, more realistic expectations about the recovery of sexual function, use of pro-erectile aids and higher levels of relationship satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Studies have also shown that physical exercise can have a positive effect on the recovery of erectile function, and on the maintenance of a masculine self-image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Evidence continues to be mixed and the search for meaningful measurable outcomes is still in process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Beyond the development of suitable interventions for couples, other gaps exist. One such gap is the lack of dissemination of tested interventions in prostate cancer beyond the research setting. Another is the lack of research that incorporates important sociodemographic factors, cultural differences, and sexual orientation that may impact sexual recovery after prostate cancer. There are very few studies about African American men with prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. There is a paucity of research on the attitudes of men from other racial/ethnic groups that may be used to inform the tailoring of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Similarly, research on gay men with prostate cancer has been largely missing in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], thus leaving as many as 11,000 gay men with prostate cancer each year without attention to their specific sexual health care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There is no research on the effect of prostate cancer-related sexual dysfunction on men who are not partnered. Finally, few studies focus on men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as health care providers may mistakenly assume that sexual recovery is not an important consideration for these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Preferences based on cultural background, sexual orientation, and an understanding of men on ADT need to be incorporated into sexual health interventions so that the interventions can be tailored to these survivors&#x02019; needs.</p><p id="Par31">Web-based interventions may be an important mode of delivery of sexual recovery interventions for prostate cancer survivors. They can address multiple barriers to dissemination and allow for a tailored approach. Although prostate cancer patients and partners are primarily an older cohort, they are frequently internet-literate and have shown a high interest in and ability to collaborate with providers online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Web-based interventions may be especially useful for patients who live far away from the clinic, for those for whom clinic visits may pose an economic burden (e.g., those whose travel costs are high or who have difficulty taking time away from work), and for those survivors who find topics such as sexual health difficult to approach in a face-to-face visit. A web-based approach has also been shown to be valuable to cancer patients with fewer social support resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In prostate cancer, couples, not just individual men with prostate cancer have also benefited from a web-based intervention aimed at reducing distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the setting of sexual recovery, an intimacy enhancement and psychoeducational sexual health intervention was shown to have been equally acceptable to patients in web-based and face-to-face formats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">In this manuscript, we describe a novel intervention that delivers web-based content for sexual recovery for men with prostate cancer. The intervention is tailored based on partnership status, treatment type and sexual orientation, with sensitivity to cultural differences. It is designed to allow men and their partners to participate in it together. We present the theoretical model which underlies the intervention approach. The study design, assessments, and analytic approach are also presented.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The national collaborative</title><p id="Par33">The Movember Foundation has collaborated with national non-profit organizations, such as the Livestrong Foundation (United States) and the Prostate Cancer Foundation (Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada) to offer funding to selected institutions with a clinical and research track record in prostate cancer survivorship. A Request for Proposals in the United States was issued in the fall of 2013, and 15 institutions were selected: Johns Hopkins University, Emory University, Harvard University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Moffitt Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, Los Angeles and Davis, University of Michigan, University of Washington, Oregon Health Sciences University, University of Colorado-Denver, Wayne State University, Duke University and University of North Carolina. In March 2014, representatives from the 15 institutions met to define priorities for interventions, and agreed to participate in building those interventions in which they had the most experience. Sexual Recovery was one of the priorities selected for intervention building.</p><p id="Par34">The Sexual Recovery Intervention was developed by a team (i.e., the Full Team) of sexual health experts, urologists, psychologists, health services researchers, epidemiologists, primary care physicians, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, nurses (one of these professionals is a survivor and another one is a partner), and survivor and partner advocates from 11 institutions (Emory University, University of Colorado-Denver, University of California-Los Angeles, Johns Hopkins University, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Michigan, Duke University, Memorial Sloan Kettering and Harvard University, University of North Carolina, University of California-San Francisco). A Design Team was established to write a proposal for intervention development and testing. It included a sexual health expert, a primary care physician, a urologist, and an internal medicine physician with expertise in information technology. The Full Team participated in monthly teleconferences and also provided regular electronic editorial contributions. After peer review by the Scientific Committee of the Movember Foundation, the protocol was amended and re-submitted for funding. Funding was assigned in March 2015.</p><p id="Par35">The intervention was developed at the University of Michigan, given the institution&#x02019;s expertise in sexual health and technology. However, the Design Team and the Full Team provided critical feedback during the development phase. The intervention is currently being tested in a multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving five institutions in the United States (Emory University, University of California-Los Angeles, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan). Plans are in progress to adapt the intervention in the United Kingdom.</p><p id="Par36">The intervention, once tested, will be integrated into a support structure for prostate cancer survivors, partners, and families, which will be available on the Movember Foundation website. The prioritized US interventions have a collective over-arching identity as True NTH (pronounced &#x02018;True North&#x02019;). Its goal is &#x0201c;to improve the physical and mental well-being of men living with prostate cancer, together with their partners, caregivers and families.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>A theoretical model of sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment</title><p id="Par37">The proposed web-based sexual recovery intervention is underpinned by a theoretical model that benefits from existing research. It was tested in a mixed methods study to ensure content validity by the principal investigator and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It is based on the biopsychosocial understanding of sexuality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Recognizing that ED and subsequent changed sexuality represent loss for both the man and the partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], the model incorporates concepts from the grief literature to suggest that sexual recovery includes, at least in part, a grief process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study overview</title><p id="Par38">The study&#x02019;s first step was to develop the intervention and conduct formative testing with 3 focus groups which included 4 heterosexual couples, 8 survivors and 8 partners, respectively. Two non-heterosexual couples were interviewed separately as we were unable to recruit for a full focus group. Usability testing was conducted with 5 couples and 5 individual survivors who commented, while working through the intervention, on the ease of use, relevance, content and graphics. The majority of the participants endorsed the web-based format and suggested that the intervention include preparation for the sexual side-effects, rehabilitation, preparation for the emotional impact of erectile dysfunction and diminished libido on couples, education for partners about the importance of erections to men, sensitivity to gay sex and education of providers regarding sexuality of men who have sex with men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the study process for the intervention group, starting prior to diagnosis with preparation for the sexual side-effects, their impacts and rehabilitation, and continuing with support for sexual recovery through 6&#x000a0;months after treatment (also the study completion). The figure also illustrates where the intervention modules of the TrueNTH Sexual Recovery Intervention will aim to affect the process of couples&#x02019; recovery. One of the modules (M10) coaches patients and partners to engage comfortably in discussions with healthcare providers about sexual problems and solutions. Finally, the figure includes measurement of the effect of the intervention on outcomes proposed in this protocol.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Tailored web-based intervention to support couples&#x02019; sexual recovery after treatment for localized prostate cancer (RCT of 6 modules in a pre-treatm6nt to 6-month post-treatment time-frame)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2017_3652_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par40">This study aims to evaluate the effect of 6 modules of the intervention in an RCT on patients&#x02019; and partners&#x02019; satisfaction with their sex life, compared to usual care at 6&#x000a0;month follow up.

If not, we will transform the data for this outcome to approximate normality. Since the primary outcome is measured on both patients and partners and randomization was done at the level of each dyad, we will assess the impact of the intervention using the Actor-Partner Interaction Model (APIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The APIM is a mixed-effects linear regression model that allows us to simultaneously estimate the association of partner characteristics with partner and patient outcomes, as well as simultaneously estimate the association of patient characteristics with both outcomes. The APIM incorporates random effects to account for the correlation between patient and partner outcomes from the same dyad. Our base model will contain (1) an indicator of intervention versus control, (2) baseline PROMIS Satisfaction with Sex Life, (3) a indicator of partner versus patient, (4) interaction terms of (3) with (1) and (2), (5) a random partner effect to account for variation among partners, (6) a random patient effect to account for variation among patients, and (7) a third random effect to account for the correlation (non-independence) between outcomes measured from the same dyad. From this base model, we can assess not only the relative impact of the intervention among dyads, but also the differential impact of the intervention on partners and partners.</p><p id="Par69">We can then expand our base model to include other partner characteristics and/or patient characteristics to assess whether or not these characteristics moderate or mediate the effect of the intervention for the patient and the partner. For example, we could include baseline satisfaction with sex life of the partner and the patient and see if either or both factors moderate or mediate the effect of the intervention on 6-month satisfaction with sex life. We note that because dyads were randomized to the intervention, we expect dyad level characteristics to have little effect in our model because those factors should be nearly balanced among the two treatment arms. Thus, adjustment for them is unnecessary, except to gain statistical power. The random effects will allow us to estimate the remaining variability of outcomes among partners, among patients, and the correlation of outcomes within each dyad, that is not explained by our APIM.</p><p id="Par70">All secondary endpoints will be analyzed with an APIM exactly as described for the primary endpoint. It is possible that some secondary endpoints, even after transformation, will have slightly skewed distributions. However, random effect models are fairly robust to slight deviations from normality.</p><p id="Par71">Along with outcome data analyses, we will conduct an analysis of the logistics of participant activity.

Adding 10%, or 14 dyads (including an extra one to get to an even number to allow the same sample size in each arm), to our total to account for the anticipated dyads that will be lost to follow-up prior to study completion, we will recruit 140 dyads (280 individuals) for this study (expected to be 70 couples on each study arm).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par73">The study will be coordinated by the University of Michigan, the protocol has been approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB) and by the IRBs of all the other participating sites.

It is based on an evidence-based theoretical model that incorporates both a biopsychosocial approach to sexuality and the grief process, as a path to recovery. Unlike any previous sexual health intervention, it is interactive and has a personalized approach achieved through tailoring to treatment, partnership and sexual orientation. When fully implemented, it will provide support for men with prostate cancer and their partners along the trajectory of the illness, including during disease progression and in the metastatic stage. This approach recognizes both the hard work that men and couples undertake when they desire to maintain their sexual viability after prostate cancer treatment, and the fact that men and partners benefit from staying close during all phases of illness. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] Patients&#x02019; and partners&#x02019; quest to maintain sexual intimacy will be reinforced by modules that provide coaching for discussions of sexual concerns between the patient, partner and healthcare provider and alert them to barriers to sexual recovery with relevant strategies.</p><p id="Par75">The evaluation of the intervention is also innovative. In particular, we are investigating satisfaction with sex life, which may be applicable to a broad array of men, including older men and their partners who may be able to attain/maintain satisfaction with their sex life despite compromised sexual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Furthermore, the study includes many variables that are critical and relevant to a successful sexual recovery, such as sexual function, grief about the loss of sexual function, dyadic coping, knowledge acquisition, some of which have been primary outcomes in previous studies. Finally, our analytic approach allows us to evaluate the couple which experiences prostate cancer as a unit with reciprocal influence on each other&#x02019;s outcomes. Our goal is to provide an accessible, comprehensive and individually relevant supportive structure for recovery from this well-recognized long-term treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and to contribute positively to patients&#x02019; and partners&#x02019; quality of life in survivorship. When the study is completed, we plan to publish the findings. Subsequently, the intervention will be modified, as needed, based on study findings and offered in full on the Movember Foundation-True NTH website to all prostate cancer survivors and their partners.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACS</term><def><p id="Par6">American Cancer Society</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADT</term><def><p id="Par7">Androgen deprivation therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>APIM</term><def><p id="Par8">Actor-Partner Interaction Model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCI</term><def><p id="Par9">Charlson Comorbidities Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHCR</term><def><p id="Par10">Center for Health Communications Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCI</term><def><p id="Par11">Dyadic Coping Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p id="Par12">Erectile dysfunction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPIC</term><def><p id="Par13">Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p id="Par14">European Quality of Life &#x02013; 5 Dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Est.</term><def><p id="Par16">Estimated</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSFI</term><def><p id="Par17">Female Sexual Function Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQOL</term><def><p id="Par18">Health Related Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IIEF</term><def><p id="Par19">International Index of Erectile Function</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p id="Par20">Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PROMIS</term><def><p id="Par21">Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QOL</term><def><p id="Par22">Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par23">Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRT</term><def><p id="Par24">Testosterone replacement therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par25">Visual Analog Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par76">The funding for the study was awarded by the Movember Foundation.
