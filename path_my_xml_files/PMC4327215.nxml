In flattened canals, tissue remnants can persist in recesses and ramifications<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. According to Wu, et al.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (2000) the buccal and lingual extensions of flattened root canals are areas of difficult instrumentation and filling. The success of root canal therapy depends directly on how effectively all phases of the endodontic treatment (i.e., shaping, cleaning, disinfection and obturation) are performed.</p><p>Several techniques have been used for biomechanical preparation. However, due to the limitations of conventional techniques in working in curved and flattened canals, some crown-down techniques have been recently investigated in order to provide a more efficient canal preparation. Complete biomechanical preparation with stainless steel instruments involves a high risk of perforating or significantly weakening the root. On the other hand, it seems questionable whether highly flexible Ni-Ti instruments allow a controlled preparation of canal extensions<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>Ni-Ti rotary instrumentation has been shown to have a limited area of action. Due to their super-elasticity, it is known that NiTi instruments cannot be pressed against the root canal walls, leaving the polar areas of flattened root canals uninstrumented. It is likely that pathogenic microorganisms remain lodged in these areas. Flattened root canals do not allow a great widening of canal diameter without the risk of creating lateral perforations. A change of instrumentation techniques should also be considered<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>The oscillatory movement or the movement of balanced forces has presented superior results to the filing movements. This movement can be manually executed or can be done using special handpieces that currently have a prominent place in endodontic practice causing a lower incidence of canal transportation and better centralization of the prepared root canal<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>The Endo-Eze AET oscillatory system (Anatomic Endodontic Technology &#x02013; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) has been recently released to the market with the objective of yielding cleaning and shaping of root canals using the root canal anatomy as a guide and hence preserving the dental structure.

<italic>In vitro</italic> Evaluation Preparation of teeth</title><p>The teeth were decoronated with a 40-mm diamond disc (KG Sorensen, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) at the cementoenamel junction. A #10 stainless steel K-file (Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) was then passively introduced into the canal until its tip was seen at the apical foramen. The instrument was retracted 1 mm to determine the working length (WL) by the visual method. Mesiodistal and buccolingual radiographs were taken to confirm the existence of only one root canal.</p><p>The teeth had the apices and coronal openings sealed with sticky wax and were placed inside a PVC ring (25 mm in diameter; 25 mm in height) that was filled with crystal-clear orthophtalic polyester resin (Polyfibras - Bahia - Brazil) at a ratio of 10% monomer <italic>per</italic> kilogram of resin. The PVC ring had its base perforated to allow the placement of a thread and a screw (Fischer&#x000d2; MQR 19, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) with the purpose of facilitating the removal of the sections for undertaking photographs during the experiment<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1a and 1b</xref>).

The following sequence of instruments belonging to the &#x0201c;Shaping Files&#x0201d; set was used. First, the oscillatory S1 file (yellow shank, D0 = 10 mm, taper 2.5%) was used at WL until it became loose into the canal. This file was followed by the SC instrument (red shank, D0 = 13 mm, taper 3.5%), the S2 instrument (blue shank, D0 = 13 mm, taper 4.5%) and the S3 instrument (green shank, D0 = 13mm, taper 6%). After using the oscillatory files, the apical third was instrumented using manual files belonging to &#x0201c;Apical Files&#x0201d; set of the system (#15 to #30).</p><p>In Group 2, the teeth were instrumented using RaCe rotary system (FKG Dentaire) according to the crown-down technique in the following sequence: Pre-RaCe 40.08, RaCe 35.02, 30.04, 30.02, 25.04 and 25.02. Apical preparation was completed with RaCe 25.04 or 30.02 files, depending on root canal anatomy.

However, despite the limitations of the conventional techniques in working in curved and flattened canals, crown-down techniques have been recently proposed with the aim of achieving a more efficient preparation.</p><p>The quality of the biomechanical preparation is related to the internal anatomical characteristics of the root canal system<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Manual crown-down instrumentation techniques have been more effective in cleaning mesiodistally flattened root canals than rotary techniques.</p><p>In this study, the root canals that had mesiodistal flattening and were instrumented with the RaCe rotary system presented changes in their original anatomy with the formation of a protuberance in the mesiodistal direction, leaving the walls of the isthmus uninstrumented. This showed that the rotary instrumentation had a limited working area, in according with previous studies<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>The flexibility of the NiTi instruments does not allow a controlled instrumentation of the buccal and lingual extensions of flattened canals. These instruments frequently produce a circular protuberance in the root canals, maintaining the extensions uninstrumented<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>Wu and Wesselink<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> (2001) also demonstrated that, after biomechanical preparation of mandibular incisors with oval root canals using balanced force, 65% of the canals presented non-instrumented isthmuses.</p><p>In the present study, the group instrumented with the rotary system had better results in the apical third, with only two sections having non-instrumented buccal and lingual extensions (isthmuses) versus six middle third sections This may be attributed to the fact that most flattened root canals become more round towards the apex, as previously shown in a study with extracted teeth<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p>Several automated systems that connect different types of files to different handpieces are being introduced to Endodontics. Amongst these are the alternating systems that use oscillatory movements, which have been described as the best type of movement for biomechanical preparation of flattened root canals<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>Endo-Eze instruments have recently been introduced to the market and, according to its manufacturer, the use of stainless steel instruments attached to an oscillatory handpiece allows the preparation of oval anatomical irregularities of root canals, thus cleaning the intracanal space without weakening the root.</p><p>In this study, the oscillatory system (Endo-Eze) was used in flattened root canals to allow comparisons with the data of previous studies<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, which carried out similar studies under the same conditions using similar techniques, but used rotary NiTi instead.</p><p>The present study evaluated the amount of uninstrumented root canal area after biomechanical preparation using the oscillatory technique. Our results were better than those of previous studies that used rotary instrumentation in flattened root canals and found that the rotary instrumentation was not capable of reaching all the root canal walls<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. In this study, the number of sections that maintained the original root canal shape when using the oscillatory technique in middle third was statistically significant (9 sections), if compared to the rotary technique (section 1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>). In the apical third, both techniques maintained the original root canal shape. This result disagree with those of Camargo<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> (2004), according to whom Endo-Eze instrumentation caused greater displacement of root canal center than the RaCe instrumentation in the apical third of artificial premolars.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Under the tested conditions, Endo-Eze oscillatory system yielded the
