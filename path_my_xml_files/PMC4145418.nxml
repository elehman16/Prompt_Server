The primary end point was ACR20 at Week 12. Secondary endpoints included ACR50, ACR70, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (C reactive protein). Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy in population subgroups were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response compared with placebo was significantly higher for sarilumab 150&#x02005;mg qw (72.0% vs 46.2%, multiplicity adjusted p=0.0203). Higher ACR20 responses were also attained with 150&#x02005;mg q2w (67%; unadjusted (nominal) p=0.0363) and 200&#x02005;mg q2w (65%; unadjusted p=0.0426) versus placebo. Sarilumab &#x02265;150&#x02005;mg q2w reduced C reactive protein, which did not return to baseline between dosing intervals. Infections were the most common adverse event; none were serious. Changes in laboratory values (neutropenia, transaminases and lipids) were consistent with reports with other IL-6R&#x003b1; inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Sarilumab improved signs and symptoms of RA over 12&#x02005;weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe RA with a safety profile similar to reports with other IL-6 inhibitors. Sarilumab 150&#x02005;mg and sarilumab 200&#x02005;mg q2w had the most favourable efficacy, safety and dosing convenience and are being further evaluated in Phase III.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rheumatoid Arthritis</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>DMARDs (biologic)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>editors-choice</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Therapies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have evolved from symptomatic treatments to non-biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

ACR20 response rate was analysed using the two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by prior biological use and geographical region. Pairwise comparisons for the response rates between each dose of sarilumab and placebo were derived by testing each active dose group versus placebo separately. The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the OR and the corresponding 95% CI were derived by testing each active dose group versus placebo separately.

An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, including terms for baseline, treatment, prior biological use and region, was used to assess treatment differences in the change from baseline for each of the seven ACR components and for DAS28(CRP). Descriptive statistics and post hoc correction for multiplicity in the secondary efficacy end points of ACR50 and ACR70 are provided in the online supplement.

Of the five sarilumab doses and regimens investigated, the lowest cumulative monthly dose (100&#x02005;mg q2w) was ineffective; all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in this group, as well as safety and PK and PD assessments were similar to placebo. Among the four remaining sarilumab doses and regimens, ACR20 responses ranged from 62% to 72%. Of note, the overall efficacy of 150&#x02005;mg and 200&#x02005;mg q2w dosing was similar to that observed with 100&#x02005;mg and 150&#x02005;mg qw dosing. For example, all four of these groups had statistically significant improvements in DAS28(CRP) reduction. In addition, secondary endpoints showed that responses achieved with 200&#x02005;mg q2w were numerically similar to and, in some cases, greater than the highest sarilumab dose (150&#x02005;mg qw).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Furthermore, the exploratory results for CDAI support the efficacy of sarilumab at Week 12. Because this Phase II dose ranging study (MOBILITY part A) was limited in its scope, duration and sample size, results of secondary or exploratory efficacy endpoints (eg, ACR50, ACR70 and CDAI) and subgroup analyses will require confirmation in the larger Phase III portion of the operationally seamless MOBILITY study (part B).</p><p>Acute phase reactants as well as IL-6 levels are typically elevated in patients with RA.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As expected, based on its inhibition of IL-6 signalling, the effective sarilumab doses reduced the CRP concentration by more than 90% relative to baseline throughout the dosing interval with qw and q2w dosing.</p><p>In the current study, the four effective doses (those above 100 mg q2w) had trough levels of functional sarilumab above zero throughout the tested time points. Although these levels were higher in the qw dosing regimens compared with the q2w regimens, the q2w regimens had similar effects on suppressing acute phase reactants such as CRP throughout the dosing interval and on clinical endpoints such as ACR20, 50, 70 and DAS28(CRP) reduction.</p><p>The transient increase in circulating IL-6 concentrations early in the treatment period was smaller in the q2w doses compared with the qw doses. A similar relationship between drug exposure levels and elevation in serum IL-6 has been reported for tocilizumab, and may be due to receptor blockade.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The relationship among sarilumab dose regimens, sarilumab trough levels, and changes in CRP in MOBILITY Part A is consistent with data reported in a Phase I study in patients with RA.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Those results show that sarilumab PK is characterised as non-linear, consistent with an initial absorption phase, followed by a saturating &#x003b2; phase and a subsequent terminal target-mediated elimination phase. Patients in the higher dose groups had higher functional sarilumab concentrations. In addition, preclinical studies comparing sarilumab with tocilizumab demonstrated that sarilumab had a higher relative binding affinity for IL-6R&#x003b1;, and blocked IL-6R&#x003b1; activation, and inhibited IL-6-induced cellular responses such as cell proliferation at lower concentrations than tocilizumab.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Overall, sarilumab PK characteristics and its high binding affinity support q2w dosing as confirmed by the efficacy observed in the present Phase II study with the 150 mg and 200&#x02005;mg q2w regimens.</p><p>Of note is the high ACR20 placebo response rate of 46%, which is consistent with the placebo response rate reported in a tocilizumab dose ranging study.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The underlying cause of the high placebo response rate is unclear. In this study, patients were required to have received MTX for a minimum of 3&#x02005;months and stable for at least 6&#x02005;weeks prior to the screening visit, and then continued MTX according to the study dosing schedule for the duration of the study. As suggested by the investigators in the Chugai Humanized Anti-Human Recombinant Interleukin-6 Monoclonal Antibody (CHARISMA) study, extending the time period during which patients received stable MTX prior to trial entry may reduce the high placebo rate.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Confirmation of the efficacy of sarilumab relative to placebo will be sought in larger studies of longer duration currently being conducted in sarilumab&#x02019;s global Phase III program.</p><p>In this study, sarilumab exhibited a safety profile consistent with that observed previously with other anti-IL-6 therapies.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Laboratory changes were primarily neutropenia and increases in liver function tests and serum lipids. As observed with other biologicals, non-serious infections were the most commonly reported AEs. There were no serious infections observed in this 12&#x02005;week study. Also, consistent with results for other IL-6 inhibitors,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> in patients treated with sarilumab, there was no clear association between rates of infection and decreases in neutrophil counts. This suggests that the observed effect on peripheral neutrophil counts may not have overt clinical or functional consequences. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism of this change in peripheral neutrophil counts associated with blockade of IL-6 signalling. An increase in transaminases (ALT and AST) was associated with sarilumab treatment. In this study, no cases of Hy's law (elevation of ALT/AST &#x02265;3&#x000d7; ULN plus total bilirubin &#x0003e;2&#x000d7; ULN) were observed.

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The aetiology of these changes is not understood. LDL and HDL cholesterol increases were observed with sarilumab doses higher than 100&#x02005;mg q2w.

Among these doses, the efficacy findings, as well as the PK and PD parameters, showed that the every other week dosing regimens (150&#x02005;mg and 200&#x02005;mg q2w) were as effective as the weekly dosing regimens (100&#x02005;mg and 150&#x02005;mg qw). Sarilumab was generally well tolerated, with changes in neutrophil counts and trends for other safety lab parameters favouring q2w dosing. In light of the above and the convenience of every other week dosing, the 150&#x02005;mg and 200&#x02005;mg q2w doses are being assessed in multiple Phase III studies in patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-204405-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1690" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants, staff and co-investigators at participating centres.
