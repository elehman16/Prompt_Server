Over 5 years, insulin use increased to 32% (21% also taking oral agents). Use of oral agents remained similar at 56%. Only 2% of patients at baseline and 4% after 5 years were taking oral agents other than metformin or sulfonylureas.

Progression means that this therapeutic intervention needs to be adjusted over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Insulin resistance and &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction, the metabolic defects that characterize type 2 diabetes, occur early in its pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and lead to increased hepatic glucose production and impairment of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. A continuing decline in &#x003b2;-cell function underlies the worsening hyperglycemia that generally occurs in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), inducing the need for progressive intensification of hypoglycemic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Conventional management often includes multiple oral hypoglycemic agents, particularly metformin and sulfonylureas, and then insulin, usually only when the oral treatments are no longer effective, because insulin therapy can lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), glycemic control progressively deteriorated over time, despite intensive therapy including insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This outcome is supported by findings from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which showed in clinical practice from 1988 to 2000 that combined therapy with oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin increased in adults with type 2 diabetes but failed to control glycemia adequately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>The main focus of the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial was whether fenofibrate could reduce cardiovascular disease risk in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). There was no protocol for management of glycemic control, which was managed by the patients&#x02019; usual doctors. The study therefore incidentally allowed us to assess the outcomes of real-world diabetes care, mainly in primary care, from 63 different areas in Australia, New Zealand, and Finland. The aim of the current analysis was to track the history of type 2 diabetes and to investigate the progression of type 2 diabetes and consequent changes in treatment. Because few patients were treated with agents for glycemic control other than metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin, this study addresses the question of the adequacy of standard, established therapy to maintain satisfactory glycemic control. The effects of intensified therapy on weight gain were also analyzed.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Subjects</title><p>The FIELD study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fenofibrate therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We recruited patients aged 50&#x02013;75 years with type 2 diabetes according to World Health Organization criteria from 63 centers in Australia, New Zealand, and Finland between February 1998 and November 2000. Of 13,900 patients screened, 9,795 were randomized to comicronized fenofibrate (200 mg daily) or placebo. Reasons for exclusion during the run-in period before randomization are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1307/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>.</p><p>Participants were followed up every 4 months in the first year and then every 6 months for an average of 5 years for the development of cardiovascular events until the study closed in 2005. All had an initial plasma total cholesterol concentration of 3.0&#x02013;6.5 mmol/L, plus total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio of 4.0 or higher, or plasma triglyceride of 1.0&#x02013;5.0 mmol/L, and did not require lipid-modifying therapy. The study excluded those with renal impairment (plasma creatinine &#x0003e;130 &#x003bc;mol/L), chronic liver disease, or symptomatic gallbladder disease, or those who had a cardiovascular event within the 3 months before recruitment.</p><p>Many participants were recruited from community-based sources through national diabetes registers, but hospital-treated patients were also recruited. There was no requirement for a prior hospital admission related to diabetes. Diabetes care remained in the hands of patients&#x02019; usual doctors, mostly in the primary care setting, rather than the doctors involved in the trial. There was no protocol for diabetes management. The 4,900 patients in the nonintervention arm allocated to placebo were the subjects of this study to obviate any potential confounding effect of fenofibrate therapy on glycemia.</p><p>All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the FIELD study, which was undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by local and national ethics committees.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Protocol</title><p>Body weight and blood pressure were measured at each visit, and concomitant medication was recorded. Plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were measured at baseline on two occasions, then annually, and at study end. Insulin levels were measured at baseline, 2 years, 5 years, and at study end. All adverse events, including cardiovascular and microvascular complications as well as major hypoglycemic episodes, were recorded at each visit.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Normally distributed variables are displayed as means and standard deviations, and non-normally distributed variables as medians and interquartile ranges.

Analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Although the overall type I error might be inflated and appropriate caution should be taken in interpreting the results, testing a global null hypothesis was not the primary interest in this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

At the time of the FIELD study, HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7.0% was the accepted level for glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and good practice toward this goal is reflected by the median HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.1% at which oral hypoglycemic therapy was commenced. Oral hypoglycemic therapy was not associated with weight gain, and the cohort overall lost weight during the study.</p><p>The median HbA<sub>1c</sub> for initiation of insulin therapy was 8.2%. There are many barriers to the initiation of insulin, including the well-recognized associated weight gain, which averaged 4.6 kg over 5 years, similar to the reported 4.0-kg gain in the UKPDS in those using older, long-acting insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The pattern of diabetes therapy reported here aligns with the recent consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes on the medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Few patients took oral hypoglycemic agents other than metformin or sulfonylureas. The data reflect the effectiveness of usual diabetes care in this large patient cohort distributed across 63 districts of Australia, New Zealand, and Finland. These countries have comparable health care systems: there is universal health insurance and they are primary-care led, with family medicine practitioners as the first point of contact. However, patients were recruited mainly through voluntary national diabetes registers and hospital-based diabetes clinics and volunteered to participate in a long-term study, possibly a more motivated patient group. Also, participation in any clinical trial may in itself lead to a greater emphasis on diabetes management by both patient and doctor. Nevertheless, the HbA<sub>1c</sub> thresholds at which oral therapy and insulin were introduced and their subsequent effectiveness were similar to those in an Australian community-based longitudinal observation study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and the participants are representative of patient cohorts that take part in studies of new diabetes therapies.</p><p>During the past 10 years, the UKPDS has been the most widely quoted example of a study showing that type 2 diabetes progresses despite intensive treatment with standard therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Even in the UKPDS intensive-treatment arm, HbA<sub>1c</sub> rose progressively by about 0.75% over 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and this deterioration is seen to show a need for newer treatments for type 2 diabetes. Progression of type 2 diabetes was also evidenced by a more recent study of three forms of oral hypoglycemic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and the difficulty of combating it has been reflected in textbook statements such as, &#x0201c;No cohort of patients of substantial size has ever been reported in which an average HbA<sub>1c</sub> level less than 7% has been achieved over a time frame that exceeds more than a few months&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>There were some differences in diabetes treatment between the UKPDS and the nonintervention arm of the FIELD study. The UKPDS used older sulfonylureas, which have a greater propensity to lead to hypoglycemia. Not many patients were on combination therapy because a separate arm of the study used metformin in overweight patients. In addition, very long-acting beef insulin was generally used, and self-monitoring of blood glucose was not available for a significant part of the study. In the nonintervention arm of the FIELD study, combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylureas was widely used, and oral agents were usually continued with insulin.</p><p>Several more recent studies have also demonstrated maintenance of glycemic control over 3 to 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In two of these, there was widespread background use of thiazolidinediones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), which have also been associated with problematic weight gain, overt heart failure, and osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Hypoglycemia was also a significant clinical problem in these trials. Therefore, insulin-sparing agents that achieve glycemic control without weight gain or hypoglycemia represent ideal therapy for type 2 diabetes. Incretin-based therapies offer this prospect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and the current outcome studies will be important to determine their effectiveness in diabetes care.</p><p>In conclusion, standard pharmacologic therapy for type 2 diabetes with metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin in the setting of nationally coordinated, primary health care&#x02013;led health systems, can achieve glycemic control consistent in most patients with current guidelines. Because this goal was achieved at the expense of significant weight gain and hypoglycemia, newer insulin-sparing treatments for type 2 diabetes might offer important advantages for maintenance of long-term glycemic control.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1307/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1307/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The FIELD study was supported by grants from Laboratoires Fournier SA, Dijon, France (subsequently part of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, which is now part of Abbott Laboratories) and the NHMRC of Australia, and was coordinated independently by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
