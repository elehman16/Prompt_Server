This was an open&#x02010;label, randomized, 4&#x02010;period, cross&#x02010;over study in adult subjects with drug&#x02010;induced xerostomia and documented hyposalivation. During each of the four 1&#x02010;day periods, one product (one of three DC161 formulations or the comparator) was applied at T0 and then at T4h (before a meal). Mouth dryness and related symptoms were evaluated by the subject on a 100&#x02010;mm visual analog scale. The primary efficacy criterion was the area under the curve of the dry mouth evaluation (baseline to T4h) after the first application. The oral mucosa was examined by a dental specialist; tolerability and product acceptability were assessed by the subject. Twenty&#x02010;four subjects were randomized and completed the study. Despite large variability in data among the products, the selected aqueous formulation &#x02013; DC161&#x02010;DP0292 &#x02013; reduced the intensity of dryness of mouth at least as well as the comparator; DC161&#x02010;DP0292 provided a fast relief and a long&#x02010;lasting effect on mouth dryness. Both products improved other symptoms such as swallowing and speaking, even when applied just prior to a meal. DC161&#x02010;DP0292 was well tolerated and rated by subjects as providing a slightly higher acceptability of taste/aftertaste, texture, and lubricating effect than the comparator. No clinically relevant signs were reported for any product following the oral examination. DC161&#x02010;DP0292 provides fast and long&#x02010;acting symptomatic relief and is a relevant new treatment for drug&#x02010;induced xerostomia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="cre229-kwd-0001">Efficacy</kwd><kwd id="cre229-kwd-0002">oral spray</kwd><kwd id="cre229-kwd-0003">safety</kwd><kwd id="cre229-kwd-0004">tolerability</kwd><kwd id="cre229-kwd-0005">xerostomia</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="4312"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>cre229</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>November 2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:version=5.3.2.2 mode:remove_FC converted:05.03.2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

</p></notes></front><body><sec id="cre229-sec-0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dry mouth or xerostomia, a symptom of salivary hypofunction, is a common side effect of many medications and is also associated with various medical conditions. As the number of prescribed drugs increases with age, drug&#x02010;induced salivary hypofunction and dry mouth complaints become an increasing health problem. More than 500 commonly used medications can cause xerostomia; these include antidepressants, antihypertensives, opiates, bronchodilators, proton&#x02010;pump inhibitors, antipsychotics, antihistamines, diuretics, antineoplastics, and others (Gupta <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Mouly <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>).</p><p>Estimates of the prevalence of persistent dry mouth vary between 10% and 50%. Prevalence is conservatively estimated as approximately 20% in the general population, with increased prevalence in women (up to 30%) and in the elderly (up to 50%) (Orellana <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Hopcraft and Tan, <xref rid="cre229-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Villa and Abati, <xref rid="cre229-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Dry mouth is often attributed to increased prevalence of chronic illnesses that require pharmacological treatments with dry mouth as a side effect (Porter <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Thelin <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Although salivary flow does not necessarily decrease with age, the synergistic effects of combining medications also contribute to xerostomia, and therefore, the elderly are more likely to suffer from dry mouth. Thus, while drug&#x02010;induced xerostomia is generally reversible, the disorders for which these medications are prescribed are frequently chronic.</p><p>A wide range of therapies are available for the management of xerostomia, including sialagogues and saliva substitutes, as well as general measures like sipping water or chewing gum. However, the effectiveness of many available agents is controversial, and few have been tested in controlled clinical trials. To address this concern, Pierre Fabre Medical Devices has developed three formulations (two aqueous and one oily) of a new oral spray, DC161, which acts as a saliva substitute for the treatment of xerostomia in adults. The aim of these formulations is to act as temporary substitutes for saliva by recreating its physical action without disturbing the oral environment. Their mechanisms of action vary according to the different physical and chemical properties of their components.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of these three DC161 formulations and an active comparator &#x02013; Aequasyal&#x000ae; oral spray (Caril&#x000e8;ne Laboratory, Montesson, France), a marketed oily saliva substitute &#x02013; allowing comparison of outcomes based on the product formulation. Relief of drug&#x02010;induced xerostomia and other associated symptoms and the effects on the oral mucosa were assessed, as well as local tolerability and product acceptability.</p></sec><sec id="cre229-sec-0006"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="cre229-sec-0007"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>This was an exploratory, randomized, open&#x02010;label, active&#x02010;controlled, 4&#x02010;period, cross&#x02010;over study conducted at a single center in Germany between 7 January 2014 and 21 February 2014. The study was approved by the Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Th&#x000fc;ringen Ethics Committee on 28 November 2013, and performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPMP/ICH/135/95), and the EN ISO 14155 (2011) standard for medical devices. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to study participation. The study (EUDAMED no.

Most of these subjects were taking chronic medications like beta blockers, antacids, anticholinergics, and psychotropic drugs. Subjects were also required to have a score of &#x02265;40&#x02009;mm on a 100&#x02009;mm visual analog scale (VAS) rating dryness of mouth and documented hyposalivation (resting saliva weight &#x02264;0.5&#x02009;g absorbed over 5&#x02009;min using a swab method) (Navazesh and Christensen, <xref rid="cre229-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1982</xref>). Exclusion criteria included bucco&#x02010;dental disease, which may have interfered with study conduct; history of head and neck irradiation and cancer chemotherapy; Sj&#x000f6;gren syndrome and related autoimmune diseases or other medical causes of xerostomia (oral candidiasis); or a history of major medical/psychiatric illness or surgery.</p><p>Eligible subjects were equally randomized to one of four treatment sequence groups (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, or DCAB; where A&#x02009;=&#x02009;Aequasyal&#x000ae;, B&#x02009;=&#x02009;DC161&#x02010;DP0291, C&#x02009;=&#x02009;DC161&#x02010;DP0292, and D&#x02009;=&#x02009;DC161&#x02010;DP0293) according to a computer&#x02010;generated randomization list provided by the <italic>Institut de Recherche Pierre Fabre</italic>.

If the dry mouth condition becomes chronic, it may lead to important oral pathological changes, with increased risk of infections and caries (Porter <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). In addition, dry mouth can have a marked negative impact on the patient's quality of life as a result of the impairment of oral functions. Age and polypharmacy play a very important role in patients with xerostomia (Porter <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Thelin <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Consequently, in elderly patients, particularly those over 65&#x02009;years of age, saliva substitutes represent the best palliative management option, although no ideal artificial saliva has been developed to date. Existing products replace the components and functions inherent to natural saliva, which are impaired as a result of dry mouth. Because of their lack of undesirable effects, saliva substitutes can be used for prolonged time periods as palliative or coadjuvant treatment, depending on the severity of hyposialia. Likewise, these products can be used as often as required and are adaptable to the needs of the individual patient and degree of oral dryness (Silvestre <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, three formulations (two aqueous and one oily) of DC161 oral spray, a new saliva substitute, and an active comparator, Aequasyal&#x000ae; oral spray (oily), were assessed for clinical efficacy in terms of their relief on drug&#x02010;induced xerostomia and other associated symptoms. The subjective intensity of various symptoms was self&#x02010;assessed by the subject using a 100&#x02009;mm VAS, a validated and well&#x02010;described assessment tool.</p><p>Taking into account the overall variability of the data, as well as the sample size, only slight differences between the products could be deduced from the primary criterion, VAS item No. 04 &#x0201c;Dryness of your mouth&#x0201d;. None of the three DC161 formulations showed a statistically significant difference in effect versus the comparator. However, only the DC161&#x02010;DP0292 aqueous formulation (Elgydium Clinic Dry Mouth) showed a reduction in intensity of dryness of mouth versus the comparator (&#x02212;935.00 [SE: 577.70; 95% CI: &#x02212;2088.42, 218.42]) and was therefore selected for overall comparison. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the two products, the maximum effect on dryness of mouth following the first product application was marginally higher for DC161&#x02010;DP0292 than the comparator and occurred 5&#x02009;min earlier. The onset of action, defined as a clinically relevant mean reduction of 20% from baseline, was observed within the first 5&#x02009;min in 75% of subjects for DC161&#x02010;DP0292 (62.5% for the comparator).</p><p>Dry mouth is a sign as well as a symptom and is usually accompanied by generalized discomfort, eating and speaking disturbance (Eveson, <xref rid="cre229-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). As expected, the secondary criteria evaluated in this study showed an improvement in other symptoms, including swallowing and speaking, consistent with a reduction in mouth dryness. These effects were also observed when the spray was applied just before a meal (second product application).</p><p>Optimal topical treatment in xerostomia should provide fast relief and a long&#x02010;lasting effect, although published evidence in the literature is quite variable. For example, in one study (Silvestre <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="cre229-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), around 50% of patients showed immediate improvement with a new artificial saliva spray, and the average duration of effect was 15.3&#x02009;min. For Mouly <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="cre229-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), improvement with saliva spray was only achieved from the second day for most patients, and average duration of effect was over 4&#x02009;h. In our study, DC161&#x02010;DP0292 had a long duration of clinically relevant action (1&#x02009;h 29&#x02009;min&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;h 18&#x02009;min), similar to that of the comparator (1&#x02009;h 08&#x02009;min&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;h 29&#x02009;min).</p><p>The main study limitation was use of a subjective evaluation of dry mouth symptoms, which likely contributed to the large variability in responses observed between formulations. In addition, evaluations were performed after only two applications of each product and in a limited number of subjects, and these factors should therefore be taken into consideration. As the study was not blinded, both the investigator and subjects were aware of the formulations being investigated and could bias the subjective assessments. Also as the scheme of application differed between the test products and comparator, it was not blinded; however, subjects were randomized in four different sequence groups to test all four products, allowing comparison of all three DC161 formulations with the comparator. This study was designed as an exploratory study, and the analysis was not planned to be demonstrative (no rationale for sample size).</p><p>Topical treatment response in general depends directly on patient compliance, which can be jeopardized by poor local tolerability and acceptability. Discomfort sensations, as well as ease of use and flavor, are important factors to evaluate for the treatment of dry mouth with artificial saliva. In the study by Silvestre <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="cre229-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), flavor was rated as favorable by almost 50% of the test subjects. In the present study, besides very good local tolerability, the subject self&#x02010;rated assessment indicated that DC161&#x02010;DP0292 provided a slightly higher acceptability of taste/aftertaste, texture, and lubricating effect versus the comparator. In patients with xerostomia, because the properties of saliva are usually impaired, a saliva substitute not only maintains mouth humidity but also promotes a lubricating effect and therefore prevents the disorders related to impaired saliva secretion (Humphrey and Williamson, <xref rid="cre229-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cre229-sec-0022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study in 24 subjects with drug&#x02010;induced xerostomia was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three different new oral spray formulations of DC161 (two aqueous and one oily) and an active comparator Aequasyal&#x000ae; (oily). In general, analysis of the primary criterion showed that despite large variability among the products, the selected aqueous formulation &#x02013; DC161&#x02010;DP0292 &#x02013; could reduce the intensity of dryness of mouth at least as well as the comparator: DC161&#x02010;DP0292 provided fast relief and a long&#x02010;lasting effect on mouth dryness. Both DC161&#x02010;DP0292 and the comparator improved other symptoms associated with dry mouth such as swallowing and speaking, even when applied just before a meal. The DC161&#x02010;DP0292 formulation was well tolerated and rated by subjects as providing a slightly higher acceptability of taste/aftertaste, texture, and lubricating effect than the comparator. This new oral spray, presented as an aqueous formulation, DC1661&#x02010;DP0292, is therefore considered to be a relevant treatment for drug&#x02010;induced xerostomia, providing fast and long&#x02010;acting symptomatic relief while potentially improving patient compliance.</p></sec><sec id="cre229-sec-0024"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>F.&#x02009;D. is an employee of SocraTec R&#x00026;D, a company that received payment for study monitoring and medical writing.
