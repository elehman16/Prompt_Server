In clinical trials, combination therapy with the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agent etanercept (ETN) with the synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) methotrexate (MTX) has been shown to be superior to ETN and MTX as monotherapy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> However, in the open-label ADd Enbrel Or REplace methotrexate (ADORE) study of patients with an inadequate response to MTX monotherapy, similar clinical responses were observed following ETN monotherapy or treatment with ETN+MTX.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Combination therapy with ETN and MTX is recommended in patients with RA who fail to reach the treatment target, remission or low disease activity (LDA) with synthetic DMARDs, particularly when poor prognostic markers are present.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> For patients with previous intolerance to MTX, ETN monotherapy may be considered.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> When combined with ETN, MTX is usually administered in doses ranging from 7.5 to 25.0&#x02005;mg/week.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In patients who develop intolerable side effects to MTX during combination therapy, MTX may be discontinued or its dosage reduced.

<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> To date, comparable efficacy of ETN across different dosages of concomitant MTX has not been established in patients with early to established active RA. The purpose of the current post hoc analysis of patients&#x02019; data from two previous ETN trials was therefore to evaluate the impact of MTX dosage on clinical, functional and quality of life (QoL) outcomes in patients with RA after 24&#x02005;months of treatment with ETN and different doses of MTX.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Data were pooled from two ETN clinical trials&#x02014;COmbination of Methotrexate and ETanercept in Active Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (COMET) and Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate with Radiographic Patient Outcomes (TEMPO).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In both trials, a group of patients were randomised to receive double-blinded MTX monotherapy or a combination of ETN+MTX for 24&#x02005;months consecutively.

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> At the week 4 visit, if the patients had an inadequate response (defined as any painful or swollen joints), the patients&#x02019; oral dose was increased to 15&#x02005;mg/week, taken in two divided doses approximately 12&#x02005;h apart. At the week 8 visit, if the patients still had an inadequate response, the oral dose was increased to 20&#x02005;mg/week.

This suggests that low doses of MTX can be considered in cases of MTX intolerance or for patients in remission who no longer wish to take high-dose MTX due to its adverse event profile.</p><p>While intensive MTX is recommended as the first-line therapy in the treatment of RA, MTX monotherapy achieves ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)-defined satisfactory disease control in approximately 30% of patients only.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The remaining &#x0223c;70% of patients will require more dynamic therapy, which often includes a biological DMARD in combination with MTX.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Results from this study indicated that treatment with ETN+MTX resulted in greater improvement than treatment with MTX alone, further supporting the addition of ETN for improved outcomes in the treatment of RA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> Clinical responses as measured by DAS28 LDA and remission rates, ACR 20/50/70 rates and change from baseline in DAS28 were similar for patients treated with ETN+MTX combination therapy, regardless of the MTX dose used. Similarly, HAQ-DI and EQ-5D VAS measures of QoL were maintained even at low MTX doses, when co-administered with ETN.</p><p>The historical literature suggests that MTX toxicity is dose-dependent and that low doses are the mainstay of RA therapy.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref> However, optimal doses of MTX when used in combination therapy are not readily available. The recent blinded, controlled CONCERTO trial explored the risk&#x02013;benefit profile of ascending doses of MTX in combination with adalimumab in early RA.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The study reported a significant trend towards increased efficacy at MTX doses 2.5&#x02013;20&#x02005;mg/week when in combination with adalimumab, but similar clinical, radiographic and functional outcomes at MTX doses of 10 and 20&#x02005;mg/week in combination with 40&#x02005;mg/week adalimumab. Increased adalimumab efficacy could be attributed to reduced clearance and higher serum concentrations when administered with MTX &#x0003e;2.5&#x02005;mg/week, with a plateau effect at MTX doses between 10 and 20&#x02005;mg/week.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Whereas MTX co-administration might alter the pharmacokinetic profile of adalimumab, no pharmacokinetic alternations to ETN were observed when administering doses of MTX 20&#x02005;mg/week with ETN versus ETN alone.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This could help to explain why increased efficacy of ETN+MTX over MTX monotherapy was not MTX dose-dependent in this study.</p><p>It has been demonstrated previously that the addition of ETN in patients with an inadequate response to MTX results in improvements that are a function of ETN alone and not of combination with MTX, whereas the effect in patients who were relatively MTX-naive may be additive.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The patients included in this post hoc study were not known partial or inadequate MTX-responders and those from the COMET study received MTX only 4&#x02005;weeks prior to baseline.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It can therefore be postulated from this study that following induction with MTX, a maintenance dose of MTX&#x0003c;10&#x02005;mg/week is sufficient to retain efficacy when used in combination with ETN.</p><p>A systematic literature review of MTX monotherapy recommended initial treatment with oral MTX up to 10&#x02013;15&#x02005;mg with escalation by 5&#x02005;mg increments up to 20&#x02013;30&#x02005;mg/week if tolerated and response is inadequate.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The findings presented in this post hoc analysis suggest that lower doses of MTX could be considered by physicians when using MTX in conjunction with ETN therapy. These findings may also provide important treatment options for patients with toxicity or tolerability issues with MTX, allowing low doses of MTX to be used without significant reductions in clinical outcomes or QoL. The Canadian Methotrexate and Etanercept Outcome (CAMEO) study concluded that withdrawing MTX after 6&#x02005;months of ETN+MTX treatment in MTX inadequate responders was inferior to continuation with combination therapy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, in a recent subanalysis of the COMET study, withdrawal of MTX from patients who had achieved disease remission with ETN+MTX at week 52 yielded similar rates of Boolean remission at week 104 compared with patients who remained on ETN+MTX.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These data, together with ours, suggest that MTX dose-reduction or even withdrawal may be viable options for patients in remission, who would prefer to discontinue MTX treatment.</p><p>The retrospective nature of this study limited its power to determine the impact of lower MTX doses on clinical efficacy and required the retroactive allocation of patients into MTX dosing categories based on the dose at 24&#x02005;months. Owing to the study designs, the MTX dose was reasonably stable over the duration of these studies, limiting the effect of this stratification; however, population selection at this time point may have biased the population towards treatment responders. The cumulative MTX dose was also similar in the monotherapy and combination therapy arms of the pooled analysis, which may have contributed to the observation of similar efficacy outcomes. Another limitation of this study is that MTX dosing in both the COMET and TEMPO studies was restricted to the oral route, even at high doses of MTX. The findings might therefore be different had subcutaneous dosing been permitted. It should also be acknowledged that pooling patient populations from COMET and TEMPO studies resulted in a diverse RA population&#x02014;patients with early and late disease, with a higher proportion of patients previously exposed to MTX in the TEMPO cohort. It is possible that different conclusions would be reached if these analyses were conducted in the patient populations from both trials separately.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, the merging of two populations allowed us to describe the effect of the MTX concomitant dose under different conditions, thereby mimicking a real-life scenario.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this post hoc analysis of the COMET and TEMPO trials, ETN+MTX showed similar efficacy outcomes regardless of the MTX dosage in patients with RA. Low-dose MTX (&#x0003c;10&#x02005;mg/week) is sufficient to achieve efficacy outcomes similar to higher doses of MTX (10.0&#x02013;17.5&#x02005;mg/week, or &#x0003e;17.5&#x02005;mg) when used in combination with ETN.
