Recent cohort studies suggest that physician care may be the most effective treatment for patients with whiplash-associated disorders. However, these findings have not been tested in a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this study is to determine which of physician care or two rehabilitation programs of care is most effective in improving recovery of patients with recent whiplash associated disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Design</title><p>We designed a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. A total of 444 participants (148 in each of three arms) who reside in Southern Ontario, Canada will be recruited from a large insurer. We will include individuals who are 18 years of age or older and who are diagnosed with Grade I or II Whiplash-associated Disorders. Participants will be randomized to physician-based education and activation or one of two rehabilitation programs of care currently in use in Ontario. Our primary outcome, self-rated global recovery and all secondary outcomes (neck pain intensity, whiplash disability, health-related quality of life, depressive symptomatology and satisfaction with care) will be measured at baseline by a trial coordinator and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up by an interviewer who is blind to the participants' baseline characteristics and treatment allocation. We will also collect information on general health status, other injuries, comorbidities, expectation of recovery, work status, pain coping, legal representation, and co-interventions. The primary intention-to-treat analysis will compare time to recovery between the three interventions. This trial will have 90% power at an alpha of 0.05 to detect a 20% difference in the rate of perceived recovery at one year. Secondary analyses will compare the health outcomes, rate of recurrence and the rate of adverse events between intervention groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study will provide the public, clinicians and policy makers much needed evidence on the effectiveness of common approaches used to manage whiplash-associated disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00546806</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Whiplash is the most common traffic injury, affecting 83% of people involved in motor vehicle collisions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] The injury leads to "Whiplash-associated Disorders" (WAD), a clinical syndrome that includes neck pain and clusters of physical and psychological symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] WAD result in a significant burden of pain, disability and health care utilization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] Moreover, WAD may increase the risk of future health problems. Studies from Sweden and Saskatchewan suggest that individuals with a history of whiplash injuries may be more likely than those without a history of whiplash injuries to suffer from future episodes of neck pain, headaches, low back pain, shoulder pain, and sleep disturbances.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</p><p>Exorbitant health care costs, increasing disability rates and uncertainty about the most effective management of WAD have led governments, insurers and clinicians throughout the Western world to develop treatment guidelines and programs of care for the treatment of whiplash injuries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] Traditionally, these guidelines have emphasized the delivery of clinical interventions and focused less on the environment surrounding the claim process. However, it is well known that the recovery from WAD also depends on contextual factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that the type, intensity and timing of health care delivery are strongly and independently associated with time to recovery. Specifically, C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; et al. found that patients who made more than two visits to general practitioners, more than six visits to chiropractors, received care from general practitioner and chiropractors and those who consulted general practitioners and specialists within the first month of their injury took longer to recover than patients who visited general practitioners once or twice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] In another cohort, Cassidy et al. investigated the effectiveness of a province-wide rehabilitation program in Saskatchewan and found that patients who attended fitness training or a multidisciplinary outpatient rehabilitation program within 120 days of their injury had slower recovery than those who received usual community care.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] Finally, a recent randomized trial compared "education and advice" by general practitioners to "education and exercises" by physiotherapists in patients with WAD lasting more than four weeks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] One year after the injury, patients in the general practitioner group reported levels of neck pain and headache intensity that were lower than those treated by physiotherapists.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] Overall, this evidence suggests that the type and intensity of clinical care strongly influences the prognosis of whiplash injuries.</p><p>Despite the efforts of governments and insurers, we still do not know whether guidelines or programs of care are effective in improving health outcomes and reducing costs of patients with WAD. To date, no randomized trials have investigated the effectiveness of a coordinated and staged multidisciplinary rehabilitation program aimed at improving the health outcomes of patients with WAD. Moreover, it is not known whether rehabilitation programs are superior to physician-based education and activation in promoting better health outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to investigate which program of care yields the best outcomes for patients.</p><p>Our primary objective is to determine whether education and activation by a physician is more effective than two rehabilitation programs of care ("Soft Tissue Injury Care Model" developed by AVIVA Canada and the "Pre-approved Framework Guideline for Grade I and II Whiplash Associated Disorders" developed by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario, an arm's length agency of the Ontario Ministry of Finance) in improving recovery from WAD.</p><p>Our secondary objectives will compare the effectiveness of the three interventions on reducing neck pain intensity, reducing whiplash-related disability, improving the health-related quality of life, reducing depressive symptoms, improving satisfaction with care, shorten insurance claim durations, and reducing the recurrence rate in patients with WAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>We will conduct a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study Design: Process of recruitment, randomization to treatment, treatment provision, and outcomes assessment</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-9-75-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Source population</title><p>Eligible for the study are individuals who: 1) are 18 years of age or older; 2) reside or work in the Greater Toronto area, Mississauga, Burlington, Cambridge or Kitchener; 3) are injured in a traffic collision; 4) make an insurance claim for physical injury to AVIVA Canada between February 2008 and March 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Potential participants will be identified by AVIVA claims adjusters when policy holders contact AVIVA's claim center to report an injury. The adjuster will determine whether the claimant resides or works within the catchment areas of our treatment centers and has sustained a physical injury during the motor vehicle collision. If both these criteria are met, she/he will use a standardized script to invite the claimant to learn more about the trial. Claimants who are interested will be referred immediately to the University Health Network (UHN) trial coordinator who will arrange an appointment at the nearest study clinic to assess the claimant's eligibility for the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>All potential participants will be assessed by a trial coordinator to determine whether they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

If passengers from the same motor vehicle agree to participate, they will be randomized to the same treatment arm to minimize contamination and potentially minimize cross-over between treatment arms. Therefore, our unit of randomization is the motor vehicle. Central randomization was performed by the study biostatistician using statistical package, NQuery Advisor<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>7.0.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] To minimize the risk of unbalanced treatment assignment related to patient heterogeneity, we used block randomization which was stratified by clinical centre. The size of the blocks was randomly determined and vary between three, six, nine and 12 participants. The biostatistician provided the trial coordinators with a series of sealed opaque envelopes sequentially numbered by clinical centre. The study biostatistician is not involved in the selection of participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants randomly assigned to the rehabilitation programs of care will be treated at one of three University Health Network Rehabilitation Solution clinics located at the Toronto Western Hospital in Toronto, and at satellite clinics in Mississauga and Cambridge, which are areas outside of Toronto. All services will be provided by regulated health professionals including physiotherapists, kinesiologists, occupational therapists and massage therapists. Participants allocated to the physician-based "Education and Activation" arm will be referred to family physicians located at Toronto Western Hospital, the Rehabilitation Solutions clinic in Cambridge, and a private clinic in Mississauga. Health care professionals will be assigned to one treatment arm only. As recommended by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario, all participants will receive a "Getting the Facts about Whiplash" brochure. The brochure includes basic information about whiplash.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Soft Tissue Injury Care Model</title><p>The "Soft Tissue Injury Care Model" is a staged multidisciplinary rehabilitation program of care developed by AVIVA Canada. The model aims to reduce the administrative burden related to the claim process and facilitate access to timely health care. Participants randomized to the "Soft Tissue Injury Care Model" will obtain assistance from the clinic staff to complete the insurance forms necessary to initiate the claim. The program will be led by a physiotherapist and includes three integrated and sequential rehabilitation components: 1) Acute-subacute Phase; 2) Multidisciplinary Evaluation and 3) Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation.</p><sec><title>Acute-subacute phase</title><p>During the first six weeks post-injury, care will be delivered by physiotherapists, and if necessary kinesiologists and massage therapists. The care consists of: 1) reassurance; 2) education; 3) home exercises, 4) physiotherapy modalities to reduce pain and 5) massage therapy. A maximum of nine treatments (including massage therapy) during the first three weeks post-collision and an additional eight sessions (including massage therapy) between the third and sixth week post-collision will be allowed. The type and frequency of treatment will be prescribed by the physiotherapist based on her/his assessment. During this phase, the physiotherapist may recommend an "in-home" or "job site" functional assessment. Finally, the physiotherapist will refer the participant to a Multidisciplinary Evaluation if she/he is not progressing as expected.</p></sec><sec><title>Multidisciplinary evaluation</title><p>Patients who require treatment beyond the acute-subacute phase will be referred for a multidisciplinary evaluation. The evaluation will be conducted by an independent team that may include a physiotherapist, physician, occupational therapist, psychologist, and kinesiologist. The purpose of the multidisciplinary evaluation is to identify barriers to recovery and recommend the appropriate treatment through interdisciplinary rehabilitation program.</p></sec><sec><title>Interdisciplinary rehabilitation</title><p>The interdisciplinary rehabilitation program has three specific goals: 1) overcome psychosocial barriers to return to function; 2) physical restoration; and 3) functional restoration. The program will include up to five weeks of daily intervention (each session can last up to 5.5 hours). The frequency, duration and type of care will be determined by the interdisciplinary team. The team may include a physician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and a psychologist. Moreover, the following individuals may be invited to join the team: 1) insurance claims advisor; 2) kinesiologist; 3) vocational counselor; 4) employer; 5) ergonomist; and 6) cognitive behavioral therapist. If necessary, the interdisciplinary rehabilitation program will include a jobsite assessment. The services provided during interdisciplinary rehabilitation can include: 1) education; 2) reassurance; 3) goal setting and advice on self-management; 4) psychological counseling and stress management; 5) relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and family counseling; 6) cognitive behavioral therapy; 7) instruction on pain management techniques; and 8) strength, endurance, flexibility or cardiovascular exercises.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pre-approved framework guideline for Grade I and II Whiplash Associated Disorders (PAF)</title><p>The PAF is a clinical management guideline that focuses on the provision of interventions to manage pain and disability through functional restoration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] Its use is mandated in Ontario for patients with Grade I and II WAD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] The treatment will be provided under the supervision of a physiotherapist and includes: 1) reassurance; 2) education; 3) home exercises, and 4) encouragement to resume normal activities of daily living. Additionally, the physiotherapist may prescribe the following interventions: 1) exercise and functional activities; 2) mobilization and manipulation; 3) pain management modalities (including massage therapy); and 4) coping skills education. The frequency and number of visits is based on the clinical judgment of the physiotherapist but cannot exceed 10 visits within the first three weeks and nine visits three to six weeks post-collision.</p><p>Participants with significant functional limitations will be eligible for a functional assessment of their home, work or school environment. Based on the assessment, occupational therapists will develop an intervention that may include: 1) recommendation to use aids or devices; 2) minor modifications at the work, home, or school environment; 3) instructions on adaptive strategies or alternate approaches to fulfill functional tasks; and 4) specific functional activities to increase tolerance.</p><p>Participants who report significant improvement in the first six weeks of care, but who have not recovered, can receive up to four additional treatments over a two-week period. Participants who have not recovered will be re-evaluated and a new plan of management will be developed by the physiotherapist in charge of the care.</p></sec><sec><title>Physician-based education and activation</title><p>The education and activation intervention program is designed to promote self-care and early return to normal activities of daily living. Participants randomized to education and activation will be under the care of a family physician.</p><sec><title>Initial visit</title><p>The intervention includes reassurance, education about the favorable prognosis of WAD, encouragement to resume activities of daily living, recommendation to do home exercises (stretching) and, if indicated, prescribe pain relief modalities (heat/ice, acetaminophen or a Cox-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or non-selective NSAID with or without gastroprotection). At the end of the initial visit, the physician will determine whether a follow-up appointment is necessary or if the participant should be discharged. The participant will be informed to contact the physician should their complaint persist or worsen.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up visits</title><p>If follow-up visits are necessary, the participant will be re-assessed and the intervention described above will be repeated and adapted to the participant's status. Participants who have not recovered six weeks after the injury or have improved but require more care will be referred for a multidisciplinary evaluation and enter the interdisciplinary rehabilitation (described above under Soft Tissue Injury Care Model).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection and follow-up</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> summarizes the data to be collected during the trial. We will follow-up participants at six weeks, and three, six, nine and 12 months post-injury. All follow-up interviews will be conducted by a research assistant either in person at the study clinic or by telephone. The study research assistant will be blind to the treatment allocation and to the baseline characteristics of participants. However, because most outcomes are self-reported by the participants, the research assistant will not be blind to their outcomes status.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Measures used at baseline and follow-up interviews</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Measures</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Baseline</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>6 Weeks</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>3 Months</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>6 Months</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>9 Months</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>12 Months</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Accident information</td><td align="center">x</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Past history of neck pain and whiplash</td><td align="center">x</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Numerical rating scale</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Health care after accident</td><td align="center">x</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Comorbidity questionnaire</td><td align="center">x</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Acute 36-item short-form health survey (V2)</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Work status</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Expectation of recovery</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Whiplash disability questionnaire</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Center for epidemiological studies-depression scale (CES-D)</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Vanderbilt pain management inventory</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td></td><td align="center">x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Health state question</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Socio-demographic characteristics</td><td align="center">x</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Whether a lawyer or paralegal is involved in the claim</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Global perceived recovery question</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Satisfaction with care and treatment outcome</td><td></td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Co-interventions</td><td></td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><sec><title>Time to recovery</title><p>Our primary outcome is time to recovery measured by the global self-perceived recovery question. The global perceived recovery question is a reliable, valid and responsive measure of health status in patients with musculoskeletal disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] This ordinal transition scale has been used in previous randomized trials and cohort studies of neck pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] In patients with WAD, we have previously reported that perceived recovery is consistently associated with less neck pain, better physical functioning and fewer depressive symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]</p><p>At each follow-up interview, participants will be asked: "How well do you feel you are recovering from your injuries?" Participants will select between one of the seven following choices: 1) completely better; 2) much improved; 3) slightly improved; 4) no change; 5) slightly worse; 6) much worse and 7) worse than ever. Participants who respond to be "completely recovered" or "much improved" will be considered recovered.

The NRS is a global measure of pain intensity anchored by two extremes of pain intensity ranging from 0 (referring to "No pain") to 10 (referring to "Pain as bad as it could be"). The NRS has good short-term test-retest reliability with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.95&#x02013;0.99 when re-administered within 24 hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] The NRS has good construct validity and can distinguish between various levels of pain in subjects with chronic post-operative pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] It correlates well with other instruments used to measure pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Whiplash disability</title><p>Disability will be measured with the Whiplash Disability Questionnaire (WDQ).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] The WDQ is a 13-item modified version of the Neck Disability Index. It includes 13 Likert scales scored from 0 to 10 with higher global scores indicating more disability. The instrument has adequate face validity, discriminate validity and good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96).

(2006)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported that the WDQ has no substantial ceiling or floor effect. In patients with chronic stable symptoms, the WDQ has excellent short-term (24 hours) and medium-term (one month) reproducibility (Intra-correlation coefficient = 0.90, and 0.86, respectively).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] The WDQ is a responsive scale with a minimal detectable change of 15 points.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Health-related quality of life (H-RQoL)</title><p>We will use the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey version two (SF-36) to measure health-related quality of life. The SF-36 has 36 items which measure the H-RQoL of a subject. Two summary scores can be computed: the physical component score and the mental component score. There are eight individual scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The questionnaire has been shown to have excellent reliability demonstrated with internal consistency and test-retest methods. The SF-36 is a valid and reliable measure for clinical and general populations with a reported intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.85.

Claim closure corresponds to the end of treatment, the attainment of maximal medical improvement, the termination of income replacement benefits or the date of payment of the last outstanding bill incurred by the claimant (e.g., eyewear). Claim closure dates will be provided by AVIVA Canada. We have previously validated time on benefit as a marker of time to health recovery in a population of whiplash patients from Saskatchewan and found that claimants who close their claims have significantly lower levels of neck pain, better physical functioning and no depression compared to claimants who have not closed their claim.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Recurrence</title><p>A recurrence will occur when a participant reports to have recovered, but reports at any subsequent follow-up on the self-perceived recovery question to be: 1) slightly improved; 2) unchanged; 3) slightly worse; 4) much worse, or 5) worse than ever.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-interventions</title><p>We will measure co-interventions by asking participants to self-report the type health care provider consulted beyond those involved in delivering the trial interventions.

Assuming a 30% loss-to follow-up per arm we aim to enroll a total of 444 participants (148 per intervention arm).</p><p>It is common for vehicles involved in traffic collisions to have multiple passengers. Early in our trial, we observed that some participants enrolled in the study had a spouse or relative with them in the car at the time of the collision that was also eligible for the trial. To prevent contamination bias and promote treatment compliance, we decided to change the randomization unit from the individual to the motor vehicle. Consequently, all passengers from the same vehicle are randomized to the same study arm. We have observed that less than 5% of vehicles have multiple passengers. Therefore, our original sample size of 444 participants remains valid.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our primary analysis focuses on studying treatment policy and therefore will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, that is, participants will be analyzed according to their randomized intervention group whether or not they received the intervention. However, we are also interested in understanding the impact of treatment self-selection and protocol deviations on the primary and secondary outcomes. To achieve this goal, we will also analyze the trial using the "as treated" (participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they received) and "per-protocol" (the analysis will be restricted to participants who were compliant with the treatment protocol) approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcomes: self-perceived recovery</title><p>Our primary analysis will compare the time to recovery across intervention arms using the Kaplan-Meier method.
