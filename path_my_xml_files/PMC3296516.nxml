Healthy volunteers were enrolled into one of five separate randomized trials; four were open label and one double blind. Following a screening period of &#x0003c;28 days, participants received differing tablets containing lanthanum carbonate [LC, 3000 mg/day of elemental lanthanum (in one study other doses were also used)]. Participants received a standardized phosphate diet and remained in the relevant study center throughout the duration of each treatment period. The end point in all studies was the reduction in urinary phosphorus excretion. Reductions in mean 24-h urinary phosphorus excretion in volunteers receiving a lanthanum dose of 3000 mg/day were between 236 and 468 mg/day over the five separate studies. These data in healthy volunteers can be used to estimate the amount of reduction of dietary phosphate absorption by LC. The reduction in 24-h urinary phosphorus excretion per tablet was compared with published data on other phosphate binders. Although there are limitations, evidence suggests that LC is a very effective phosphate binder in terms of binding per tablet.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lanthanum carbonate</kwd><kwd>sevelamer hydrochloride</kwd><kwd>chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>phosphate binder</kwd><kwd>hyperphosphatemia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Phosphate binders are usually required to restore phosphate balance in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effectiveness of such binders depends on their ability to bind dietary phosphate in the gut and the stability of the resulting insoluble complex in the presence of normal contents of the gastrointestinal tract, thus preventing absorption. Several phosphate binders are currently available, including calcium-based agents (calcium carbonate and calcium acetate). However, calcium-based agents may increase calcium load and the risk of vascular calcification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref></p><p>Lanthanum carbonate [(LC) FOSRENOL, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Basingstoke, UK], sevelamer hydrochloride [(SH) Renagel, Genzyme Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA], and sevelamer carbonate (Renvela, Genzyme Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA) are non-calcium-containing phosphate binders licensed for use in CKD patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> In vitro data indicate that LC has a higher binding affinity for phosphate than SH and LC's phosphate binding is not affected by acidity or the presence of bile acids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref></p><p>In healthy people and patients with the early stages of CKD, serum phosphorus levels are maintained within the normal range by complex homeostatic mechanisms with the kidney as one of the main regulatory organs for maintenance of phosphate balance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> As such individuals are in neutral phosphate balance, measurement of urinary phosphorus excretion can be used as an estimate of intestinal phosphate absorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref></p><p>This article presents results from five healthy volunteer studies examining the ability of LC to bind dietary phosphate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Trial Designs</title><p>Each randomized trial of healthy volunteers was a single center study; studies 1, 2, and 3 were in UK centers; study 4 was in a center in the United States; and study 5 was in a center in Japan. All were carried out in accordance with the principles of the 18th World Medical Assembly (Helsinki 1964) and amendments, and local ethical and legal requirements. Informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. In all studies (abbreviated details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), volunteers were randomized following a screening period of up to 28 days and participants remained in the study centers for the study period only and not during washout periods. Restrictions on concomitant medication use occurred in each study. The only permitted medications were hormonal contraceptives and treatments required for adverse events. Vitamin supplements were excluded during the studies. Study 5 was a double-blind study and studies 1&#x02013;4 were all open label.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of studies of lanthanum carbonate (LC).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phosphorus intake (mg/day)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatments (doses)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study 1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parallel-group, dose-ranging study</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0223c;2000</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LC<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">a</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022;

As expected, homeostasis was maintained by the normal kidney function in healthy volunteers; therefore, LC treatment was not associated with clinically significant changes in serum phosphorus or calcium levels in any of the studies.</p><table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Reduction in 24-h urinary phosphorus excretion from baseline with lanthanum carbonate (LC) at a dose of 3000 mg/day of elemental lanthanum.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">Urinary phosphorus excretion, mg/day (mmol/day)</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study and formulation (all given three times daily)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At baseline</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At end point</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reduction from baseline</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Study 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;1 &#x000d7; 1000 mg tablet</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">992 &#x000b1;253 (32.0 &#x000b1;8.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">662&#x000b1;154 (21.4&#x000b1;5.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">329 &#x000b1;276 (10.6 &#x000b1;8.9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Study 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 47)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;4 &#x000d7; 250 mg tablets</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">592 &#x000b1;233 (19.1 &#x000b1;7.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">353&#x000b1;133 (11.4&#x000b1;4.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">239 &#x000b1;183 (7.7 &#x000b1;5.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;2 &#x000d7; 500 mg tablets</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">663 &#x000b1;252 (21.4&#x000b1;8.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">370&#x000b1;164 (11.9 &#x000b1; 5.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">294&#x000b1;177 (9.5 &#x000b1;5.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;1 &#x000d7; 1000 mg tablet</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">674&#x000b1;310 (21.8 &#x000b1; 10.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">356&#x000b1;144 (11.5 &#x000b1; 4.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">318&#x000b1;294 (10.3 &#x000b1;9.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Study 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 48)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;4 &#x000d7; 250 mg tablets</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">637&#x000b1;195 (20.6 &#x000b1;6.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">393&#x000b1;130 (12.7 &#x000b1;4.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">244&#x000b1;164 (7.9 &#x000b1;5.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;1 &#x000d7; 1000 mg tablet</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">646 &#x000b1;167 (20.8 &#x000b1;5.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">410&#x000b1;142 (13.2 &#x000b1;4.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">236 &#x000b1;167 (7.6 &#x000b1;5.4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Study 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 33)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Batch A (4 &#x000d7; 250 mg tablets)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">952&#x000b1;155 (30.7 &#x000b1;5.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">643 &#x000b1;116 (20.7 &#x000b1;3.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">309 &#x000b1;149 (10.0 &#x000b1;4.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Batch B (4 &#x000d7; 250 mg tablets)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">921 &#x000b1;177 (29.7 &#x000b1;5.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">641 &#x000b1;143 (20.7 &#x000b1;4.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">279 &#x000b1;168 (9.0 &#x000b1;5.4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Study 5 (<italic>n</italic> = 6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;4 &#x000d7; 250 mg tablets</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">680&#x000b1;211 (21.9 &#x000b1;6.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">212&#x000b1;99 (6.8&#x000b1;3.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">468&#x000b1;167 (15.1 &#x000b1;5.4)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Notes: Data relate to the pharmacodynamic populations; studies 2, 3, and 4 were crossover studies; study 1 only included patients receiving a daily dose of 3000 mg LC; and study 5 only included patients receiving LC.

Most adverse events across the LC groups in study 1 were mild in intensity and the most common were headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. With regard to treatment-related adverse events, gastrointestinal disorders (nausea or vomiting) were experienced by two (20%) participants and headache was experienced by one individual (10%) in the group receiving an elemental LC dose of 3000 mg/day in study 1. In study 2, the most common adverse event was nausea, which was experienced by six (12%) volunteers receiving the reference (4 &#x000d7; 250 mg tablets) formulation, 10 (20%) volunteers receiving the existing (2 &#x000d7; 500 mg tablets) formulation, and 10 (19%) volunteers receiving the optimal (1 &#x000d7; 1000 mg tablets) formulation. In study 3, headache was experienced by two (4%) individuals receiving 4 &#x000d7; 250 mg tablet dosing and six (12%) individuals receiving 1000 mg tablet dosing. Nausea was experienced by two (4%) participants receiving 250 mg tablets and by three (6%) participants receiving 1000 mg tablets. One (2%) participant receiving 250 mg tablets and three (6%) participants receiving 1000 mg tablets experienced abdominal pain.

As thrice-weekly hemodialysis will only remove approximately 2400 mg (77.4 mmol) phosphate,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> absorption of approximately 1800 mg (58.1 mmol) phosphate per week must be prevented to achieve neutral phosphate balance.</p><p>Recommended protein intake is slightly higher for peritoneal dialysis patients (1.2&#x02013;1.3 g/kg bodyweight per day)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> compared with their counterparts on hemodialysis. A 70 kg peritoneal dialysis patient may therefore consume up to 1092 mg phosphate (35.3 mmol elemental phosphorus) per day, resulting in absorption of 4586 mg (148.1 mmol) phosphate per week (assuming 60% absorption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). As peritoneal dialysis removes only about 315 mg (10.2 mmol) phosphate per day,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> absorption of approximately 2381 mg (76.9 mmol) phosphate per week must be prevented by other means to prevent phosphate overload.</p><p>In reality, the dietary phosphate intake of many dialysis patients is likely to be closer to the typical US daily phosphate intake of 1300 mg (41.9 mmol elemental phosphorus) per day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>; furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract may absorb up to 86% of ingested phosphate depending on vitamin D status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Add to this the problem of phosphate-based food additives that are better absorbed than the phosphates found in unprocessed foods,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and the phosphate burden could be significantly higher than the above estimates.</p><p>Effective dietary phosphate binders are therefore desirable to prevent phosphate overload.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> In our studies in healthy volunteers, lanthanum (given as LC) reduced urinary phosphorus excretion at all doses tested; 3000 mg/day produced a near-maximal response, with saturation occurring at higher doses. These results are consistent with clinical practice where doses of 2250&#x02013;3000 mg/day appear to be effective for management of hyperphosphatemia.</p><p>The data reported here suggest that the standard 1000 mg dose of LC reduces mean 24-h urinary phosphorus excretion by between 79 and 156 mg/day (2.5 and 5.0 mmol/day) in healthy volunteers (data from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the studies in which they were directly compared, the different LC formulations were shown to be pharmacodynamically equivalent and there were no notable differences between the formulations. There was some inner study variation despite the same LC dose, probably due to differences in study procedures, the race of participants,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> geographical location,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> the standardized phosphate content of diets, and potentially the type of phosphate (organic vs. inorganic) found in these diets.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> The largest reduction in 24-h urinary phosphorus excretion was experienced in the Japanese participants in study 5. A recent study has shown racial differences in the renal handling of phosphate between Caucasian and Black individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>; phosphate handling may also be different in Asian populations. The use of a standardized diet with similar phosphate content to that of the other studies in Japanese individuals with a lower body mass (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) may also have affected phosphate handling. Geographic and seasonal differences in ultraviolet light exposure across study populations may also have resulted in different vitamin D status,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> potentially influencing phosphate absorption.</p><p>A typical hemodialysis patient may require removal of about 1800 mg (58.1 mmol) of phosphate by binders every week, or approximately 257 mg/day (8.3 mmol/day). Our data suggest that a 1000 mg dose of LC binds 79&#x02013;156 mg (2.5&#x02013;5.0 mmol) phosphate; therefore, approximately 1650&#x02013;3250 mg/day LC would be required to remove a typical phosphate burden. This range correlates reasonably well with clinical experience, as LC doses of 2250&#x02013;3000 mg/day (typically three tablets per day) appear to be sufficient for management of hyperphosphatemia in the majority of patients.</p><p>Several studies have examined the binding capacities of other phosphate binders in healthy volunteers. While comparisons across these studies cannot provide robust evidence, they provide useful indications regarding the relative phosphate-binding capacities of LC and other binders. Burke et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> administered various doses of SH to healthy volunteers (<italic>n</italic> = 6 per group) receiving a standardized diet (1200 mg elemental phosphorus, similar to most of our studies). Compared with placebo, SH 1000, 2500, and 5000 mg administered three times daily reduced urinary phosphorus excretion by 108 mg/day (3.4 mmol/day), 245 mg/day (7.7 mmol/day), and 340 mg/day (10.6 mmol/day), respectively. Therefore, the apparent phosphate-binding capacity of sevelamer decreased with increasing dose, similar to LC doses greater than 1000 mg three times per day in study 1. A single 1000 mg dose of SH (the most effective dose per gram of binder in the Burke study) was estimated to result in a reduction in mean 24-h urinary phosphorus of approximately 36 mg/day (1.2 mmol/day), equivalent to 29 mg/day (0.9 mmol/day) per 800 mg tablet. No published data on the binding capacity of the alternative sevelamer carbonate formulation compared with SH are available.</p><p>Phosphorus recovered in urine over 6 h after a 1000 mg (32.3 mmol) phosphorus load and administration of calcium phosphate binders has been assessed in six healthy volunteers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> Dosing with two calcium carbonate tablets (800 mg of elemental calcium) resulted in a decrease in urinary phosphorus excretion of 31 mg (1.0 mmol) compared with control, whereas six calcium acetate tablets reduced urinary phosphorus by 132 mg (4.3 mmol) [22 mg (0.71 mmol) per tablet]. In another study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> the calculated reduction in 24-h urinary excretion of phosphate after 6 days of treatment was 66 mg (2.1 mmol) per 1000 mg of elemental calcium compared with 32 mg (1.0 mmol) per 1000 mg of SH.</p><p>Following consumption of a set meal (daily elemental phosphorus intake of 1000 mg in three meals), net phosphorus absorption was determined based on fecal phosphorus excretion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> In this study, 1000 mg of elemental calcium (given as calcium acetate) bound 174 mg (5.6 mmol) of phosphorus [equating to 29 mg (0.9 mmol) per tablet], whereas the same elemental dose of calcium given as the carbonate bound 112 mg (3.6 mmol) of phosphate. Calcium citrate bound 92 mg (3.0 mmol) of phosphorus per 1000 mg of elemental calcium and aluminum carbonate bound 155 mg (5.0 mmol) of phosphorus per 1000 mg of elemental aluminum.</p><p>Only indirect comparisons of phosphate-binding capacity can be made based on our studies and the published literature. To bind the 257 mg/day (8.3 mmol/day) excess phosphate from a dietary intake of 1000 mg/day (32.3 mmol/day), a hemodialysis patient may theoretically require approximately three LC (3000 mg elemental lanthanum) tablets, nine calcium acetate tablets (1521 mg elemental calcium), or nine SH tablets (7200 mg SH). These calculations are consistent with manufacturers' dosage recommendations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and reflect clinical practice where phosphate binders often contribute 50% of total daily tablet burden, which may exceed 25 tablets per day in some patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref></p><p>The proposition that urinary phosphorus excretion is an index for phosphate binding assumes that the individual is at steady state. Little is known about the time effects of phosphate binders on net phosphate absorption. Calcium absorption has been better studied; it takes between 10 and 17 days to achieve a new steady state after a change in calcium intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> Phosphate may achieve steady state more rapidly because the renal mechanism for phosphate conservation is more responsive to phosphatonins and does not require new protein synthesis. Thus, short-term studies serve as an effective estimate of the relative magnitude of phosphate binding by various agents, but unless studies occur within the same individuals under identical conditions, the results should only be used as a first estimate of relative binding capacity. Thus, there are clear limitations when comparing data from different studies and a direct comparison of phosphate binders in healthy volunteers is required. It should be noted, however, that patients with CKD may differ from healthy individuals in terms of gastrointestinal absorption dynamics, such as transit times, effects of pH on binding and absorption, and drug interactions. Relative phosphate-binding capacities in individuals with CKD may therefore differ from those established in studies in healthy volunteers.</p><p>In conclusion, LC effectively reduces absorption of dietary phosphate in healthy individuals. Clinicians should consider the dose&#x02013;response relationship for the different phosphate binders when reviewing doses or choice of binder. A direct comparison of the binding capacities of currently available phosphate binders would be useful to guide clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported financially by the sponsor Shire Pharmaceuticals, including provision of a grant for Oxford PharmaGenesis&#x02122; Ltd. to provide medical writing and editorial assistance to the authors.
