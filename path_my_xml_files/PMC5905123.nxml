In particular, the prevalence of mobility-related disability increases rapidly with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Frailty and associated co-morbidities compromise quality of life for older adults and contribute major societal costs; directly to people who live with frailty, to friends and family providing care and losing productivity, and to health and social care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Physical inactivity is one of the strongest predictors of mobility-related disability in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A fit and active older person has a 36% lower risk of developing functional limitations and a 38% lower risk of hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the UK-based Opal Plus cohort, older people who undertook at least an average of 25&#x000a0;min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day at baseline received fewer prescriptions and were less likely to be admitted to hospital in an emergency 4 to 5 years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Clinical trials have provided robust evidence that physical features of frailty, such as reduced muscular strength or endurance, can be reversed, or at least the progression of these frailty indicators can be slowed, by undertaking an appropriate exercise programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, older adults are the least active segment of the UK population. Less than 30% of 65&#x02013;74-year-olds report any moderate-intensity physical activity lasting at least 10 min in the previous 4 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Health Survey for England (HSE) data indicate that among people aged 65 years and above, 36% of women and 27% of men reported a need for help in the last month with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs) such as getting up and down stairs, dressing, getting around indoors, or shopping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These people are in transition from independence to frailty and have a great deal to gain if loss of function can be reversed and independence maintained.</p><p id="Par49">Sedentary behaviour and mobility limitations in older people are more prevalent in socio-economically deprived sectors of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Ethnically diverse groups in the USA have a significantly greater risk of a range of physical and mental health problems compared to their White counterparts, and subsequently suffer higher rates of morbidity and premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Self-reported data from the HSE indicate that older (55&#x02009;+&#x02009;years) Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian adults in England are less likely to meet physical activity guidelines compared to their White European counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, exercise interventions that can successfully engage and retain sedentary and ethnically diverse groups of older adults could contribute to the reduction of health inequalities.</p><p id="Par50">Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders <bold>(</bold>LIFE) is a landmark study in the field of physical activity promotion in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. LIFE was a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of a physical activity programme with a successful ageing educational programme in more than 1600 functionally impaired older persons, over an average follow-up of 2.6&#x000a0;years. The intervention reduced the risk of developing major mobility disability (defined as the inability to complete a 400-m walk test within 15&#x000a0;min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] by 18% relative to the control group (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.82: 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69&#x02013;0.98). It also reduced the risk of persistent mobility disability by 28% (major mobility disability at consecutive time points) (HR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57&#x02013;0.91). The intervention group maintained an increase of 40 min/week (95% CI, 29 to 52; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) in objectively assessed lifestyle-intensity activity (&#x02265;&#x02009;760 counts/min compared with the control group at 24&#x000a0;months of follow-up). These estimates are likely to be conservative as the study utilised an active control group which received a substantial health education/lifestyle intervention including weekly workshops for 6&#x000a0;months and monthly sessions for a further 18&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par51">Building on the success of the LIFE study in the USA, the REtirement in ACTion (REACT) study aims to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a community-based physical activity intervention for reducing, or reversing, the progression of functional limitations in older people who are at high risk of mobility-related disability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par52">The study protocol is presented in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">The REACT study is a multi-centre, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot phase and that incorporates comprehensive process and economic evaluations. Following identification and recruitment, 768 participants who meet the study inclusion criteria will be randomised to receive either the REACT intervention, delivered over a period of 12&#x000a0;months by trained facilitators or a minimal control intervention. The pilot phase will assess the feasibility of recruitment methods (allowing for some refinement if needed) and confirm adequate retention rates in the intervention and the study, prior to progressing with the main trial. A nested sub-study, led by the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford, employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will test the hypothesis that the REACT intervention will slow the rate of brain atrophy and of decline in cognitive function. Outcome data will be collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months for the main study, with MRI sub-study data collected at baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. The REACT study was reviewed and approved by the National Health Service (NHS) South East Coast-Surrey Research Ethics Committee (15/LO/2082). The study is registered as a current randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN45627165).</p><p id="Par54">The REACT study will be conducted at three UK sites &#x02013; Bath/Bristol, Devon and Birmingham &#x02013; allowing recruitment of a socio-economically and ethnically diverse sample including participants from urban, rural and semi-rural locations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par55">The eligibility criteria are intended to identify 768 sedentary, community-dwelling, older people aged 65 years and over with functional limitations (i.e. who are at risk of major mobility limitations), but who are still ambulatory, i.e. they can still walk. This will be measured using a battery of objective physical function tests (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)) to assess balance, walking speed and the ability to change from a sitting to a standing position. This generates a physical function score from 0 to 12 older adults with scores of 4&#x02013;9 (inclusive) out of 12 will be eligible to take part in REACT.

REACT will be delivered by qualified exercise professionals with experience of leading exercise classes in the community. We will collaborate with existing community-based organisations who have access to suitable venues and delivery staff. Sessions will be organised as group activities with up to 15 participants per group, but there will be individually tailored elements for aerobic exercise, strength work and exercise progression plans. Activities will include cardiovascular, strength, balance and flexibility exercises and daily lifestyle-based activity in the form of neighbourhood walking and active travel. Breaks in sedentary time will also be promoted.

This will include application of an intervention fidelity checklist to audio-recordings of a purposive sample of intervention sessions. This will generate a descriptive summary of delivery-quality scores. Each item will be scored using the Dreyfus competence-rating scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It will also generate a qualitative summary of the recorded sessions, highlighting examples of theorised and non-theorised intervention processes in practice, as well as examples of good and poor delivery. This analysis will help to interpret and contextualise the data on intervention adherence and effectiveness, providing explanations about why the intervention might work better for some people than others and what were the barriers to engagement with the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par110">A qualitative analysis of data to examine processes of change and elicit explanations for possible intervention success or failure. This will integrate data from: (1) semi-structured, longitudinal, individual interviews at 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months with a purposive sample of 24 participants in the intervention group (designed to sample diversity in terms of SPPB scores, session attendance, ethnicity, age, gender, service provider and area deprivation index) and (2) exit interviews at 24&#x000a0;months with a sample of participants and exercise leaders (after intervention completion). Topic guides will be piloted with the REACT service user advisory group prior to use. The analysis will capture individual narratives/within-person processes of change, as well as drawing out common themes. Emergent themes will be compared and contrasted with the theorised processes of change specified in the logic model. Processes of engagement with the intervention will also be explored. Using data collected at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months, factors influencing maintenance of physical activity/exercise will be assessed and linked to responses at 6 months. This will allow a qualitative description of participants&#x02019; experiences, potential pathways and barriers to maintenance. Techniques to enhance the objectivity and depth of the analysis may include cross-tabulation, negative case analysis and hypothesis testing, as well as respondent validation. Service users will also be involved in the interpretation of the data through workshops to discuss transcripts and the researchers&#x02019; interpretations of the data</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par111">Quantitative testing of hypotheses derived from the logic model. For example, we hypothesise that measures of theoretical determinants of behaviour change will change more in the intervention arm than in controls (between-group comparisons) and that these changes will be associated with between-group effects on physical activity (mediation analyses). Brief questionnaires assessing mechanisms of change suggested by Social Cognitive Theory and Self-Determination Theory (the main theoretical underpinnings of the intervention model) will be administered at baseline, 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). We will also investigate the mediating and moderating effects of changes in physical activity on the primary outcome (physical function) and other outcomes of interest (cognitive function, sleep quality, well-being, depression) using multiple regression models</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par112">Breaking the spiral of decline that is characterised by loss of physical and cognitive function, reduced capacity to independently manage daily tasks and reductions in social interaction is fundamental to healthy ageing. It also has the potential to substantially reduce reliance on health and social care services as people grow older. This is particularly true for those who are at risk of mobility-related disability resulting from low levels of physical activity as they settle into changed routines after their primary working years. Strong clinical evidence supports the role of physical activity in reducing or even reversing this decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there have been few attempts to develop, and rigorously evaluate, feasible models of physical activity promotion for older people in community settings. In particular, there are no programmes that specifically target people at high risk of mobility-related disability, and few programmes are grounded in service-user and service-provider perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par113">REACT represents the first large-scale, pragmatic, community-based trial in the UK to target the non-disabled but high-risk segment of the older population with an intervention to reduce mobility-related disability. This approach has many advantages. People in this category are still physically capable of engaging in a progressive exercise programme and have potential for prevention of further physical decline. A programme that can successfully engage them in sufficient activity to improve strength, aerobic capacity, coordination and balance would have a major impact on their prospects for sustained health and independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par114">REACT is also the first study of its kind to conduct a full economic and comprehensive process evaluation alongside the RCT. These elements will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the REACT intervention, as well as build a deeper understanding of crucial mechanisms for (1) generating physiological and mental health benefit in this population and (2) promoting sustained change in physical activity. The MRI sub-study will provide significant advancements in the neuroscientific literature, adding comprehensive data on the impact of physical activity and functional ability on brain volume and cognitive function in later life.</p><p id="Par115">If effective and cost-effective, the REACT intervention has strong potential to be implemented widely in the UK and elsewhere. The REACT study is likely to inform UK and international healthy ageing guidance and health promotion policies for the prevention of disability and the maintenance of independent living in older adults.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par116">Enrolment into the study started in March 2016.
