balance, gait, and activities of daily living (ADLs) in stroke patients. [Subjects] Among
20 participants with stroke, 10 were randomly assigned to the experimental group, and 10
were randomly assigned to the control group. The experimental group participated in
horse-riding exercise for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Balance was
tested with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Gait was measured using the 10-Meter Walk Test
(10MWT). ADLs were tested with the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). Differences between pre-
and post-experiment values within the two groups were compared using paired t-tests.
Between-group differences were compared using independent t-tests. [Results] The
experimental group showed significant improvements in balance, gait, and ADLs following
horse-riding exercise. Additionally, the experimental group showed significant differences
in balance, gait, and ADLs compared with in the control group. [Conclusion] These results
support that horse-riding exercise enhances balance, gait, and ADLs in stroke patients.
This study supports the need for further research on horse-riding exercise programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Horse-riding exercise</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Activities of daily living</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke, caused by ischemia or hemorrhage, results from the interruption of blood supply to
the brain that induces constant deficiency of oxygen and causes brain damage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Though fatality after stroke has been
greatly reduced by the development of medical technology, stroke presents physical and
mental obstacles that impair quality of life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Once a stroke has occurred, various motor
skills deteriorate, and therefore stroke rehabilitation focuses greatly on exercises
designed to recover motor skills<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance is the ability to sustain the center of gravity, and it is a complex process of
controlling posture when conducting a voluntary movement and responding to external
perturbations<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients often
experience hemiplegia, weakness of one side of the body that induces unbalanced posture,
loss of proprioception, and abnormal muscle tone, thereby reducing balance ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Due to balance instability, stroke patients develop an abnormal gait with a short weight
support duration on the affected side, and differences between the strides of the normal
side and affected side cause the gait speed to decrease, affecting physical ability and
impairing independent daily activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to solve problems concerning balance, walking, and daily activities related to
stroke, various treatment methods such as neurological development treatment (NDT),
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), the Brunnstr&#x000f6;m approach, and motor
relearning programs have been developed<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Ideal treatment programs are yet to be discovered, and various approaches are being
developed for more effective treatment<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many approaches to physical therapy are being developed, and horse-riding exercise is one
method being tested for rehabilitation. Horse-riding exercise is a complex and scientific
therapeutic method resembling movements from riding a horse<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Horse riding strongly stimulates proprioceptive sensation by
providing the rhythmical and repetitive movements of a horse. These movements stimulate the
upper motor neuron system and input information similar to movement patterns of the pelvis
when walking<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such movements control abnormal muscle tone and movement patterns
while enhancing balance and walking<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Positive effects that can be induced from horse-riding exercise include recovery of
disability in patients with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord damage<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, research related to horse-riding exercise is being conducted, but studies
investigating the effect of horse-riding exercise on balance, gait, and activities of daily
living (ADLs) in stroke patients are still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
to investigate the effect of simulated horse-riding exercise on balance, gait, and ADLs in
stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 20 patients diagnosed with stroke on MRI at least 6 months prior to the
study. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group (5 males, 5 females) and an
experimental group (5 males, 5 females), who participated in a horse-riding exercise
program. The inclusion criteria were a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater
than 24 points, ability to walk more than 10 meters independently, and Brunnstr&#x000f6;m approach
stage of four or greater. Participants were excluded if they suffered from a visual
disability or orthopedic disease of the lower extremities. Before the experiment, all
participants were notified of the purpose and method of this study and provided written
consent in advance. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nambu
University and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.

months.</p><p>Both groups were treated using an NDT approach for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 6
weeks. Horse-riding exercise utilized mechanical equipment that effectively resembles the
movement of an actual horse (JOBA EU7800, Panasonic Corporation, Osaka, Japan). The
equipment generates three-dimensional movements including twisting, up-down slide,
back-forth slide, up-down roll, and back-forth roll. In this study, a whole body course and
partial body course were alternately conducted, and the difficulty was increased from level
1 to 4, according to the adaptability of the participants. Participants were allowed to
freely control their posture and were instructed to grab the handle to ensure correct
posture while riding.</p><p>Balance was measured using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The BBS is composed of a total 14
items and covers sitting, standing, and posture changes. The total score is 56 points, and a
higher score corresponds to better balancing skill. Gait was measured using the 10-Meter
Walk Test (10MWT). The 10MWT measures time spent while walking a total of 14 meters,
excluding the first and last 2 meters. ADLs were measured using the Modified Barthel Index
(MBI). The MBI has a total score of 100 points and contains a total of 10 items including
personal sanitation, independent bathing, eating, using the bathroom, dressing, controlling
bowel movements, controlling urination, walking or using a wheel chair, and moving towards a
bed or chair. Scores of 0 to 24 indicate total dependency, scores of 25 to 49 indicate
mostly dependent, 50 to 74 indicate moderate dependency, score of 75 to 90 indicate minor
dependency, and score of 91 to 99 indicate minimal dependency. All measurements were carried
out before and 6 weeks after the experiment.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). General features of the
participants were detailed as means and standard deviations using descriptive statistics.
Differences before and after the experiment within the two groups were compared using paired
t-test analysis. To compare between-group differences before and after the horse-exercise
therapy experiment, independent t-tests were used. The level of statistical significance was
set as &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes in the scores of the in BBS, 10MWT, and MBI are listed in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of BBS, 10MWT, and MBI measures between the experimental and control

balance, gait, and ADLs in stroke patients. Significant improvements in balance were as
observed in the experimental group (p &#x0003c; 0.05) but not in the control group. Balance,
gait, and ADLs were significantly different between the two groups (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Research
by Han et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and Lee et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> found the BBS to be more significantly
improved among those participating in horse-riding therapy than in control subjects.
Horse-riding exercise simulates the natural walking rhythm of a horse, which is similar to
that of the human trunk during motion. While a constant movement pattern is being applied,
the trunk muscles act to counteract gravity<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Reduction of the instability of trunk muscles and enhancement of proprioception and
vestibular function are considered to improve balance ability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such results mean that
the horse-riding exercise used in this study has positive effects on balance in stroke
patients.</p><p>Patients with hemiplegia from stroke exert a great deal of energy and have difficulty
walking independently<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in gait
were observed to be significant in the experimental group but not in the control group (p
&#x0003c; 0.05). In the between-group comparison, the outcomes of the experimental group were
significantly different from those of the control group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Lee et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> showed significant gait speed improvement
following horse-riding exercise. McGibbon et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> used horse-riding exercise in children with cerebral palsy for 12
weeks, and it enhanced gait skill by activating adductor muscles. This study also applied a
similar exercise program and showed similar results. Rhythmical and repetitive movements of
the mechanical horse simulate movements during gait and provide a positive effect on gait
skill<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Constant pelvis movement and
enhancement of trunks motor skills seem to improve the walking ability of patients.</p><p>Stroke patients need to set goals to improve balance and gait skills that can enable
independent daily activities<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Significant changes in ADLs were observed in the experimental group (p &#x0003c; 0.05) but not in
the control group. In the between-group comparison, the outcomes of the experimental group
were significantly different from those of the control group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Jung et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> showed improvement in movements related to
daily activities in children with cerebral palsy following a horse-riding exercise program.
Kim<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> used horse-riding exercises in
autistic children, and their movements of daily activities significantly improved,
coinciding with this study&#x02019;s results. Horse-riding exercise uses various movements in a
horse that can naturally provide physical effects to stimulate and activate shortened
muscles in order to improve movements in daily activities.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the small number of participants, which precludes
generalization. Follow-up studies will need to confirm the durability of these effects, and
further research should verify the benefits of horse-riding exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Feigin</surname><given-names>VL</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke epidemiology in the developing
