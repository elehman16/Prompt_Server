electromagnetic field (PEMF) in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. [Subjects and
Methods] This was a randomized clinical trial that included 52 girls diagnosed with
primary dysmenorrhea and who were assigned randomly into two groups of equal numbers. The
treatment was three sessions every cycle for three consecutive cycles where group (A)
included those participants treated with HILT 15&#x02005;min/session and group (B) those who were
treated with PEMF 30&#x02005;min/session. All patients were evaluated before starting the
treatment as well as after the end of treatment by present pain intensity scale and the
prostaglandin level in blood and pain relief scale at the end of treatment for both
groups. [Results] The results showed a significant decrease in the severity of pain,
statistically significant decrease in prostaglandin level in blood, and a statistically
significant pain alleviation in both groups. With comparison between both groups there was
a statistically significant decrease in the severity of pain, significant decrease in the
blood levels of PGF2&#x003b1;, in group (A) than group (B). [Conclusion] Both HILT and PEMF are
effective in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea with HILT being superior to PEMF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Dysmenorrhea</kwd><kwd>High intensity laser therapy</kwd><kwd>Pulsed electromagnetic field</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dysmenorrhea can be defined as painful menses in females that represent a common
gynecologic problem worldwide affecting about 60% of women among adolescent and young adult
females. It categorized into two types: primary and secondary dysmenorrhea<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Primary dysmenorrhea is a painful menstrual cramp that felt in lower abdomen and pain can
transfer downwards into the inner thighs. Common symptoms displayed by females suffering
from the condition include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, lethargy, and headaches, many of
which can have an adverse impact on daily life<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Primary dysmenorrhea usually happen in earlier age but may be
remained until 50&#x02005;years old. It begins around the time that a female&#x02019;s initial menstruation
begins. Specifically, it appears one to two years following the start of menarche (first
menstruation), and this notably corresponds to the incidence of consistent ovulatory cycles.
Typically, the discomfort associated with the condition starts several hours prior to or
following the beginning of menstruation, and its duration is two to three days<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The etiology of primary dysmenorrhea is not exactly understood, but can be explained by
excessive or imbalanced secretion of uterine prostaglandins form endometrium during
menstruation with falling progesterone level during the luteal phase brings about these
elevations, particularly PGF2&#x003b1;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
levels reach their peak during the initial two days of menstruation and, as such, facilitate
myometrial contractions characterised by ischemia and dysrhythmic behaviour, with increased
basal tone and increased active pressure. Uterine hyper-contractility, reduced uterine blood
flow, and increased peripheral nerve hypersensitivity are effective in inducing pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Prostaglandin (PG) increases the level of
tension and contraction strength of uterus and blood vessels, and this process may induce
pain, thus, the measure of PG level can be an indicator of intensity of dysmenorrhea. PG
level can show the therapeutic effect on dysmenorrhea objectively<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Drugs therapy centring on PG inhibitors, which include
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), result in hepatic, renal, hematologic, and
gastrointestinal pain, along with central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, which includes
indigestion, nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, rashes,
impaired renal blood flow, renal papillary necrosis, and vertigo<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A range of treatment options have been examined in the literature, including TENS, heat
application, pelvic floor and aerobic exercises, and acupuncture, with several producing
effective outcomes<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low level laser
therapy (LLLT) has an effective results in the treatment of acute pain and it helps in pain
reduction in the short term through alleviating the inflammation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In comparison
with other modalities LLLT is an effective method in the treatment of dysmenorrhea<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It reduces both prostaglandin E and F
production, and stimulates inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandin synthetase<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pulsed High Intensity Laser Therapy
(HILT) has been used in many fields of physical therapy as sports, traumatology and pain
therapy with high excellent results<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pulse Electromagnetic field (PEMF) has been used in the physical therapy field as a useful
modality for treatment of many diseases, it shows vasodilatation, analgesic effect,
anti-inflammatory action and anti-edematous activity<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. PEMF offers a non-invasive, harmless, and simple method to
directly treat the site of lesion, the source of pain and inflammation in a wide range of
diseases and pathologies<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
beneficial effects of PEMF on body tissues include: pain reduction, decrease of
inflammation, improving the number and action of white blood cells and fibroblast in the
wound, increase rate of edema reduction, absorption of hematoma, stimulates osteogensis,
anti-infective activity, and increases the healing of peripheral and central nervous
system<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Study to investigate the
effect of PEMF in treatment of primary dysmenorrhea concluded that PEMF appears to be
effective in treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, providing an effective, safe, low-cost and
successful alternative rather than pharmacological treatment<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of pulse
HILT versus PEMF in treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Randomized clinical trial study was carried out after full explanation of the treatment
protocol and signing of a consent form. A research approval was obtained from the Ethics
Review Committee of the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were set as follows:</p><p>&#x02022; The body mass index of participants should not exceed 29&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> with no medical
or psychological problems.</p><p>&#x02022; None of them received any medical treatment regarding their menstrual pain during the
study course.</p><p>Sample size analysis was conducted before the study to calculate the adequate sample size
according to previous research results of LLLT in primary dysmenorrhea<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Using G-power analysis version 3.1 after setting the
effect size to 0.8 (large effect size based on Cohen&#x02019;s d and to detect even low differences
among the study groups), high power of 0.8 and type 1 error of 0.05; 52 patients was needed
to conduct the study.</p><p>A total of 52 female participants aged between 18&#x02013;24 years and diagnosed with primary
dysmenorrhea were randomized into two groups (HILT group, and PEMF group) using a GraphPad
program (San Diego, USA). HILT group consisted of 26 female, received pulsed HILT program
for ten minutes three sessions every cycle for three consecutive cycles and PEMF group
consisted of 26 female, received PEMF program for ten minutes sessions every cycle for three
consecutive cycles.</p><p>Present Pain intensity scale (PPi): Participants were asked to show the severity of pain on
PPi<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a graphic rating scale
with numerical values placed equidistantly along a line in which 0 equal no pain, 1 equal
mild pain, 2 equal moderate pain, 3 equal severe pain and 4 mean unbearable pain. It was
done before and after treatment course for both groups. Pain relief scale (PR)<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> was used after treatment course to
indicate the rate of pain relief. The PR is similar to present pain intensity scale in which
0 equal no relief, 1 equal slight relief, 2 equal good relief, 3 equal excellent relief and
4 equal complete relief.</p><p>Blood samples (5&#x02005;ml) were collected from each participant Sample before and after three
months of treatment application to measure the concentrations of serum PGF2&#x003b1; using
commercially available ELISA kit (Abcam, MA, USA). All serum samples were processed in
duplicate on a fully automated ELISA system (Human Diagnostics) and according to the
manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. As reported by the manufacturer, the kit had a sensitivity of
0.98&#x02005;pg/ml together with inter and intra-assay coefficient of variation of 7.1% and 10.1%,
respectively.</p><p>Each group received the intended treatment for three sessions every cycle for three
consecutive cycles when the subject complained of unbearable pain a day before the beginning
of menstrual flow, and the treatment was repeated on the first and second days after the
menstrual flow. Participants in HILT group received pulsed HILT with pulsed Nd:YAG laser
produced by a HIRO 3 device (ASA, Arcugnano, Vicenza, Italy). The HILT apparatus used
postulates (Nd:YAG), with pulsed emission (1,064&#x02005;nm), very high peak powers (3 kW), high
levels of energy density (fluency from 810&#x02013;1,780&#x02005;mJ/cm), very short pulse duration of
(120&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;s), a duty cycle of approximately 0.1%, and frequency (10&#x02013;40&#x02005;Hz). The HILT was
applied with total energy of 880&#x02005;J, which was administered through three phases. During the
initial phase, laser fluency was set to 510&#x02005;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> for total 350&#x02005;J that include
fast scanning for suprapubic and paravertebral regions from L<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;S<sub>3</sub> and,
the intermediate phase was applied using a headpiece to nine point, three points
supra-pubically while the patient in crock lying position, and six points over the
lumbosacral region from L<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;S<sub>3</sub> three shoots for each side while the
patient in prone lying position with 20&#x02005;J and fluency of 610&#x02005;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and 14 sec
for each point for total of 180&#x02005;J. The final phase was the same as initial phase but with
slow scanning with total application time of 15&#x02005;min. Participants in PEMF group received
PEMF using EASY quattro PRO (ASA, Arcugnano, Vicenza, Italy). The treatment was applied
while the participant was lying in a comfortable modified side lying position with small
paddings under her body curves. Then, PEMF was applied for 30&#x02005;min with one electrode above
suprapubic region and another electrode on the lumbosacral region from (L4&#x02212;S3) supported by
long strap with frequency of 50&#x02005;Hz and intensity of 60 gauss. The device was calibrated for
constant output thorough out the experiment at the Department of physical therapy, faculty
of Applied Medical Science, Umm Al-Qura University.</p><p>The outcome measures were pain and PG level. The pain, which was measured pre and after
treatment intervention, was assessed by PPi and PR scale, while PG level was assessed prior
to the treatment and three months after treatment by taking a blood sample to detect its
level. Descriptive statistics were used in the form of means, standard deviations (SD), and
qualitative variable analytical experimentations, including the use of a student t-test to
comparatively examine means prior to and following the treatment. A significance level of
0.05 was applied across each statistical examination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The outcomes for each treatment variable being presented as follows:</p><p>Present pain intensity scale: As indicated in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Tables

bone and in the lower abdomen during menstruation. Affecting from 50% to over 70% of women
of childbearing age<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, its symptoms can be described by the increase release of
uterine prostaglandins, particularly PGF2&#x003b1; that causes over activity of myometrium, ischemia
and stimulation of nerve endings<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
purpose of this study has been to investigate the effect of Pulsed HILT versus PEMF in
treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Results of this study illustrated highly statistically
significant decrease in pain severity in the study groups (p&#x0003c;0.0001), also, there was
highly statistically significant decrease in serum prostaglandin level in both groups
(p&#x0003c;0.0001); while in comparing both groups there was significant decrease in both pain
and prostaglandin serum level in HILT group more than PEMF group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>The results of this study agree with Bjordal et al., who stated that laser is effective in
the treatment of acute pain and results in pain reduction in the short term through
alleviating the inflammation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
results also, in line with England and Sabour who stated that LLLT is an effective method in
the treatment of dysmenorrhea in comparison with other modalities. LLLT reduces the
production of prostaglandin E and F, consequences of accumulation of superoxide dismutase,
which acts as an inhibitor in the production of prostaglandins<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study&#x02019;s
findings are also consistent with Thabet et al., which examined a 30-participant sample
group to examine the impact that physical activity paired with LLLT has on the pain
experienced during PD. The researchers employed a Gallium-arsenide laser (wavelength of
635&#x02013;670&#x02005;nm and a 5 mv power), and a McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was responded to by the
participants prior to and following treatment. The researchers also assessed serum cortisol
levels prior to the research, and this was conducted once again after the 3-month treatment.
LLLT was employed on the day prior to menstruation in addition to the first and second days
of menstruation, and 3 shots (lasting 60 seconds) were implemented to the suprapubic region.
The paravertebral region in prone position and the L4&#x02013;S3 region were also targeted with
similar 60-second shots. As indicated by the results, pain severity was reduced, with 23
participants (76.67%) experiencing complete relief<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, the present findings are also supported by the results of Shin et al., who
used laser instead of needle for acupuncture. The researchers employed a laser rather than
an acupuncturist&#x02019;s needle to examine a 31-participant sample group, consisting of females
experiencing PD. Two groups were created from the sample, with 21 participants being
administered with LLLT and 10 participants being administered with a placebo laser. Prior to
the emergence of the monthly menstruation period, the participants underwent a 5-day
treatment course of either LLLT or the placebo laser, which lasted for a period of 20
minutes. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was employed to gain insight into pain intensity,
and this was utilised each month for a period of 6 successive months. Of the total 31
participants, 16 females experienced satisfaction in the initial month, while 5 experienced
satisfaction in the second LLLT cycle. Notably, pain alleviation was reported by 83% of the
participants<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the
current study agrees with Kempf et al., double-blind study performed acupuncture with laser.
Laser performed more effectively than the placebo laser for the treatment of dysmenorrhea,
with the method used by the researchers involving the bilateral stimulation of 8 acupuncture
points (SP6&#x02013;LV3&#x02013;LI4), and CV3&#x02013;ST36 (on the right side of body) using a 20-minute laser for
three menstrual cycles. The VAS scale was employed to determine pain intensity, and the
results clearly evidenced pain alleviation for the laser group<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>No studies have been yet carried out to investigate the efficacy of HILT on pain associated
with primary dysmenorrhea. Our results of HILT may cause hopeful new therapeutic tool in the
treatment of primary dysmenorrhea as our findings showed that HILT is more effective in
alleviating pain associated with dysmenorrhea than PEMF. The pulsed Nd:YAG laser or pulsed
HILT has a wavelength of 1,064&#x02005;nm and acts in a therapeutic window that permits it to
infiltrate and spread easily through human tissues, as the skin does not absorb this
wavelength due to lack of proper concentration of endogenous chromophores. Although HILT has
a peak power of up to 3 kW, the duty cycle of a brief duration limits heat accumulation
inside tissues and quickly produces a photothermal and photochemical effect<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have proven the ability
of pulsed Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of various musculoskeletal and neurological
problems, and it is thought to have anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous, reparative and
analgesic effects<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sedative effect of
HILT may be as a result of various mechanisms of action, involving its capability to
decrease the conduction of the pain impulses and to raise the rate of morphine-mimetic
substances production in the human tissues<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it may have the ability to block pain transmission
through A&#x003b4;- and C-fiber, increases blood flow, vascular permeability, and cell
metabolism<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s results are consistent with those of Markov and Colbert, who found that
magnetic field therapy produces a range of impacts associated with inflammation reduction,
sedation, vasodilation, and the reduction of oedematous impacts, paired with an increase in
the pain sensitivity limits<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
findings published in Khamaganova et al. are similarly consistent with the present research
in that the previous researchers found evidence to suggest that high-frequency PEMF (with
more than 10&#x02013;15 individual treatments at 2-day intervals) is effective in treating back pain
(89%), postoperative pain (80%), endometriosis (40%), the pain experienced due to pelvic
inflammatory disease (80%), and various forms of lower abdominal pain (83%)<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The outcomes of the present study are consistent with a double-blinded clinical study
evaluated the effectiveness of PEMF for treating knee pain in osteoarthritis. Treatment was
applied for eight sessions, 6-minutes each over a 2 weeks period. Each patient recorded
perceived pain on a 10-point scale before and after each treatment session. The group
treated with PEMF showed a 46% decrease in pain vs. an average 8% in the placebo group. Two
weeks after the study, pain diminished by 49% versus the placebo group, which demonstrated
9% pain decrease<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results are
supported by Strauch et al., who indicated that PEMF was an effective therapeutic tool in
alleviating pain, muscle spasm and associated swelling during tooth removal and used
effectively in postsurgical pain, treatment of chronic wounds and assisting in angiogenesis
and vasodilation<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hutchinson et al.&#x02019;s
results are supportive of this study&#x02019;s findings, with their research investigating pain
alleviation associated with burst ovarian cysts, long-term urinary tract infections, uterine
fibrosis, endometriosis, dyspareunia, and postoperative pelvic hematomas<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study&#x02019;s participants responded
positively and enhancements were observed regarding analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and
immune-enhancing impacts.</p><p>Numerous mechanisms including inflammatory mediators might explain the pain-relieving
effects of PEMF treatment. It has been shown that PEMF treatment increases the
anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 and decreases the pro-inflammatory cytokine
IL-1b, which is a strong hyperalgesic mediator and a nociceptors stimulator through direct
and indirect pathways<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Animal studies
have shown that IL-1b might trigger nociceptive fibres in a brief time in sensory
transmission, and IL-1b receptors were found in many sensory neurons<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, IL-1b also modifies neuronal excitability
via its effect on neuronal receptors such as gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, sodium
channels, glutamate receptor and ion channel protein found in nerve cells, and through its
influence on the release or the triggering of nociceptive molecules such as IL-6, and
prostaglandins, and substance-P<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, PEMF may also cause
analgesic effects by increasing the synthesis and release of nitrous oxide (NO). This, in
turn, enhances the analgesic effects in the periphery in early stages of inflammation, and
pain severity has been shown to inversely correlate with NO levels<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. PEMF has been also suggested to enhance the endogenous
opioid precursor proteins<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It was concluded that HILT and PEMF are effective modalities in the treatment of primary
dysmenorrhea, with HILT being more effective modality which can be used as an alternative
conservative therapy rather than medication that have numerous side effects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mahvash</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Alijani Eidy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mehdi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of physical activity on primary dysmenorrhea of
