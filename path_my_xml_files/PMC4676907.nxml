In 2008, 30% of all global deaths (17.3 million) were attributed to CVD (World <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">Health Organization 2015</xref>). Of these deaths, an estimated 7.3 million were due to coronary artery disease (World <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Health Organization 2011</xref>).</p><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from progressive blockage of the coronary arteries by atherothrombosis (Bojar <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Clinical syndromes result from an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand resulting in inadequate myocardial perfusion (ischaemia). CAD can be treated with medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient's clinical presentation, the extent and nature of coronary disease, the degree of inducible ischaemia on stress testing and the status of ventricular function are taken into consideration when determining whether a patient is at increased risk of an adverse cardiac event and is therefore an appropriate candidate for an interventional procedure (Patel <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). An indication for CABG should be considered if PCI is not feasible or when the short- and long-term benefits of CABG are superior to those of PCI (Bojar <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite substantial improvements in myocardial preservation strategies, cardiac surgery is still associated with severe complications. The incidence of complications will further increase in the future as cardiac surgery is increasingly being performed on an aging patient population with increased numbers of comorbid conditions and complex coronary lesions. Analyses of large patient databases indicate that major complications including death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and failure, renal failure, stroke, gastrointestinal complications and respiratory failure occur in up to 16% of all patients during the initial hospital stay (Ghosh <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><sec><title>Description of the condition</title><p>Worldwide, an estimated 800,000 to 1,000,000 CABG procedures are performed annually, with about 400,000 in the US alone (Centers <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">for Disease Control and Prevention 2015</xref>). Most commonly, the procedure is performed through a median sternotomy with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardioplegic arrest. Revascularisation during CABG is obtained by creating new routes for the blood (bypasses) around narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. Autologous venous or arterial graft material is harvested from the patients' extremities and re-implanted in aortocoronary position. In addition to the open surgical procedure under circulatory arrest, both minimally invasive and beating heart strategies exist.</p><p>Several approaches have been implemented to reduce the perioperative risk of myocardial ischaemia. Among the most commonly applied are hypothermia, cardioplegic solutions and the general limitation of procedure times. These strategies have led to a pronounced reduction in procedural mortality and morbidity (Estafanous <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Nevertheless, postoperative elevated creatine kinase or troponin levels indicate persisting myocardial damage due to intraoperative ischaemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. Methods of pre- and post conditioning have been proven to reduce I/R damage in vitro, however the translation into a clinically relevant protective strategy is still challenging.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the intervention</title><p>Ischaemic preconditioning is an experimental method to increase the body's resistance to a projected reduced oxygen supply. In the heart, ischaemic preconditioning is an intrinsic process whereby repeated short episodes of ischaemia protect the myocardium against successive ischaemic insults.</p><p>Since the mid-1980s, the existence of preconditioning as a protective mechanism has been known from animal models (Murry <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). A brief stimulus of sub-lethal ischaemia was able to induce at least two time windows in which the myocardium is protected from otherwise deleterious noxa. In recent decades, several alternative stimuli (e.g. opioids, volatile anaesthetics, noble gases) have been shown to induce the same effect. Amazingly, the effect can also be induced by a remotely applied temporary ischaemia. The term remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) was first coined by Przylenk in 1993 (Przyklenk <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). The remote ischaemic preconditioning intervention is performed by temporary inflation of a blood pressure cuff above the systolic arterial pressure on one chosen extremity. The blood flow from and to this extremity is blocked and local ischaemia occurs. Reperfusion washes released mediators from the isolated tissue into the circulation.</p><p>Within the past decade, remote ischaemic preconditioning has been rapidly translated from experimental studies to promising proof-of-principle clinical trials. Various studies have demonstrated that RIPC reduces myocardial injury in various surgical settings (Ali <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Cheung <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Hausenloy <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hausenloy <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hausenloy <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Heusch <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Thielmann <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In contrast, other reports have not confirmed the positive effects of RIPC (Karuppasamy <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Young <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The underlying reasons might be the RIPC protocol itself or the use of volatile anaesthetics in several of these studies, which in itself is known to protect the heart against ischaemia/reperfusion injury (Karuppasamy <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Kottenberg <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the adverse events associated with RIPC are not known. The repeated pumping up of the blood pressure cuff is considered to be safe, and since the intervention occurs after the induction of anaesthesia, additional pain or feelings of stress through the actual intervention are unlikely. The potential risk of thrombosis, plaque rupture or embolisation in patients with pre-existing atherosclerosis in the upper extremities is also regarded as low.</p></sec><sec><title>How the intervention might work</title><p>In remote ischaemic preconditioning, temporal ischaemia of a distant compartment positively affects the human heart. The humoral factors involved are unclear, but it is largely agreed upon that the effect is mediated via the blood stream. Suspected mediators are nitrites (Corti <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Rassaf <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), microRNA (Li <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Slagsvold <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and other chemokines. Within the myocardium, the effect is supposedly mediated via the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) and survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) pathways (Hausenloy <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and preserves mitochondrial function (Slagsvold <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and myocardial performance (Illes <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Li <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Lu <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) in ischaemia/reperfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Why it is important to do this review</title><p>Several randomised trials comparing RIPC versus no RIPC in patients undergoing CABG have been conducted, but the results have varied and most trials were too underpowered to reach a conclusion on clinically relevant outcome measures. Following the conduct of several small trials, two major trials on remote ischaemic preconditioning are currently completing recruiting and will provide data on 3012 patients undergoing CABG/cardiac surgery (Hausenloy <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>; Meybohm <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Final consensus is needed on the effectiveness of RIPC for cardiac patients scheduled for CABG.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To assess the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, with or without valve surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Criteria for considering studies for this review</title><sec><title>Types of studies</title><p>We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

We will consider studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We will assess the method as follows:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>low risk (no blinding of outcome assessment but the authors judged that the outcome was not likely to be influenced by this);</p></list-item><list-item><p>high risk (no blinding of outcome assessment and the outcome measurement was likely to have been influenced by this);</p></list-item><list-item><p>unclear risk (insufficient information to permit judgement; the study did not address this).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec><title>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</title><p>For each included study, we will describe the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether the intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.

Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will interpret the results of the systematic review and meta-analyses in light of the findings with respect to risk of bias. When considering treatment effects, we will take into account the risk of bias for the studies that contribute to that outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of bias in conducting the systematic review</title><p>We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the 'Differences between protocol and review' section of the systematic review.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measures of treatment effect</title><p>We will analyse dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

If asymmetry is detected in any of these tests, or is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it. If there are fewer than 10 studies included in this systematic review, we will assess reporting bias qualitatively based on the characteristics of the included studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Data synthesis</title><p>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (RevMan <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We will undertake meta-analyses only where this is meaningful, i.e. if the treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make sense.</p><p>Given the clinical heterogeneity in the modus operandi of RIPC and the heart surgery performed (CABG with or without valve surgery) we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary of average treatment effect across trials. We will treat the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. We will present results as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of T<sup>2</sup> and I<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</title><p>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful and, if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it. We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses.</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Differences in the number of RIPC cycles or their length.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences in the localisation of RIPC (upper or lower limb).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences in surgical techniques (off-pump versus on-pump CABG).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences in concomitant or no concomitant cardiovascular procedure to CABG (with or without valve surgery). We will distinguish between isolated or combined valve procedures (e.g. aortic valve and/or mitral valve repair).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Where subgroup analyses are performed we will restrict them to the primary outcomes. We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager (RevMan <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We will report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi<sup>2</sup> test and P value, and the I<sup>2</sup> value of the interaction test.</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>We will perform sensitivity analysis by limiting analyses to studies at low risk of bias. This will be done by excluding studies judged at high or unclear risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. We will give the criteria for these judgements in the 'Assessment of risk of bias in included studies' section.&#x000a0;</p><sec><title>Reaching conclusions</title><p>We will base our conclusions only on findings from the quantitative or narrative synthesis of included studies for this review. We will avoid making recommendations for practice and our implications for research will suggest priorities for future research and outline what the remaining uncertainties are in the area.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>None.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1"><title>APPENDICES</title><sec><title>Appendix 1.
