life in chronic stoke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Forty chronic stroke patients
participated in this study. They were divided into same number of experimental group (EG)
and control group (CG). EG participated in a 60-min Pilates training program, twice a week
for 12 weeks, while the CG did not participate in any exercise-related activities for the
duration and participating in general occupational therapy without any exercise-related
activities. Then the MMSE-K was performed before and after Pilates training to observe the
influence of Pilates training on the quality of life in chronic stroke patients. [Results]
Statistically significant improvement in the physical, social, and psychological domains
was found in EG after the training. No statistically significant difference was found in
all three quality of life domains for the CG. EG experienced a statistically significant
improvement in all quality of life domains compared with that of CG. [Conclusion]
Therefore, participation in Pilates training was found to effectively improve the quality
of life in stroke patients. Pilates training involves low and intermediate intensity
resistance and repetition that match the patient&#x02019;s physical ability and can be a remedial
exercise program that can improve physical ability and influence quality of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Pilates training</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a chronic disorder that is mainly caused by a decrease in the number of brain
cells, resulting from lack of oxygen due to a blockage or rupture in cerebral blood
flow<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, stroke is the second
highest cause of death after cancer, with 17 million occurrences annually worldwide. It is
also the disorder with the third highest proportion of disability occurrences, with numbers
increasing annually<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are varying
disabilities found in &#x0003e;85% of patients surviving stroke, including physical disabilities
due to stiffness, lack of physical coordination, or sensory paralysis, decrease in
intellectual abilities due to decreased focus or memory loss and other language
disabilities, mental disabilities due to sense of loss, etc<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined &#x0201c;quality of life&#x0201d; as a person&#x02019;s views
regarding their position in society, including physical, social, and psychological domains.
Moreover, they stated that higher or lower quality of life is determined according to an
individual&#x02019;s health, lifestyle and satisfaction, psychological and mental state,
independence, social environment, etc<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the quality of life in the majority of stroke patients, who are limited in their
ability to perform basic activities that are inherent to &#x0201c;quality of life&#x0201d; that is greatly
influenced by a person&#x02019;s health or disorder, was found to be remarkably low<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. After being discharged from the hospital,
patients who had stroke are typically unable to participate in consistent rehabilitation
training to recover their functionality due to time and financial difficulties. As a result,
patients often experience decreased will and tend to live on their own without any social
relations. Such results show that stroke patients experience decreased quality of life from
the physical, mental, and social perspectives after onset, and their quality of life
drastically decreases for 4&#x02005;years after the stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The rehabilitative objective of stroke patients is based on independent living by improving
their functional disabilities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, rehabilitation training for stroke patients focuses on improving flexibility,
muscular strength, coordination, and sense of balance to maintain an independent lifestyle
through the recovery of physical functions; thus, requiring consistent and long-term
treatment<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, a method that promotes the meaning of life and
qualitative value of life is an important factor to consider when planning rehabilitation
treatment in addition to preserving and extending life with respect to stroke, which is a
chronic illness that negatively affects an individual&#x02019;s quality of life<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, a
creative rehabilitation program must be offered that considers mental aspects on top of
medical treatment for improving a patient&#x02019;s balance and ability to walk when using exercise
therapy for recovering functions in stroke patients.</p><p>Pilates training, which was developed by Joseph Pilates based on regulatory exercise
training from spinal neutrality, was found to be highly effective for recovering physical
functions such as improving sense of balance, flexibility, and muscle and cardiopulmonary
functions in stroke patients in studies regarding the potential for Pilates training
programs to be applied to patients who were neurologically diagnosed with chronic
stroke<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, Pilates training goes beyond physical development by
using exercise methods or equipment and addresses all aspects of exercise that require
mental control based on eight principles: control, breathing, flowing movement, precision,
centering, stability, range of motion, and opposition, and improves an individual&#x02019;s health
in terms of their mind and body and even their quality of life<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pilates training also includes various programs that
enable the participation of patients who cannot participate in normal exercises due to
injury or vulnerable health issues through supportive equipment, such as Reformers,
Cadillacs, Wunda Chairs, Magic Rings, Magic Circles, and various types of Foot Correctors,
Sandbags, in addition to mat-based exercises<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Independent exercises can be created within each exercise process
to match each individual&#x02019;s needs<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, because Pilates is a type of
supervised training, it can be an ideal method of exercise for stroke patients who are
unable to exercise without help. It is a valuable rehabilitation exercise program that
reduces secondary obstacles with respect to rehabilitation exercises for stroke patients,
helps improve quality of life, and helps individuals exercise on their own with a sense of
independence.</p><p>However, most studies on Pilates training programs are conducted based on orthopedic
rehabilitation exercises<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on studies on Pilates conducted on normal adults,
consistent Pilates training resulted in increased abdominal strength, endurance, and trunk
flexibility<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, increased endurance in
the trunk extensor and flexor<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
improved dynamic balance<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies
conducted on senior citizens reported that Pilates was effective in improving static and
dynamic balance<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, and improving functions and strength in the lower extremities<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As such, the effects of Pilates training on physical functions have been verified in
various age groups, particularly the elderly, but there are not yet any studies on the
correlation between exercise in chronic stroke patients and quality of life. Therefore, this
paper will conduct an in-depth survey on the influence of the Pilates training program on
the quality of life in chronic stroke patients, and provide meaningful basic data that can
be used for developing exercise programs that increase rehabilitative effects for stroke
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study has 40 subjects (experimental group: n=20; control group: n=20). All were

center for the disabled. The control group included 20 stroke patients who were
participating in general occupational therapy without any exercise-related activities. The
selection criteria for the subjects in this study were as follows. 1) Patients with a
disease duration of 1&#x02005;year or longer, 2) Patients who scored 25 points or higher on the
MMSE-K (Mini Mental State Examination-Korean), 3) Patients who are able to communicate, 4)
Patients who did not faint or resist, 5) Patients who were able to walk for 10&#x02005;min or
longer. Patients with heart disease, high blood pressure, or pain that could not be
controlled and patients with fractures in the pelvic floor, traumatic injury to the
peripheral nerves, or visual or hearing disabilities were excluded. This study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea National Sport University (20161123&#x02013;02), and
conducted after the requirements and purpose of the study were thoroughly explained to all
subjects and a written consent form was obtained.</p><p>The MMSE-K is a standardized cognitive function test that was developed by Folstein et al.
<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, and then translated by Park and
Kwon<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. This test clinically evaluates
cognitive level and was used in this study to evaluate the cognitive abilities that are
required to participate in tasks when selecting research subjects. The MMSE-K has 12 items
in six categories, and the reliability between inspectors is 0.9934. In the test results for
each individual, scores of 24 of 30 or lower were evaluated as loss of perception, thus only
patients with a score of 25 or higher and did not have loss of perception were selected as
the research subjects.</p><p>The Korean Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL) that was designed by Williams et
al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> and adapted by Moon<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> was used as the evaluation tool to survey
quality of life for the experimental group and control group. After the MMSE-K test, 40
subjects hoping to participate in this study personally completed and submitted a SS-QOL
once before and after participating in the Pilates training program. The SS-QOL has 49
questions, including 11 questions regarding quality of life in the physical domain, 22
questions regarding quality of life in the emotional domain, and 16 questions regarding
quality of life in the social domain. Each item was measured on a Likert 5-point scale (1
point: strongly agree; 5 points: strongly disagree), and higher scores meant the individual
reacted positively regarding their quality of life. The reliability of the SS-QOL has
received positive reactions with a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; value of 0.73 in the study conducted by
Williams et al. and a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; value of 0.80 in the study where it was translated into
Korean.<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> It also showed a high

<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study applied a pre-test, post-test with control group design and had subjects from
the experimental group participate in a 60-min Pilates training program twice a week for 12
weeks. The control group did not participate in any exercise-related activities for the
duration of the experiment, and participated in a 50-min occupational session thrice a
week.</p><p>The Pilates training program in this study lasted 60&#x02005;min per session, involving 10-min
warm-up exercises before the main exercises, 40-min main exercises, and 10-min cool-down
exercises. Each action in the training was repeated eight times. The Pilates program used in
this study was based on the actions used in the mat-based exercise program in a preceding
study conducted by Lim et al.<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
these actions were at beginning or intermediate levels, considering the characteristics of
stroke patients. In addition, hemiplegia characteristics were put into consideration, and
props were used to help subjects perform these actions. Props included balls, Magic Rings,
and Thera-Bands. Considering that subjects were chronic stroke patients, Pilates mat
exercises were modified to encourage subjects to perform them, and the exercises were
performed by helping subjects modify and supplement each action<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS for Window Version 21.0 was used to analyze the collected data, and all statistical
significance levels were set to 0.05 for this study. When analyzing the study results, a
Shapiro-Wilk normality test was conducted to check the normality of the quality of life
between the experimental and control groups, and an independent sample t-test was conducted
to test homogeneity before beginning the Pilates program. A matching sample t-test was
conducted to compare the physical, social, and psychological domains of quality of life
before and after starting the Pilates program for the experimental and control groups.
Lastly, an independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the physical, social, and
psychological domains of quality of life after starting the Pilates program for the
experimental and control groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Before starting the program, the normality verification results for quality of life in the

already completed hospitalization treatment after the onset of stroke by dividing them into
the experimental (n=20) and control groups (n=20) and conducting a Pilates training program
for 15 weeks. Here, the study results will be discussed.</p><p>A decrease in the ability to perform daily activities due to disabilities resulting from a
stroke reduces an individual&#x02019;s independent lifestyle and also decreases quality of life<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, an effective rehabilitation
program for stroke patients must not only restore their physical functions, but also help
with stability and support in consideration of their quality of life<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, the Pilates training program that is used as the
intervention method in this study was an aerobic exercise at a low intensity that is
appropriate for the elderly, unlike high-intensity muscle exercises. It is a remarkably
effective intervention method that can help restore physical functions and increase desire
to participate, similar to other rehabilitation exercise programs without need for fear of
resistance training in subjects<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various studies have reported that Pilates training exhibits positive effects, such as core
strength and flexibility in the elderly<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>, muscle endurance<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, posture
improvement<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>, dynamic balance<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup> etc. Based on these preceding studies,
Pilates is recognized as an exercise program that is effective in restoring physical
functions in stroke patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
elderly females, Pilates training was shown to improve autonomy, static balance, and quality
of life<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and even improve quality of
life that had decreased due to chronic disorders over a long period<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As such, Pilates training is being used as a positive exercise program that can improve
quality of life, including physical rehabilitation, but there is a lack of preceding studies
on whether or not Pilates training programs can bring changes in the quality of life in
stroke patients. Hence, statistically significant improvement (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the physical,
social, and psychological domains of quality of life through participation in Pilates by
stroke patients as shown in the results of this study can be used as basic data that can
propose Pilates training as an extremely effective exercise method for improving quality of
life in addition to restoring functions in stroke patients. Although the discussion has many
limitations due to a lack of preceding studies regarding quality of life in stroke patients,
the study results are in line with the results of studies that examined quality of life in
the elderly or disabled individuals who participated in Pilates training, including some
studies reporting that quality of life in the elderly increased as the level of
participation in Pilates increased<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>
and another study by Choi<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup> reporting
that quality of life increased with respect to joy, sense of satisfaction, and sense of
happiness in disabled individuals through regular Pilates training.</p><p>Pilates training not only improves physical function in stroke patients with reduced
independence as shown in preceding studies, but it is also an extremely effective exercise
program that improves quality of life in stroke patients as shown in the current study
results. This study only compared between an experimental group that participated in Pilates
training and a control group, but follow-up studies must verify the effect between Pilates
training and other intervention methods to improve quality of life. There is also a need to
observe changes in quality of life by applying this study on acute or subacute stroke
patients or other patients with varying neurological disorders instead of chronic stroke
patients. Finally, there is also a need to observe changes in quality of life through
participation in autonomous exercises considering restrictions in time and space when
participating in the Pilates training program.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the
