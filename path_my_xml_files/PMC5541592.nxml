</p><p>No randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the optimal duration of therapy for Gram-negative bacteraemia (GNB), a frequent community-associated and hospital-associated infection, has been published. Traditionally, guidelines have somewhat arbitrarily recommended long antibiotic courses of 2&#x02009;weeks, even though patients with no structural complications may recover after only 5&#x02009;days of therapy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Direct evidence is mounting that longer antibiotic courses leave patients at risk of acquiring difficult-to-treat multiresistant organisms. In one RCT comparing 8 to 15 days of antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia, multiresistant pathogens emerged significantly less frequently in those who had received 8 days of antibiotics.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Indeed, given rising concerns over resistance, many physicians have reduced antibiotic durations for uncomplicated GNB to 7 days with no apparent untoward consequences.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>Although these shorter durations have not been directly studied, there is nonetheless mounting evidence that they do not increase patients&#x02019; risk of relapse or other complications: several randomised studies evaluating the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> pneumonia,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> peritonitis<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> and surgical site infections<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> have included patients with concurrent bloodstream infections (both Gram negative and positive). These have compared durations as short as 5 days with longer (7 or 14 days) durations, and none demonstrated differences in the subset of patients with bacteraemia in clinical or microbiological outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nonetheless, none of these trials aimed specifically to assess the equivalence or the non-inferiority of shorter versus longer durations of antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Antibiotic durations could also be individualised, guided by clinical response as measured by objective markers, including inexpensive biomarkers such as C reactive protein (CRP).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This acute phase protein is a reliable and highly sensitive marker of inflammation across different patient populations and infections.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> While procalcitonin has been studied in more than 20 RCTs as a biomarker to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy in severe infections<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> and has indeed proved the concept of biomarker-guided therapy, observational and randomised studies<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 22</xref> have demonstrated no substantial differences in the ability of these two markers to reflect improvement (or worsening) in the clinical course of severe infections. Indeed, an RCT comparing the two markers head-to-head for guiding antibiotic therapy duration in sepsis found that a procalcitonin-based protocol was not superior to a CRP-based protocol, while no difference in morbidity or mortality was observed.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> CRP is substantially less expensive and more accessible than procalcitonin across various clinical settings: many community hospitals do not offer or routinely perform the procalcitonin assay.</p><p>The increasing equipoise with regard to varying treatment durations, the high incidence of Gram-negative bacteraemia (GNB), the relative ease of its diagnosis and the high stakes of antibiotic overconsumption in an ageing population combine to make antibiotic use for GNB an appropriate subject of study for a point-of-care (POC) randomised trial. We hypothesise that shorter antibiotic courses for GNB reduce antibiotic treatment days without increasing relapse rate or mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The trial&#x02019;s primary objective is to determine whether shorter antibiotic courses (5&#x02013;7 days) are non-inferior to a 2-week antibiotic course in the treatment of GNB. Secondary objectives are to determine whether antibiotic durations can be safely determined via a simple algorithm employing clinical and laboratory (CRP) markers, whether shorter antibiotic courses for GNB will result in a decrease in antibiotic days, incidence of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection, emergence of bacterial resistance and length of hospital stay.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analyses</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This investigator-initiated, analyst-blinded, POC RCT will enrol 500 hospitalised adult patients diagnosed with community-acquired or hospital-acquired GNB.

</p><sec id="s3c1"><title>CRP algorithm for the individualised-duration arm</title><p>The rationale for the individualised algorithm&#x02019;s specific use of a 75% reduction in peak CRP values is based on an RCT of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) with severe sepsis or septic shock with or without bacteraemia.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> That study demonstrated that an even more restrictive algorithm (antibiotic stop once the CRP has decreased by &#x02265;50% if peak CRP was &#x02265;100&#x02009;mg/L or once CRP is less than 25&#x02009;mg/L if peak CRP was &#x0003c;100&#x02009;mg/L) was safe and effective to reduce antibiotic use. This study additionally used a 7-day maximum duration of antibiotic therapy for non-bacteraemic patients while bacteraemic patients received at least 7&#x02009;days of antibiotics.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Our individualised algorithm is slightly adapted in analogy to procalcitonin-based algorithms, which have been successfully tested in several RCTs and used &#x02265;80% decreases of procalcitonin to discontinue antibiotic therapy.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 25&#x02013;28</xref> Our slight modifications take into account the slower decrease of CRP values compared with procalcitonin after resolution of an infection<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 29</xref> and incorporate an additional safety margin compared with the study by Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>, which treated bacteraemic patients differentially.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Of note, if the CRP value has not decreased by 75% by day 14, the marker will no longer be used to guide the duration of therapy. In these cases, the duration will be determined by clinical judgement per usual practice.</p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>Choice of antibiotic(s) and mode of administration</title><p>In all arms, the choice and mode of administration of antibiotic(s) will be left to the patient&#x02019;s attending physician and consulting infectious disease specialist and thus will follow usual standards of care, determined primarily by the three sites&#x02019; local institutional antibiotic therapy guidelines and antimicrobial resistance patterns. (Resistance prevalences in these hospitals and communities are similar, and the sites&#x02019; treatment guidelines contain no significant discrepancies with respect to acceptable antibiotic treatment standards of uncomplicated GNB.)</p><p>De-escalation (from a broad-spectrum to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic), switches from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy or from intermittent to continuous infusions or vice-versa, will be allowed per current standard practice. Study investigators will not interfere with these clinical decisions but will collect detailed data on all therapeutic management for later subanalyses. Although in Geneva randomisation and subsequent discontinuation of antibiotic therapy according to treatment arm will occur through the EHR, at all sites study investigators will also not interfere with attending physicians&#x02019; decisions to prolong therapy should a patient&#x02019;s clinical condition worsen. (See sections on statistical analysis and sample size calculation.)</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>We determine day 5 as the appropriate randomisation point because this is the usual timing of the study&#x02019;s and clinicians&#x02019; essential question:</p><disp-quote><p>Now that my patient has been stabilized and appears to be improving, when can I safely discontinue antibiotic therapy?</p></disp-quote><sec id="s3d1"><title>General principles and peripheral site randomisation procedures</title><p>Randomisation will be based on investigator-blinded blocks of randomly varying size to protect against potential predictability of treatment assignments. Blocks will contain 3, 6, 9 or 12 allocations. Randomisation will be stratified by study site, given that the three sites do not share a common EHR system and that site launches will be staggered (HUG will be the first site to launch; CHUV and KSSG will follow). For randomisation at HUG, see the next section. For randomisation at CHUV and KSSG, a statistician not involved in the study analysis will produce the randomisation list prior to the initiation of the study; the blocks&#x02019; order will be generated by use of a computer-based randomised number system, and the allocation implemented by means of sealed, opaque envelopes. The statistician will keep copies of the randomisation list.</p></sec><sec id="s3d2"><title>POC randomisation through the electronic health record at HUG</title><p>In POC trials, the extent of the EHR&#x02019;s involvement in randomisation is variable: on one end of the spectrum, the EHR simply provides an automatic alert to a prescribing physician making her aware of the existence of the POC trial and the patient&#x02019;s likely eligibility for it while simultaneously alerting a study investigator of the patient. At the other end of the spectrum, the EHR provides such alerts and, according to a physician-triggered EHR workflow, ultimately performs the actual randomisation with treatment assignment.</p><p>In the present study, through the work of information technology (IT) specialists at HUG, this principal study site will implement a fully EHR-integrated process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>) using HUG&#x02019;s &#x02018;Dossier patient informatique&#x02019; (DPI), with an initial, early alert to the study team at the moment the positive blood culture is registered in the EHR and automatic alerts for the treating physician at POC and study personnel once the patient enters the eligibility window. Study personnel will be notified to (1) provide information to the patient, (2) verify study inclusion criteria and then (3) approve the EHR-based randomisation.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Electronic-healthcare record workflow for patient identification, randomisation and follow-up in Geneva.

On the predetermined day of antibiotic discontinuation, both physicians and nurses will receive alerts regarding that discontinuation. These alerts will be repeated until the physician electronically signs his acknowledgement of the discontinuation.</p><sec id="s3d2a"><title>The control workflow</title><p>Importantly, the current study focus of GNB provides an ideal occasion for piloting and testing this process since, in reality, the study team will already be well aware of all patients hospital-wide with any GNB, given the established daily communication between microbiology laboratories and infectious disease teams described above. There will thus be a &#x02018;control&#x02019; workflow shadowing the automated EHR workflow at all times, with safety valves present at all workflow nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d2b"><title>The EHR-determined randomisation procedure</title><p>The EHR will be programmed to randomise using the same principles described above: randomisation will be based on randomly varying blocks with 3, 6, 9 or 12 treatment duration assignments. The bioinformatics specialist leading the informatics component of this trial will keep a copy of the EHR&#x02019;s randomisation list, as will a designated, unblinded member of the study team (control workflow).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Blinding</title><sec id="s3e1"><title>&#x02018;<italic>Ad terminum</italic>&#x02019; blinding of patients, attending physicians and investigators</title><p>The blinding of patients, hospital staff and designated trial investigators to assigned treatment duration will be key to avoiding the introduction of bias in the follow-up/management of patients between study arms. It is conceivable that the knowledge that one&#x02019;s patient will receive a shorter course of antibiotics could result in defensive medicine, with that patient&#x02019;s receiving &#x02018;special treatment&#x02019; such as additional surveillance blood cultures and/or imaging tests just before antibiotic discontinuation. For this reason, we will carry blinding of patients, treating hospital staff and designated investigators through the furthest study point possible. These parties will be blinded to treatment assignment from randomisation until antibiotic discontinuation (&#x02018;<italic>ad terminum</italic>&#x02019;). Thus, in the fixed short arm, all parties will be blinded until day 7, and in the individualised arm until the clinical requirements for discontinuation have been met. In the effort to avoid unblinding by the process of elimination after day 7, attending physicians and nurses will not be made aware of the specific algorithm defining criteria for antibiotic discontinuation in the individualised group.

Cost-effectiveness and other health-economic analyses will also be performed.</p><p>Additional subgroup analyses will be performed for main causative organisms, resistance patterns, involved organ systems, antibiotic regimens including single versus combination therapy and de-escalation. Moreover, risk factors for clinical failure will be determined, such as age, antibiotic choice, anatomic focus of primary infection, comorbidity status, infection acquisition type (community vs nosocomial), severity of illness at the time of diagnosis and so on.</p><sec id="s3f1"><title>Other definitions</title><p>Bacteraemias will be categorised as nosocomial if the first positive sample is taken &#x02265;48&#x02009;hours after hospital admission; otherwise they will be categorised as community acquired.

An important principle of POC trials is that patients be allowed to remain in their normal clinical setting; they are followed non-invasively for outcomes data. The only additional laboratory test that may be requested is later-phase CRP measurements if these have not already been ordered by treating physicians (on days 8&#x000b1;2&#x02009;and 12&#x000b1;2 in patients whose antibiotic therapy was not already discontinued).</p><p>On days 30, 60 and 90, clinical data necessary for determining the primary and secondary outcomes listed above will be collected.

At this time, and if determined necessary, a non-blinded investigator will also assess the performance of the CRP as a marker for guiding durations. If the marker is proving either impractical (eg, logistically difficult to obtain) or its algorithm difficult to follow (eg, CRP initially decreases but not quite by 75%, then rises again due to another inflammatory process), an alteration in the algorithm or in the arm itself will be explored. Any recommended changes will undergo review by all study investigators and methodologists, and any proposed amendment to the protocol will be submitted to the central ethics committee per usual routine.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Safety &#x02018;checkpoint&#x02019; analyses</title><p>An initial safety &#x02018;checkpoint&#x02019; analysis will be performed after 150 patients (roughly one-third of the target) have reached the 30-day follow-up mark to assess whether arms with shorter therapy durations (fixed short duration of 7 days and individualised arm) could potentially result in worse clinical outcomes, specifically with increased clinical failure. The outcomes assessment and data analysis for this assessment will be done in blinded fashion. If, however, results show a significant difference in outcomes in any arm, the blind will be lifted for the data analyst. (Blinding and unblinding of data will occur with the aid of the data manager, as described above.) Given the relatively small number of patients to be included in the first safety analysis (necessarily reducing power), statistical support in the interpretation of the data will be provided by study statisticians.</p><p>Unblinded results will be forwarded to an independent Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) for review. Should patients in either of the intervention arms demonstrate significantly worse clinical outcomes, recommendations made by the SMB will be followed. Other safety checkpoints may be scheduled depending on the outcome of this first fixed analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Adverse events</title><p>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject that may occur during or after administration of a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, whose focus is not on the choice of antibiotic but on its duration and within which only postmarket non-experimental antibiotics with well-established safety profiles will be used, only AE considered possibly, probably or certainly related to the antibiotic(s) being administered for the GNB will be recorded into the eCRF. The AE will thus be recorded during and in the 2&#x02009;days following discontinuation of antibiotic therapy targeting the GNB. After that point and for the remainder of the study period, only symptomatic <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection and serious adverse events will be recorded in the eCRF.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Previous observational studies and RCTs including patients with bacteraemia<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 16 30 32</xref> have demonstrated clinical failure rates between 10% and 30% in settings with access to broad-spectrum antibiotics and resistance prevalences similar to those in Switzerland. The primary reason for failure in these and other studies is the lack of appropriate antibiotic therapy (either due to antimicrobial resistance or a delay in therapy initiation). Because this trial&#x02019;s inclusion criteria require 5&#x02009;days of microbiologically adequate antibiotic therapy at the time of randomisation, we assume the upper limit of &#x02018;success&#x02019; or, inversely, the clinical failure will be 10% in both the control and intervention arms. To establish non-inferiority, we will allow a difference up to 10% in the primary outcome. The chosen margin is wide because the expected gain from reducing the use of antibiotics is significant (decreased odds for antibiotic resistance, reduction in treatment adverse events, reduced medical costs by shorter length of hospital stay).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, as we will have excluded immunosuppressed patients and those with complicated infections, there will be decreased risk for life-threatening events and serious deterioration.</p><p>Further assuming a one-sided type 1 error (&#x003b1;) of 0.025, a power (&#x000df;) of 0.80, an attrition (loss to follow-up) of ~5% and potential treatment switching of ~12%, 167 patients will be needed in each of the three arms to prove non-inferiority, making the total sample size 500.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We will perform the primary analysis on both the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (all patients randomised) and the per-protocol (PP) population (all patients adhering to the study protocol with no major deviations). While ITT analyses are critical in all studies, in non-inferiority trials PP analyses take on a particularly important role in the effort to avoid commission of a type 2 error.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> (One can imagine, for example, that non-adherence to the full 14-day antibiotic regimen could lead to this arm&#x02019;s appearing generally less effective, thus lowering the bar for the two intervention arms.) In this particular study, however, the PP analysis will have another key role. As stated above, attending physicians will have the freedom to override their patients&#x02019; treatment duration assignments in the event of perceived clinical worsening. There may thus be some switching from intervention towards control arms (non-adherence to treatment assignment) with the risk of diluting the difference in clinical failure rates between the intervention groups and the control group and thus increasing the risk of incorrectly concluding non-inferiority of shorter antibiotic duration. The sample size has thus been increased to accommodate treatment switching of ~12%&#x02009;study wide or some 20 patients per group (see above).</p><p>Descriptive analyses with standard methods for randomised trials will be used to measure primary and secondary outcomes. Continuous variables will be compared between the three study arms with the use of Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate; categorical variables will be compared with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, as appropriate. To test the hypothesis of non-inferiority for the prespecified margin of 10 percentage points (see "Sample size calculation"), we will perform a generalised linear regression model with a log link and binomial distribution reporting risk differences of clinical failure between intervention arms compared with the control arm. The treatment assignment will be the main predictor with the control arm (&#x02018;fixed long&#x02019;) as the reference and the model will be adjusted for the study centre.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> If some differences in the use of antibiotics are described between the three intervention arms, we will also adjust for it in the regression model.

Most patients were excluded because of an inability or unwillingness to provide written informed consent. The clinical failure rate in this group was 80%, while only 33% of included patients experienced clinical failure. Within the trial, mortality in the vancomycin group was non-significantly lower (mortality OR 0.76, 95%&#x02009;CI 0.36 to 1.62), but among excluded patients, mortality was significantly higher with vancomycin treatment (OR 2.63, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.04 to 6.64).<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
