The Global Burden of Disease project estimates that, in 2010, schizophrenia was responsible for 1.1% of all Disability-adjusted Life Years due to non-communicable diseases and 2.4% of Years Lived with Disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even though relatively low-cost and effective treatments are available for psychotic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], only very few persons affected by these disorders receive any treatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Community studies in sub-Saharan Africa show that only about 20% of persons with severe mental disorders had received any treatment in the prior 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A study conducted in Nigeria found that symptoms of non-affective psychoses were relatively common, with a prevalence of 1.1%. The majority of those who reported the conditions had not received any treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">It has been estimated that 80% of the world&#x02019;s rural poor rely on complementary alternative health providers (CAPs) for their health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is evidence from LMIC to indicate that CAPs, principally consisting of traditional healers (TH) and faith healers (FH)), constitute a large proportion of the de facto human mental health resource for health care service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Community surveys in these countries show that traditional health practitioners (THP) are often the first health care providers contacted by persons with a variety of mental health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is also evidence that some patients continue with simultaneous consultations to CAPs and conventional health providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Studies conducted in Uganda show that about 60% of patients consulting THPs have diagnosable <italic>Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, version IV</italic> (DSM-IV) disorders, with about 30% of these being cases of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In LMIC, in particular, the prevalence and pattern of mental disorders among people attending THPs commonly reflect the beliefs within communities that people with severe mental illness are afflicted by spirits or supernatural forces for which the effective intervention is not orthodox medicine but traditional health approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consequently, both in view of their significant presence within the health care systems in LMIC and the apparent preference for their care by many in the community, suggestions have been made for a more formal incorporation of the service of CAPs into the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Three approaches have been suggested for a more formal engagement of CAPs within the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]: (1) evaluation of the efficacy of traditional healing practices; (2) integration of traditional medicine into the national health system and (3) providing training for traditional healers to deliver safe and effective treatment. In view of their abundance and closeness to the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], there is little doubt that in most LMIC a process of collaboration with CAPs is likely to be of importance in any attempt to scale up mental health service. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, one important challenge to a formal integration of CAPs into the public mental health services is the frequent observation that CAPs sometimes use harmful practices, and abuses of human rights have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These harmful practices include shackling of patients, beating them, and making ritual scarification, a procedure that carries a high risk of infection, including that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These practices commonly reflect erroneous beliefs, which are common among both healers and the public, about the underlying causation of mental health problems and the effective interventions for them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">There is evidence that, with the appropriate approach, a collaborative care program can be developed between THPs and the conventional public health sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Experience, especially in the area of HIV treatment, has shown that while biomedical health practitioners may initially have reservations about collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], a program aimed at building mutual understanding and respect can lead to beneficial collaborations [56]. King pointed out that a key element for successful collaboration is building of mutual respect between THPs and biomedical health professionals through dialogue, exchange of information and readiness to learn from one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, no empirical evidence has yet been provided about the possible boundaries of such collaboration in the care of persons with severe mental disorders, its feasibility, and its likely impact on patient outcome. The present study, COllaborative Shared care to IMprove Psychosis Outcome (COSIMPO) is designed to provide such evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par54">The main objective of COSIMPO is to compare the effectiveness of a collaborative, shared-care intervention program implemented by CAPs and primary health care providers (PHCPs) with care as usual in improving the outcome of patients with psychosis.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary hypothesis</title><p id="Par55">Patients presenting to CAP facilities engaged in collaborative shared care (CSC) with PHCPs will have better outcome of psychosis compared to patients in enhanced usual care at 6&#x000a0;months following entry into the trial as measured by a significant mean reduction in symptoms as rated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

A cluster is composed of a primary health care clinic (PHC) and all the CAP facilities in its neighborhood, defined as the catchment area typically served by the PHC. That is, a cluster has one PHC and its neighboring CAP facilities, the number of the latter being determined by distance, ease of contact, and administrative considerations. Clusters were composed such that the CAP facilities are readily accessible to the PHCW in order to facilitate clinical engagement and support. All CAP facilities in the two study sites, previously identified and mapped during the formative stage of the project, were allocated to clusters. A total of 51 clusters were composed. Randomization of clusters was carried out before recruitment of trial participants (TPs). Allocation of clusters to each of the study arms was conducted by a statistician at the University of Ibadan (UI) Department of Epidemiology and Statistics with no other involvement in the day-to-day implementation of the study. Allocation to the two arms was balanced by site (Ghana versus Nigeria) and by size of the cluster, using the number of beds in each cluster (small versus large). Patients who are invited will not be informed of their allocation until their eligibility has been established and they have consented to participate.

Training was conducted separately for CAPs and PHCPs. This separation was necessary to ensure the use of appropriate presentational approaches, including language and content of training, which was designed to be appropriate for the level of education and literacy of these two distinct groups of providers. For example, the training of the PHCPs, and not that of the CAPs, included the use of the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Program Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in the management of psychosis. The local language of the participating sites was used during the training of the CAPs at each of the sites. Role-plays on specific components and contents of the collaborative care were modelled at these sessions. An important component of the training of the PHCPs in the CSC arm was on dialogue and engagement with CAPs. While formal and written pre- and post-training tests were conducted for the PHCPs, the CAPs were assessed verbally by asking participants to describe individually the components of the collaborations as well as steps to take when presented with different clinical scenarios. The training of the PHCPs was based on specific defining features of the collaboration as well as on recognition and treatment of psychosis, including the identification and response to adverse events and medication side effects. Treatment approaches for psychosis followed the mhGAP-IG specifications, adapted, where necessary, for the context of their use in a CAP facility. Training of both groups included an understanding of the range of possibly harmful and abusive practices and how to avoid them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Interventions in COSIMPO</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Intervention arm</title><p id="Par77">The collaboration between the CAPs and the PHPCs taps into the skills of both types of providers for the management of patients with psychosis. The patients who are treated within this collaborative program have access to both orthodox medical care as well as complementary alternative medical approaches. However, it is important to note that, in the design of COSIMPO, patients belong to the CAPs primarily and the PHCP acts only in advisory and supportive capacity in patient management. The role of the PHCP is to help the CAP to provide safe and acceptable care to patients, including promotion of, and respect for, human rights and the avoidance of harmful practices. The collaboration is based on mutual respect, trust, support, referral and advice between the CAPs and PHCPs. In the collaborative arrangement, psychotropic medications are to be prescribed only by trained orthodox health care personnel, which is the PHCPs in the first instance or physicians or specialists if referrals are made to them by the PHCP following consultation with the CAP. CAPs in the intervention arm commit themselves to implementing enhanced patient care through the collaborative arrangement with PHCPs.</p><p id="Par78">In providing clinical support to the CAP, the PHCP engages with the CAP, the patient, and the caregivers of the patient. The PHCP conducts regular, weekly, scheduled personal contacts with the CAPs as part of the collaboration, using such contacts to reinforce information on best clinical practice, provide information on patient rehabilitation, and attend to other clinical issues that the CAPs may bring to the attention of the PHCP. Beyond the regular visits, the PHCP also responds to requests from the CAP for urgent clinical needs as determined by the CAP. Such needs may include acute deterioration of TPs&#x02019; mental status, including instances of threats of violence or absconding, or emergent or worsening physical illness.</p><p id="Par79">There are two main components of the collaborative shared care:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par80">Clinical support to respond to the medical need of psychotic patients: this involves the provision of medical care to patients, especially those in conditions of acute psychotic disturbance, by the PHCP following the request from CAP. This will often entail the administration of psychotropic, especially antipsychotic, medication</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par81">Clinical support to improve service on a continuous basis: this involves engagement and interactions between PHCP and CAP during which the former provides the latter with specific information to improve service, organize rehabilitation for their patients, and generally provide better care. This interaction will involve the provision of specific information by the PHCP to the CAP during scheduled and regular weekly visits</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par82">All interactions and activities are documented fully by the PHCP in each TP&#x02019;s clinical records. These two activities will form the basis of the evaluation of the collaborative care both in regard its feasibility, the fidelity of its implementation, as well as its impact or effectiveness on patient outcome.</p><p id="Par83">When a PHCP is involved in the care of a TP, the PHCP assesses the patient at the CAP facility, provides feedback to the CAP, and initiates treatment according to treatment specifications for psychosis as described in the mhGAP-IG. The PHCP continues to monitor the patient on at least weekly regular visits, but a more frequent monitoring may be required, depending on the clinical need of the patient (for example, administration of specific medications may require daily or more visits to monitor their effects). If the patient is taking herbal medication, the PHCP takes this into consideration in administering psychotropic medications. The PHCP may refer a TP to see a physician or specialist, as necessary, but always in consultation with the CAP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Control arm</title><p id="Par84">Providers in the control arm offer enhanced care as usual (CAU). Usual care means that provides will operate as they currently do, without a structured approach to collaboration between CAPs and PHCPs. However, the care provided by the healers is enhanced through interactive training workshops (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For the CAPs, the training consisted of (1) discussion about their understanding of the concept of psychosis and the information about the medical nature of psychosis, including symptoms and course of illness; (2) a review of the conventional and complimentary approaches to the care of persons with psychosis; (3) identification of potentially harmful treatment practices and possible ways to avoid their use; and (4) basic concepts of human rights. For the PHCPs, the training consisted of (1) a review of the diagnosis of psychosis; (2) evidence-based management of psychosis, using the mhGAP-IG; and (3) the roles of the different levels of the mental health system in the care of persons with psychosis. While the training of the CAPs was over 2&#x000a0;days, that of the PHCPs was over 1&#x000a0;day. The goal of the trainings was to improve the care of persons with psychosis by both groups of providers in the context of current practice in which formal collaboration does not occur.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Responses to harmful treatment practices</title><p id="Par85">COSIMPO is designed to engender collaboration between CAPs and PHCPs to enhance the outcome of patients with psychosis. CAPs, in the course of delivering care to persons with severe mental health disorders, including psychotic disorders, may use what can be regarded as potentially harmful or abusive approaches. These approaches are largely informed by their understanding of the nature of psychosis by CAPs and by the need to curtail difficult clinical situations. For example, CAPs might believe that patients who are aggressive are possessed of evil spirits and that physically beating such patients might drive out the spirits. Also, in handling patients who are violent and at risk of harm to self or to others, CAPs might feel the need to shackle such patients to restrict their movements and the attendant risk of violence. All of these possible scenarios that might lead to the use of harmful or abusive practices are addressed within COSIMPO through training of the providers, as described in this protocol, and through the implementation of the collaboration with PHCPs who are able to administer medications to calm agitated and potentially violent patients.</p><p id="Par86">There is need to reduce risks to all the TPs (in both intervention and control arms) as much as possible while getting the scientific and socially valuable information the study has potential to offer. To this end, a schedule of responses to harmful practices is developed to guide the research team to ensure that the team is not complicit to the use of harmful practices by CAPs while at the same time keeping the CAPs sufficiently engaged in the study in order to answer the study questions. The schedule sets out a typology of responses to some of the more common forms of harmful practices that may occur in either arm of the study. Responses are determined by the severity of the practice (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). CAPs who engage in harmful practices are expected to cooperate with the research team in the execution of the responses to these practices and to reduce such practices.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Schedule of response to harmful practices</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Practice observed</th><th>Thresholds of harm</th><th>Responses control arm</th><th>Responses intervention arm</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shackling</td><td>1.

</p><p id="Par87">Disengagement of a CAP from the study will occur at a defined instance of continued refusal to cooperate with the study team in implementing these harm-reduction responses. Given that harmful practices are often a part of the standard of care of some CAPs and are among what the project sets out to change, direct intervention by the research team will be determined by the need to ensure that the patient&#x02019;s safety is promoted while ensuring that the scientific objectives of the study are accomplished. The decision about when and how the research team will take action or intervene with patients and/or caregivers to ensure the protection of the patients against the consequences of harmful practices is be guided by specific rules.

Checklists of harmful treatment practices, human rights&#x02019; abuses and of victimization, developed with information obtained during the formative stages of the Partnership for Mental Health Development in sub-Saharan Africa (PaM-D), are used for the indicated purposes. These assessments are conducted through both observation during visits by the RAs to CAPs facilities and by patient interviews. For example, respondents are asked if they have experienced any of the practices or abuses in a defined period of time (at the baseline, this will be in the previous 3&#x000a0;months, and at follow-up assessments, this will be &#x0201c;since the last time we spoke with you&#x0201d;).

The promise of the trial is not only in regard to providing such evidence, but in also determining to what extent a collaborative shared care between traditional and faith healers, on the one hand, and primary health care workers, on the other hand, can lead to a reduction in the use of potentially harmful treatment practices by the former. Addressing the concern about the use of such practices in the treatment of severe mental disorders will be an important contribution to the discussion about the feasibility of integrating these healers into the mainstream mental health services in LMIC.</p><p id="Par124">The design of COSIMPO takes account of several important features that, from our formative studies, are crucial in engendering trust and mutual respect. The entry point to treatment for patients will be from the traditional healers or faith healers (i.e., CAPs). The CAPs take responsibility for the patient and commence treatment. The contract to care for the patient therefore lies with the CAP. The discretion about when to seek clinical support from or refer to the PHCP also lies with the CAP. The PHCP in turn provides the necessary support and assistance needed. In providing clinical support to the CAP, the PHCP may engage with the CAP, the patient, and caregivers of the patient. Beyond specific referrals and consultations, the PHCP will maintain regular weekly scheduled personal contacts with the CAPs as part of the collaboration, using such contacts to reinforce information on best clinical practice, provide information on patient rehabilitation, and attend to other clinical issues that the CAPs may bring to the attention of the PHCP.</p><p id="Par125">The results of our formative work with CAPs showed that their treatment modalities can be broadly grouped into (1) harmful, (2) innocuous and (3) possibly helpful. Harmful practices include shackling, beating/physical assaults, scarification, imposed long periods of fasting (starvation) and isolation. PHCPs will discourage these practices and offer to assist in managing patients who are being exposed to such practices, possibly as a result of the severity or challenging nature of their illness. During on-going engagement with the CAPs, PHCPs will always be mindful of the need for sensitivity, respect and avoiding undermining the authority of the CAPs. Innocuous practices are not harmful to the patients and very often reflect deep cultural and religious beliefs shared by both patients/relatives and CAPs. Examples include the use of sacrifices and rituals. PHCPs will be trained and encouraged to remain open-minded about the use of innocuous practices and to leave deeply held belief systems undisturbed provided that they do not have the potential to result in harm. Possibly helpful practices within the CAM system include the use of herbs, animal products and minerals. For the purpose of potential referral/consultations to the PHCP, it is important that PHCPs are aware of the content and side effects of herbs, so as to be able to manage them if the need arises. For this reason, CAPs who use herbs will be encouraged to provide the names of the herbs. Research team will seek to obtain the active ingredients of such herbs from the literature. PHCPs will be provided with this information as well as ways to respond to any adverse events in the patients who are administered such herbs and take appropriate action.</p><p id="Par126">Cluster randomized controlled trials have peculiar challenges. One of such challenges is that of possible contamination. This was minimized in this study by stratifying eligible and consenting clusters by LGA before allocation to the CSC or the CAU arm using a computer-generated random number sequence, thus avoiding contiguous clusters being in the same arm. Furthermore, the availability of collaboration in the CSC arm was not publicized to other CAPs. The stratification of the clusters also took account of size, thus limiting the potential limitation of differential recruitment into the arms of the study. We have continued to monitor the recruitment of participants into the arms. Subsample selection bias has been avoided in this study by recruiting all eligible and consenting participants from randomized clusters, thus maintaining the power of the study.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par127">The protocol version number is 14.0 submitted on the 7th December, 2016.

Patients who meet all of the eligibility criteria, including have a PANSS score of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60, proceed to the next stage of the enrollment procedure. Following screening and confirmation of eligibility by the RAs, a potential participant is assessed for capacity to consent by an independent social worker who has been trained to conduct such assessment. Potential participants who are deemed to have capacity are approached for consent following the provision of full trial information by the RAs. For eligible patients who are found to lack capacity to consent, a caregiver is approached to provide proxy consent. If the caregiver provides consent on behalf of the patient, the latter is still required to give assent before they are enrolled into the trial. The consenting procedure of any non-literate patient or caregiver has to be the signed confirmation of an independent adult and literate witness before enrollment is deemed to have been completed. Baseline assessments of consented participants are conducted within 3&#x000a0;days of enrollment while outcome assessments are conducted at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months following trial entry.</p><p id="Par133">All Consent Forms are being administered in the local language translations.
