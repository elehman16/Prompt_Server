Although the glucocorticoid dexamethasone has been proven to be beneficial for the prevention of BPD, there are concerns about an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Hydrocortisone has been suggested as an alternative therapy. The aim of the Systemic Hydrocortisone To Prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in preterm infants (SToP-BPD) trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of postnatal hydrocortisone administration for the reduction of death or BPD in ventilator-dependent preterm infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The SToP-BPD study is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled hydrocortisone trial in preterm infants at risk for BPD. After parental informed consent is obtained, ventilator-dependent infants are randomly allocated to hydrocortisone or placebo treatment during a 22-day period. The primary outcome measure is the composite outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Secondary outcomes are short-term effects on pulmonary condition and long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae assessed at 2 years corrected age. Complications of treatment, other serious adverse events and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions are reported as safety outcomes.

Pulmonary inflammation has been identified as an important risk factor in the development of BPD, providing the rationale for treating patients at risk for BPD with glucocorticoids, a group of drugs well known for their strong anti-inflammatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dexamethasone with placebo in ventilated preterm infants at risk for BPD have shown that dexamethasone reduces the incidence of the composite outcome of death or BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Unfortunately, follow-up studies showed associations with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, international guidelines have stated that the use of dexamethasone should be restricted to exceptional cases (i.e., patients who cannot be weaned off the ventilator), and clinical trials should be performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of alternative anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone (HC) to prevent BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The Systemic Hydrocortisone To Prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in preterm infants (SToP-BPD) study is the first multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT investigating the efficacy and safety of systemic HC initiated between 7 and 14 days after birth in mechanically ventilated preterm infants.

The ethics committee of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam approved the study protocol on 28 January 2011, starting with ten Dutch and five Belgian NICUs. Four Belgian NICUs joined the study at a later date. The local ethics committee of each participating hospital approved the local feasibility of the study protocol. During the course of the study, the accredited ethics committee approved two amendments regarding changes of the inclusion criteria (<italic>see below</italic>). The trial was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, Dutch and Belgium legislation regarding medical research involving human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Patients could be included in the trial only after written informed consent from both parents was obtained. All study sites were monitored by an independent clinical research associate of the Academic Medical Centre Clinical Research Unit (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) monitored the study&#x02019;s progress, with a special focus on safety (<italic>see below</italic>).

Ventilator-dependent preterm infants (gestational age &#x0003c;&#x02009;30 weeks and/or birth weight &#x0003c;&#x02009;1250 g) at high risk of developing BPD were included between 7 and 14 days postnatal age (PNA). The risk of developing BPD was assessed by the respiratory index (RI), defined as the product of mean airway pressure (MAwP) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>). In the absence of firm evidence, a high risk of developing BPD was arbitrarily defined as an RI &#x02265;&#x02009;3.5 for &#x0003e;&#x02009;12 h/day for &#x02265;&#x02009;48 h, ensuring adequate oxygen saturation (85&#x02013;95%) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide values (5.0&#x02013;7.5 kPa). However, during the first months of the trial, the participating centres found that this arbitrarily chosen RI cut-off of 3.5 was too high. The centres noted that many infants ventilated between 7 and 14 days PNA with an RI &#x0003c;&#x02009;3.5 were still at high risk of developing BPD, as indicated by the fact that most of these infants were treated with corticosteroids outside the trial. Therefore, the RI threshold in the inclusion criteria was reduced stepwise, first to 3.0 (21 May 2012) and finally to 2.5 (3 December 2012), to make sure that all infants at high risk of BPD could be included in the study. Both RI adjustments were submitted as protocol amendments to the accredited ethics committee and approved.</p><p id="Par40">Included participants were allocated to either HC or placebo treatment according to the study protocol. In general, the use of open-label HC during the 22-day treatment course was strongly discouraged. However, open-label HC use was allowed if the patient met the predefined criteria described in the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The open-label HC dosage schedule was similar to that used in the study. The study medication was stopped when open-label HC was initiated.

Members included a clinically experienced paediatric pulmonologist, a paediatric intensivist-clinical pharmacologist with extensive knowledge of the use of drugs in infants, and a biostatistician. The members were not involved in the trial and had no competing interests. The composition, tasks, responsibilities and working procedures of the DSMB were described in a charter.</p><p id="Par53">In the first 2 years of the study, interim analyses for safety issues were performed every 3 months. After this period, the frequency of safety monitoring was reduced to thrice and then twice annually, owing to the decreasing recruitment rate. The DSMB received a report before every interim analysis prepared by the trial statistician that included data on baseline variables (gestational age, birth weight, sex, multiple births), the primary outcome parameter, predefined safety outcomes, and SAEs and SUSARs. In the closed session, attended only by the DSMB members, the DSMB examined the data using coded (blinded) treatment groups. If necessary, treatment allocation could be unblinded.</p><p id="Par54">The DSMB charter stated that there were two possible reasons for stopping the study early, namely concerns for safety and futility. In principle, the trial was not to be stopped early for beneficial effect of HC treatment on the primary outcome before the minimum number of evaluable patients required (350) was included. This was done to preserve the power for evaluation of neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years CA, unless HC benefit was accompanied by an unacceptably high rate of mortality in the placebo group.

We will perform six analyses, each examining one sub-group: gestational age groups (less than or greater or equal to 27 weeks), presence of chorioamnionitis (yes/no), RI at randomisation, sex (male/female), multiple pregnancy (yes/no) and centre preference for type of steroid treatment prior to the study (&#x02018;HC&#x02019; versus &#x02018;dexamethasone&#x02019;). Each of these analyses will require four parameters to be estimated in the logistic regression. If there are fewer than 40 patients with and/or fewer than 40 patients without the composite endpoint BPD-free survival at 36 weeks PMA, these analyses will not be performed.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p id="Par76">The internationally accepted definition of the primary outcome BPD is under debate, given the uncertainty on how to rate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with &#x0003e;2 L/minute flow and with low or no supplemental oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. According to the international criteria used, infants who need this respiratory support should be rated as having severe BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the reason for this support in these very premature infants could be an impaired control of breathing instead of chronic parenchymal lung damage. Therefore, an auxiliary analysis will be performed in which infants on CPAP and HFNC in room air will be classified as having mild BPD. If possible, we will perform sensitivity analyses on the primary outcome to investigate the impact of correlation between infant outcomes within twin or higher-order multiple births using generalised estimating equations with a logit link function.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Short-term secondary outcomes</title><p id="Par77">The effect of HC on short-term secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear regression, logistic regression, competing risk models (that consider death before the event of interest as a competing risk) or Cox regression models, as appropriate. The time to event will be calculated as the time between randomisation and the event, death, or discharge to home, whichever occurs first. If required, non-normally distributed continuous variables will be appropriately transformed. Only a small number of SUSARs and SAEs are expected. Hence, these will be evaluated by tabulations of counts and percentages for each treatment group, respectively, and presented as absolute risk differences. These outcomes, although all pre-specified, should be considered exploratory, yielding hypothesis-generating findings, and so no formal adjustments for stratification or multiple comparisons will be made.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Long-term outcomes at 2 years corrected age (study phase II)</title><sec id="FPar10"><title>Neurodevelopmental impairment</title><p id="Par78">The key long-term outcome is survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years CA. Participants who are alive and have a BSID III cognitive and motor composite score at 2 years CA &#x02265;&#x02009;85 will be defined as having survived without neurodevelopmental impairment. If no BSID III test could be done because of impairment, the attending paediatrician was asked to fill in an estimate of cognitive delay in three categories: no delay, 3&#x02013;6 months delay or &#x0003e;&#x02009;6 months delay. A delay of &#x02265;&#x02009;3 months is considered neurodevelopmental impairment and equivalent to a BSID III cognitive and motor composite score &#x0003c;&#x02009;85. Parents of participants who do not attend the 2-year assessment at the outpatient clinic will be invited by telephone once more. If they refuse to attend, the reason for refusal will be documented. On the basis of available information about their neurological and developmental (ab)normality, participants will be classified as having neurodevelopmental impairment or not, if reasonably possible. If there is insufficient information to classify the neurodevelopmental outcome in &#x0003e;&#x02009;5% of the participants, missing continuous BSID III scores will be imputed using multiple imputation using baseline characteristics. As previously recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], we will obtain a number of imputed datasets equal to the percentage of missing data. These datasets will be combined using Rubin&#x02019;s rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Inspection and imputation of missing data will be performed during the blinded review of the data. This strategy will be updated if, during the blinded data review, unexpected patterns are detected, requiring an appropriately adapted handling procedure. In that case, relevant deviations will be clearly documented and justified. Statistical analysis will be performed in the same way as for the short-term primary outcome. If multiple imputation is performed, three additional sensitivity analyses will be performed to test the robustness of the results obtained. These sensitivity analyses will be performed (a) using complete cases only and by applying (b) best case and (c) worst case scenarios for the unobserved neurodevelopmental impairment outcome data.</p></sec><sec id="FPar11"><title>Other long-term secondary outcomes</title><p id="Par79">The effect of HC on the other long-term secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear, logistic or Cox regression or competing risks models, as appropriate.
