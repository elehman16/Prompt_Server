It is mainly due to sympathetic blockade leading to peripheral vasodilatation and pooling of blood in dilated vascular bed with subsequent decrease of venous return and cardiac output. This problem is magnified in parturient who is liable to develop hypotension by her virtue due to positional causes wherein the supine position, the gravid uterus compresses the aorta and the inferior vena cava against the bodies of the lumbar vertebra resulting in decreased venous return, which may decrease maternal cardiac output and blood pressure leading to a compromised uteroplacental perfusion.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Multiple trials to prevent or combat hypotension using positional changes during or immediately after spinal injection were made.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Fluid therapy was another therapeutic option, but still there is a debate about the administration of crystalloids or colloids;[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] preloading or coloading.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The use of vasopressors was tried to induce vasoconstriction so as to combat vascular bed dilatation; however, the drug choice and mode of administration as either bolus or infusion is still a matter of debate.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl is a lipid soluble opioid with rapid onset of action, within 5 min, after intrathecal injection.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It significantly reduces pain during CS when added to bupivacaine. Meanwhile, intrathecal administration of fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g in no laboring term parturient does not produce clinically important maternal hemodynamic changes.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The current study aimed to compare the effect of spinal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl separately to the standard injection of mixed fentanyl with hyperbaric bupivacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>The current prospective double-blind randomized controlled study was conducted at Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital, KSA, from 5/2013 to 10/2014. After approval of the study protocol by the Local Ethical Committee and obtaining fully informed written patients' consents, 124 parturient at full-term scheduled for elective CS with uncomplicated pregnancy were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included parturient with body weight &#x0003c;50 kg or &#x0003e;90 kg, height &#x0003c;150 cm or &#x0003e;170 cm, preeclampsia, any major systemic disease, contraindication to regional anesthesia or allergy to used medications. All patients attended the theater fasting at least 6 h and without administration of premedications or preoperative intravenous (IV) fluids.</p><p>Patients (parturient primi or multigravid) were randomly allocated into two groups (62 parturient in each group): Group M included parturient received spinal anesthesia using 10 mg bupivacaine 0.5% premixed with 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl in the same syringe and Group S included parturient received the same medications sequentially without premixing using two different syringes; the first was lodged by 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl and the second was lodged by 10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% without barbotage. All medications were prepared before insertion of the spinal needle. Timing between the first and second syringes was kept as low as possible to prevent CSF loss with part of the fentanyl dose. Demographic data including age, height, and weight were determined preoperatively. Drugs were injected through Quincke spinal needle, 25-gauge, inserted in the L3-4 interspace. Spinal anesthesia was done in sitting position then the parturient asked to lie down immediately after bupivacaine injection. Envelopes containing the two techniques were placed in a box. One anesthesiologist in our hospital gave spinal anesthesia to all the cases, and he is not from the research team and not sharing in postspinal management and recordings. He randomly picked an envelope and followed the technique written inside without informing the parturient about it. The research anesthesiologist entered the room immediately after spinal anesthesia and was unaware of the technique used. He recorded the results on a paper labeled with the patient's file number. IV fluid co-load was given in a dose of 15 ml/kg warm lactated ringer solution started as fast drip during and continued after spinal anesthesia application through 18-gauge IV cannula.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients monitoring included the following</title><p>

When the patients are turned supine immediately after injection in the lumbar region, a hyperbaric solution will spread under the influence of gravity down the slope created by lumbar spinal curvature. However, plain solution being less viscous, mixes rather freely with CSF, and thus moves easily through compressed subarachnoid space and will not have gravity dependent spread.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>As regards the outcome; the incidence of hypotension is significantly lower in Group S compared to Group M. In my opinion, the mixture of hypobaric fentanyl and hyperbaric bupivacaine sank down, then they crept up together when the patient lay down acting synchronously on the same level. However, hyperbaric bupivacaine, which was injected separately without mixing, was denser than bupivacaine fentanyl mixture and sank more down and took a longer time to reach the final level which delayed the onset of the sympathetic block and gave time for a compensatory mechanism to prevent hypotension. The delayed mean onset of hypotension in Group S (7 min) compared with Group M (5.6 min) may prove this theory. This delayed onset of sympathetic block match the results of Helmi <italic>et al</italic>. and Martin <italic>et al</italic>., who concluded that isobaric bupivacaine produced more rapid onset of hypotension compared to hyperbaric bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Late hypotension, occurring more than 30 min after spinal anesthesia, is observed in both groups with nonsignificantly more patients in Group S. It was first described by Kyokong <italic>et al</italic>., and the mechanism of this late-onset hypotension remains unidentified.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In my opinion, some patients have moderately weak compensatory mechanisms in the upper half of the body which is exhausted after more than 30 min. Those patients tend to develop early hypotension in Group M, because of the more rapid sympathetic block and late hypotension in Group S.</p><p>The most significant outcome of our work is the great improvement in the quality of sensory block in Group S comparing to Group M. We believe that separate injection of fentanyl allows it to work on higher levels in the spinal cord preventing visceral pain. It is known a long time ago that fentanyl and sufentanil improve neuraxial anesthesia, decrease trans-operative pain, and moderately prolong sensory block.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The response to intrathecal medications with different baricity given sequentially was first studied by Cesur <italic>et al</italic>., who compared parturient received 10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine with those who received 5 mg of plain and 5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine sequentially for spinal anesthesia.

The second group received 10 mg bupivacaine through one syringe, followed by morphine 100 &#x003bc;g plus fentanyl 15 &#x003bc;g through a separate syringe. They reported that patients received mixed medications had higher levels of sensory block to cold than those received separate injections and may be associated with the higher postoperative opioid requirement. In our work, there was no significant difference in levels. This difference could be because they injected hyperbaric bupivacaine before opioids, which went down to lower levels during injection of opioids and gave lower level in the separate group. In their study, the incidence of hypotension was insignificantly lower in Group S.
