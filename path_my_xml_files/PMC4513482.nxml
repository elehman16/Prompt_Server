Group Medical Visits are an emerging health service delivery method. Recent systematic reviews show that they can significantly reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, but Group Visits have not been evaluated within primary care. We intend to determine the clinical effectiveness, quality of life and economic implications of Group Medical Visits within a primary care setting for older people with T2DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A 2-year proof-of-concept, single-blinded (measurement team) randomised control trial to test the efficacy of Group Medical Visits in an urban Canadian primary care setting. Participants &#x02265;65&#x02005;years old with T2DM (N=128) will be equally randomised to either eight groups of eight patients each (Group Medical Visits; Intervention) or to Individual visits (Standard Care; Controls). Those administering cointerventions are not blinded to group assignment. Our sample size is based on estimates of variance (&#x000b1;1.4% for HbA1c) and effect size (0.9/1.4=0.6) from the literature and from our own preliminary data. Forty participants per group will provide a &#x003b2; likelihood of 0.80, assuming an &#x003b1; of 0.05. A conservative estimation of an effect size of 0.7/1.4 changes the N in the power calculation to 59 per group. Hence, we aim to enrol 64 participants in each study arm. We will use intention-to-treat analysis and compare mean HbA1c (% glycosylated HbA1c) (primary outcome) of Intervention/Control participants at 12&#x02005;months, 24&#x02005;months and 1&#x02005;year postintervention on selected clinical, patient-rated and economic measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT02002143.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PRIMARY CARE</kwd><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate Group Medical Visits with a general practitioner lead in diabetes management.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention addresses a Chronic Care Model by combining an interprofessional team-based medical care, patient self-management, life skills development and disease-specific education, with a focus on physical activity and nutrition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The content of the intervention is based on the successful Trento model with an additional focus using our expertise from 10&#x02005;years of physical activity interventions (group-based and individual).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of Group Medical Visits to promote physical activity as measured objectively (SenseWear accelerometer).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Currently, the study is limited to one geographic location with a relatively homogeneous population.

Evaluation of traditional primary care delivery highlights that many patients do not receive guideline care.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Moreover, traditional individual physician appointments are not based on the principles of the Chronic Care Model.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref></p><p>Traditional one-to-one clinical encounters will always have a place in health service delivery. However, we ask the question, &#x02018;Is there a more effective way to encourage successful patient self-management for older people withT2DM?&#x02019;.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Group Medical Visits (GMVs) or Shared Medical Appointments may contribute to improved T2DM care for older people in the primary care setting.</p><p>GMVs are organised for a group of people living with a specific condition and a proactive interprofessional team which supports the group.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The structure and formats of GMVs vary; typically, in lieu of an individual visit, a patient will participate in a longer (60&#x02013;120&#x02005;min) group visit with 6&#x02013;14 other patients, led by a physician and/or other healthcare practitioner. The group component emphasises medical care (ie, interprofessional team-based care), disease-specific education and life skill development.</p><p>The most compelling clinical trial data for GMVs providing superior control of HbA1c come from Dr Trento and Dr Porta, University of Turin, Italy.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> Patients who attended structured Group Medical Visits decreased their HbA1c by 0.9% (Effect size 0.56) compared with control group counterparts.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In their ROMEO clinical trial,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> the Turin investigators concluded that Group Care when compared to &#x02018;Usual Care&#x02019; represented a &#x02018;cost-neutral approach to the outpatient management of T2DM&#x02019;.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Building on those data, we highlight four additional elements that are of interest. First, the studies in Turin and around Italy<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> took place in &#x02018;hospital-based clinics&#x02019;, not regular primary care settings. An endocrinologist led the GMVs; primary care was not part of the team. Second, participants in the Turin studies averaged 64&#x02005;years of age. Third, the Turin studies did not include a generic quality of life measure (eg, EQ-5D) and did not estimate health utilities, including complications, hospital admissions or adjunctive therapies. Fourth, health economic implications cannot easily be extrapolated from the Italian health system to that in other countries.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published RCT of GMVs for any condition in Canada&#x02014;certainly not for T2DM. In a systematic review of RCTs of GMVs for T2DM, Housden <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> reported a 0.46% reduction in HbA1c across 10 RCTs that met their inclusion criteria. However, in a 12-month US Veteran Affairs Medical Centre trial, Group Medical Visit patients had only a 0.3% improvement over patients randomised to individual care (effect size 0.21).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Study duration was the main difference between the US and the University of Turin studies appeared similar. Housden reported that the duration of GMVs (ie, 24&#x02005;months) was significantly associated with outcome (approximately 0.25% lower HbA1c per year), but the number of Group Medical Visits was not. This provides the rationale for an RCT across 2&#x02005;years.</p><p>Therefore, we designed this study to answer the question &#x02018;Do Primary Care-led GMVs provided seven times over 2&#x02005;years improve metabolic control in diabetes?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We aim to conduct a 24-month, single-blinded (measurement team), efficacy RCT to provide Canadian evidence for GMVs in the Primary care setting. The intervention patients (GMVs) will receive seven (7) GMVs sced quarterly.

Thus, assuming an &#x003b1; of 0.05, 40 participants per group will provide a <bold>&#x003b2;</bold> likelihood of 0.80. However, we aim to be conservative with our estimate of effect size; an effect size of 0.7/1.4 changes the N in the power calculation to 59 per group. Hence, we aim to enrol 64 participants in each study arm following baseline measurement and randomisation. This provides a contingency for a smaller effect size than in previous studies.

By intention-to-treat analysis, we mean all randomised participants, regardless of protocol adherence (as per the SPIRIT protocol). Change from baseline to 24&#x02005;months will be assessed using analysis of covariance that incorporates (controls for) baseline measures of the dependent variable and selected covariates. Observing a statistically significant difference in mean HbA1c between groups at 24&#x02005;months will be considered evidence of efficacy. We will report variance, covariance and effect sizes. We will sample feasibility (ie, ease of recruitment, recruitment rate, withdrawal rate). These data will inform sampling for future trials.</p><p>After the trial is over, we will evaluate whether participant outcomes change 12&#x02005;months after cessation of the intervention.

HbA1c has been used for over 30&#x02005;years as a marker of cumulative glycaemic exposure over the previous period of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;months. In terms of monitoring management, HbA1c is a widely accepted method and its use as the primary outcome in Housden <italic>et al's</italic> systematic review attests to the measure's suitability.
