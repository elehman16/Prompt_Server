It has been recommended in all steps of management approach of asthma except step 1. In the newly diagnosed symptomatic asthmatic patients, high doses of inhaled corticosteroid can be used in the absence of long-acting beta agonist instead of low doses of inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta agonist.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>In decreasing airway inflammation and relieving symptoms in moderate asthma, it seems that effects of high-dose inhaled corticosteroid are comparable with oral prednisolone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Nevertheless, there are some concerns about possible systemic adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids, this may include Hypothalamic-Pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, and adverse effects on growth and bone metabolism. In a number of studies, adrenal insufficiency has been reported after three weeks of treatment with corticosteroids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The severity of HPA-Axis suppression is associated with duration, route, dose, and time of drug administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Low- and high-dose ACTH suppression tests are the standard tests which are mainly used to assess HPA-Axis suppression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In order to decrease circadian rhythm effect on the test results, high-dose ACTH test is recommended.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Fluticasone propionate (FP) and Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) are the two most commonly used inhaled corticosteroids in our society. FP appears to be more potent than BDP and Budesonide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] High topical potency, decreased systemic bioavailability, and rapid elimination are the favorable features of an inhaled corticosteroid and FP has the minimum oral bioavailability, which is ideal for an inhaled corticosteroid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>In a meta-analysis, maximum clinical benefit for asthma treatment was obtained in a dose of 500 &#x003bc;g/d, but there are some concerns about adrenal suppression with FP in a dose of 1.5 mg/d.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] It has been shown that FP can suppress serum cortisol and overnight urinary cortisol when used in medium and high doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>According to another trial, high dose of FP with a dose of 1 760 &#x003bc;g/d could result in decreased amount of mean serum cortisol compared with placebo but low-dose Synacthen test did not confirm the same results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>To address some of these issues, the present study compared the systemic and pulmonary effects of high dose of 3 weeks of therapy with FP and BDP in symptomatic moderate asthma patients by means of high-dose synacthen test and spirometry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A sample of 66 moderate asthmatic patients volunteered to participate in the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

By using high doses of inhaled corticosteroid as an alternative approach, according to GINA guidelines,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] the effect of confounding factors was attenuated; therefore, there was no need to use a long-acting beta agonist. All eligible patients were randomized by Permuted Balanced Block Randomization to treatment with BDP or FP and were trained to use a pMDI with spacer and rinse their mouth after using inhaler. Of 66 patients, four patients were excluded: two patients because of non-compliance and two due to incomplete follow-up. Eventually, 62 patients were assigned to receive 1 500 &#x003bc;g FP or 1 500 &#x003bc;g BDP according to randomization, via a metered dose inhaler in two divided doses. After 3 weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated. Three weeks is the earliest time required for the complications to occur and the aim of this project was to assess the prevalence of complications occurring after consuming high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Compliance was assessed based on taking empty canister at the end of the expected time, and thereafter the full canister was given to the patients.

In our knowledge, this study is the first study in Iran in which high dose of ACTH test has been used to compare systemic effects of BDP and FP.</p><p>We found that neither BDP nor FP in this study has suppressive effect on adrenal function tests. Adrenal suppression demonstrated by 250 &#x003bc;g ACTH test, considering the cut-off level of 600 nmol/l, was observed in FP group (22.6%) and in BDP group (16.1%), although it was not statistically significant in either groups, the calculated risk ratio was about 1.4 (CI 95%:0.34-6.21) that implies 40% increased risk of adrenal suppression in FP group, which however was not statistically significant.</p><p>Our results substantiates the results of study by Gagnon <italic>et al</italic>. in which 1 000 &#x003bc;g BDP and ACTH test was used to determine adrenal suppression and is in accordance with the other study that used 1 500-2 000 &#x003bc;g of BDP and FP by measuring plasma cortisol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] But our results contradict adrenal suppression, which was shown in another study which compared 750 &#x003bc;g FP with 1 500 &#x003bc;g BDP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] These differences may be due to our provision not to use other systemic steroids and different dose and spacer use. In a range of 1 000-2 000 &#x003bc;g per day use of FP adrenal suppression has been shown in some studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] This discrepancy may be attributed to various laboratory tests used in these studies, different cut-off level for adrenal suppression, previous use of systemic corticosteroids, different population groups, and different number of cases in the study. In addition, the results of this study may be due to the use of spacer, since spacers can reduce systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Three patients (4.8%) in FP group and one patient (1.6%) in BDP who had baseline cortisol level &#x02264;3 &#x003bc;g/dl after treatment showed suppressed cortisol levels of 30, 60 minutes after dose increment, which implies that performing ACTH test may not be necessary in this group of patients in order to determine adrenal suppression, as showed by Hagge <italic>et al</italic>.'s study results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>The study demonstrated significant difference in FEV1 and FVC which was produced in FP group, and indicates that high dose of FP is more efficient than that of equivalent dose of BDP in moderate asthma control. The results are concordant with the findings of the other studies that FP is more efficacious than BDP but is in contrast to another study that did not show the higher efficacy of FP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the incidences of adverse events were similar in both groups. Adverse effects were detected in a small number of patients that point out efficacy and safety of spacer use and also desirable hygiene of the patients since a spacer will decrease deposition of drug in oropharyngeal area.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study was the short period of intervention and it is possible that with longer period of treatment, adrenal suppression may occur. In addition, higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids rather than 1 500 &#x003bc;g/d may suppress HPA axis. Other studies are needed to investigate these effects when using higher doses and for longer courses.</p><p>We found that BDP and FP in a dose of 1 500 &#x003bc;g/d did not suppress pituitary adrenal axis, resulted in no effect on FPG, nevertheless FP improved FEV1 and FVC significantly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was financially supported by Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center (EMRC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Study was financially supported by Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center (EMRC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>The Global Initiative For Asthma: GINA At-A-Glance Asthma Management Reference.
