Twin pregnancies contribute disproportionately to preterm birth.</p><p>Progesterone, administered either as intramuscular 17 &#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone caproate or vaginal progesterone, has been demonstrated to reduce the rate of preterm birth in women with high-risk singleton pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, we and others have shown that neither progesterone nor 17 &#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone caproate prevents preterm birth in multiple pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Use of progesterone for prevention of preterm birth in women with a previous preterm birth and/or with a short cervix is becoming widespread [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 2011, the USA Food and Drug Administration approved use of 17 &#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of preterm birth in women at risk because of previous spontaneous preterm birth [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that agents given to pregnant women with the aim of improving pregnancy outcomes can have unexpected effects on children which may not be apparent at birth but harmful long-term [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, long-term follow-up data on children exposed to progesterone are needed.</p><p>There is emerging but limited evidence on the long-term effects of <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to progesterone when given for the prevention of preterm birth. Follow-up of 274 singleton children, born to mothers participating in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of 17 &#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in high-risk singleton pregnancies, demonstrated no difference in health status, physical examination, or mean score on the <italic>Ages and Stages Questionnaire</italic> at four years of age despite prolongation of pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Follow-up of 991 children born to mothers with twin pregnancies enrolled in the PREDICT randomised control trial comparing progesterone with placebo revealed no difference in mean score on the <italic>Ages and Stages Questionnaire</italic> at six months and at 18 months of age. Progesterone had no effect on duration of pregnancy in the PREDICT trial [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The aim of our study was to determine the potential adverse and/or beneficial effects of prophylactic <italic>in utero</italic> progesterone on health and developmental outcomes of children at three to six years of age. We evaluated a cohort of twin pregnancies in which progesterone had no effect on short-term (obstetric and neonatal) outcomes, thus allowing any direct effects of progesterone to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>This study evaluated outcomes of twin children born to mothers who participated in the STOPPIT trial, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of progesterone given for the prevention of preterm birth to women with twin pregnancy.</p><p>Briefly, the STOPPIT trial (registered clinical trial, ISRCTN35782581), conducted at nine National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across the United Kingdom, randomised women to receive either progesterone gel or placebo gel daily from 24 weeks&#x02019; gestation for an average period of ten weeks. In the original trial, outcome assessment was limited to obstetric and neonatal outcomes. These results have previously been reported: there were no differences in the primary outcome of intrauterine death or preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks and 0 days of gestation, nor any differences in neonatal outcomes between the progesterone and placebo groups [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All participating women were informed of the possibility of follow-up of their children and were given the opportunity to withdraw consent for future contact from the research team if they wished.</p><p>We aimed to include all children born to mothers resident in Scotland who had been recruited to the STOPPIT trial, and for whom routine health data could therefore be accessed through Information Services Division, NHS Scotland. Given that such routine health data were available for twins resident in Scotland, mothers who were resident in England at the time of the trial, and all those who emigrated out of a Scottish Health Board after the birth of their babies were not eligible for follow-up. Mothers who were lost to follow-up, and those for whom there were insufficient data for tracing were excluded from follow-up. Mothers who withdrew consent for questionnaire follow-up and those who had experienced the death of one or more twins were also excluded.</p><p>The personal identifiers of mothers of eligible children were used to identify mothers&#x02019; records on the Community Health Index (CHI) database and thus obtain their up to date contact details to enable questionnaire distribution. The CHI database contains a record of all patients registered with a General Practitioner in Scotland.</p><p>The personal identifiers of mothers were also used to identify the CHI numbers of children via linkage to statutory birth registration records. CHI numbers of children are documented on all routine health records in Scotland, and hence record linkage enabled follow-up of twins&#x02019; outcomes through examination of routine health data. In addition, statutory death registration records were searched using children&#x02019;s personal identifiers to identify any additional deaths of twins for whom the CHI numbers were unknown.</p><p>Records for twins with known CHI numbers were identified on the national child health programme information systems <italic>Health Visitor First Visit</italic>, <italic>Six to Eight Week Check</italic>, <italic>Primary-1 Screening</italic>, <italic>Neonatal Hearing Screening</italic> and <italic>Preschool Vision Screening</italic> records. Subsequent to April 2005, child health programme records included a Health Plan Indicator assigned to indicate a child&#x02019;s level of need for ongoing support to achieve good health and developmental outcomes.</p><p>Twin records were also identified on the hospital outpatient attendance (<italic>Scottish Morbidity Record 00&#x02014;SMR00</italic>) and inpatient and day case discharge (<italic>SMR01</italic>) datasets. For all twins with hospital attendances, primary diagnoses at time of discharge (coded via World Health Organisation International Classification of Disease, 10<sup>th</sup> edition (ICD-10)[<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) were examined. Those with outpatient or inpatient entries with diagnoses ICD-10 codes Q00-Q99 (Chapter XVII: Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities) were defined as having a congenital abnormality.</p><p>Twins in the progesterone and placebo groups were heterogeneous with respect to age, sex, and gestational age at birth. Accordingly, measures of height, weight and head circumference were converted into z-scores (standard deviations) using freely available LMS software [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and UK 1990 growth reference data [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We selected two validated parent-completed questionnaires, the <italic>Health Utilities Index</italic> (HUI) [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and the <italic>Child Development Inventory</italic> (CDI) [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] from available paediatric developmental assessment tools, purchasing licenses for the use and exact reproduction of each questionnaire. Mothers were invited by letter to participate in questionnaire follow-up. All letters were accompanied by a demographic data questionnaire, an information sheet and a written consent form. Where telephone numbers of mothers were available, a courtesy call was made to ensure questionnaires had been received. Questionnaires were mailed out in 2011 and again in 2012. In the unusual event that a mother replied twice, data from the most recent questionnaire were used. Mothers completed and returned all questionnaires and investigators calculated aggregate scores prior to any unmasking. Thereafter, treatment allocation was revealed to four mothers at their request.</p><p>We compared baseline demographic characteristics including maternal age at randomisation, household index of multiple deprivation (quintile), gestation and chorionicity, and the age of the children at the time of questionnaire completion in the responding and non-responding groups.</p><p>We summarised all baseline characteristics and outcomes using means (standard deviation), medians (25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> centiles) or frequencies and percentages where relevant. Outcomes were analysed using generalised linear models (linear or logistic regression) where appropriate, adjusting for the clustering at the level of the mother. For other outcomes, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test or a comparison of medians was used. Where possible, all effect sizes have 95% percent confidence intervals. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). There was no imputation of missing data and all analyses were as randomised.</p><p>Ethics approval was granted by the South East Scotland Research Committee 02 (reference number 10/S1102/70).</p><p>All women recruited to the original STOPPIT trial had been informed of the possibility of direct and record-based follow-up of their babies prior to providing written informed consent for participation. At the conclusion of the trial, women were reminded of the intention to complete a follow-up study in a newsletter and were given the opportunity to withdraw consent for further contact from the research team.</p><p>At the time of the follow-up study, Community Health Index Advisory Group (CHIAG) and Privacy Advisory Committee (PAC) approvals were obtained in order to update contact details of mothers of children eligible for follow-up, identify CHI numbers of eligible children, and perform anonymised record linkage of children&#x02019;s CHI numbers to national child health records so that health data could be obtained. Parents were contacted and gave additional written informed consent for the completion of questionnaires.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec007"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 500 women in the original STOPPIT trial, 68 were excluded from attempted record linkage as they lived in England (and would therefore not have relevant health records in Scotland), leaving 432 for whom record linkage was attempted. A further six women were lost to follow-up at the end of the original trial and ten could not be identified on the CHI database. Therefore, 416 women were potentially eligible to be sent a questionnaire and had current contact details available. Linkage to the children&#x02019;s CHI numbers was performed in March 2013. CHI numbers of one child (in seven women) and both children (in 22 women) could not be identified, leaving 781 children whose CHI numbers were submitted for linkage to national child health records at ISD (386 in the progesterone group and 395 in the placebo group). Record linkage was successfully performed on at least one record in 759/781 (97%) children.

Hence, the clinical relevance of the height centile difference is likely to be limited.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0122341.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0122341.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Child Health Surveillance Programme.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0122341.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0122341.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

HUI Mark II measures health status as a function of seven attributes: sensation, ambulation, self-care, cognition, emotion, pain and fertility. The HUI Mark III assesses eight attributes: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, cognition, emotion and pain. Parental responses to questionnaire items are combined and ascribed a multi-attribute utility score between 0.00 and 1.00 (where 1.00 describes perfect health), calculated using standard formulas for the HUI Mark II and for the HUI Mark III.

These findings complement the findings of the original STOPPIT trial in which progesterone was found to have no significant effect on the composite outcome of death or delivery before 34 weeks&#x02019; gestation [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The use of a cohort of women with twin pregnancies, in which progesterone had no effect on gestational length, allows the direct effect of progesterone to be determined independent of any effect of progesterone on preterm birth. Hence, our study provides no significant evidence that <italic>in utero</italic> progesterone exposure directly <underline>enhances</underline> the health of exposed children. This is perhaps surprising; progesterone has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of adult acquired brain injury, and a direct beneficial effect on neurodevelopment is plausible [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our study, the parent reported health status of twin children was excellent or very good for 98% of children, despite 33% of children having evidence of some developmental delay. The developmental delay likely relates to prematurity, with 28% of children having been born before 35 weeks&#x02019; gestation.</p><p>The results of this follow-up study additionally provide reassurance that progesterone does not cause <underline>harm</underline> to children exposed <italic>in utero</italic>. No difference was found in the overall rate of congenital anomalies in the progesterone and placebo groups. In the absence of an anomaly register, detection of congenital anomalies was limited to diagnoses made in children who presented to hospital. Nevertheless, anomalies that cause hospital admission and early death are likely to have been well recorded and linked.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that progesterone exposure in early pregnancy might increase the risk of hypospadias in males [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the STOPPIT trial, progesterone therapy was initiated after 24 weeks&#x02019; gestation. Thus, administration occurred after the completion of the embryological development of the male genitalia at 14 weeks. Current evidence indicates there is no increase in the risk of hypospadias in males exposed to progesterone after 16 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The results of our follow-up study support this hypothesis.</p><p>Other studies have raised concerns regarding behavioural outcomes in children exposed <italic>in utero</italic> to progesterone [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We reported no significant differences between the progesterone and placebo groups with respect to social development (reported on the CDI), emotion and cognition (reported on the HUI).</p><p>This follow-up did not include a formal evaluation of intelligence and school performance. Future linkage to educational records could demonstrate whether the apparently high incidence of some developmental delay has any adverse effects on educational attainment.</p><p>Our study extends the duration of follow-up of a twin cohort exposed to progesterone <italic>in utero</italic> to a mean age of 55.5 months. To date, limited evidence has been published regarding the long-term (post neonatal) effects of exposure <italic>in utero</italic> to vaginal progesterone in twins. Only one published study has evaluated the effects of vaginal progesterone. The previously published study had a larger sample size (n = 991), but the duration of postnatal follow-up was 18 months [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The duration of follow-up in our study is comparable with that in a study of intrauterine exposure to an alternative formulation of progesterone, 17 &#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone caproate [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This latter study of 274 singleton children, born to mothers participating in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of 17 &#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in high-risk singleton pregnancies, demonstrated no difference in child health measures despite prolongation of pregnancy (<xref rid="pone.0122341.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0122341.t006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0122341.t006</object-id><label>Table 6</label><caption><title>Studies examining the long-term effects of prophylactic progesterone exposure <italic>in utero</italic> on childhood outcomes.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0122341.t006g" xlink:href="pone.0122341.t006"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Author, year</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study population</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Progesterone</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gestational age given</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Delivery &#x0003c;34 weeks</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Follow-up rate</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Follow-up age</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Congenital anomalies</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assessment tool 1 Progesterone vs. placebo</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assessment tool 2 Progesterone vs. placebo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The relative neuroplasticity of the immature brain limits the capacity to ascertain a child&#x02019;s neurodevelopmental status and prognosis until the age of at least two years [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, subtle delays are more easily identified as children become social and are exposed to environments where they are directly compared to peers [<xref rid="pone.0122341.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This is particularly relevant where parent report is used as the method of assessment.</p><p>The rigour of our findings is enhanced by the use of record linkage, which avoids the selection bias inherent in questionnaire-based studies. Our ability to trace records on 97% of eligible children using record linkage demonstrates that in the Scottish population, record linkage is an economical and effective strategy for follow-up of children of women recruited to clinical trials in pregnancy. We believe that it is unlikely that lack of linkage to the 3% of missing children would have altered the overall findings.</p><p>Questionnaire data supported data from the record linkage and provided more detail on specific individual outcomes. However, the success rate of questionnaire follow-up was lower, with only 44% of eligible parents responding. Nevertheless, the questionnaire data supported the findings of our record linkage study (where the percentage of women and children followed up was excellent); exposure <italic>in utero</italic> to progesterone after 20 weeks&#x02019; gestation had no adverse effects.</p><p>The power of our follow-up study was dictated by the original sample of the STOPPIT trial. Additionally, the effective sample size of the follow-up study was reduced by the non-independence of data collected for each twin. Clustering was accounted for with multi-level modelling in our statistical analysis. If the impact of clustering is ignored, our study had 80% power to detect an absolute increase of 10% in hospital admissions, and 95% power to detect an absolute increase of 13% in hospital admissions in the progesterone group compared with the placebo group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have found that exposure <italic>in utero</italic> to progesterone, given in twin pregnancies for the prevention of preterm birth, has no significant impact on child health and developmental outcomes at three to six years. We demonstrate that, in the absence of an effect on gestational length, progesterone has no beneficial or adverse effects on childhood development. The limitations of our study are acknowledged and the strengths asserted.</p><p>In women with high-risk singleton pregnancies because of short cervix or preterm delivery, progesterone administration (vaginal progesterone or intramuscular 17 &#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone caproate respectively) has been shown to reduce the rate of preterm birth. An ongoing randomised trial (OPPTIMUM, ISRCTN14568373) will determine whether vaginal progesterone administration to women at risk because of either a previous preterm birth or a short cervix is associated with long-term gains in terms of child health and development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122341.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Demographic characteristics of responders and non-responders and those not sent a follow-up questionnaire.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122341.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122341.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Health Utilities Index individual domains.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122341.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Andrew Duffy who performed record linkage with assistance from Diane Thom, Judith Tait and Lynne Jarvis, Information Services Division, Scotland, and Lorraine Adamson (administrator) who sent out questionnaires and derived summary values from returned questionnaires.
