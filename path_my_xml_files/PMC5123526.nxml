Patients with Stage 2 or 3 cervical cancer who had completed chemoradiation therapy for 1 year were recruited from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, between June 2010 and April 2011 for data collection. Fifty-three patients with cervical cancer and their spouses agreed to participate in this study. A 6-week nursing care intervention on sexuality was conducted in two meeting sessions. Patients with recurrent cancer and complication were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurements</title><p>&#x0201c;The format of personal information&#x0201d; sheet was developed by the investigators for collecting demographic data of the respondents.</p><p>&#x0201c;Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)&#x0201d; proposed by Meston and Bradford[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] was used. FSFI consists of 19 items that evaluate and classify the types of sexual dysfunction into six domains, namely sexual arousal, sexual desire, vaginal lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction on sexual activity, and symptom of dyspareunia. The instrument was translated into Indonesian language prior to use. The contents were validated by analyzing the results of a trial conducted in forty respondents by using correlation technique of Pearson Product Moment at 5% level of significance of 0.320. The calculated R-value for each item was compared with the standard R-value. The validity of the FSFI questionnaire content was assessed with the calculated R-value within 0.333&#x02013;0.689. Moreover, the reliability of the FSFI questionnaire was assessed using a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.853.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Procedures</title><p>The nursing care intervention on sexuality comprised education and counseling, guidance, and suggestions to perform physical exercise and communication. K-Y gel was provided, and the advantage and instruction on how to use the gel were explained to the participants. The intervention was given by the investigator at the outpatient unit and during home visit for 6 weeks in three meeting sessions. An assistant investigator collected data using questionnaires prior to the intervention.</p><p>The content for education was derived from the literature and patterned based on the patients&#x02019; needs, which was determined through the preliminary study. Educational tool was provided through booklets and flip charts. Each session for educating the participants was conducted for 60&#x02013;90 min. The material contained information on cervical cancer, etiology, and cancer treatment and its side effects that may cause various physical, psychological, sexual, and reproductive problems. The material was distributed during the first session. The material in the second session contained information and education on reproductive organs and sexual function, including anatomy and physiology of female reproductive organs, explanation in the series of female sexual response cycle, and discussion of various methods to overcome the side effects of cancer treatment. Numerous relaxation and other exercises for improving sexual fitness (such as Kegel exercise, sensation focus exercise, and exercise of various technical positions during sexual intercourse) were also discussed.

Similarly, previous studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that educational intervention could improve sexual and physical symptoms. Reduced sexual arousal and desire after cancer treatment are commonly experienced by respondents in this study. The respondents experienced improved sexual arousal and desire after the nursing care intervention on sexuality. The determination value for the success of nursing care intervention on sexuality with regard to the improvement of sexual arousal and desire was pretty low, i.e. &#x0003c;30%. However, other determining factors, namely, occupation and education of their husbands, contributed to the success of the intervention. These findings could be due to the nature of the sexual arousal and desire, which are emotionally related, thereby prolonging the time to attain improvement.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The same problem is also encountered by survivors of breast cancer; Jun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] provided a program of sexual reframing. However, improvement in sexual desire and vaginal lubrication was not significantly different between the intervention and nonintervention groups following the 6-week cancer treatment.</p><p>Previous studies reported that fear during sexual intercourse is caused by shortened vaginal size and vaginal dryness as well as fear of cancer recurrence.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] These factors lead to reduced sexual desire after cancer treatment. Fear may also be due to apprehension that the cancer has not been fully recovered, fear of re-bleeding, and fear of disease transmission to their partners. These factors made the patients to be reluctant to start their sexual activity again after cervical cancer treatment. Burke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported a similar finding. In a previous study, cervical cancer patients avoided the resumption of sexual activities because they believed that such activity may disrupt the effectiveness of cancer treatment; they also perceived that their spouses were afraid of having sexual intercourse with them.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Nursing care intervention could reduce the fear in the respondents. Some exercise and suggestions provided in the nursing care intervention could facilitate the emergence of arousal and desire in the respondents. The intervention included communication exercise as well as discussions on the importance of regular sexual intercourse and educating their husbands to assist the patients in increasing sexual arousal and desire.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has a small sample size and therefore has limited generalizability. As such, constructing a definitive conclusion based on the findings is difficult. The small sample size is due to the difficulty in recruiting respondents who are willing to discuss their sexuality concerns because sexuality remains a taboo in Indonesia. However, regardless of the small sample size, the study results are consistent with those reported in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Moreover, the results of the present study cannot be generalized in a population with younger age and without because all of the respondents were in advanced reproductive age and had children. Furthermore, the respondents were at the period of 1-year posttreatment, but the process of adaptation to their sexual life continues over time. These conditions may lead to different results over the survivorship timeframe.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Implications for nursing care</title><p>This study highlights the importance of building nurses&#x02019; competence to provide education and counseling on sexuality to improve the quality life of cervical cancer survivors. Collaborative intervention with gynecologists, sexologists, and radiotherapists would be beneficial to optimize the sexual wellness of cancer survivors and their spouses.</p><p>The current study has raised the sexuality issues that have been overlooked by the majority of nurses. This study revealed the potential of nurses&#x02019; actions on sexuality care in cancer survivors. The paradigm of nurses on sexuality care should be altered. A standard operating procedure of nursing care in providing comprehensive service, including sexuality care, is also necessary. The results in this study could be adopted in such standard according to the context of care. The findings of the present study may also be incorporated into the curriculum of adult nursing care, particularly on reproductive system and human sexuality. Consequently, nurses should have sufficient knowledge and skills to address sexuality problems in cervical cancer survivors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Nursing care intervention on sexuality through educational counseling can facilitate the improvement of sexual dysfunction symptoms in survivors and their spouses. Improvement is realized when respondents and their spouses show a reaction that they can overcome the symptom they experienced. Moreover, adaptive responses are demonstrated by the respondents by achieving adaptation against sexual changes, such as accomplishment of integration and reduced symptoms of sexual dysfunction, as a result of increased knowledge. Thus, nursing care service through the provision of educational counseling on sexuality can be a part of the standard oncology nursing practice and could be an alternative to overcome symptoms of sexual dysfunction among survivors and their spouses.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was funded by the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher
