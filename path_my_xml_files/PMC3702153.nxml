According to the fact that prevention is easier and cheaper than therapy, in this study the effect of fish oil ointment on the improvement of first stage bed sore was assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was carried out on two groups with 30 patients that had bed sore on shoulders, sacrum or heel. In the intervention group patients&#x02019; position was changed every 2-3 hours and the bed sore was washed with water and cotton-wool and fish oil with thickness of 2-3 mm was applied on the place of sore. This method was used for seven days. If they improved, the method was stopped in the first days of procedure. At the end of seven days, again the first day checklist was completed, and it was compared to the questionnaire of the two groups, and analyzed separately according to the daily changes of intervention and control group.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Findings:</title><p>There was statistically significant difference between the average of changes in the size of sore of the study group and control group (p &#x0003c; 0.002).

With the permission from health centers, patients from Isfahan and Ahvaz were studied. After being assured of having no effects on the procedure and evaluating the efficiency of the tools, referred to AL-Zahra educating center- Esfahan and by using the classification form for pressure ulcers of international consultation for pressure wound, recognized sixty patients affected by Pressure wounds (class I) in the sacrum area shoulders and heels, gradually. By using the questionnaire and information form, items such as age, sex, body index, wound location, intelligence rate, stimulation, nutrition and wound classification were considered and the data was registered. Then the cases like the wound diameter, redness and the rate of recovery were considered according to standard checking lists and the wound redness was analyzed by one of the projects co-workers and the wound specifications were considered with respect to the diameter of damaged area and the area redness and the diameter was measured with regards to the pressure ulcer scale for healing and the area diameter was measure with a ruler, in centimeters (largest length and largest width) and the rate of redness was considered accordingly: (class 1) considerable reduction of redness (class 2) brief reduction of redness, (class 3) no change in redness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] but in analyzing the class 2 and 3 redness were mixed and the redness grade was considered as two groups of red and lack of redness areas. The ulcer characteristics were recorded and evaluated after each intervention. Selection of patients were based on goals, such that the patients entered the study according to criteria and were divided into two groups after evaluation of their age, sex, tallness, weight, ulcer location, intelligence, stimulation rate and redness of the ulcer, randomly, of treatment and placebo groups. Routine and standard care was used for the placebo group. i.e. the patients changed positions every 2-3 hours and the ulcer location was cleaned by cotton and ordinary water and fish oil ointment was rubbed on the location, such that the ulcer with approximate thickness of 2-3 mm was covered with the ointment and this was done for 7 days, but in case of full recovery, the procedure stopped earlier and the cases were evaluated and registered. After study and completing the checking lists and collecting the data, SPSS software (version 11) was used for analyzing the data and the obtained information was analyzed by using student t-test, chi-squire, variance analyses, t-test and Fischer questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>F<sc>INDINGS</sc></title><p>The result of the present research showed that the average size of the ulcer was 22.7 (20) and 21.8 (26.4) for the treating and placebo groups respectively, at the beginning of the study and there was no significant difference between the two groups, according to the student t-test (p = 0.3)</p><p>According to the obtained results at the beginning of intervention, all the ulcers of the patients under study were showing clear redness.</p><p>After 24 hours of treatment, 23 cases (76.7%) of the treating group showed brief reduction of redness, but there was no evidence of reduction of redness in placebo group.

Use of fish liver oil is effective on speeding up the wound reparation and also creation of vessels within the ulcer, and hence reduces the time of recovery the wound. Kassaee and Rashidy-Pour have expressed about the effect of topical use of fish oil on wound resulted from burning,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and using topical fish oil caused the reduction of the recovery time in our research. Daly et al. reported that nutrition with omega-3 fatty acids after election surgeries causes significant reduction in the time of betiding of the patients in hospitals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Bjerve has reported that there is no efficient recovery for patients who lack omega-3 fatty acids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Sajadi et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] as well as Matushevskaia et al. showed that fish oil could recover stomach and duodenum ulcers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Fish oil rich of omega-3 fatty acids may act through growth factors like cytokines, because other researches have reported that fish oil that is rich in DHA and FAP, could increase mRNA relating to growth factor trams formation (TGF-B) and the protein in the mice spleens.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Also fish oil can stimulate the cytokine effects (growth factors) by stimulating the active of receiving tissues, of these substances[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] other probable reasons of fish oil effect are: increasing the survival of monocytes (since monocytes have principle role against attacking pathogen factor and eliminating infectious findings and thus could have their role in recovering and reproduction of wounds). Producing collagen controlling the inflammation process of the ulcer reduce in controlling the collection of platelets reducing the vessels answer to contracting factor of the vessels widening the vessels and increasing blood flow and taking oxygen to the wound location increasing cells reproduction increasing cells distinctions increasing the discharge of growth hormones speeding up reproduction of vessels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>It is also reported that vitamin A existing in fish oil has an important role in rapid recovery of the ulcer; perhaps the existence of this vitamin as a recovery factor is due to fish oil. The possibilities are also considerable.</p><p>We found fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids to have positive effects on the recovery of ulcers. In contrast, other reports have implied no useful effects of fish oil in wound recovery. For instance, Jafari Naveh et al. showed that supplementation with fish oil had no effects on recovery of skin wounds in rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Similarly, Ormerod et al. showed that taking fish oil cannot affect cornea wounds in rabbits.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Sukumar et al. suggested that a diet containing fish oil has no effects in recovery of ileum ulcer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] A survey by Albina et al. indicated that diets including fish oil produce certain disorders in skin ulcers in the mice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Therefore, more investigations should be performed to clarify the effects of fish oil on skin injuries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>It seems over ally that fish oil ointment and even consuming fish itself which is a gift from the sea, and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, is effective in treating the pressure ulcers and these useful results might introduce a new group of substances or topical medicine, in which fish oil omega-3 fatty acids are used.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Research Article of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, No: 5684</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brunner</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Suddarth</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Connell Smeltzer</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name></person-group><source>Brunner &#x00026; Suddarth&#x02019;s textbook of medical-surgical nursing</source><year>2008</year><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippincott Williams &#x00026; Wilkins</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vanderwee</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dealey</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunningberg</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Defloor</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pressure ulcer prevalence in Europe: a pilot study</article-title><source>J Eval Clin Pract</source><year>2007</year><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>227</fpage><lpage>35</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17378869</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Salsali</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaban</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamali</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Naderi Pour</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of hydrochloid cover in bed wound in patient going under cover vessels surgery</article-title><source>Hayat</source><year>2004</year><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>39</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><comment>[In Persian]</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dressings can prevent pressure ulcers: fact or fallacy.
