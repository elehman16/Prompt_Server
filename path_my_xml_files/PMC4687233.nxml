The condition is more painful when mobile joints such as <italic>Janusandhi</italic> (knee joint) of the body are involved due to <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic>. The disease <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic> is more prone to be affected to knee joint because it is most frequently involved joint in daily routine work, weight bearing joint of the body, and more prone to develop in overweight patients. In the pathogenesis of <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic>, <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> dominant with symptoms such as <italic>Vedana</italic> (pain during joint movement) and <italic>Shopha</italic> (swelling). The joint stiffness and crepitus (specific sound during joint movement) are symptoms that may be co-related in modern parlance with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint. OA is the second most common rheumatologic problem and is the most frequent joint disease having prevalence of about 22&#x02013;39% in India. Among them, 29.8% persons between 45 and 64 years of age group report diagnosed arthritis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] OA of the knee joint is seen most common in the clinical practice of elderly population. Below 45 years of age, this disease is common in men and involves one or two joints, while in female, 55 years of age, usually involving multiple joints.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] OA is the most common form of arthritis and leading cause of chronic disability mostly in all the population. For the management of OA, patients need to take analgesics for daily and lifelong. In OA, surgical therapy-like knee joint replacement is very costly and even after surgery patient has to continue some medicine for a long duration. The use of analgesics and steroids in old age may produce adverse effects such as gastritis, hyperacidity, and sometimes renal failure.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] <italic>Agnikarma</italic> is a nonpharmacological treatment which has definite role in <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic>. The emphasis of the Ayurvedic approach of <italic>Agnikarma</italic> is to relieve the pain in OA. It may be more effective in the management of <italic>Janugata Sandhivata</italic> (OA of knee joint).
