In spite of significant improvement in treatment, there is still a significant subset of patients that does not respond sufficiently to currently available medicines. Thus, there is still a need for treatments with a novel mechanism of action, and several of these are currently in development. The conventional approach towards clinical trials during early drug development is however not sustainable due to the high costs involved in testing large numbers of patients to provide proof of mechanism; slow recruitment rates due to improved standard of care as well as the large number of competing clinical trials; and ethical considerations: why would one unnecessarily expose large numbers of patients to placebo or experimental drugs that are likely to be ineffective in light of the high attrition rates during early drug development?</p><p>Therefore, we have previously proposed a fundamentally different approach towards phase Ib/IIa clinical trials: small, high density-of-data clinical trials evaluating biomarkers associated with common final pathogenetic pathways known to be relevant for the disease, biomarkers associated with the proposed specific mechanism of action, and trends towards clinical improvement. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Gerlag1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> We have previously identified and validated the expression of CD68+cells in the synovial tissue of RA patients as a biomarker that is related to changes in clinical signs and symptoms independent of the primary mechanism of action. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Haringman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106253-Bresnihan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> We have recommended a rethinking of the decision to move ahead to large clinical trials when there is no trend towards clinical improvement, no specific effect related to the mechanism of action, and no change in CD68+ macrophage numbers in the synovium after treatment. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Gerlag1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> If this is the case, the drug might not hit the target effectively or the target may not be the right one. However, when there is a signal in at least one of these three variables, the next step would be to test the drug in conventional studies to determine whether the biological effect translates into clinically meaningful improvement. This screening approach, where the change in the number of CD68-positive sublining macrophages in serial arthroscopic synovial biopsy specimens is used to discriminate on the group level between effective treatment and ineffective during early drug development, has been successfully used to test a wide variety of experimental medicines, <xref rid="pone.0106253-Gerlag1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106253-vanKuijk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> allowing early go/no go decisions related to further clinical development. Such proof of mechanism studies may not only help to screen for potential efficacy, but may also help to optimize the range of dosages to be tested in the phase II/III trials.</p><p>While synovial biopsy is a safe and generally well-tolerated procedure in experienced hands <xref rid="pone.0106253-Gerlag2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, a limitation of this approach is that it is only used in a limited number of centers. Moreover, serial synovial biopsy is mainly restricted to the knee, ankle and wrist joints, affecting recruitment as not all patients with active RA have clinical involvement of these joints. Thus, there is a clear need for a biomarker reflecting the changes in monocyte/macrophage infiltration and activation in the synovial compartment in response to treatment, but which can be measured in the peripheral blood to screen for potential efficacy on the group level during early drug development.</p><p>Myeloid-related protein (MRP)-8 and MRP-14 are calcium-modulated proteins that regulate myeloid cell function and control inflammation. The heterodimer MRP8/14 is released during the interaction of monocytes with activated endothelium, probably at sites of local inflammation. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Frosch1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> Therefore, we investigated the sensitivity to change of this soluble biomarker in RA patients in small clinical trials of short duration, similar to how this would be used in early phase Ib/IIa proof of mechanism clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the changes after treatment with three known effective biologics: infliximab, adalimumab and rituximab; these open label prospective clinical trials have been described before. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> Briefly, in the first cohort, 34 patients were treated with infliximab 3 mg/kg intravenously at baseline, week 2, week 6 and subsequently every 8 weeks. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Wijbrandts2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> In the second cohort (ISRCTN68762628), 85 patients received adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously at baseline and every other week, <xref rid="pone.0106253-Wijbrandts3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in the third cohort (ISRCTN05568900), 20 patients were treated with intravenous infusions of 1000 mg rituximab at day 1 and 15 after premedication with 2 mg clemastine fumarate and 1000 mg acetaminophen but without methylprednisolone <xref rid="pone.0106253-Thurlings1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>We also analyzed data obtained in 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials of treatment strategies that were shown to be ineffective in RA: C5a receptor-antagonist (C5aR; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6), <xref rid="pone.0106253-Vergunst1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> a human C-C chemokine receptor type 2 blocking antibody (CCR2; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8), <xref rid="pone.0106253-Vergunst2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> C-C chemokine receptor type 5 inhibitor (CCR5, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13), <xref rid="pone.0106253-vanKuijk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and one patient treated with placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with abatacept (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00420199) in patients with RA. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Conaghan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Targeting C5aR, CCR2 and CCR5 has been shown ineffective in RA in these placebo-controlled, phase Ib/IIa trials. <xref rid="pone.0106253-vanKuijk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106253-Vergunst1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106253-Vergunst2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> The studies were performed in the Academic Medical Centre/University of Amsterdam and approved by the Medical Ethics Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine (AMC-UvA).

The follow up samples were the samples taken after baseline. For trials with effective treatment as well as C5aR antagonists and anti-CCR5 antibodies, the follow up samples were obtained 4 weeks after baseline. For the trial with anti-CCR2 antibodies, the follow up sample was taken at day 43. In the trial with placebo versus abatacept, the follow up sample was taken at day 113. Serum levels of MRP8/14 complexes were determined by double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, performed in the laboratory of the University of M&#x000fc;nster, as described previously. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106253-Holzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> For comparison with earlier studies, internal control sera were used as a reference in all ELISA studies. The readers of the laboratory assay were blinded for the clinical details and samples were analyzed in a random order. In addition, we measured serum C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels at these time points and determined the disease activity score evaluated in 28 joints (DAS28-CRP).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous data were described as median and interquartile range (IQR) if not normally distributed. The chi-square test was used to compare categorical characteristics. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). A p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The standardized response mean (SRM), a measure of sensitivity to change, was calculated by dividing the mean change over time by the standard deviation of that change. The SRM of the clinical scores (CRP and DAS28-CRP) and MRP8/14 were calculated to evaluate the ability of these measurements to detect changes over time in the effective treatment groups (infliximab, adaliumab and rituximab treatment) and in the ineffective/placebo group (patients who received placebo or treatment with C5aR antagonist, anti- CCR2 or anti-CCR5 antibodies). An SRM&#x0003e;0.8 is considered high, representing a change of at least four fifths of a standard deviation of the change in the score. An SRM of 0.5 is defined as having moderate potential to detect changes, and an SRM of 0.2 as having low potential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred thirty-nine patients treated with a known effective treatment and 28 patients treated with a placebo or ineffective treatment were included and analyzed in this study.

Changes in MRP8/14 levels and DAS28 do suggest an effect of rituximab 4 weeks after the first infusion, but the values are relatively low due to the time point that is early for this specific mechanism of action and due to the fact that no methylprednisolone pre-treatment was given.</p><p>The sensitivity to change for serum levels of MRP8/14 resembles that for expression of CD68 positive macrophages in synovial tissue samples in patients treated with effective treatments across different mechanisms of action. <xref rid="pone.0106253-Haringman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106253-Wijbrandts1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Of importance, this soluble biomarker does not appear to be susceptible to placebo effects, expectation bias or regression to the mean in proof of mechanism studies of relatively short duration in contrast to DAS28, with an SRM of 0.58 (moderate sensitivity to change) in the placebo/ineffective treatment studies. The SRM of MRP8/14 was low in EULAR responders after ineffective/placebo treatment, which supports the notion that this biomarker is not susceptible to placebo effects in studies of short duration.</p><p>The test characteristics of CRP were also clearly not as good as those for MRP8/14 in discriminating between effective and ineffective treatment. To exclude the possibility that this results could be explained by a relatively low CRP level at baseline in some of the patients, we calculated the SRM for CRP excluding all the cases with relatively low levels with a similar result.</p><p>Taken together, the results suggest that serial measurement of MRP8/14 levels in peripheral blood could be used as a biomarker to screen for initial evidence of efficacy on the group level during early drug development. This study provides the rationale for future validation studies using known effective drugs with a distinct mechanism of action such as tocilizumab, abatacept and tofacitinib compared to placebo and ineffective experimental treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0106253-Gerlag1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
