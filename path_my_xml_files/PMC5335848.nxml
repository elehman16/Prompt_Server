The primary outcome is the total number of patients randomised into RESTART per month per site, which will be analysed in a negative binomial generalised linear mixed model. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of sites using stroke databases to identify potentially eligible patients before PRIME, frequency of using bespoke stroke audit data exports during PRIME, barriers to recruitment in PRIME, barriers to using the bespoke stroke audit data exports, and disadvantages of the bespoke stroke audit exports identified by PRIME sites. PRIME began in September 2015. The last intervention will be delivered in August 2016. Six-month follow-up will be complete in February 2017.

Promoting Recruitment using Information Management Efficiently (PRIME) is a stepped wedge, cluster randomised trial of a complex intervention to help RESTART sites increase their recruitment and attain their own target number of participants. Seventy-two hospital sites that were active in RESTART in 2015 opted into PRIME, so the trial can be considered as a study-within-a-trial (SWAT).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Intervention</title><p>The complex intervention involves a recruitment coordinator discussing recruitment strategies with the principal investigator (PI) and RESTART coordinator at each site, providing software for each site to extract from their own stroke audit data lists of patients who were potentially eligible for RESTART, and a second teleconference to review progress 6&#x000a0;months later. The key components of the intervention are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Discussion on how staff at the site have been finding RESTART to date</p></list-item><list-item><p>Review of the recruitment commitment made at the site initiation visit and how many patients they have recruited</p></list-item><list-item><p>Review of the information in the pre-review questionnaire about recruitment completed prior to the recruitment review</p></list-item><list-item><p>Explanation of the availability of bespoke stroke audit data exports and examples provided of how the pilot sites effectively used them</p></list-item><list-item><p>Review of the use of a template invitation letter for approaching prevalent patients and discussion about how they can be used effectively in conjunction with the bespoke stroke audit data exports</p></list-item><list-item><p>Review of the opportunities to recruit inpatients and outpatients at the hospital site</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sharing of what other methods top recruiting sites have been using to identify, consent and randomise patients</p></list-item><list-item><p>After the review, an email is sent to all the collaborators at the site summarising what had been discussed at the review, providing attendance certificates, and giving instructions for running the relevant bespoke stroke audit data exports</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A stepped wedge design was chosen because it would have been very difficult to apply the intervention across all intervention clusters simultaneously in a standard, parallel-group, cluster randomised trial design. By allowing a phased introduction of the intervention in a stepped wedge design, this meant that it was only necessary to have a single PRIME coordinator to implement a tailored intervention at each individual site; and so it was logistically and practically easier to implement the intervention. Furthermore, all sites will have been given a potentially efficacious intervention by the end of the trial, whilst the expected burden on these sites was perceived to be low. There was also no foreseeable negative impact on patients in terms of harm or burden due to the intervention. In addition, we would expect that the intracluster correlation coefficient might be relatively high in this trial as a result of high variability in average recruitment rates between sites; leading to possibly greater statistical power for the stepped wedge design compared to a standard cluster trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>PRIME has a closed-cohort, stepped wedge design whereby all participating sites are included from the start through to the end of the trial, and we are interested in assessing the recruitment rate within fixed time periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The timing of the recruitment review was randomised, stratified by hospital location (Scotland versus England/Wales). This involved using computer-generated block randomisation to randomly allocate the 72 sites to groups of six with 12 different months for the recruitment review in one calendar year, stratified by hospital location. The investigators, recruitment coordinator, and sites were all blinded to the timing of the recruitment review until this had to be revealed in order to organise the recruitment review. Members of staff at each site were asked to complete questionnaires before the recruitment review and 6&#x000a0;months afterwards enabling us to characterise sites, identify barriers to recruitment, and determine any perceived disadvantages to applying the intervention. Further details about the PRIME trial design, including the sample size calculation, can be found in the trial protocol paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this article we describe the statistical analysis plan which outlines how data analysis will be conducted at the end of the trial. The statistical analysis plan was finalised and approved by the co-authors on 4 April 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome is the total number of patients randomised into the RESTART trial per month per site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>We will collect secondary outcomes, from the information supplied in the questionnaires completed before, at, and 6&#x000a0;months after the recruitment review.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary analysis of the primary outcome</title><p>To assess how the primary outcome changes over time, the cumulative total randomisation rate since the start of the PRIME study will be plotted in a graph for each randomised group of six sites, with a vertical dashed line to indicate when the sites cross over into the intervention phase. This will be done separately for each of the 12 randomised groups so that we can clearly see how the total recruitment rate for each of the groups changes over time with reference to the start of the intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To provide an overall assessment, we will also plot the cumulative total recruitment rate across all sites with shading to indicate how many sites had received the intervention up to that point (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Example of the line plot that will be drawn to show changes in cumulative recruitment rate over time in each randomised group of sites (this plot does not contain any real data)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1840_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

</p><p>Informed by a published method to model recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we will fit a negative binomial generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) to the primary outcome, adjusting for the fixed effects of time since start of study (in months), season (December/January (when recruitment rates in RESTART have been low) versus all other months), site location (Scotland versus England/Wales), and an indicator variable for whether the PRIME complex intervention has been implemented or not (according to the planned randomisation schedule). Site will also be included as a random effect in the model. For the primary analysis, the secular change in recruitment rate over time will be adjusted for in the models using a single continuous linear term, unless the graphs of recruitment rate over time strongly indicate otherwise.</p><p>The results will be expressed as rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The number of decimal places will be determined by the &#x02018;rule of four&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The estimated time effect will also be reported from the fitted model.</p><p>The primary analysis will follow an &#x02018;as-randomised&#x02019; principle, which means that the data will be analysed according to the randomised timing of the recruitment review rather than the actual time that the recruitment review occurred. In addition, for the primary analysis, all sites will be included regardless of any site withdrawals and/or compliance with the PRIME trial procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Secondary analyses of the primary outcome</title><p>There will be four separate secondary analyses of the primary outcome, which will each involve using the same negative binomial GLMM methodology as described for the primary outcome with the following modifications:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The negative binomial GLMM will additionally include model terms representing the length of time after the randomised introduction of the intervention to assess whether there is a time trend in the effect of the complex intervention on recruitment rate. This will consist of including categorical dummy variables in the model representing the categories &#x02018;3-6 months after recruitment review&#x02019; and &#x02018;more than 6&#x000a0;months after review&#x02019;; with &#x02018;first 3&#x000a0;months after review&#x02019; as the reference category</p></list-item><list-item><p>A per-protocol &#x02018;actual times&#x02019; analysis will be performed: based on the actual times of the recruitment review, and only including those sites that continued to be active in both the RESTART and PRIME trials until the end of the PRIME study period</p></list-item><list-item><p>The analysis will be restricted to use only data collected within the rollout period (i.e. the period of time when there were sites in both intervention and control conditions). This is to reduce the risk of confounding due to secular changes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], at the expense of a reduced sample size. An additional site-level explanatory variable will be included in the GLMM: the average number of people randomised per month before the PRIME rollout phase (i.e. before the first site received the intervention)</p></list-item><list-item><p>We will assess the sensitivity of the model results with respect to different ways of specifying the adjustment for secular trend in the models. For example, we may model time using a categorical factor variable or by using spline functions that may more appropriately reflect the change in recruitment rates observed in the graphical analysis of primary outcome (i.e. in plots such as those depicted in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Primary outcome analysis assumptions</title><p>All analyses of the primary outcome assume that the evaluation will not be confounded by other simultaneous methods to boost recruitment, and that the recruitment coordinator&#x02019;s effectiveness will remain constant over time (i.e. it will not be diluted by the increasing number of sites that she will support over time, or influenced by seasonal changes in trial recruitment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Secondary outcome analyses</title><p>The PI, delegated physicians and/or research staff at each RESTART hospital site will complete a 6-month post-recruitment review questionnaire and the responses will be analysed descriptively.
