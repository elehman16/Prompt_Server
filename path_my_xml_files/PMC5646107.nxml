General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the management of LBP; however, GP care has not been shown to be the most cost-effective approach unless exercise and behavioural counselling are added to usual care. The Fear Reduction Exercised Early (FREE) approach to LBP has been developed to assist GPs to manage LBP by empowering exploration and management of psychosocial barriers to recovery and provision of evidence-based care and information. The aim of the Low Back Pain in General Practice (LBPinGP) trial is to explore whether patients with LBP who receive care from GPs trained in the FREE approach have better outcomes than those who receive usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This is a cluster randomised controlled superiority trial comparing the FREE approach with usual care for LBP management with investigator-blinded assessment of outcomes. GPs will be recruited and then cluster randomised (in practice groups) to the intervention or control arm. Intervention arm GPs will receive training in the FREE approach, and control arm GPs will continue to practice as usual. Patients presenting to their GP with a primary complaint of LBP will be allocated on the basis of allocation of the GP they consult. We aim to recruit 60 GPs and 275 patients (assuming patients are recruited from 75% of GPs and an average of 5 patients per GP complete the study, accounting for 20% patient participant dropout). Patient participants and the trial statistician will be blind to group allocation throughout the study. Analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome will be back-related functional impairment 6&#x000a0;months post-initial LBP consultation (interim data at 2&#x000a0;weeks, 6&#x000a0;weeks and 3&#x000a0;months), measured with the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary patient outcomes include pain, satisfaction, quality of life, days off from work and costs of care. Secondary GP outcomes include beliefs about pain and impairment, GP confidence, and actual and reported clinical behaviour. Health economic and process evaluations will be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">In the LBPinGP trial, we will investigate providing an intervention during the first interaction a person with back pain has with their GP. Because the FREE approach is used within a normal GP consultation, if effective, it may be a cost-effective means of improving LBP care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370896&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN12616000888460</ext-link>.

At any given point in time, 18% of the world&#x02019;s population may be experiencing LBP, and 38% of people will experience LBP over the course of 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Back pain is one of the leading causes of health loss globally and in New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Back pain has been estimated to cost 2% of gross domestic product in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Health care use represents about 15% of the total societal cost of LBP, with the majority of costs due to absence from work and decreased productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, interventions that promote early return to work and that minimise lost productivity are likely to have the greatest impact on the societal burden of LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Back pain is a very common reason to visit general practitioners (GPs), both internationally and in New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. People are more likely to seek care when they have high levels of disability and/or pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although GP care is cheaper than other treatments for LBP, authors of a systematic review found that it is generally less cost-effective when costs associated with loss of earnings and changes in productivity are taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, when exercise and behavioural counselling were added to usual GP care, it became the most cost-effective approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Factors that predict persistent LBP-related activity or work limitation include high initial levels of pain and impairment, psychiatric co-morbidities, low health status and a range of psychosocial factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Low pain self-efficacy beliefs, poor expectation of recovery, elevated fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophisation, psychological distress (anxiety, depression and stress) and reliance on passive coping strategies have all been found to be independently associated with poor disability outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Those who have more maladaptive beliefs, particularly higher levels of fear or more catastrophic beliefs, are also more likely to seek care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The Fear Reduction Exercised Early (FREE) approach was developed in New Zealand to assist GPs manage LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Practices in the region which have more than three full-time equivalent (FTE) GPs will be invited to participate in the trial in collaboration with their primary healthcare organisations (PHOs). Practices will not be invited if the PHO considers that trial participation will place an unacceptable burden due to other factors. Recruitment will not be feasible in practices smaller than three FTE GPs, given the low relative incidence of LBP presentations. Practices will enter the trial in pairs because sequential participation of practices will permit close contact with practices to optimise patient recruitment. The sequence of participation will be planned in collaboration with practices to enable simultaneous recruitment from pairs of intervention and control practices that are of similar size.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>General practitioners</title><p id="Par38">GPs will be invited to participate if they are registered medical practitioners working at a general practice in the study region that has consented to participate in the trial.

The FREE approach to LBP was developed on the basis of a systematic review of the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], in-depth interviews with GPs and people who had acute and chronic LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and a national survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These findings were synthesised with current research evidence on back pain, behaviour change and guideline implementation to create a novel approach. A full description of the development and basis of FREE is available elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The FREE approach is a complex intervention which combines GP and patient belief change with behaviour change approaches. The aim of FREE is to optimise the behaviour of both GPs and patients and shift focus to factors and behaviours which have been shown to influence outcome while reducing the provision of unhelpful, threat-related information to patients.</p><p id="Par46">Key GP behaviour change goals are (1) increased confidence to manage back pain and reduced GP anxiety related to screening for pathology; (2) increased understanding of the impact of psychosocial factors on patient outcomes, with tools for exploring and managing these factors; and (3) increased confidence that movement and activity are safe, with tools for demonstrating this confidence to patients. Key patient behaviour change goals are (1) reduced threat associated with LBP, (2) decreased fear of movement and decreased perceived need to protect the back, (3) improved expectation of outcome from a back pain episode, and (4) increased activity and work participation.</p><p id="Par47">Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> describes the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) employed in FREE in relation to GPs. The BCTs employed for patients are presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. These techniques are described using the BCT taxonomy developed by Michie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">GPs will be trained in the FREE approach through a 4-h facilitated workshop supported with a training manual. GPs then use the approach during a 4-week experiential learning period. It is anticipated that GPs will see at least three patients with LBP during the learning period. GPs will then attend a 1-h refresher session to discuss experiences and resolve any implementation difficulties. The same investigator (BD) will lead all GP training workshops and refresher sessions. Patient enrolment in the study will commence after this refresher session. The approach also includes an electronic medical record (EMR) tool to facilitate use of the approach, an information booklet for patients and GPs, and an information website accessible by both patients and GPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par49">GPs within a practice allocated to the control group will receive no training during the intervention and follow-up periods, during which time they will continue to provide current usual care. This has been chosen as the comparator because it is the best care available locally outside the study. All GPs have access to current LBP treatment guidelines.</p><p id="Par50">At the end of the trial, control group GPs will be offered an opportunity to attend the FREE workshop. This will provide comparable benefits for being part of a research trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par51">General practices will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group (i.e., all GPs in a practice will be randomised to the same arm) with a 1:1 allocation, using a computer-generated randomisation schedule stratified by the number of FTE GPs within the practice (&#x02264;8 versus&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;8 FTE). The aim of the stratification procedure is to ensure that approximately equal numbers of GPs are allocated to the intervention and control groups. An independent statistician will conduct the randomisation process. Analysis of outcomes will include this practice size stratification variable as a fixed effect to account for the impact of this design element on study results.</p><p id="Par52">GP participants will be randomised by practice for the following two reasons: (1) Individual patient randomisation is not feasible, because GPs may find it difficult to provide &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; after learning about the new approach, which would result in contamination of results from control patients; and (2) randomisation at the level of the individual GP (rather than practice) may result in contamination effects if intervention GPs discuss the FREE approach with control arm GPs within their practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Allocation concealment</title><p id="Par53">All general practices participating in the trial (and GP participants currently working in these practices) will be recruited before group allocation occurs. GPs may leave and others may join these practices (and become eligible for the trial) during the period between randomisation and data collection. New GPs will be kept blinded to their practice&#x02019;s group allocation until they have decided whether to participate in the trial (using the same information as their peers). An independent statistician at a central administration site will perform the randomisation. The independent statistician will communicate practice allocation to the primary investigator so that training may be planned in intervention practices and data collection dates can be agreed upon with all practices.</p><p id="Par54">Patient recruitment will occur post-randomisation. All eligible patients will be invited to participate. Patients will be unaware of the trial&#x02019;s existence and goals prior to presenting at the practice. Patients will also be unaware that two different treatment approaches are being compared within the trial, meaning that patient participants will be masked to cluster allocation. Research nurses at intervention and control group practices will use identical scripts and information sheets when approaching potential participants, screening participants for inclusion and explaining the study to minimise potential recruitment bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par55">The results dataset will be stored with the study arm identity blinded by way of a unique code for each study participant. The key to this code will be held (independent of the dataset for analysis) by the independent statistician, the chair of the data monitoring committee (DMC) and the principal investigator (PI). The PI needs to know practice group allocation to conduct the intervention group training workshops. The PI will not be involved in data collection, entry, modification or analysis.</p><p id="Par56">Individual patients will remain blind to the presence of two study arms throughout the course of the trial. Consultation appearance will be similar from a patient perspective, except that intervention arm participants may be provided a FREE booklet and referred to the FREE website. Control arm participants may be given other informational materials (e.g., ACC pamphlet) or be referred to other information sites (e.g., patient.org). Even if a patient perceives he/she is receiving a different approach from previous GP LBP consultations, they will remain blind to the study hypothesis.</p><p id="Par57">All patient participant data submitted on paper surveys will be entered or checked by a research assistant blind to group allocation. Data entered by participants through electronic surveys will be checked for completeness and anomalous responses.</p><p id="Par58">Data cleaning and analysis will be conducted by the trial statistician who is blind to group allocation. Once analysis is complete, the results will be unblinded. To eliminate the risk that the trial statistician may have been inadvertently exposed to practice codes during the conduct of the trial, these will be replaced with new codes in the dataset prior to the trial statistician&#x02019;s receiving the data. Only the independent statistician and the chair of the DMC will have access to the key for these new codes.</p><p id="Par59">GPs and practices will necessarily be unblinded following group allocation because the need for training means GPs will know whether they are in the intervention or control arm prior to patient recruitment. GPs will be aware of their study allocation when completing baseline measures. This is necessary in order to minimise the time between completing baseline measures and receiving FREE training or starting patient recruitment.

These have been found to have acceptable predictive ability for disability outcomes but poor predictive ability for persistent pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Encouraging GPs to simply apply these screening tools and plan subsequent referred care on the basis of risk profiles misses the opportunity for a positive therapeutic encounter delivered by the GP at the point on entry into the health system. Even if a GP is to base treatment decisions on a classification process, there is still a need to ensure this first interaction with a health practitioner is delivered in an optimal manner and aids rather than impedes future care. Because FREE is delivered by a GP within normal consultation time, it does not add cost to an episode of care. Therefore, if FREE is found to be effective and does not increase other costs, it may be a cost-effective method of improving LBP care.</p><p id="Par96">In a previous study in which Dutch GPs were trained to explore and address psychosocial factors in patients who had subacute LBP, researchers did not find any clinically relevant benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Jellema et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] concluded that this was because GPs were only moderately successful at identifying psychosocial factors and postulated that 20-minute consultations were insufficient for restructuring patients&#x02019; dysfunctional beliefs. The FREE approach differs from the intervention of Jellema et al. in three key ways. Firstly, it aims to restructure the basic GP consultation rather than providing it by way of an additional appointment. This makes the approach appear to be standard practice rather than an add-on, allows the earliest possible intervention, minimises the risk of the GP unwittingly increasing patient threat or fear through their usual practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and ensures that a consistent approach can be used in any subsequent encounters. Secondly, FREE bases the exploration of psychosocial factors around the identification and minimisation of factors which increase patient threat in relation to their back pain rather than including all potential psychosocial influences which may overwhelm GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thirdly, it also provides the patient with a booklet and website which support and reinforce the information provided by the GP.</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par97">FREE was initially planned to be delivered during the first consultation which someone receives for an episode of acute LBP, and this study was designed to explore the effect of FREE in this population. The study population was expanded to include people with LBP of any duration for two reasons. Firstly, presentation rates of eligible patients to the first recruitment sites was unacceptably low and indicated that recruitment targets would not be met within time frames that were acceptable to either participating practices or the project budget. Secondly, feedback from participating GPs indicated that these restrictive recruitment criteria excluded most of the patients with LBP they commonly saw. Consequently, the generalisability of study findings was likely to be limited. The revised recruitment criteria are similar to those used in previous LBP primary care research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. A sensitivity analysis of the main outcomes will be performed restricted to the original study population of participants with acute LBP.</p><p id="Par98">GPs will complete baseline measures post-randomisation (but prior to receiving training). Training requires that all participating GPs in a practice attend a 4-h training session together. Although it would be preferable to have all GPs complete baseline measures prior to randomisation, this is not possible, given the lead-in time required to schedule and co-ordinate training sessions with the practices. GPs will be aware of whether they will receive training, but they will not be aware of the content of the intervention when they complete baseline measures. It is possible that knowledge of group allocation could affect GPs&#x02019; responses when completing baseline measures; however, it is considered more important that these be completed close to when training is received and patients are recruited. GP measures are not the trial&#x02019;s main outcome, and patients are recruited while blind to group allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par99">This is protocol version 2 (amended 8 December 2016).
