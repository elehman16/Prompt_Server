Heart rate variability (HRV), the variability in consecutive R-wave to R-wave intervals (RRI) of the electrocardiogram, captures synergy between the brain and cardiovascular control systems that modulate adaptive responding. Here we introduce a qualitatively new dimension of adaptive change in HRV quantified as a <italic>redistribution</italic> of spectral power by applying the Wasserstein distance with exponent 1 metric (W<sub>1</sub>) to RRI spectral data. We further derived a new index, D, to specify the direction of spectral redistribution and clarify physiological interpretation. We examined gender differences in real time RRI spectral power response to alcohol, placebo and visual cue challenges. Adaptive changes were observed as changes in power of the various spectral frequency bands (i.e., standard frequency domain HRV indices) and, during both placebo and alcohol intoxication challenges, as changes in the structure (shape) of the RRI spectrum, with a redistribution towards lower frequency oscillations. The overall conclusions from the present study are that the RRI spectrum is capable of a fluid and highly flexible response, even when oscillations (and thus activity at the sinoatrial node) are pharmacologically suppressed, and that low frequency oscillations serve a crucial but less studied role in physical and mental health.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In fields as diverse as astrophysics and molecular biology, variability within a system has been identified as a characteristic of adaptability.

To ensure that these integrated mind-body responses <xref rid="pone.0028281-Porges1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Vasilevski1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Soroko1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> occur rapidly and efficiently, heart rate variability changes on a moment-to-moment basis.</p><p>Heart rate variability (HRV) is measured as the variability in consecutive R-wave to R-wave intervals (RRI) of the electrocardiogram. It reflects the activity of multiple influences at the sinoatrial (SA) node of the heart, especially those emanating directly from the brain via the sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Commonly used, standard frequency domain indices of HRV are generated from the RRI power spectrum density (PSD) <xref rid="pone.0028281-Task1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to reflect the <italic>amount</italic> of variability within the system calculated as the power of RRI oscillations in various frequency ranges. The overall amount of variability in these ranges of the RRI PSD is an obviously essential dimension of neurocardiac dynamics, but unlikely the only dimension, especially if one considers the possibility that RRI PSD dynamics can change qualitatively and non-linearly in response to perturbation <xref rid="pone.0028281-Muskulus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Reorganization of variability (i.e., redistribution of spectral power) is another key dimension of neurocardiac dynamics, which may be captured in ways other than the standard HRV indices (e.g., change in the ratio of power in the low and high frequency ranges) designated by the Task Force <xref rid="pone.0028281-Task1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In this paper, we go beyond the Task Force conceptualization of spectral reorganization by measuring <italic>reorganization</italic> of variability independently from <italic>amount</italic> of variability (i.e., disentangling the redistribution of spectral power from the power of RRI oscillations in a given frequency range). We propose that, in and of itself, spectral reorganization may reflect a fundamental mechanism of adaptability that supports changes in response to challenge even when the amount of variability is diminished, for example, by disease states <xref rid="pone.0028281-Agelink1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> or pharmacological challenges such as alcohol drinking <xref rid="pone.0028281-Romanowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This implies that adaptive neurocardiac responding might still be accomplished by strategically redistributing power to a given frequency, even when <italic>de novo</italic> generation of spectral power from the neural inputs at the SA node is impaired (i.e., when the amount of variability is limited or less likely to increase).</p><p>This study is the first to apply the Wasserstein distance with exponent 1 (W<sub>1</sub>) metric to RRI spectral data in order to quantify redistribution of RRI spectral power as a distinct dimension of real time cardiovascular reactivity. Applying W<sub>1</sub> to RRI data provides a strong approach to characterizing redistributions in the temporal dynamics of the RRI PSD during challenge conditions because it is robust against noise <xref rid="pone.0028281-Mezic1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Ni1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and makes no a priori assumptions about linearity of the data <xref rid="pone.0028281-Muskulus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The utility of W<sub>1</sub> as a measure of dissimilarity between probability distributions <xref rid="pone.0028281-Mezic1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and histograms <xref rid="pone.0028281-Ni1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> is well-established outside the area of physiology. We computed W<sub>1</sub> from individual RRI PSD in order to measure dissimilarity between power spectra elicited during a resting state compared to a challenge condition, as follows:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0028281.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is defined as<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0028281.e002.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>
</p><p>The W<sub>1</sub> metric differs in several important ways from the standard indices of HRV defined by the Task Force <xref rid="pone.0028281-Task1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which are calculated as the absolute power in predefined spectral frequency bands (e.g., low [LF HRV] and high [HF HRV] frequency bands) or as the ratio between them (LF/HF ratio). First, the W<sub>1</sub> metric integrates the RRI PSD across the entire spectral range (i.e., &#x0223c;0 to 0.5 Hz); no predefined spectral frequency bands are imposed. Second, the W<sub>1</sub> is a metric on a set of equivalence classes of power spectra. In other words, the RRI PSDs being compared are normalized prior to computing W<sub>1</sub>. This implies that two power spectra, which can be obtained from each other by multiplying one of them by a positive constant (i.e., changes only in spectral power), will not be differentiated by W<sub>1</sub>. Third, the W<sub>1</sub> metric measures dissimilarity between two PSDs in terms of absolute distance, and thus captures absolute change in the <italic>overall shape or structure</italic> of the power spectrum in response to perturbation. These features of the W<sub>1</sub> metric make it possible to quantify and visualize the overall extent to which the RRI PSD reorganizes following a perturbation, distinct from increases or decreases in HRV. We suggest that a consideration of spectral power redistribution (W<sub>1</sub>), together with changes in power captured by the standard spectral frequency indices (e.g., HF HRV, LF HRV) may be heuristic for further understanding mechanisms that modulate neurocardiac responding.</p><p>To refine this approach for assessing change in neurocardiac signaling, it is useful to consider the direction of spectral power redistribution. A redistribution in the RRI spectrum towards lower versus higher frequencies has a different physiological meaning with respect to adaptability. There is consensus that HF HRV, dominated by oscillations around 0.3 Hz, reflects activation of the parasympathetic branch of the ANS mediated by the vagus nerve, and is commonly linked to respiration. HF HRV is thought to be dominant at rest or during restful states. In contrast, LF HRV is influenced by both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity <xref rid="pone.0028281-Malliani1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and often includes oscillations at &#x0223c;0.1 Hz (also called the Mayer wave) that are strongly mediated by the HR baroreflex system <xref rid="pone.0028281-Malpas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Goldstein2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Notably, 0.1 Hz is one of several resonance frequencies in the cardiovascular system <xref rid="pone.0028281-Vaschillo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Vaschillo2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Aljuri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> that serve to augment variability in the system <xref rid="pone.0028281-Vaschillo2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Yasumasu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. To capture the directionality of spectral power redistribution, we derived a new directionality index (D) from W<sub>1</sub>. D was computed from individual PSD (using the same CDF definition as W<sub>1</sub>) as follows:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0028281.e003.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>When D takes on a positive value, it suggests a coordinated reorganization towards lower frequency oscillations. Alternatively, a negative D implies movement towards higher frequency oscillations.</p><p>This paper introduces W<sub>1</sub> and D as a new approach to characterizing HRV changes in response to challenge and examines whether it provides non-redundant information to standard indices of RRI spectral power (e.g., LF HRV, HF HRV, LF/HF ratio). We used existing data from a study aimed at understanding physiological mechanisms that modulate alcohol use behaviors in young men and women. The original study collected ECG data at rest and in response to alcohol, placebo, and cognitive-emotional challenges in healthy men and women, and as such provided a rich data source for assessing adaptive reactions to a tiered challenge paradigm. We chose to examine gender differences as a starting point from which to assess the contribution of spectral redistribution (W<sub>1</sub>) and directionality of the redistribution (D) to adaptive psychophysiological response because multiple literatures demonstrate inherent differences in adaptive functioning between men and women. For example, women have greater vagal mediation of heart rate <xref rid="pone.0028281-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and autonomic balance <xref rid="pone.0028281-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> at rest, greater vagal withdrawal in response to stress <xref rid="pone.0028281-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, less suppression of HRV by alcohol <xref rid="pone.0028281-Udo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and more protection against coronary heart disease <xref rid="pone.0028281-Rossy1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> compared to men. Moreover, women demonstrate a well-established survival bias which is initiated at conception <xref rid="pone.0028281-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and evidence longer life expectancies in both developed and developing countries <xref rid="pone.0028281-Barford1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>We utilized pharmacological (alcoholic beverage consumption) and visual cue challenges that are known to change power in the RRI PSD. Acute intoxication depresses HRV in both low and high frequency bands <xref rid="pone.0028281-Romanowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and cognitive-emotional visual cues enhance spectral power at 0.1 Hz in the LF band <xref rid="pone.0028281-Vaschillo3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We hypothesized that women would show an adaptive advantage in responding to the tiered challenge paradigm, especially as the magnitude of the challenge increased. We predicted that this adaptive advantage would be evidenced by greater spectral redistribution (W<sub>1</sub>) towards low frequency oscillations (D) in response to potent stimuli.

The main finding is that the W<sub>1</sub> metric and D index are complementary to the standard HRV frequency domain indices. When increases and decreases in spectral power were considered together with the nature of the reorganization that occurred in the RRI PSD, the data revealed qualitatively different ways in which the cardiovascular system adapts to different types of challenges. The results suggest that the W<sub>1</sub> metric and D index provide insight into a dimension of neurocardiac dynamics that supports adaptive responding even when neural activity at the SA node of the heart is compromised and the amount of cardiovascular variability cannot be adjusted appropriately (i.e., increase or decrease) to meet a given challenge. This is consistent with the notion that the cardiovascular system has at its disposal multiple, complementary mechanisms to support adaptive responding.</p><p>Clearly, further research and discussion are needed to understand the implications of this new dimension of spectral change; however, using gender differences as a starting point, we offer some initial speculations as to the significance of the W<sub>1</sub> metric and D index that build on our ongoing research into the arterial baroreflex system and the role of resonance in adaptive responding. As a first example, in the control condition, there were no significant gender differences in spectral power redistribution (W<sub>1</sub>) in response to cognitive emotional visual cues, but women did show greater increases in LF HRV and a greater LF/HF ratio compared to men. We interpret these findings as showing that when the cardiovascular system, and its bidirectional communication with the brain, is performing optimally (participants were all young healthy adults), the &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d; adaptive response to the visual cue challenge was to provoke greater neural activation at the SA node to generate more low frequency oscillations; this was accomplished more robustly by women than men.</p><p>As a second example, following alcohol consumption, the power of the total RRI spectrum (total HRV index) was decreased, but both the LF HRV and HF HRV suppression was significantly less prominent in women than in men <xref rid="pone.0028281-Udo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The W<sub>1</sub> metric and D index further showed that the relative contribution of RRI oscillations with different frequencies to the power spectrum changed considerably, and that the extent of this redistribution was greater, and towards lower frequencies, in women than in men. One interpretation of this finding is that when neural input at the SA node is dampened by alcohol, the system attempts to compensate for this reduction by redistributing remaining power towards lower frequencies. If spectral reorganization is serving as a mechanism by which the cardiovascular system compensates for reduced neural input at the SA node and helps to offset or override the effects of alcohol, then the fact that women are both less suppressed by alcohol and more able to redistribute power towards lower frequencies is consistent with an adaptive advantage.</p><p>There is an abundance of research demonstrating that greater HF HRV at rest (i.e., unchallenged) is associated with health and well-being. Here we assert that the story is different in the face of challenge; namely, that oscillations in the low frequency range also serve important adaptogenic functions that support health and well-being. During a mild challenge, such as viewing visual cues with emotional content, an increase in power in the LF band of the RRI PSD may be adaptive because it signals activation of neural inputs to promote alertness and vigilance. When neural communication with the heart is compromised by alcohol or other adverse conditions, maintaining low frequency oscillations, even at the expense of high frequency oscillations, may be adaptive because oscillations at lower frequencies can generate a resonance response. Resonance amplifies cardiovascular oscillations and thus may compensate for reduced &#x0201c;efferent-induced&#x0201d; oscillations. We propose that through resonance, the heart-brain biofeedback loop can be maintained. It is noteworthy that both vagal stimulation <xref rid="pone.0028281-Labiner1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and resonance breathing biofeedback <xref rid="pone.0028281-Lehrer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which induces high oscillations at 0.1 Hz, show promise in the treatment of various physical and mental health problems <xref rid="pone.0028281-Beekwilder1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Karavidas1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028281-Lehrer2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>As a final point, we note that our results clearly demonstrate that W<sub>1</sub> does not capture the same spectral movement as the LF/HF ratio. In the control condition, a change in the shape (or structure) of the RRI PSD was detected by the standard LF/HF ratio index but not the W<sub>1</sub> metric. In the alcohol condition, on the other hand, a change in the structure of the RRI PSD was detected by the W<sub>1</sub> metric, but not the LF/HF ratio index. A major difference between the LF/HF ratio index and W<sub>1</sub> metric is that the latter compares normalized spectra and thus can differentiate amount of variability (i.e., RRI spectral power) from organization of variability (i.e., shape of RRI PSD). Another key difference is that the ratio compares two portions of a single RRI PSD using predefined frequency bands, whereas the metric captures shifts across the entire spectral range between two independent RRI PSDs. The conceptual significance of these differences is open to debate.</p><p>In today's world, adaptation most often entails successful negotiation of a wide variety of sublethal physical and emotional challenges that seldom demand an extreme defensive response. Thus, useful conceptualization of body-brain communication needs to encompass more than &#x0201c;fight or flight&#x0201d; response capacity and focus on the nuanced biofeedback that occurs between the heart and brain on a moment-to-moment basis. As has been well studied, the human heart must receive detailed instructions from the brain to adapt rapidly and effectively to an enormous range of challenges that vary in magnitude, content, and salience. Less often considered, but also of seemingly critical importance, is the communication of information back to the brain regarding how well the body has carried out neural commands. It is necessary to move beyond the existing standard indices of HRV to initiate exploration of how such &#x0201c;body to brain&#x0201d; mechanisms participate in the closed-loop circuit of communication that continually exists between these two most essential organs. The W<sub>1</sub> metric and D index may serve as an initial step towards this by helping to understand autonomic function as an embedded component of central nervous system functioning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects Involved in Research and participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Participants</title><p>The present analyses used data from 232 (118 women) young adults between the ages of 21 and 24 (mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21.6; <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.9) who regularly drank alcohol, but who were not alcohol dependent.
