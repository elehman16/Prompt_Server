Participants completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule as a measure of baseline negative mood, and were randomly assigned to either the high-stress or low-stress version of the Trier Social Stress Test. Participants then completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task as a measure of mind-wandering behavior. In Experiment 1, participants reporting a high degree of negative mood that were exposed to the high-stress condition were more likely to engage in a variable response time, make more errors, and were more likely to report thinking about the stressor relative to participants that report a low level of negative mood. These effects diminished throughout task performance, suggesting that acute stress induces a temporary mind-wandering state in participants with a negative mood. The temporary affect-dependent deficits observed in Experiment 1 were replicated in Experiment 2, with the high negative mood participants demonstrating limited resource availability (indicated by pupil diameter) immediately following stress induction. These experiments provide novel evidence to suggest that acute psychosocial stress briefly suppresses the availability of cognitive resources and promotes an internally oriented focus of attention in participants with a negative mood.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transactional model of stress</kwd><kwd>mind wandering</kwd><kwd>negative mood</kwd><kwd>coping strategies</kwd><kwd>pupil diameter</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="100"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The experience of stress is pervasive. In 2011, 23.6% of adult Canadians reported experiencing extreme stress in daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Statistics Canada, 2011</xref>). With chronic stress linked to immunological (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Herbert and Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Cohen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Esch et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Segerstrom and Miller, 2004</xref>, for reviews), cardiovascular (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Harlan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Esch et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bunker et al., 2003</xref>), and neurodegenerative disease (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gilad et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Gilad and Gilad, 1995</xref>), as well as poor mental health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Negr&#x000e3;o et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">Vaidya, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Raison and Miller, 2003</xref>), an abundance of research has emerged with the aim of mapping both the psychological and physiological determinants of the body&#x02019;s response to stress.</p><p>Transactional models of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>) are multidimensional representations that emphasize the reciprocal relation between state and stressor on behavior. Transactional models provide an algorithm that characterizes stress response based on an individual&#x02019;s appraisal of environmental demands and subsequent choice of coping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Lazarus, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Stokes and Kite, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Zeidner and Endler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Hammond, 2000</xref>). Appraisal mechanisms evaluate the degree of personal relevance within the stressful context, while coping mechanisms regulate whether the individual engages in either a task-focused or emotion-focused strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>). A task-focused coping strategy operates to prevent distraction and maintain successful task performance. An emotion-focused coping strategy is intimately tied to self-regulation and self-referential mentation, and facilitates the prioritization of processing internal worries at the expense of concurrent task performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Matthews and Desmond, 2002</xref>).</p><p>While transactional models provide a framework for developing a state-mediated model of stress, transactional theories lack specific predictions on information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Matthews and Campbell, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Matthews (2001)</xref> proposed two separate transactional frameworks for modeling the effects of stress on cognition in order to address this gap in the literature. Cognitive-adaptive transactions aim to model the stress response as a function of the allocation of attention and energy, where behavior is driven by goals and intentions and operates to direct attention as a function of coping strategy. Those who enlist a task-focused coping strategy are therefore more likely to allocate attention toward task supervision in efforts to maintain successful task performance, while those who enlist and an emotion-focused coping strategy are more likely to allocate attention toward self-referential mentation (and therefore are more likely to perform poorly on the task). This framework aligns with previous reports that stress promotes the select processing of information relevant to an individuals&#x02019; current goal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chajut and Algom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Kofman et al., 2006</xref>). Bio-cognitive transactions on the other hand, are modulated by fluctuations in both neural and cognitive architectures that directly influence the availability of attentional resources, where the term resources refers to the capacity of the executive attention network to process information (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kane and Engle, 2002</xref>). Indeed, stress has been shown to deplete working memory capacity independent of task difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Schoofs et al., 2008</xref>) and modulate cognitive control functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Alexander et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Steinhauser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Liston et al., 2009</xref>). The two conceptual frameworks are therefore inherently linked and complementary: bio-cognitive transactions model the limitation of attentional resources during periods of stress, while cognitive-adaptive transactions model the allocation of attention within the constraints of resource availability. The current work aims to investigate the effect of stress on mind-wandering behavior, using both a cognitive-adaptive (Experiment 1) and bio-cognitive (Experiment 2) parameters to provide a comprehensive account of the effects.</p><p>In the situation of an emotion-focused coping strategy, attention is allocated toward the internal world rather than the task environment. Often referred to as mind-wandering episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Smallwood et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2003c</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Smallwood and Schooler, 2006</xref><bold>)</bold>, these mental diversions are associated with poor task performance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Smallwood and Schooler, 2006</xref>) and typically occur during well-practiced or mundane tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Teasdale et al., 1995</xref>). While mind-wandering behavior consumes almost half of our conscious experience in daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010</xref>), such behavior occurs more frequently in some populations relative to others. For example, clinically depressed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Carriere et al., 2008</xref>) and dysphoric populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Smallwood et al., 2007</xref>) are more likely to engage in mind-wandering behavior compared to healthy controls. A similar bias toward internal processing has been observed following negative mood induction in healthy individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Smallwood et al. (2009)</xref> found that participants induced with a negative mood were more likely to engage in task-irrelevant thought and were less able to effectively disengage from such thoughts relative to controls. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Smallwood and O&#x02019;Connor (2011)</xref> observed a similar increase in mind-wandering behavior following negative mood induction, and report a retrospective bias during episodes of off-task thought in the negative mood group relative to controls.</p><p>Negative mood has also been implicated as a critical determinant of coping strategy in studies of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Parker and Brown, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Coyne et al. (1981)</xref> compared coping mechanisms in stressful situations between depressed and non-depressed populations over a 1-year period. Using self-report as the primary measure, the authors report that being in a depressive state promotes an emotion-focused coping following a stressful experience. Depressive states have also been associated with a heightened perception of what is at stake in a stressful situation (e.g., self-esteem and well-being) relative to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>), and is associated with fewer available personal and social resources to mediate the effects of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Mitchell et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Negative mood appears to systematically bias the allocation of attention toward a self-referential mentation within both the mind wandering and stress literature. The current work therefore attempts to provide novel evidence for a cognitive-adaptive (Experiment 1) and bio-cognitive (Experiment 2) account of stress on mind-wandering behavior, with negative mood isolated as the state variable within the transactional framework. We grouped participants based on their level of state negative mood, and exposed them to either a high-stress procedure or a low stress control procedure. In Experiment 1, we predicted that in the high negative mood group, the high-stress condition would induce an emotion-focused coping strategy and an allocation of attention toward the internal environment, resulting in an increase in mind-wandering behavior relative to the low stress condition. In Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate the behavioral effects of Experiment 1, and predict a limitation of resource availability (indicated by larger pupil diameter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Beatty, 1982</xref>) following participation in the high-stress condition for the high negative mood group relative to the low stress condition. Finally, the effect of stress on cognition has been shown to diminish over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Elzinga and Roelofs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Oei et al., 2006</xref>), and as such we predict that stress effects are likely to be maximal immediately after stress induction (block 1) in both experiments. As a most direct test of these hypotheses, we used planned comparisons based on <italic>a priori</italic> predictions of high-stress experiences affecting high negative affect more adversely than low negative affect participants, immediately following stress induction, in addition to omnibus tests.</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENT 1</title><sec id="s1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 124; 51 in the experimental group, 26 females; and 73 in the control group, 43 females) were undergraduate students from McMaster University. Participants were recruited using the University&#x02019;s online experiment scheduling system and received partial course credit in exchange for their participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants spent approximately 1 h in the laboratory. After providing written informed consent, participants were asked to complete the Extended Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Watson et al., 1988</xref>). The PANAS-X provides a subscale measure of an individual&#x02019;s level of state positive and negative mood, and was used as a baseline measure of state mood prior to the stress induction procedure. In the current work, our predictions were inclusive to participants&#x02019; scores on the negative subscale only. As a result, participants&#x02019; scores on the positive subscale were not included in the analyses.</p><p>Participants then randomly assigned to either the &#x0201c;high-stress&#x0201d; experimental condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Kirschbaum et al., 1993</xref>) or the &#x0201c;low stress&#x0201d; control condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Het et al., 2009</xref>) of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized paradigm that reliably activates the body&#x02019;s stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Kuhlmann and Wolf, 2005</xref>). Both conditions had two phases. The first phase included an anticipation period, where participants were asked to sit in a waiting room alone for 5 min. This first phase was the same for both conditions. In the second phase, participants were moved into a second experiment room. In the high-stress condition, participants were required to complete complex verbal arithmetic and to give an impromptu speech (on their career plan following completion of their undergraduate degree) in front of a three-member confederate panel. Participants were informed that their performance was being taped for further consideration. In the low stress condition, participants were required to count aloud in intervals of 15 without a panel for the verbal arithmetic task, and informally talk about their favorite movie or experience in front of a single panel member for the speech task (as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Kirschbaum et al., 1993</xref><bold>).</bold></p><p>Participants were then guided to another experiment room where they completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Robertson et al., 1997</xref>) as a measure of mind-wandering propensity. The SART is a go/no-go task that requires participants to respond quickly and accurately on non-target trials, and withhold their response on infrequent target trials. In the current work, target probability was 20%, with the non-target stimuli being the numbers 0 through 9 and the target stimulus being the number 3 (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Smallwood and Schooler, 2006</xref>). Probe trials immediately followed target trials to assess the participants&#x02019; conscious experience of mind-wandering behavior. The probe read &#x0201c;Stop! Where was your attention focused immediately prior to this question?&#x0201d; with an alternative forced choice response format of either &#x0201c;my attention was focused on the task&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;my attention was not focused on the task.&#x0201d; The proportion of off-task thought was calculated by dividing the number of off-task thought probes by the total number of thought probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Vinski and Watter, 2012</xref>). The experiment was presented to participants using E-prime software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Schneider et al., 2002</xref>). Participants were shown two blocks of 179 stimuli, with stimuli presented for 700 ms and an inter-stimulus interval of 2000 ms. The stimuli were presented in black print on a white background.</p><p>Response time variability on non-target trials, known as the response time coefficient of variability (RTCV, calculated as reaction time SD divided by the mean), and the proportion of inappropriate responding on target trials (error rate) were calculated as the behavioral indicators of task inattention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Smallwood and Schooler, 2006</xref>). Response time variability has been validated as a measure of natural variation in attentional focus throughout task performance and has emerged as an increasingly relevant behavioral measure within the mind wandering literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Cheyne et al., 2009</xref>). Error rate is indicative of failures in top-down supervision of task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Robertson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Manly et al., 1999</xref>), and has traditionally been utilized as a measure of off-task focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Smallwood and Schooler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Smallwood et al., 2007</xref>). However, convergent evidence suggests that not all performance errors provide direct evidence of inattention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Peebles and Bothell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Helton, 2009</xref>), with error rates mediated by both signal salience and the speed-accuracy trade off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">See et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Manly et al., 1999</xref>) and vulnerable to impulsivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Helton, 2009</xref>). Correlations were therefore computed between dependent measures for the first block of the experiment and across all experimental blocks to validate that the three dependent measures reflect the same construct. Correlations are shown in <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold>. The proportion of times participants failed to respond on non-target trials, typically referred to as the omission rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Cheyne et al., 2009</xref>), was not included as a dependent measure due to the limited time in which participants were required to make their response on non-target trials (700 ms).</p><p>Retrospective probes were inserted following the first and second experimental block to provide a measure of thought content during mind-wandering episodes. Retrospective report of off-task thought has been validated with both intermittent thought probes and response latencies during task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Smallwood et al., 2004</xref>), and therefore provides an opportunity to collect an additional measure of attentional focus during task performance. Participants were given 3 min to type the content of their thoughts during the experimental block immediately prior. Participants were reassured that the report would be confidential and were encouraged to be as detailed in their report as possible. Thought content was coded based on three parameters: tense, valence, and focus. Tense refers to whether participants&#x02019; thoughts were focused on episodes that occurred prior to the experimental session (past), episodes that occurred within the experimental session (present), or expectation of future episodes (future; modified from criterion defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Smallwood et al., 2011b</xref>). Valence refers to the affective tone of participants&#x02019; thoughts. Content was coded as either positive, negative, neutral, or a select combination of either affective valence. Focus refers to the focus of participants&#x02019; thoughts with respect to the experimental paradigm. Content was coded as either related to the SART (task-related), to their experience during the TSST (TSST-related) or unrelated to the experimental session (task-unrelated; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Smallwood et al., 2003b</xref> for a similar coding criterion). If participants reported thoughts that coincided with more than one level of a given factor (for example, reported both positive and negative thoughts within the same retrospective probe) then the participant was classified as &#x0201c;Other.&#x0201d;</p><p>Two assistants in the laboratory were recruited to code the thought probes, and were extensively debriefed on the coding scheme prior to completing the classification. A cross-coding validation procedure was employed to validate the categorization of the participants&#x02019; retrospective reports, whereby the two coders compared classification for each subject (as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Smallwood et al., 2003a</xref>). Discrepancies between coders were resolved through discussion, and a third party was included if the case of indecision. In the current work, all discrepancies were resolved through discussion and no third party mediation was necessary. Coders were blind to the experimental hypotheses and participant information. Participants were extensively debriefed following participation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The first set of analyses were designed to investigate the effects of stress on mind-wandering behavior across task duration, as a function of negative mood reported prior to stress induction.

<italic>Negative Affect</italic> (high, low).

All analyses were performed with negative affect included as a continuous variable. Because the results and significance of findings were not affected, we report median-split analyses only. In addition to our omnibus analyses, we conducted a small number of directional planned comparisons, focusing on high versus low negative mood participants in the high-stress condition in block 1 data. These planned comparisons were based on <italic>a priori</italic> predictions of greater stress-mediated disruption to focused performance in high negative affect participants that are likely to diminish over time.

Consistent with predictions, the observed effects were prominent during the first experimental block only.</p><p>The aim of Experiment 1 was to provide evidence for a cognitive-adaptive transactional account of stress on mind-wandering behavior. The present findings are compatible with such an account, with acute stress inducing a temporary stressor-oriented bias in attentional allocation relative to the low stress group, with performance deficits potentiated by the degree of negative mood reported prior to stress induction. To complement the cognitive-adaptive findings in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 was designed to provide evidence for a bio-cognitive account of stress on mind-wandering behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENT 2</title><p>Bio-cognitive transactions are mechanisms that are modulated by the fluctuation in both neural and cognitive architectures that influence availability of resources. Pupil dilation has been shown to reliably reflect resource utilization during cognitively demanding tasks regardless of the sensory domain under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Beatty, 1982</xref>), with dilation systematically increasing as a function of cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Granholm et al., 1996</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Kahneman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Beatty, 1982</xref>). Experiment 2 was designed to replicate the behavioral and self-report trends observed during Experiment 1, while providing a psychophysiological measure of resource availability compatible with a bio-cognitive transactional theory of stress.</p><p>The first set of analyses were conducted to replicate the stress effects observed in Experiment 1, and investigate how the observed trends extended into a third experimental block. It was hypothesized that behavioral trends and retrospective reports would replicate the findings observed in Experiment 1, predicting that participants that report a high level of negative mood will be more likely to engage in mind-wandering behavior (high response time variability and error rates) in the high-stress condition relative to the low negative mood group, with maximal effects likely during the first experimental block. As per Experiment 1, we predict that task disengagement in the high negative mood group is due to the initiation of an emotion-focused coping strategy, and therefore expect that this group will also be more likely engage in ruminatory processing of the stressor when compared to the low negative mood group. In light of previous reports of reduced resource availability during episodes of stress in those with a negative disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Coyne et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>), we predict that individuals in the high negative mood group will also demonstrate a larger pupil diameter immediately following stress induction relative to the low negative mood group, a trend that would parallel the behavioral indicators of mind-wandering behavior observed during the first experiment.

When exposed to our high-stress manipulation, participants in the high negative mood group displayed more variable response behavior and made more errors compared to participants with low negative mood, and showed relatively stable versus decreasing patterns of self-report mind wandering compared to other participants over time. These participants also exhibited larger pupil dilation on average relative to controls. These effects of mood were relatively absent in the low stress group, providing evidence for resource dependent, bio-cognitive account of stress on mind-wandering behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>GENERAL DISCUSSION</title><p>The current work aims to investigate the effects of stress on mind-wandering behavior within both the cognitive-adaptive (Experiment 1) and bio-cognitive (Experiment 2) components of transactional theory. Participants were grouped based on their level of negative mood prior to experiment participation, and were randomly assigned to either the high stress or low stress version of the TSST. Participants were then required to complete the SART as a measure of mind-wandering propensity. With the current work representing the first investigation of stress effects on mind-wandering behavior, Experiment 1 was exploratory in nature with the minimal prediction that negative mood would potentiate the effects of stress. Predictions in Experiment 2 were bolstered by the trends observed in Experiment 1.</p><p>The cognitive-adaptive component of transactional theory predicts cognitive performance based on resource allocation (coping strategy) while the bio-cognitive component predicts performance based on resource availability. When both components are used in conjunction, transactional theory provides a comprehensive understanding of stress effects on cognition. Findings from Experiment 1 reveal that participants in the high negative mood group are more likely to disengage from the task (indicated by an increased response time variability and error rate) and think about the stressor when exposed to the high-stress condition relative to the low negative mood group. This stressor-oriented focus, reflecting an emotion-focused coping strategy, was observed during the first experimental block only and failed to replicate in the low stress condition, suggesting that the inattentive state observed was driven by the stress manipulation. This behavioral trend was observed in both experiments. Findings from Experiment 2 further reveal that participants in the high negative mood, high-stress condition also demonstrated reduced resource availability (larger pupil diameter) during the first block relative to the low negative mood group. Stress-induced limitations in resource availability promote the select processing of information that is most relevant to the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">Wells and Matthews, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chajut and Algom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Kofman et al., 2006</xref>). These data therefore suggest that acute stress limits resource availability in individuals with a negative disposition and, in the initiation of an emotion-focused coping strategy, promotes the select processing of stressor-oriented information at the expense of task performance.</p><p>Previous work on the relation between attentional state and pupil diameter support this interpretation, with pupillary construction associated with indices of task engagement and dilation with indices of task disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Smallwood et al. (2011a)</xref> provide additional evidence for the systematic relationship between pupil diameter and attentional state using the SART, reporting pupillary dilation during mind-wandering episodes and constriction during task focus. Pupil dilation also reflects activation of the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine (LC/NE) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Yoshitomi et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Koss, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Loewenfeld, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Frith and Frith, 2006</xref>). The LC/NE system is a prominent network within the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis (HPAA), a constellation of regions activated in stressful situations that operates to maintain homeostasis within the body (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">Woodward et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Morilak et al., 2005</xref>). Acute stress has been shown to induce a phasic release of norepinephrine (NE) from the LC/NE system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abercrombie and Jacobs, 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">Svensson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Cecchi et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">b</xref>). In the attention literature, phasic release of NE enhances the processing of stimuli deemed to be of high reward and utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). Previous work suggests that those in a depressive state are more likely to ruminate relative to healthy controls (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Salguero et al., 2012</xref>). Depressive rumination is intrusive and persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Lam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Wenzlaff and Luxton, 2003</xref>), and is often fixated on a social problem perceived by the individual to be severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Edwards and Weary, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Lyubomirsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Treynor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Rudolph and Conley, 2005</xref>). In the face of a psychosocial stressor such as the TSST, it is possible that participants in a negative mood, who typically employ an emotion-focused coping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Coyne et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Parker and Brown, 1982</xref>), appraise stressor-focused thoughts to be of higher utility than the post-stressor SART and that phasic release of NE potentiates the internal focus of attention. As the HPAA feedback mechanisms terminate the stress response and phasic release of NE begins to diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Chamberlain et al., 2006</xref>), performance of participants with high levels of negative mood align with the low negative mood group and low stress controls. A stress-based mind-wandering paradigm therefore not only offers a unique framework for investigating the neurochemical basis of mind-wandering behavior, but may also provide a framework for investigating how depressive populations value information in situations of limited processing capacity.</p><p>Regardless of stress induction, depressive populations typically mind wander more than healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Smallwood et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Smallwood and O&#x02019;Connor, 2011</xref>). It would therefore be reasonable to predict that in the low stress condition, participants reporting a high level of negative mood would demonstrate a heightened propensity to mind wander relative to the low mood group. Instead, participants in the low negative mood group were more likely to mind wander (higher response time variability and errors rates) and have limited resource availability (larger pupil diameter) in the low stress condition, although this trend did fail to reach significance for all dependent measures. This trend validates the current interpretation that mood interacts with stress to promote mind-wandering behavior, but raises the question of why participants with low negative mood would mind wander more than high negative mood participants in circumstances of low stress. One possibility could be that the low stress condition induces a positive state in those with a depressive mood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Fredrickson and Levenson (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Fredrickson et al. (1999)</xref> argue that positive mood can regulate negative mood, with positive mood having been linked to a broadened scope of attention and heightened resource availability (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Fredrickson, 1998</xref>). Eliciting positive emotions has even been shown to undo the effects of negative mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cabanac, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Solomon, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Nezu et al., 1988</xref>). In the low stress condition used in the current work, participants are asked to spend 5 min talking about a favorite experience or movie. While speculative, it is possible that the low stress condition temporarily alleviates depressive mood and promotes an on-task focus in high negative mood participants. Stress-related research typically utilizes the high-stress version of the TSST, and transactional models typically focus on the interaction between high-stress situations and mood. Findings in the current work therefore offer a new route of investigation within the stress literature: does the low stress version of the TSST (engaging in positive thought) induce a focused state of attention in depressive populations?</p><p>While the low stress condition may elicit positive moods in participants with high negative mood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Schoofs et al. (2008)</xref> found that exposure to the high-stress version of the TSST can induce a negative mood in participants. The current work fails to include measures of TSST effectiveness beyond behavioral measures, and therefore it could be argued that the observed effects are an artifact of temporary mood induction. Indeed, the behavioral deficits observed during the first block are congruent with previous reports of attentional deficits following negative mood induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Smallwood and O&#x02019;Connor, 2011</xref>). The inclusion of a post-TSST mood questionnaire or retrospective report of stressor effectiveness would alleviate the current limitation. However, in the interest to investigate the depleting effect of stress on task inattention, increasing the time interval between the TSST and task performance was perceived as a threat to the validity of data interpretation. In addition to the passage of time, it is possible that having participants actively reflect on their current mood may interfere with the stress manipulation. Investigating the mediating role of stress-induced mood on cognition, rather than the mediating role of mood on stress effects (as in the current work), would be an interesting route of investigation and may help shed light on the mechanisms underlying the effect of stress on mind wandering.</p><p>Introducing a time interval between the TSST and SART performance may also influence the degree to which participants are likely to report of mind wandering during the first experimental block. In the current work, the high and low negative mood groups were equally likely to report off-task thought in the high-stress condition, even though behavioral measures of task inattention appear to differ between groups. One reason for this finding could be stereotype threat induced by the TSST. Stereotype threat refers to the psychosocial phenomena whereby an individual feels under threat of a stigmatized social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Steele and Aronson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Steele, 1997</xref>), with the individual maintaining an effort to sustain a self-image of competence beyond race, gender, socioeconomic status, or age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Steele, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Aronson et al., 1999</xref>). The TSST is designed to stimulate a manageable level of stress through social evaluative threat and perceived uncontrollability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Kirschbaum et al., 1993</xref>), providing the ideal environmental context for facilitation of stereotype threat. In light of evidence that stereotype threat facilitates worries related to perceived task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cadinu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Beilock et al., 2007</xref>), it is reasonable to presume that participants were likely to diminish the degree to which they reported mind-wandering behavior in the high-stress condition, regardless of negative mood. This interpretation is also congruent with previous reports that self-report measures are vulnerable to threats of performance evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Vinski and Watter, 2012</xref>), and the failure to observe consistent correlations between self-report and the remaining dependent measures across both experiments. Future research on the effects of stress using the mind-wandering paradigm might benefit from measuring the degree to which participants felt intimidated by the high-stress condition of the TSST as a mediator of self-report measures.</p><p>The current findings are interpreted with a focus on the detrimental effects of stress on participants that report a high level of negative mood. However, an alternative interpretation could be that low levels of negative mood buffers against the detrimental effects of stress, resulting in enhanced task-focus immediately following stress induction. This interpretation is congruent with previous stress-related work in non-depressive populations that demonstrates improved vigilance at moderate levels of arousal (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">Warm et al., 2008</xref>). This interpretation would also account for the steady decline in vigilance (and increase in mind wandering frequency) as the effects of stress diminish over time. However, participants with low levels of negative mood were equally likely to engage in mind-wandering behavior regardless of the stress condition across all experimental blocks, and mind wandering typically increases throughout task duration regardless of participants&#x02019; mood due to a decline in available cognitive resources necessary to maintain stimulus-independent thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Teasdale et al., 1995</xref>). The current experiments do not permit the ability to tease apart whether the temporary low levels of mind wandering observed in the low negative mood, high-stress condition is due to the effects of stress or due to a natural task-oriented focus of attention at the early stages of experiment participation typically observed in non-depressive populations, however, this route of investigation would be interesting in future studies of stress effects on mind wandering.</p><p>While we discuss the current effects within a theoretical framework of attentional control, it is possible that other causal arrangements could account for the observed effects. For example, the difference in self-report of on-task performance over blocks could more causally relate to the differences we observe in behavioral performance measures. Our view is that all of these measures reflect aspects of attentional control, but concede that it is not possible from our data to properly tease apart potentially separate effects of block and more basic attentional effects.</p><p>While <italic>a priori</italic> predictions were replicated between the two experiments, it is imperative to consider the findings that failed to replicate, including the main effects of stress and negative mood. One possibility for the discrepant findings could be the difference in sample size: Experiment 1 has a sample size almost twice the size of Experiment 2. It is therefore entirely plausible that the power of the observed effects in Experiment 1 is not large enough to translate into a smaller sample. It is also plausible that including an eye-tracker in Experiment 2 introduced a degree of discomfort for participants, which may have diminished the difference in mind-wandering behavior originally observed between groups in Experiment 1.</p><p>In summary, findings in the current work provide evidence for a transactional account of stress on mind-wandering behavior. Specifically, acute stress appears to limit the availability of cognitive resources in participants that report a high level of negative mood (Experiment 2) and, in the alongside the initiation of an emotion-focused coping strategy, is likely to induce a temporary stressor-oriented focus of attention at the expense of task performance (Experiment 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all members of the Cognitive Science Laboratory at the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour at McMaster University, for their assistance in the development of this work, especially Alex Gough for help with experiment programing and Kaian Unwalla and Esther Manoian for their help with data collection and coding.
