Analgesics that are used widely are opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), all of which have potentially threatening toxicities even when used in therapeutic doses. Their adverse effects and insufficient effectiveness in many types of pain are the main driving forces in the development of new analgesics.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The main factors contributing to the apparent draught of novel analgesics are insufficient mechanism-based approach to clinical pain syndromes and inadequate predictive validity of animal models of pain in humans. In addition, the neurobiology of nociceptive systems differs between species, and this limits the extrapolation of findings from animal studies to man even further. Experimental pain models in healthy volunteers for evaluation of analgesic action minimize the gap between knowledge gained in animal and human clinical studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Among several experimental approaches in humans for early screening of new analgesics, experimentally-induced mechanical pain model is associated with good precision and reproducibility. Commonly, these tests measure subjective pain after induction of pain stimuli. The method originally described by Randall and Selitto has been used by many investigators and has been proven to detect the efficacy of analgesics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Ugo basile analgesy meter (Randall&#x02013;Selitto test) was used to measure the analgesic property in the present study as <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> was found to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties probably mediated by the peripheral and central mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Preliminary studies by Shailasree <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have indicated anti-inflammatory activity for the aqueous extracts of fruits of <italic>T. chebula</italic> and could inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), COX-2, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of 1000 mg of aqueous extract of <italic>T. chebula</italic> on pain in healthy human volunteers using a mechanical pain model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The present study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and was performed as per the Good Clinical Practice and declaration of Helsinki guidelines. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twelve healthy male volunteers aged 18-40 years, with a body mass index in the range of 19.5-25.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> participated in the study. The study medication consisted of two capsules (500 mg each) of <italic>T. chebula</italic> and two placebo capsules, both given as single dose in a randomized manner. Each capsule of <italic>T. chebula</italic> contained a patented standardized aqueous extract of <italic>T. chebula</italic> with &#x02265; 15% of chebulinic acid, &#x02265; 10% of chebulagic acid and &#x02265; 15% of other low molecular weight hydrolysable tannins and is highly standardized by high performance liquid chromatography. Placebo capsules were identical to <italic>T. chebula</italic> capsules in size, shape, and color and were supplied by the study sponsor, Natreon Inc., New Jersey, USA.</p><p>The volunteers were screened for eligibility into the study. The successfully screened healthy volunteers were trained on two separate occasions for the Randall&#x02013;Selitto test procedure prior to participation into study. In the present study, we evaluated the analgesic activity of <italic>T. chebula</italic> using mechanical pain model by Randall&#x02013;Selitto test using analgesy meter (Ugo-Basile, Biological Research Apparatus, Milan, Italy). Participant was asked to sit comfortably on a chair with his eyes blindfolded. Participant's nail bed of index finger of nondominant hand was placed on a small plinth of basile analgesy meter, under a cone shaped pusher with a rounded tip as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. A pedal switch was pressed by the investigator to apply force to the nail bed. The instrument is geometrically designed to increase the force on the finger at a constant rate of 80 g/s. The participant was asked to lift his index finger of the other hand when he first experiences pain (noted as pain threshold) and when he was unable to tolerate the pain (noted as pain tolerance). Then, pressure on the pedal switch was removed, and the weight-bearing arm of the instrument was lifted to release the pressure on the nail bed. Readings on the scale were recorded. Three readings were taken at 5 min intervals. The average of the three readings was taken and the force (in grams) exerted on the nail bed and the threshold time and tolerance time were calculated.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Components of Ugo basile analgesy meter</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-32-329-g001"/></fig><p>The volunteers were given either two capsules of 500 mg <italic>T. chebula</italic> or identical looking placebo capsules with 240 ml of water at 8:00 AM as per prior randomization schedule (run 1), in a double-blind manner. After taking the drug, the subject was asked to sit upright on the chair for 2 h. Randall&#x02013;Selitto test was repeated 3 h after the drug administration and the readings were noted.

The results suggested that <italic>T. chebula</italic> could be a potential candidate for bioactivity-guided isolation of natural analgesic agents in the management of chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In another study by Nair <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] hydroalcoholic extract of <italic>T. chebula</italic> produced a significant inhibition of joint swelling compared to control in both formaldehyde-induced and complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis in mice. <italic>T. chebula</italic> treatment also reduced serum TNF-&#x003b1; level and synovial expression of TNF-R1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1&#x003b2; thereby exhibiting its therapeutic potential as a disease-modifying agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In a study by Ramani and Pradhan[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] acetone extract of fruits of <italic>T. chebula</italic> in doses of 160 and 320 mg/kg showed anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic effects as it decreased the paw edema significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) which was comparable to dexamethasone treated group. Also, in contrast to the traditional NSAIDs, which are reported to produce gastric ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding, <italic>T. chebula</italic> extract is reported to have gastro protective effect.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is limited published data on evaluation of the analgesic activity of <italic>T. chebula</italic> alone in human subjects. In the present study, we used Ugo basile analgesy meter for conducting Randal&#x02013;Selitto test as it is associated with good precision and smaller inter-individual and intra-individual variation of baseline effect. In the present study, aqueous extract of <italic>T. chebula</italic> 1000 mg given as single dose was well tolerated without producing any adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>T. chebula</italic> significantly increased pain threshold and pain tolerance force and time compared to placebo in healthy volunteers.
