Meta analysis indicates a 30&#x00025; (95&#x00025;CI: 20-39) protective efficacy in infants against clinical malaria <xref rid="pone.0023391-Aponte1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Studies conducted in older children living in areas where malaria transmission is highly seasonal have reported 67&#x00025; to 86&#x00025; reductions in clinical malaria <xref rid="pone.0023391-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0023391-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These initial trials were conducted in communities where the use of insecticide treated bednets (ITNs) was low. More recently, trials of IPT in children who were sleeping under a long lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN) showed a protective efficacy against clinical episodes of malaria of 70&#x00025; in Burkina Faso <xref rid="pone.0023391-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and 83&#x00025; Mali <xref rid="pone.0023391-Dicko2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, indicating that IPT provides substantial additional protection to that offered by ITNs.</p><p>Interventions which reduce exposure to malaria could interfere with the development of acquired immunity which could, in turn, lead to a shift of morbidity and mortality from malaria from younger to older age groups (&#x0201c;rebound effect&#x0201d;) <xref rid="pone.0023391-SnowRWOmumbo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Early studies in African children which employed chemoprophylaxis showed a significant increase in cases of clinical malaria when the intervention was stopped. In The Gambia, children who had received seasonal chemoprophylaxis from the age of three months to five years had a significant increase in clinical episodes of malaria in the year after chemoprophylaxis was stopped. No increase in mortality was observed but the trial was only large enough to have detected a substantial effect <xref rid="pone.0023391-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In Tanzania, administration of chemoprophylaxis during the first year of life led to a significant increase in the risk of malaria and anaemia during the second year of life <xref rid="pone.0023391-Menendez1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. By the age of five years the cumulative incidence of clinical attacks of malaria was similar in the intervention and control groups <xref rid="pone.0023391-Aponte2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>One of the rationales underlying the development of IPT as a malaria control tool is that by allowing some infections to occur between drug administrations, it is less likely than chemoprophylaxis to interfere with the development of naturally acquired immunity to malaria. Therefore, a number of studies have examined the malaria experience of infants in the year after they had received IPT (IPTi). In the initial study of IPTi undertaken in Tanzania <xref rid="pone.0023391-Schellenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the investigators found that, protection appeared to persist into the second year of life with a 35&#x00025; reduction in the incidence of clinical malaria in children who had previously received IPTi. However, a sustained protective effect has not been seen in subsequent studies. A suggestion of an increased risk of high density infections and of anaemia was found in two studies undertaken in Ghana <xref rid="pone.0023391-Chandramohan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023391-Mockenhaupt1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A meta analysis of all IPTi trials did not find clear evidence of an increase in the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria or of anaemia in the year following the intervention <xref rid="pone.0023391-Aponte1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Only limited information is available as to whether administration of IPT to older children is associated with an increased risk of malaria in the period following the intervention. No overall increase in risk was observed in Senegal and Mali <xref rid="pone.0023391-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023391-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> with incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 0.98 (95&#x00025;CI: 0.82&#x02013;1.17) and 1.07 (95&#x00025;CI: 0.90&#x02013;1.27) respectively. No significant overall increase (IRR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.38; 95&#x00025;CI: 0.98&#x02013;2.16; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.059) in the subsequent malaria transmission season was observed in Ghana in children who received AS&#x0002b;AQ monthly <xref rid="pone.0023391-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

Meetings were held with local health authorities and the communities to explain the objectives and methods of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from caregivers of children before enrolment into the trial and an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitored the trial.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study area and population</title><p>The study was conducted from August 2008 to November 2009 in Bouss&#x000e9; health district, in central Burkina Faso. Four villages (Laye, Niou, Sao and Toeghin) which each have a health centre were included. Malaria transmission in the study area is high and seasonal with most of the transmission occurring between July and October. Children aged 3&#x02013;59 months residing in the study villages were enrolled.

SP was given as single dose of 25 mg per kg of sulphadoxine plus 1.25 mg of pyrimethamine and AQ was given for 3 days as a daily dose of 10 mg per kg. Three rounds of IPTc were given starting in August 2008 with a one-month interval between treatments. Details of the eligibility, randomisation and intervention procedures have been presented elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0023391-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The intervention ended after the third course of IPT but children were followed up to the end of the subsequent malaria transmission season. The main outcome measure of the study reported in this paper is the incidence of malaria in the malaria transmission season after cessation of the intervention (2009).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Surveillance of malaria episodes</title><p>Passive surveillance for malaria episodes was set up from the day of administration of the first dose of IPT in July 2008 until the end of November 2009. Briefly, caregivers were advised to bring their children to the village health centre at anytime if they were sick. Clinical examination was performed by a nurse. Caregivers were asked if the child had had fever in the previous 24 hours, axillary temperature was measured and signs and symptoms of illness were recorded. A rapid malaria diagnosis test (RDT) was performed and thick and thin blood films were prepared if a child had fever or a history of fever.</p><p>Children with a positive RDT who were thought to have uncomplicated malaria were treated with artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS&#x0002b;AQ) or artemether lumethantrine (Coartem&#x000ae;) at the health centre. If a child had signs or symptoms of severe malaria, treatment with quinine was provided and, when required, the child was referred to the district hospital in keeping with local guidelines. Children with an illness other than malaria were given appropriate treatment free of charge. Hospital admissions due to malaria and other causes were recorded and children's condition was monitored until release from the health centre.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Monitoring of malaria infection, anaemia and nutrition</title><p>From July 2009 to November 2009, weekly home visits were made to monitor the prevalence of malaria infection. Each week, 150 children per treatment arm were randomly selected for a home visit. A history of fever in the previous 24 hours was recorded, axillary temperature was measured and thin and thick blood films were prepared for all children. During home visits, caregivers of children were asked if the LLIN allocated to the child was still in the house and whether the child had slept under the net the previous night.</p><p>At the end of the 2009 malaria transmission season, we performed a cross-sectional survey of all children from the original trial who were available. Children had a clinical examination performed by study medical staff. Caregivers were asked if their child had fever within the previous 24 hours and axillary temperature was measured. Thick and thin blood films and filter paper blood spots were prepared and haemoglobin concentration was measured. Children's weight and height were recorded.</p><p>During these surveys, a rapid malaria diagnostic test (RDT) was performed on the spot if a child had fever or a history of fever. If the RDT test was positive and the child was suspected of having uncomplicated malaria, s/he was referred to health centre for appropriate treatment with AS&#x0002b;AQ or Coartem&#x000ae;. Children with severe malaria or an illness other than malaria were treated as described in the previous section.

The parasite count was measured against 200 white blood cells (WBC) and converted to a parasite density per &#x000b5;l assuming that 1 &#x000b5;L of blood contains 8000 WBC per &#x000b5;L. In the event of a discrepancy between the two readers, the slide was re-examined by a third laboratory technician. The arithmetic mean of the 2 readings was used as the final parasite density if there was agreement between two of readers. If there was no agreement after the third reading, the arithmetic mean of the three parasite densities was used.</p><p>Haemoglobin concentration was determined using a Hemocue&#x000ae; 321 (Hemocue AB, Angelholm, Sweden) as described previously <xref rid="pone.0023391-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size and power</title><p>The sample size for the first phase of the study was set to detect a 20&#x00025; reduction in the incidence of clinical malaria and a 50&#x00025; reduction in the incidence of admissions to hospital for severe malaria in children who had received intermittent preventive treatment. Details regarding sample size calculation for the main study have been published elsewhere (Konat&#x000e9; et al., 2010). Based on the requirements set out above, at least 1500 children were needed per treatment arm for the study to have a 90&#x00025; power to detect reductions in the endpoint mentioned above. Thus, 1509 and 1505 children were enrolled and randomized to receive SP&#x0002b;AQ or placebos respectively. It was anticipated that there would be a 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of loss to follow-up in the second year. Therefore, it was estimated that with this sample size, the study would have greater than 90&#x00025; power to detect a 20&#x00025; increase in the incidence of clinical malaria and greater than 90&#x00025; power to detect a 20&#x00025; increase in parasite prevalence in subsequent high malaria transmission season post intervention in children who received IPT with SP&#x0002b;AQ.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data handling and analysis</title><p>Data entry was performed by two independent data clerks using Microsoft ACCESS and analyses were performed using STATA version 11 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stata.com">www.stata.com</ext-link>). The intervention period was defined as the period from the first dose of IPT administration to the end of November 2008 (42 days after the third dose of IPT). The post intervention high malaria transmission period was defined as the period from July to November 2009 and the whole post intervention period was defined as the period from December 2008 to November 2009, which included the low malaria transmission season dry season (December 2008 to June 2009). Children were grouped in two age categories for adjusted analyses: children aged 3 to 23 months and children aged 24 to 59 months at the start of the intervention in August 2008.</p><p>Details of statistical procedures used in the study have been published previously <xref rid="pone.0023391-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Briefly, an episode of clinical malaria was defined as fever or a history of fever in the previous 24 hours together with the presence of at least 5000 asexual forms of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> per &#x000b5;l and the absence of any other obvious cause of fever. WHO's standard definition was used for severe malaria <xref rid="pone.0023391-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A child was not considered at risk for 21 days if he/she had experienced an episode of malaria and had been treated with an anti-malarial. The incidence of malaria was estimated as the number of malaria episodes divided by a child's time at risk. Incidence rates of malaria in children who had received IPTc or placebos during the intervention period were compared using Cox regression models. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were adjusted for age (used as categorical variable), sex and village. Confidence intervals around IRRs were calculated using robust standards errors to account for children who experienced multiple episodes.</p><p>Crude and adjusted IRRs for all-cause and malaria-specific hospital admissions were also estimated using a Cox regression model as described above. Prevalence ratios (RRs) of malaria infection, anaemia (Hb&#x0003c;11 g/dL) and moderately severe anaemia (Hb&#x0003c;8 g/dL) were estimated using a generalized linear model. Parasite density and Hb concentrations were compared using Student's t-test.</p><p>Anthropometric data were analysed as described previously <xref rid="pone.0023391-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Z-scores for weight-for-age (WAZ; underweight), height-for-age (HAZ; stunting) and weight-for- height (WHZ; wasting) were determined using the WHO child growth standard <xref rid="pone.0023391-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Wasting, stunting and underweight were defined as z-scores&#x0003c;-2 for the relevant indicator. A generalized linear model was fitted with age, sex and village as covariates to estimate PRs for wasting, stunting and underweight among children who had received IPTc compared with those who had received placebos the previous year.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Characteristic of children at the start of the post intervention high transmission season</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the 1509 and 1505 children randomized at the beginning of the trial to receive IPTc or placebos are reported elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0023391-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. At the beginning of the post-intervention malaria transmission season (July 2009), 1416 (93.8&#x00025;) children from the former intervention arm were available for follow up compared with 1399 (93.0&#x00025;) children in the former control arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023391-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Six of the 93 (6.2&#x00025;) children from the former intervention arm who were not available for follow up had died and 87 had migrated out of the study area. The comparable figures for the 106 children (7.0&#x00025;) who had previously received placebos were 11 and 94 respectively; one child who was allergic to SP&#x0002b;AQ was excluded from the follow-up study. The mean age of children at the start of post-intervention follow up period was 45.9 months (95&#x00025;CI 45.3&#x02013;46.5). The age and sex of children in the two study arms were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023391-t001">Table 1</xref>) as was the distribution of children by village. The proportions of children who were reported to have slept under a LLIN during weekly home visits were similar between children who had received IPTc previously and children who had received placebos (93.1&#x00025; versus 93.3&#x00025;).

Our study did not demonstrate persisting protection in younger children during the high malaria transmission period post intervention as was the case in Senegal <xref rid="pone.0023391-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The small excess of clinical malaria in the post intervention period in children in the former intervention arm was not accompanied by an increase in all-cause hospital admissions or hospital admissions due to malaria. However, our study was not powered to detect a rebound effect in hospital admission, and caution is required in the interpretation of these results.</p><p>Children who had received IPTc during the previous year were not at increased risk of harbouring a malaria infection at the end of the subsequent malaria transmission season nor did they have a higher prevalence of malaria infection during weekly surveys, despite their slightly increased susceptibility to clinical malaria. Although children who had received IPT in 2008 appeared to have lower prevalence of malaria infection in the subsequent malaria transmission season than control children, they had a reduced ability to control parasite density which is important for the development of clinical malaria, and may partially explain the slight increase in clinical malaria. Similar findings have been observed previously in children <xref rid="pone.0023391-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023391-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and infants <xref rid="pone.0023391-Schellenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> who have received IPT. High parasitaemia is an important risk factor for malaria anaemia. However, in this study, children who had received IPTc were not at an increased risk of anaemia or moderately severe anemia at the end of the subsequent malaria transmission season. This finding is consistent with previous reports on from Senegal <xref rid="pone.0023391-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and Ghana <xref rid="pone.0023391-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023391-Tagbor1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>A limitation of this study, and previous studies that examined the role of IPTc in causing rebound malaria morbidity, is that the intervention was given during only one malaria transmission season. This may not be sufficient to significantly impair the acquisition of immunity and induce a large increase in malaria morbidity. In addition, most of these children enrolled in the studies undertaken so far had experienced significant exposure to malaria infection prior to the intervention and may, therefore, have developed some level of immunity to malaria before receiving IPTc which may have been sufficient to counterbalance the potential negative effects of reduced exposure to malaria on malaria morbidity in the subsequent transmission season. If IPTc is to be deployed on a major scale and given annually for the first few years of a child's life, it will be essential that the impact of several years of IPTc on the development of immunity to malaria is investigated carefully.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0023391.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0023391.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0023391.s002"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Protocol amendment</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0023391.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0023391.s003"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Consort Checklist</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0023391.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0023391.s004"><label>Ethics S1</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0023391.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the study population, the Bouss&#x000e9; District Health Officer and the district health staff, the CNRFP research personnel for their efforts in the implementation of the trial.
