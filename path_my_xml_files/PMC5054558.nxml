There are no sufficient randomised prospective controlled trials in the paediatric population comparing the safety and tolerance of early feeding (3&#x000a0;h) after PEG placement. In order to reduce the period of fasting, inadequate nutritional support, and hospitalisation time, we decided to devise this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is a multicentre, randomised, open-label trial designed to evaluate the tolerance and safety of early enteral nutrition after PEG placement in children. Patients are randomised to receive the first feeding bolus with a polymeric diet (1&#x000a0;kcal/ml) via a feeding tube 3&#x000a0;h after the PEG placement (group I - early enteral feeding) or 8&#x000a0;h after the procedure (group II - late enteral feeding). The key objective of the study is to compare the tolerance and safety of the early- and late-feeding modes after PEG placement in children. The primary endpoint is the number of patients who will achieve full feed (total fluid and caloric requirements) within 48&#x000a0;h of the first feeding bolus. The secondary endpoints are: the number of early and late complications, the duration of hospitalisation after PEG placement, gastric residuals (ml) total in the period up to 48&#x000a0;h since the first feeding bolus.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge this is the first study in paediatric patients to evaluate the tolerance and safety of early enteral nutrition after PEG placement.

Although the benefits and techniques for the insertion of PEG have been described and accepted, feeding after PEG placement is not as clear. Traditionally, tube feedings have been delayed after PEG placement to the next day and up to 24&#x000a0;h postprocedure. This decision is based on a standard convention, extrapolated from surgical guidelines, with little data to support the withholding of feedings after PEG placement. Over the past 15&#x000a0;years, many studies have examined the use of early PEG feedings after insertion. Results from various randomised controlled trials (RCTs), mostly in adults, indicate that earlier feeding might be an option. In some adult centres, it is reported that the procedure can be performed in the morning and the patient discharged the same day. Despite the recent literature indicating early PEG feedings as a safe alternative, the common practice continues to be to significantly delay post-PEG feedings. It is essential, especially in children, to reduce to a minimum fasting time and begin to improve nutritional status as soon as possible. In view of the financial pressures on the healthcare system, the economic aspect is also essential. A short stay in hospital can be beneficial for both the medical centre and the child, and it could result in reducing the overall cost of the procedure.</p><p>There are only a few studies on the safety of early feeding after PEG placement in paediatric patients. The recent prospective randomised study with the earliest feeding in children after PEG placement is by Corkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Forty successive patients who met the entry criteria were enrolled, with 20 in each group, and they found no increase in complications with the earliest feeding (3&#x000a0;h after PEG insertion).</p><p>Our study will include a relatively large group of patients (100, 50 in each group), and the observation will last 12&#x000a0;months, which is longer than in other studies. First of all we would like to determine whether earlier initiation of feeds (3&#x000a0;h after PEG placement) is as effective and well tolerated as the current standard practice (8&#x000a0;h) and result in shortening the length of stay in hospital after PEG implantation. Both the objectives of the study and the primary, secondary and tertiary endpoints, are described in detail below. The goal is to establish an optimum standard procedure in the group of paediatric patients qualified for PEG insertion procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a multicentre, randomised, open label trial designed to evaluate the tolerance and safety of early enteral nutrition after PEG placement in children.

Subjects will be screened to ensure they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The patients and their caregivers will give their written informed consent before the start of any procedure. All subjects will undergo a radiological examination of upper gastrointestinal tract at screening. 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring/Multi-Channel Intraluminal Impedance and pH Measurement will be obtained at screening and after 10&#x02013;12 months. A qualified physician will interpret the study results. Vital Signs-blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature-will be monitored during hospitalisations. All measurements will be recorded in metric units when applicable. A physical examination, including weight and height, will be performed at each visit. Abnormalities noted will be evaluated and documented by the investigator as to whether they are complications. Oropharyngeal flora will be determined before PEG insertion at screening in all subjects. The microbiological flora will be examined in the event of wound infection in all subjects. Samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests. Clinical laboratory tests are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. All abnormal laboratory test results that are considered clinically significant by the investigator will be followed up to a satisfactory resolution. Plasma ghrelin, lepitin and adiponectin levels will be measured in all subjects after 72&#x000a0;h of enteral nutritional feeding (two measurements-fasting and 2&#x000a0;h after feeding). Test for faecal calprotectin level will be made in all subjects at screening. In all subjects the serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA) and total IgA serum level will be measured for celiac-disease screening. Anthropometric parameters-height, weight, BMI, arm circumference, triceps skinfold and mean length of forearm-will be controlled during the study. Dietary consultation will be performed at screening and at control visits planned during the study. Complications will be monitored throughout the entire study period. Data on all study participants will be included in the safety analyses. At each visit, data about complications will be documented and blood samples will be obtained for laboratory evaluation. Any withdrawals from the study due to complications will be recorded in the study documentation. To evaluate parental/caregiver degree of satisfaction with the gastrostomy feeding the structured Satisfaction Questionnaire with Gastrostomy Feeding, the <italic>SAGA-8</italic> questionnaire, will be used 6&#x000a0;months after the PEG implantation. To investigate the influence of PEG placement on the family quality of life at Baseline Visit and 12&#x000a0;months after PEG implantation the validated <italic>Family Quality of Life Questionnaire</italic> ver. 2006 will be used.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Clinical laboratory tests</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Hematology</th><th>Clinical Chemistry</th><th>Coagulation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hematocrit<break/>Hemoglobin<break/>Glycated hemoglobin<break/>Red Blood Cell (RBC) count<break/>White Blood Cell (WBC) count<break/>Neutrophils<break/>Bands<break/>Lymphocytes<break/>Monocytes<break/>Basophils<break/>Eosinophils<break/>Platelet count</td><td>Creatinine<break/>Urea<break/>Total protein<break/>Albumin<break/>Glucose<break/>Aspartate transaminze (AST)<break/>Alanine transaminaze (ALT)<break/>Sodium<break/>Potassium<break/>Calcium<break/>Zinc<break/>Iron<break/>Magnesium<break/>Selenium<break/>Ferritin<break/>C Reactive Protein<break/>Vitamin D &#x02013; 25(OH)D3<break/>Vitamin A<break/>Vitamin E<break/>Vitamin B 12<break/>Ac folicum</td><td>Prothrombin time (PT/Quick)<break/>international normalized ratio (INR) activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

PEG has become the preferred method for providing long-term enteral nutrition in children with insufficient oral intake. The optimal timing for gastrostomy placement remains uncertain; it varies between 2 and 12&#x000a0;weeks of enteral feeding depending on recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to the current ESPGHAN recommendations the anticipated duration of enteral nutrition exceeding 4&#x02013;6 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] is an indication for gastrostomy and it can be prolonged in many cases. Before PEG placement each case should be considered on its own merits. the advantages and disadvantages must be assessed by a multidisciplinary nutrition-support team, taking into account clinical condition, diagnosis, prognosis, ethical issues, patients&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; expectations and expected effect on the quality of the child&#x02019;s life. In general, PEG can be used as a means of exclusive or supplemental enteral tube feeding, gastric decompression and/or the administration of medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It can significantly reduce feeding time, improve nutritional status and growth, and also the social functioning or quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The range of indications for PEG tube use is wide and has been demonstrated in children with neurodisability, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, neonatal pulmonary disease, oncological disorders, metabolic disease, genetic-chromosomal and degenerative disease, Crohn&#x02019;s disease and chronic renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The former indication for PEG placement is dysphagia associated with neurological or neuromuscular disorders, especially cerebral palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The appropriate time to initiate enteral nutrition after the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube has been an area of limited research. Historically, data to guide decisions regarding the initiation of feedings has been extrapolated from surgical experience with gastrostomy tubes. The recommended time for the resumption of feeding in adults and children is inconsistent, and varies from 1 to 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There are few published trials in the literature to guide post-PEG feeding decisions. Choudhry et al. prospectively analysed 41 subjects in a randomised controlled fashion to early (after 3&#x000a0;h) versus delayed feedings (after 24&#x000a0;h) after PEG placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Two subjects in the early intervention group versus one subject in the late intervention group had feedings held due to significant gastric residuals (arbitrarily defined significant gastric residual volumes as 60&#x000a0;mL). Complication rates and mortality data were similar among the groups. Stein et al. prospectively enrolled 80 patients in a randomised controlled trial comparing immediate feeding within one hour after PEG placement versus feeding after 24&#x000a0;h in intensive care and intermediate unit patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Gastric residual volumes were measured as the primary endpoint. Residual volumes were similar between groups on days 1 and 3. Complication rates and mortality rates were similar between groups. Brown et al. prospectively enrolled 57 patients in a controlled randomised trial comparing early (within 3&#x000a0;h) versus a delayed (next-day) feeding regimen post PEG-placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. All patients tolerated the feeding regimen without complication. Chumley et al. describes in abstract form a prospective randomised controlled study of 150 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Three groups were compared. Groups 1 and 2 were fed early (Group 1, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50 &#x02014; fed at 3&#x000a0;h; Group 2, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50 &#x02014; fed at 6&#x000a0;h). Delayed feedings took place after 24&#x000a0;h. Only one patient in the 3-h group developed increased gastric residuals (volume not defined). McCarter et al. prospectively studied 112 patients in a controlled randomised fashion comparing early feedings (4&#x000a0;h) versus delayed feeding (24&#x000a0;h) after PEG placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Twenty five percent of the early feeding group had a high gastric residual on day 1 compared to 9&#x000a0;% in the delayed feeding group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.029). By day two, there was not a statistically significant difference in gastric residuals between the groups. One patient in the study died of aspiration pneumonia (delayed-feeding group). Minor complications were similar between the groups. In 2008 Bechtold et al. performed meta-analysis and only RCTs on adult subjects that compared early (&#x02264;4&#x000a0;h) versus delayed or next-day feedings after PEG placement were included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Authors concluded that early feeding can represent a safe alternative to delayed or next-day feedings. Although an increase in significant gastric residual volumes at day 1 was noted, overall complications were not affected. Szary et al. in 2011 in their meta-analysis demonstrated that feeding initiated 3&#x000a0;h after PEG placement in adult patients is safe and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. By initiating feeding earlier after PEG placement, many patients can avoid acute care hospital stays, unnecessarily prolonged intravenous access and medications and receive earlier substantial nutrition. The study evaluating the safety of early (6&#x000a0;h) feeding in children after PEG placement (6&#x000a0;h) was performed by Werlin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This was an uncontrolled series of 24 paediatric patients, and they found no increase in the complication rate with the earlier feedings. The recent prospective randomised study with earliest feeding in children after PEG placement is by Corkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Forty successive patients who met the entry criteria were enrolled, with 20 in each group. The authors compared the tolerance of feedings at 3 and 6&#x000a0;h after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. The change in abdominal girth before and 1&#x000a0;h after the initial feeding, any vomiting, and the gastric residual volume before the next feeding. were recorded and the length of stay was also documented. They found no increase in complications with the earliest feeding (3&#x000a0;h after PEG insertion).</p><p>Concluding, there aren&#x02019;t sufficient randomised prospective controlled trials in the paediatric population comparing the safety and tolerance of early feeding after PEG placement (3&#x02013;4 h). Most patients are fasted for at least 12&#x000a0;h following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. In order to decrease the period of fasting, inadequate nutritional support, and hospitalisation time, we decided to design this study. The additional goal is to establish an optimum standard procedure in the group of paediatric patients qualified for PEG insertion procedure in Poland.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Study sponsored by grant No. RG 1/2014 obtained from the NUTRICIA Foundation.
