This is usually hampered by imperfect fracture classification systems, which are frequently further undermined by poor inter-observer agreement. The latter is even more problematic for multicentre trials. This article focuses on the practicalities of defining the fracture population within a pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment of adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.</p><p>The proximal fracture of the humerus evaluation by Randomisation (PROFHER) trial recruited 250 adults from the orthopaedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) of 32 acute care NHS hospitals in the United Kingdom between September 2008 and April 2011. The results of the trial do not support the trend of increased surgery for patients with these fractures.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Formal fracture classification in PROFHER was based on the commonly used Neer classification.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Central to this classification are the relative positions of the four main segments of the proximal humerus: the humeral head, the greater tuberosity, the lesser tuberosity and the humeral shaft. Although these may be delineated by fracture lines, a segment is only considered a &#x02018;part&#x02019; if there is displacement of &#x0003e; 1 cm or 45&#x000b0; angulation. A &#x02018;minimally displaced&#x02019; fracture, often referred to as a one-part fracture, occurs when the displacement criteria are not met for any of the four segments. Two-part, three-part and four-part fractures involve the relative displacement of two, three or all four segments, respectively. Other Neer categories involve fractures associated with an anterior or posterior humeral head dislocation and fractures involving the articular surface of the humeral head. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1">Figure 1</xref><sup><xref rid="bibr4-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> shows the Neer classification,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> with numbering of the 16 categories by Sidor et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Neer classification for proximal humeral fractures.

In all trial information, the study eligibility criteria were expressed in terms of the Neer classification and the displacement criteria stated. However, in keeping with normal practice in busy fracture clinics, there was no expectation that the recruiting surgeons would classify the fractures and thus judge whether or not displaced parts met the Neer criteria. Instead, surgeons were asked to indicate on the eligibility form if the fracture involved either tuberosity.</p><p>Anonymised electronic versions of baseline radiographs, identified only via the patient&#x02019;s unique four-digit trial number used in the assessment of trial eligibility for each randomised patient, were sent on CDs to the York Trials Unit (YTU). Early on, we found several sites could not send us Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) images. Therefore, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) files were requested, preferably with a resolution of 300 dpi, as these could be provided by all hospitals and can also be read easily on all computer platforms.</p><p>Initial processing of the radiographic images involved checks on anonymisation, correct labelling and ensuring that the images could be accessed and transferred electronically. For blinding purposes, the sets of radiographs were renumbered using a three-digit code, with letters used to label each of the radiographs within a set (e.g., 038a, 038b).</p></sec><sec id="section11-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1"><title>Preparations for the independent Neer classification</title><p>Preparations for the independent assessment and classification of trial baseline radiographs based on the Neer classification comprised an interim quality assessment of the radiographs; information gathering; removal of excess baseline radiographs; developing a protocol, training presentation and data collection tool (proforma); and testing these in a pilot study.</p><p>A protocol-specified monitoring and audit process was established to check for clear breaches of the main inclusion criterion (i.e., fractures should involve the surgical neck) and to assess the quality of the copies of the radiographic images available for each patient in terms of the suitability for fracture classification. Initially, the audit involved two consultant shoulder surgeons (AR and JJC-C), each of whom independently assessed the first five sets of images from each participating centre. Assessment was carried out for subsequent participants from each centre by one surgeon only (AR). The quality of the images was assessed according to three criteria: at least two projections in planes perpendicular to each other; proximal humeral and glenohumeral joint visible on each projection; and across all views, the shaft, greater tuberosity, lesser tuberosity, head of the humerus, and the glenohumeral joint could be identified. A failure to meet at least one criterion was considered an indication of potential difficulty for the Neer classification. A third surgeon acted as an arbiter to resolve disagreement at the final stage of the audit.</p><p>Information gathering included a review of the rater reliability studies on the Neer classification, with a particular focus on the approaches taken for assessing displacement and training. After trial recruitment, a postal survey was also sent to the radiographers representing the 33 participating hospitals that had screened patients for eligibility. This was done to obtain their specialist feedback on the imaging relating to fractures of the proximal humerus. The survey included questions on recommended views, assessing image quality, provision of specialist reports for use at fracture clinics, perceived difficulties in the interpretation of radiographs and the routine use of CT scans. Responses were received from 26 radiographers (79%).</p><p>An in-depth discussion with one radiographer at the lead site revealed that the accurate measurement of linear and angular displacement of bony parts using plain radiographs alone is unrealistic. The following was established: without the use of a calibration object, such as a scaling ball placed in an appropriate location at image acquisition, accurate measurement of scale is not possible. An approximation of scale is provided via picture archiving and communications systems (PACS), although the inbuilt scale is lost when patient details are removed upon anonymising the images. The problem is worse where there has been image manipulation, such as enlargement, prior to file closure. Thus, assessing linear displacement is more challenging when there are anonymised copies of radiographs. One suboptimal approach of limited applicability to assist the assessment of linear displacement is present in those radiographs where standard left/right markers (added to the cassette at image acquisition) are used, as the stems of the &#x02018;L&#x02019; and &#x02018;R&#x02019; are 9 mm. Judging angular displacement is also problematic as it depends on image orientation and the clear delineation of the edges of the bone parts.</p><p>Rather than use illustrations from Neer&#x02019;s original articles<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> for training purposes as undertaken by Brorson et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> actual PROFHER trial images were used for facilitating the rater training. This decision ensured continuity in the images available for the decision-making process &#x02013; from those seen by the recruiting surgeon to those seen by the independent assessor. Similarly, in keeping with the trial&#x02019;s pragmatic design, we recruited two independent United Kingdom-based consultant orthopaedic surgeons who were experienced in treating fractures of the proximal humerus and who had experience comparable with that of surgeons in the PROFHER trial. From the literature and our experience, it was clear that involving more raters would not improve agreement.</p><p>The number of radiographs received for each trial participant ranged from two to seven. A maximum of four images per set of radiographs was arranged for the Neer classification.

The approach taken and methods used accommodate the known limitations of the Neer classification system and maximise external validity (applicability of trial findings) and accuracy in the formal definition of the fracture population. The key product is the description of the study fracture population according to the Neer classification.</p><p>Both the intended and actual fracture population represent the collective and individual uncertainty as to whether surgery provided a better outcome for patients with these fractures. Both raters independently confirmed that all patients had sustained injuries typically considered for surgery in contemporaneous practice. Although a very few fractures of the surgical neck were &#x02018;minimally displaced&#x02019;, the actual distribution tended more towards complex fractures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1">Table VI</xref>). Indeed, there were proportionally more fractures without tuberosity fractures amongst those that were ineligible than in the trial population: 40.2% <italic>versus</italic> 22.8%.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Notably, the Neer classification resulted in just 11 four-part fractures (4.4%), but 64 fractures (25.6%) were recorded as involving both tuberosities on the trial eligibility forms. This disparity may be explained in part by the observation in a study by Brorson et al<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> that there is substantial confusion as to whether all involved segments for three- and four-part fractures should be displaced according to Neer&#x02019;s definition. Additionally, lesser tuberosity displacement is harder to gauge, perhaps contributing to the 10.4% disagreement between the two raters for these fractures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1">Table IV</xref>).</p><p>Although the agreement between the assessments (tuberosity involvement at baseline <italic>versus</italic> Neer parts) was only fair, good balance was maintained between groups in the Neer categories. Moreover, this disparity did not result in any important changes to the findings of the fracture subgroup analyses based on either grouping for the primary outcome, the Oxford Shoulder Score.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Neither subgroup analysis supported differentiating treatment (use of surgery) on the basis of these characteristics.</p><p>Insights from the hospital radiographer&#x02019;s survey and other sources point to the assessment of the fracture in terms of suitability for surgery in PROFHER being equivalent to that in the practice employed in the United Kingdom. This includes the availability of generally two views rather than the full trauma series, the assessment being undertaken by the surgeon using images of plain radiographs, and CT scans rarely being used. The latter is no drawback;<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> even sophisticated physical models of fractures do not improve inter-observer agreement among shoulder specialists.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Crucially, although the four-part aspect of the Neer classification was used in assessing eligibility, there was no expectation of a rigorous application of the Neer displacement criteria. This too is likely to reflect clinical practice, in which judgements are often made with incomplete evidence and with suboptimal images. Considerations of image quality also relate to our decision to obtain JPEG files rather than DICOM files. This reflected the practicalities of obtaining a standardised set of portable images at the time, even if it was at the expense of loss of resolution. In the event, all images could be classified, and thus compressing the images to JPEG files for ease of use proved practical and effective.</p><p>The lack of a calibration object is especially noteworthy when an exact linear threshold is to be met. Yet, as confirmed by Neer, his displacement criteria are arbitrary,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and introduced in response to a stipulation by the journal editor prior to publication in the <italic>JBJS [Am]</italic>.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is evidence that surgeons agree more on treatment options (conservative treatment, locking plate fixation, hemiarthroplasty) than on fracture classification.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Lastly, we cannot rule out that some surgeons may consider other fracture characteristics, such as varus/valgus positioning of the head segment, not explicitly covered in the Neer classification. Nonetheless, we confirmed that fractures with these characteristics were present in the study population.</p><p>The involvement of two independent raters helped us to obtain as good a summary of the fractures characterised according to Neer as was feasible, and thus fulfil a key reporting requirement. As expected, there was disparity between how fractures were assessed during busy clinical practice for tuberosity involvement compared with the independent Neer classification. This did not, however, affect the relative distributions between treatment groups with respect to fracture type. Nor did the fracture classification at baseline <italic>versus</italic> the Neer classification influence the effect of treatment on the primary patient outcome. This has endorsed the pragmatic approach we took to classify fractures realistically when screening for patient eligibility during clinical practice. These insights are likely to apply to other fracture classifications, including those with displacement thresholds, which typically have similar problems of poor inter-observer agreement. The process we have described in this article should help mitigate these difficulties and provide an important guide for researchers designing pragmatic multicentre clinical trials on fracture management. Finally, we note that our key underlying philosophy reflected normal clinical practice, where emphasis on the surgeon&#x02019;s judgement, rather than observation of exacting fracture classification criteria, was used for recruitment. This approach tallies with the aforementioned findings of Brorson et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2046-3758.510.BJR-2016-0132.R1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Similar research to identify the basis for surgeons&#x02019; decisions in the treatment of other fractures is also likely to provide valuable insights.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Mr B.
