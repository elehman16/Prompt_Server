<list list-type="order" id="L2"><list-item><p id="P17">Skills training and self-monitoring texts with personalized feedback.

To increase intervention fidelity, calls were scripted and audiotaped; 10% were reviewed at research meetings, with discussion and role-play retraining as needed. A web application was used for note taking and storage of process data (e.g., date/time of call, call attempts, disposition).</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Implementation</title><p id="P20">Our intervention was designed to be an adjunct to clinical care, not formally integrated within it, as data suggest that healthcare providers consider weight control a lower priority than other clinical needs.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This design, coupled with the use of technology to deliver content, was chosen for its potential ease of widespread dissemination.</p><p id="P21">Participants randomized to the intervention were oriented to the program at their baseline visit from the health coach, who provided an overview of the behavior change goals, explained the intervention components, and reviewed the schedule with participants.

We calculated total gestational weight gain as the difference between last measured weight recorded before delivery and first measured weight in early pregnancy, both extracted from clinical prenatal care records. Similar to other studies among pregnant women, we chose to use participants&#x02019; earliest measured weight as the proxy for maternal weight at conception because measured maternal pre-pregnancy weight is seldom available, self-reported pre-pregnancy weight varies by BMI and sociodemographic factors, and the total weight gain in the first trimester is small (0.5&#x02013;2 kg).<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> As described in a prior publication, we found systematic differences in pre-pregnancy weight recall by BMI; underestimation of pre-pregnancy weight was significantly greater among women with obesity.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Sixty-four participants (97%) had a first trimester measured weight available for this analysis (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation = 7.9 &#x000b1; 3.6 weeks&#x02019; gestation). For the remaining 2 mothers, we used their initial weight measured at 18 weeks&#x02019; gestation to calculate total gestational weight gain. Average gestational age of participants&#x02019; last measured weight was 0.7 weeks (range 0&#x02013;4) before delivery. Timing of weight measures did not significantly differ between treatment groups. We surveyed participants at study entry to collect data about demographics and again at 36 weeks&#x02019; gestation to assess treatment acceptability. Heights were measured by trained research staff with a stadiometer at study entry, used with participants&#x02019; earliest measured antenatal weight to calculate BMI. Neonatal weight outcomes (e.g., birth weight, small-for-gestational-age [SGA, birth weight less than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile], large-for-gestational-age [LGA, birth weight greater than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile]) and maternal obstetric outcomes (e.g., mode of delivery, gestational diabetes) were abstracted from inpatient hospital records after delivery. We also examined intervention engagement by calculating the number of self-monitoring response texts received, number of participant comments or &#x0201c;likes&#x0201d; to posts on Facebook, and number of coach calls completed. Treatment fidelity was measured by monitoring the number of coach calls attempted and number of weekly coach posts to Facebook.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P23">Based on the intent-to-treat principle, we analyzed data from all participants as originally randomized. Univariate analyses comparing baseline characteristics and outcome data between the intervention and usual care groups were performed for categorical variables using Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests in the case of expected cell frequencies of less than 5. We used t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables, depending on the distribution of the variable. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the effect of treatment group on the proportion of women who exceeded IOM gestational weight gain guidelines compared to those within and below the guidelines, controlling for early pregnancy BMI, parity, and maternal age. Women with miscarriages (n = 5) or elective termination (n = 1) were excluded from primary analyses; participants with preterm deliveries (&#x0003c; 37 weeks&#x02019; gestation, n = 4) were also excluded because IOM guidelines for pregnancy-related weight gains are based on full-term births. However, similar results were obtained with their inclusion, even after correcting for gestational age of final measurement. We used analysis of covariance to assess the effect of treatment group on total gestational weight gain, with adjustment for the same covariates along with length of gestation. We additionally used logistic regression analyses to examine group differences in neonatal and obstetric outcomes. Analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S17"><title>Results</title><p id="P24">The intervention and usual care groups did not differ significantly with respect to baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><sec id="S18"><title>Weight change during pregnancy</title><p id="P25">Participants assigned to the intervention group were significantly less likely to exceed IOM guidelines compared to usual care (37% vs. 66%, p = 0.033; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

The high rates of text message engagement signal that technology-based strategies can be effectively implemented in socioeconomically disadvantaged ethnic minority patient populations, populations that are increasingly &#x0201c;connected&#x0201d;.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, additional studies focusing on issues of implementation, dissemination, and cost are needed.</p><p id="P32">Our treatment approach focused exclusively on the modification of several simple and easily understood weight-related behaviors. Repeated conversations with mothers from our target population revealed that recommending strict caloric targets or specific diets were unappealing, due to the cognitive complexity and inherent resource assumptions (e.g., food access/availability, transportation, costs) associated with these strategies. Our intervention design, to be delivered via digital health platforms, offered a moderate to high intensity intervention with greater flexibility than repeated in-person visits for socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers &#x02013; mothers who have proven difficult to treat in prior studies.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Members of our team have tested a similar intervention approach (iOTA) in other populations of low-income ethnic minority adults with weight loss success.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Our reliance on coach calls to deliver support and additional skills was met with high satisfaction, despite the lack of association with weight control. Human support is associated with better behavior change outcomes in clinical trials,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> but whether this support needs to be in-person or can be remote for improving pregnancy outcomes is still up for debate.</p><p id="P33">While the intervention did not have adverse effects on obstetric or neonatal outcomes, we were not adequately powered to assure there were no group differences. A much larger sample would be required to examine outcomes such as SGA, LGA, and gestational diabetes. Our next step will be to determine the longer term effects of the intervention on 6-month and 1-year postpartum weights, following completion of a postpartum weight loss/weight maintenance phase.</p><p id="P34">The results of this study are encouraging; nonetheless, any conclusions drawn must be tempered by study limitations including the pilot nature and small sample size. We used clinic measured weights to calculate our primary outcome, and thus, cannot be certain these weights were collected with the same degree of quality (e.g., calibrated scales, no shoes) as weights collected by research staff. However, clinic staff were blind to randomization assignment, so any measurement bias would likely be non-differential across treatment groups. Additionally, Vesco and colleagues found the absolute agreement between research and prenatal clinic measured weights to be extremely high, providing strong support for exchangeability.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> We may have misclassified participants as adhering to IOM guidelines by using the first measured weight in early pregnancy rather than self-reported pre-pregnancy weights or estimated pre-pregnancy weights using mathematical models, as described in other publications.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Any misclassification, then again, should not differ between intervention and controls. Participant and coach activity on Facebook declined during the intervention making it difficult to fully appreciate Facebook&#x02019;s utility; future studies should test whether automating posts and/or establishing incentives for &#x0201c;likes&#x0201d; and comments leads to higher engagement. Further, our study design did not allow for isolation of the independent contribution of discrete intervention components, and thus, we were unable to determine which component attributed to the high degree of efficacy observed. While we suggested nutrient-rich foods as substitutions for obesogenic dietary behaviors, we did not perform a comprehensive assessment of diet to evaluate the quality of intervention participants&#x02019; food choices. Larger, ongoing trials as part of the Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms consortium may provide data that overcomes some of the limitations of this pilot study.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p id="P35">In summary, our findings show efficacy of a technology-based, behavioral intervention for controlling gestational weight gain in overweight or obese African American women. Whether minimizing excessive weight gain in pregnancy can successfully reduce disparities in obesity and improve child health among this high risk population is still unknown, but remains of great interest to further investigate.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><p id="P36"><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH K23 HL106231) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA R40MC26818) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
