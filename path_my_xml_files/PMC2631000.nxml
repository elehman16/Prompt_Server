Further, very few studies assessed the role of dietary composition on bone mass during weight cycling. The primary objective of this study was to determine if a diet high in amylase-resistant starch (RS<sub>2</sub>), which has been shown to increase absorption and balance of dietary minerals, can prevent or reduce loss of bone mass during weight cycling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 84, age = 20 weeks) were randomly assigned to one of 6 treatment groups with 14 rats per group using a 2 &#x000d7; 3 experimental design with 2 diets and 3 weight cycling protocols. Rats were fed calcium-deficient diets without RS<sub>2 </sub>(controls) or diets high in RS<sub>2 </sub>(18% by weight) throughout the 21-week study. The weight cycling protocols were weight maintenance/gain with no weight cycling, 1 round of weight cycling, or 2 rounds of weight cycling. After the rats were euthanized bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) of femur were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and concentrations of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, and zinc in femur and lumbar vertebrae were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Rats undergoing weight cycling had lower femur BMC (p &#x0003c; 0.05) and marginally lower BMD (p = 0.09) than rats not undergoing weight cycling.

Consistent with these findings, RS<sub>2</sub>-fed rats also had higher femur calcium (p &#x0003c; 0.05) and magnesium (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) concentrations.

Weight cycling is the repeated loss and regain of body weight, and occurs frequently in obese and overweight men and women in their attempts to lose weight and maintain a lower body weight. Weight cycling may also occur in men and women of normal body weight or in those with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. The goal of intentional weight loss is to reduce fat mass, but there is typically an accompanying unwanted loss of lean body mass, including bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although there is convincing evidence for a loss of bone mass with weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], there are only a few human studies on the relationship between weight cycling and bone mass or density. A small number of epidemiologic studies demonstrate that a history of weight cycling is associated with a reduction in bone mineral density or an increased risk of hip and other fractures in men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In one of these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], greater weight variability in a sample of about 20,000 women and 19,000 men was associated with relative risks of hip fracture of 2.07 for women and 2.70 for men. In another study of 169 premenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], weight cycling was associated with significant (p &#x0003c; 0.01) decreases in BMD at the lumbar spine and distal radius. In the above studies, the significant relationships between weight cycling and hip fracture or BMD persisted even after correction for body weight. In more recent studies, Sogaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] found that weight cycling in elderly Norwegian men was a risk factor for forearm fracture, and Bacon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] reported that chronic dieting in 30&#x02013;45 year old obese women was associated with low bone mass. In contrast other investigators found that weight cycling did not reduce bone mass in competitive athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and overweight, sedentary, premenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The varying results of the above and other human studies on the relationship between weight cycling and bone mass may be due to the many factors that cannot be adequately controlled in human studies, including subject diets, compliance with the study protocol, and patterns of weight loss. Furthermore, a history of weight cycling may define a subgroup of people at risk for bone loss due to other factors.</p><p>It is not known if dietary composition during weight cycling can influence bone mass, quality, and strength; specific diet components that may influence bone during weight cycling include vitamins D and K, calcium, magnesium, several essential trace minerals, and the resistant starches. Resistant starches (RS<sub>1</sub>, RS<sub>2</sub>, RS<sub>3</sub>, RS<sub>4 </sub>and RS<sub>5</sub>) are subgroups of fiber that occur naturally in foods or can be produced during food processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Total resistant starch is estimated to be about 10% (range = 2&#x02013;20%) of ingested starches in Western diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The resistant starches are not digested by mammalian enzymes in the mouth, stomach, or small intestine, but may be fermented in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Categorization of the five types of resistant starch is based on the factors that explain their resistance to degradation in the upper gastrointestinal tract. These factors include physical entrapment of the starch by the native cellular structure (RS<sub>1</sub>), the physical structure of the starch granules (RS<sub>2</sub>), or their chemical composition (RS<sub>3</sub>, RS<sub>4</sub>, and RS<sub>5</sub>) (8&#x02013;10). RS<sub>2 </sub>is the subtype most widely used commercially. We selected it for this investigation because a number of prior studies from other laboratories provide considerable evidence demonstrating that dietary RS<sub>2 </sub>improves absorption and balance of calcium, magnesium, and several trace minerals in experimental animals, particularly the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This study is based on the hypothesis that RS<sub>2</sub>, by reducing gastrointestinal loss of calcium, magnesium, and other bone minerals, may help to maintain bone mass subsequent to weight cycling.</p><p>Because of the difficulty of controlling the various factors that could influence the effects of weight cycling on bone mass in humans, we conducted a study in rats so that diet composition, weight cycling patterns, age, and other relevant variables could be tightly controlled. The primary objective of this investigation was to determine if a diet high in natural RS<sub>2 </sub>from high-amylose cornstarch (also termed "maize starch") can reduce or prevent loss of femur BMD and BMC subsequent to weight cycling in female rats. The female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat was chosen as the experimental model based on prior studies in our laboratories in this species; these studies suggest that the female SD rat is an appropriate model for the study of relationships between weight loss and bone composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A second goal was to analyze bone for other minerals and trace elements that are known or suspected to be required for optimal bone strength, specifically calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, and zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This was done to obtain insight into specific bone metals that may be involved in the effects of weight cycling and/or dietary resistant starch on bone. A third goal was to analyze selected non-calcified organs (liver and kidney) with high metabolic activity for the same metals in order to compare effects of weight cycling and dietary resistant starch on bone versus soft tissue minerals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Diet preparation</title><p>Diets were formulated and prepared by Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ. The composition of these diets is described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Carbohydrate in each diet is provided by waxy cornstarch, pregelatinized waxy cornstarch, and sucrose. A mixture of waxy cornstarch, pregelatinized waxy cornstarch, and sucrose was used for the control (normal) diets to provide a resistant-starch-free formulation capable of being formed into pellets. For the diets containing resistant starch, Hi-maize 260<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>starch (National Starch and Chemical Company, Bridgewater, NJ) was substituted for a portion of the waxy cornstarch (Amioca, 0% amylose). Hi-maize 260 starch, a hydrothermally-treated RS<sub>2 </sub>starch composed of 60% total dietary fiber as RS<sub>2</sub>-type granules, is derived from cornstarch high in amylose but is resistant to enzymatic degradation by amylase. A target of 18&#x02013;20% by weight of Hi-maize 260 starch was chosen because diets with a similar concentration of this component have been shown to improve retention of calcium, magnesium, and some trace minerals in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of calcium-deficient normal and resistant

each of the essential vitamins and trace minerals. To achieve this goal, 4 diet formulations were required, as described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The diets were formed into cylindrical pellets (22 mm &#x000d7; 12 mm in diameter) and colored with FD&#x00026;C dyes to provide a distinct color for each diet formulation and facilitate conduct of the study by allowing easy identification of each of the four diets. Diet NDWL (normal diet for weight loss) was formulated to have concentrations of AIN-76 salt mix, calcium phosphate, AIN-76A vitamin mix, and choline bitartrate that were 40% higher than Diet ND (normal <italic>ad lib </italic>diet). Similarly, Diet RSWL (resistant starch (RS<sub>2</sub>) weight loss diet) was formulated to have concentrations of AIN-76 salt mix, calcium phosphate, AIN-76A vitamin mix, and choline bitartrate that were 40% higher than Diet RS (resistant starch (RS<sub>2</sub>) <italic>ad lib </italic>diet). Diets ND and RS were fed except when rats were undergoing energy restriction to achieve weight loss; during energy restriction diets NDWL or RSWL were fed.</p><p>The target calcium concentration for Diets ND and RS was 1.0 mg of calcium per gram of diet (0.1% calcium by weight = 25 &#x003bc;mol/g), a concentration that is 20% of the calcium concentration of the standard AIN-76 diet, and can be considered to be moderately deficient for the rat. This approach was used because many younger adults and more than 50% of older adults living in the United States, including those who use calcium-containing antacids or supplements, consume diets that are considered to be inadequate in calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and thus may be at higher risk of loss of bone mass during weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Animal care and treatment</title><p>Female rats were chosen for this study because low BMD and BMC, as well as a higher risk of osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures, are more common in women than men, and because of our prior experience studying effects of weight loss on bone in women and female rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The number of rats chosen per treatment group (n = 14) exceeds the number per group (as few as 6) in prior studies conducted in our laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] that demonstrate significant loss of bone mass after weight loss. In addition we conducted a power analysis based on the effect of a projected 18% loss of body weight on bone density in the rat. Using conservative assumptions and data from our prior studies, the power analysis showed that with 12 rats per treatment group and alpha = 0.05, there is 90% power to detect a difference in BMD between treatment groups of 4.7% and 80% power to detect a difference of 4.0%. Thus, it was anticipated that 14 rats per group would provide adequate statistical power to detect treatment effects of moderate size on the major outcome variables of BMD and BMC even with attrition of as many as 2 rats per group.</p><p>Sexually mature female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC, n = 84, age = 20 weeks) were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups with 14 rats per group using a 2 &#x000d7; 3 experimental design with 2 diets and 3 weight cycling protocols. Because body weight is strongly associated with bone mass, rats were stratified by body weight prior to random assignment to one of the 6 treatment groups to ensure nearly identical initial mean body weights in each of the 6 groups. As anticipated, this approach to random assignment resulted in very similar mean body weights at randomization (281.2&#x02013;282.5 g) in each of the six treatment groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Rats were fed pelleted diets without RS<sub>2 </sub>(ND = normal diets, controls) or diets high in RS<sub>2 </sub>(17.9&#x02013;18.1%) throughout the study. The weight cycling protocols were: weight maintenance with no weight cycling (Groups ND0 and RSD0), 1 round of weight cycling (Groups ND1 and RSD1), or 2 rounds of weight cycling (Groups ND2 and RSD2).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Rat body weights</bold>.

Rats were then euthanized by decapitation after administration of additional anesthetic if necessary. Both femurs and the spinal column bones of the lumbar region were harvested. Other organs harvested from each rat were liver and kidney. Procedures used to harvest the organs have been used on many occasions in our laboratory and have been designed to minimize the potential of organ metal contamination during harvesting. For the right femur to be used for measurement of BMD and BMC, femurs were preserved by wetting them with 50% physiological saline (0.42%) solution and wrapping them in cotton gauze saturated with 50% saline prior to freezing.

Our target for diets moderately deficient in calcium for the rat was a concentration of 1.0 mg of calcium per gram of diet (25.0 &#x003bc;mol/g). Measured mean calcium concentrations for Diets ND and RS fed during periods of weight maintenance or weight gain were 1.09 mg/g (27.2 &#x003bc;mol/g) and 1.07 mg/g (26.7 &#x003bc;mol/g), and thus are within 10% of the target concentration. Calcium present in other food components besides the dibasic calcium phosphate used to add calcium to the diets likely contributed to the total calcium concentration of the diets. Diets NDWL and RSWL that were fed during periods of weight loss at 60% of ad lib were intended to have calcium concentrations that were 40% (1.40-fold) greater than Diets ND and RS; measured values were 51% and 42% greater, respectively.

Rats fed RS<sub>2 </sub>also had higher bone mass in the absence of weight cycling. Although the differences we found among treatment groups in BMD and BMC are small-to-moderate in magnitude (2.8&#x02013;18.2%), they are within the range of the decreases in BMD and BMC of about 10% that are associated in women with a substantially increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist, or spinal column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Although BMD and BMC for the total femur, distal femur, and femoral neck were consistently lower in rats undergoing weight cycling in comparison to those animals not losing weight, the differences were significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) only for BMC total. Because we measured BMD and BMC only after regain of body weight, larger reductions in BMD and BMC with weight loss may have been partially restored by the rapid regain of body weight prior to harvesting the femurs for determination of BMD and BMC.</p><p>In the current study rats fed the RS<sub>2 </sub>diet had significantly higher femur calcium and magnesium concentrations. We also found significant pairwise associations between femur BMD or BMC and femur calcium and magnesium concentrations. These data suggest that dietary RS<sub>2 </sub>may prevent loss of bone mass during weight cycling by enhancing absorption and retention of calcium and/or magnesium (as suggested by the Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> data for femur calcium and magnesium), but not the retention of copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. This result is consistent with the results of prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] showing that RS<sub>2 </sub>increases calcium and magnesium absorption; a potential mechanism for this effect is hypothesized to be the cecal wall hypertrophy and cecal acidification that RS<sub>2</sub>-induced fermentation produces in the large intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Lobo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have studied the effect of a diet containing 5% fructooligosaccharides (FOS) on intestinal absorption of calcium and magnesium, bone mineral density, and bone strength parameters in growing 4-week old male rats. Compared to controls, rats fed <italic>ad lib </italic>with FOS had a higher apparent absorption of calcium and magnesium, higher femur and tibia calcium concentrations, and increased femur peak load and yield load. Thus, our study and that of Lobo et al. suggest that specific dietary carbohydrates may have important roles in building and maintaining bone mass and strength during weight cycling or growth, and that the mechanism for this effect may be enhanced calcium and magnesium absorption and retention.</p><p>A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] used NHANES III data to estimate the mean intake of total resistant starch in the diets of USA residents age one year or older. The mean intake was 4.9 g/day, with a range of 3&#x02013;8 g/day. The major sources of resistant starch were breads (21%), cooked cereals and pasta (19%), vegetables other than legumes (19%), bananas/plantains (14%), and legumes (9%). Legumes contained the most resistant starch per serving, as much as 8 grams. Comparison of the above intakes for an adult to the RS<sub>2 </sub>dose administered to the rats in the current study suggests that higher intakes than those found for the above USA residents studied may be needed to effect short-term improvements in BMD and BMC. However, it is possible that long-term consumption of intakes at the high end of the range of 3&#x02013;8 g of total resistant starch daily may improve BMD and BMC.</p><p>In the current study 20-week old female rats were fed diets that were deficient in calcium but that contained levels of copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, and zinc that were near AIN-76 target values. Thus, the diets contained normal/adequate concentrations of the latter five essential metals that are considered to be important for bone health. The effects of RS<sub>2 </sub>on BMD and BMC might differ from the results found in the current study if the diets were adequate in calcium or deficient in copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, and/or zinc. The results might also differ if male rats or female rats of a different age were studied, because age and gender have substantial effects on BMD and BMC and on bone metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Weight cycling reduces bone mass. However, a diet high in RS<sub>2 </sub>can prevent or reduce loss of bone mass during weight cycling and may increase bone mass in the absence of weight cycling. The results provide the first evidence that a dietary component can help preserve BMD and BMC during weight cycling. If the above effects of dietary RS<sub>2 </sub>are found to apply to humans, then increased dietary RS<sub>2 </sub>may help to build and preserve BMD and BMC in men and women, especially during weight cycling.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Drs.
