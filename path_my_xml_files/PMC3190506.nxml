The concept of postoperative pain relief and its utilisation in the paediatric age group has improved dramatically over the recent years. Till date, various methods have evolved for providing post-op pain relief in paediatric population, nonetheless having some side effects which prohibit their use in children. For example, in children, narcotics could cause respiratory depression, oral analgesics cannot be given for some time after general anaesthesia due to the fear of vomiting and aspiration, and fear of needlestick in the case of parenteral analgesics.</p><p>The regional anaesthetic techniques significantly decrease the postoperative pain and systemic analgesic requirements. Caudal route is one of the simplest and safest techniques in paediatric surgery, with a high success rate. Caudal block is usually placed after the induction of general anaesthesia and is used as an adjunct to both intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in children undergoing surgical procedures below the level of the umbilicus. Caudal analgesia could reduce the amount of inhaled and intravenous (IV) anaesthetic administration, attenuate the stress response to surgery, facilitate a rapid, smooth recovery, and provide good immediate postoperative analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In order to decrease intra and postoperative analgesic requirements after single shot caudal epidural blockade, various additives, such as morphine, fentanyl, clonidine and ketamine, with local anaesthetics have been investigated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Ropivacaine, a long-acting amide local anaesthetic related structurally to bupivacaine, has been used for paediatric caudal anaesthesia. It provides pain relief with less motor blockade and is less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine, which makes it a more suitable agent for caudal epidural analgesia, especially following day care surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist having an eightfold greater affinity for &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors than clonidine and much less &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> effects. A major advantage of dexmedetomidine is its higher selectivity compared with clonidine for &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub> receptors which is responsible for the hypnotic and analgesic effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine to provide postoperative analgesia and also determine the other effects of dexmedetomidine when added to ropivacaine for caudal analgesia in children undergoing lower abdominal surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomised, prospective, parallel group, double-blinded study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Simple randomised sampling was done by lottery method.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sixty patients were studied.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>ASA I/II patients between 6 months and 6 years of age undergoing lower abdominal surgeries were included.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with known allergy to the study drugs, suspected coagulopathy, infection at the site of caudal block, history of developmental delay, neurological diseases and skeletal deformities were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Allocation</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethical committee and review board's approval and written informed consent from the parents, the children were randomly allocated into two groups.

After the insertion of LMA, sevoflurane concentration was reduced to 3% in 50% nitrous oxide, patients were left in spontaneous ventilation and a caudal block was performed in all patients according to the group.

In addition, dexmedetomidine is a shorter-acting drug than clonidine and it is unique that its sedative effect can be reversed by atipamezole. These properties render dexmedetomidine suitable for sedation and analgesia during the whole perioperative period. The preferred route of administration of dexmedetomide is the intravenous (IV) route, although others have been studied. In children, the pharmacokinetics of a 10-min IV infusion of dexmedetomidine, 0.33, 0.66, or 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ kg, yielded a rapid redistribution (&#x003b1; phase) half-life of 9 min and a slow (&#x003b2; phase) elimination phase with a half-life of 2 hours, similar to adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] There appears to be no dose-dependent kinetics in children. Pharmacodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine have been studied thoroughly in adults, whereas in children, initial publications were anecdotal, in the form of case reports.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] More recently, investigations in children have described the pharmacokinetics as well as a number of pharmacodynamic effects in randomised, controlled trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] One of the major advantages of dexmedetomidine over other sedatives is its respiratory effects, which are minimal in adults and children. Indeed, respiratory rate, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) tension, and oxygen saturation are generally maintained during dexmedetomidine sedation in children. Dexmedetomidine provides an interesting quality of sedation that permits arousal with gentle stimulation. It has been studied for sedation in children for a number of different purposes, including radiologic procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>El-Hennawy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] administered dexmedetomidine and clonidine, both in a dose of 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg as adjuvant with 0.25% bupivacaine caudally. They found that the duration of analgesia was significantly higher in the group receiving bupivacaine&#x02013;dexmedetomidine mixture [median (95% CI): 16 hours (14&#x02013;18)] or bupivacaine&#x02013;clonidine mixture [median (95% CI): 12 hours (3&#x02013;21)] than the group receiving bupivacaine alone [median (95% CI): 5 hours (4&#x02013;6)].

The patients stayed haemodynamically stable and there were no undue side effects. The mean duration of analgesia was 6.32&#x000b1;0.46 hours in ropivacaine group, 13.17&#x000b1;0.68 hours in clonidine group and 15.26&#x000b1;0.86 hours in dexmedetomidine group. The prolongation of duration of analgesia was significant in both clonidine and dexmedetomidine groups when compared to ropivacaine alone administered group. The incidence of adverse effects was statistically insignificant between the three groups.</p><p>We observed from our study that the duration of postoperative analgesia [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] recorded a median of 14.5 hours (13.90&#x02013;15.09) in Group RD compared with 5.5 hours (4.97&#x02013;6.03) in Group R, with a <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.001.

No episodes of clinically significant postoperative complications such as PONV, respiratory depression, urinary retention, pruritus, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The results of our observations show that in addition to prolonged post-op analgesia, dexmedetomidine has a favourable safety profile and stable haemodynamics, which are in concordance with the reports published by several other authors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Emergence agitation (EA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] is a frequent side effect of sevoflurane anaesthesia in paediatric patients. There is no well-defined prophylaxis or treatment, although the incidence of this excitatory behaviour seems to be reduced by the perioperative use of sedative and analgesic drugs.

RD group had significant sedation compared to R group, meaning that RD group children were asleep but easily arousable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Caudal dexmedetomidine 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg with 0.25% ropivacaine 1 ml/kg for paediatric lower abdominal surgeries achieved significant postoperative pain relief up to 15 hours, which resulted in a better quality of sleep and a prolonged duration of arousable sedation and produced less incidence of EA following sevoflurane anaesthesia. Also, there was no necessity for any supplemental analgesic and the haemodynamics too were stable. No episodes of clinically significant postoperative complications were observed. Hence, we find dexmedetomidine to be a safe and effective adjuvant for caudal analgesia in paediatrics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
