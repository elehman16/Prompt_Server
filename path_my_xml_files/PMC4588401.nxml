A bespoke web-based trial management system developed for the trial (and housed within the secure NHS Data Network) communicates directly with the HEAT Toolkit software downloaded at participating practices, which issues queries searching entry criteria (&#x02265;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;years, on chronic aspirin &#x02264;&#x000a0;325&#x000a0;mg daily, not on anti-ulcer therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for GP review of eligibility. Trial participation is invited using a highly secure automated online mail management system. Interested patients are seen once for consent and breath testing. Those with a positive test are randomised to eradication treatment (lansoprazole, clarithromycin, metronidazole) or placebo, with drug sent by post. Events are tracked by upload of accumulating information in the GP database, patient contact, review of National Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of National Statistics data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>HEAT is the largest Clinical Research Network-supported drug trial, with 115,660 invitation letters sent from 850 practices, 22,922 volunteers, and 3038 <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive patients randomised to active or placebo treatment after 2.5&#x000a0;years of recruitment. 178 practices have performed their first follow-up data search to identify 21 potential endpoints to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>HEAT is important medically, because aspirin is so widely used, and methodologically, as a successful trial would show that large-scale studies of important clinical outcomes can be conducted at a fraction of the cost of those conducted by industry, which in turn will help to ensure that trials of primarily medical rather than commercial interest can be conducted successfully in the UK.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>HEAT, a large clinical trial investigating effects of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication on incidence of ulcer bleeding in aspirin users</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>HEAT methodology allows large-scale trials of important clinical outcomes to be conducted at low cost affordable to the NHS</p></list-item><list-item id="u5610"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>As the largest CRN-supported drug study, HEAT has currently invited participation from over 115,000 patients countrywide</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Aspirin</kwd><kwd>Helicobacter pylori</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Ulcer</kwd><kwd>Bleed</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s0015"><label>1.1</label><title>Background and Rationale</title><p>Clinical trials measuring the effect of an intervention on clinical outcomes are more influential than those investigating intermediate surrogate measures. However, if the outcome occurs infrequently such studies need to be large, making them costly to conduct. Consequently, outcomes studies tend only to be done where there is a substantial funding source and commercial motivation, resulting in systematic bias in the information available to prescribers.</p><p>The development of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors generated robust outcomes data about these drugs compared to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Funds have not been available to conduct similar investigations into low dose aspirin, though prescribing volumes are higher (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">http://www.hscic.gov.uk/NHS information centre, n.d.</xref>) and the influence on peptic ulcer bleeding is now probably greater (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Taha et al., 2007</xref>) than for NSAIDs. Moreover understanding how to prevent ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin is likely to grow in importance with increasing recognition of the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing various cancers (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Din et al., 2010a</xref>), as well as its benefits in coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Whilst analgesic doses of aspirin cause gastroduodenal damage this is much reduced with the lower doses prescribed for prevention of vascular disease.</p><p>The primary aim of the HEAT trial is to investigate the hypothesis that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication will reduce the incidence of ulcer bleeding in patients taking aspirin. We therefore investigated how we could conduct a large scale intervention trial into the prevention of ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin within the resources available from funding bodies for academic studies.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>1.2</label><title>Objectives and Trial Design</title><p>In some epidemiological studies, <italic>H. pylori</italic> increases the odds of ulcer bleeding in aspirin users, even in studies which show an opposite effect for non-aspirin NSAIDs (<xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Stack et al., 2002; Lanas et al., 2002</xref>). In endoscopic studies of patients on low dose aspirin there is a fivefold increase in ulcer development in <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive compared to negative patients (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Yeomans et al., 2005</xref>). Some studies of secondary prevention in patients at high risk of ulcer bleeding suggest that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication may substantially reduce the risk of further events (<xref rid="bb0035 bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2001; Lai et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>HEAT brings together a number of approaches, methods and devices to streamline a large-scale interventional trial:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Recruitment in primary care using the MIQUEST (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/miquest, n.d.</xref>) search tool that enables electronic scrutiny of records in any of the clinical systems used in UK general practice</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Use of an automated Docmail (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">http://www.cfhdocmail.com/, n.d.</xref>) postal system that ensures invitations are received within 48&#x000a0;h of patient identification, whilst maintaining record confidentiality</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Use of nurses available through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN) for the purposes of recruitment</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Using the recruitment visit opportunistically to obtain health check data to patient and GP benefit, including blood pressure, Body Mass Index, alcohol consumption and smoking status</p></list-item><list-item id="u0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>A dedicated central facility for <italic>H. pylori</italic> analysis</p></list-item><list-item id="u0040"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Despatch of treatment by post</p></list-item><list-item id="u0045"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Replacement of conventional follow-up visits by multiple methods for endpoint ascertainment: participant report, automated scrutiny of GP records, regular download of hospital episode statistics (HES) and mortality data, using the secure NHS N3 spine (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">http://n3.nhs.uk/technicalinformation/n3networkoverview.cfm, n.d.</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item id="u0050"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Validation of endpoints by the adjudication process used in the TARGET study (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Schnitzer et al., 2004</xref>)</p></list-item></list></p><p>These methods were selected after validation in a pilot study (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">HEAT Trial Pilot Study Report, n.d.</xref>), and have several advantages over conventional approaches.

Of those who volunteered, 77 were ineligible at initial contact, and a small number were screen failures, leaving 825 who were enrolled in the study (87.4% of those initially responding positively). Of these, 184 were positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection (22.3%) with 12 borderline results (1.5%). Approximately two months post-eradication all positive participants had a follow-up appointment for post-treatment breath testing. Participants and their GPs were notified of their current <italic>H. pylori</italic> status; those who remained positive were referred back to their GP. At follow-up, 177 (91.3%) of those with an initial positive breath test had a negative test indicating successful treatment.</p><p>In response to a questionnaire, 72% of participants in this non-randomised study said they would participate in a randomised trial in which only half the participants were treated during the trial.

The protocol was designed by collaborators at the Universities of Nottingham, Southampton, Durham, Oxford and Birmingham, and the trial's sponsor is the University of Nottingham. This is currently believed to be the largest interventional drug trial taking place in the UK, aiming to contact 170,000 potential participants, consent and breath-test 33,000, and randomise 6600 who are <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Governance &#x00026; Ethics</title><p>HEAT has been approved by the East Midlands-Leicester Research Ethics Committee (Ref 11/EM/0434), and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (CTA Ref 03057/0052/001-0001) and is conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.

This is further to a recent expansion of the trial, from 67 PCTs initially identified in 2011. The trial has been adopted by 24 former Comprehensive Local Research Networks (CLRNs) across England, led by Trent CLRN. Principal Investigators (PIs) are based at 5 regional centres (Nottingham, Durham, Southampton, Oxford/Birmingham, Belfast). Each practice has a nominated Study Site Coordinator (SSC) acting under the guidance of the regional PI, who identifies potentially suitable patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>3.1.4</label><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Subjects are males or females &#x02265;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;years of age, taking daily aspirin &#x02264;&#x000a0;325&#x000a0;mg daily (4 or more 28-day prescriptions in the last year). Subjects are excluded if currently prescribed anti-ulcer therapy (within the last 3&#x000a0;months), oral NSAIDs or any medication with a clinically significant interaction with the <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment.

This regimen was chosen to match the regimen used in the pilot study, so we are able to infer comparable eradication rates (this will also be checked by re-breath testing a 10% sample of patients at the end of the study, and any patient who experience an endpoint). This regimen is also reputed to achieve high eradication rates over a shorter treatment duration than other regimens (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Hunt, 1999</xref>). The control group receives placebos to the same regimen. All medication was manufactured and packaged by Modepharma (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">http://www.modepharma.com/, n.d.</xref>).</p><p>Treatment is dispatched to the participants by post, including a form on which the participant can log dose timings and record any adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>3.1.11</label><title>Participant Compliance and Adverse Events</title><p>Participants receive a telephone call approximately 7&#x000a0;days following despatch of medication to check compliance and adverse effects. Because of the high eradication rates achieved in the pilot study, only a 10% sample will be retested to confirm successful treatment and indirectly act as a measure of adherence. This is also measured via patient self-reporting, as all patients are asked to complete a Treatment Record Form, stating the date and time they take each medication dose.</p><p>Serious adverse event data is collected by the GP practices for only 4&#x000a0;weeks from the start of treatment. This is because the trial is classified by the MHRA as the lowest risk trial of an investigational medicinal product (Type A study) (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Licensingofmedicines/Clinicaltrials/Submittinganotificationforatrial/index.htm, n.d.</xref>), using established medications within their licensed indication. This means that, because the primary outcome is a safety one, events are not reported after this time unless the Chief Investigator thinks there are compelling reasons to implicate treatment in an event detected during subsequent interrogation of GP records.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>3.1.12</label><title>Data Acquisition</title><p>Participant-reported adverse effects are entered on the trial database.

Our power calculations are based on assumptions derived from event rates in published randomised clinical trials and observational studies. Based on an average of the rates of ulcer bleeding in control patients in RCTs and observational studies we assume a rate of 0.16% per annum, in patients not taking aspirin. If aspirin increases the bleeding rate 2.5 fold we would predict an ulcer bleeding rate in patients &#x02265;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;years old on aspirin of 0.4% per annum. We assume approximately 25% of patients are <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive (as in our pilot study) and that infection increases the risk threefold. These assumptions translate into an ulcer bleeding rate of 0.8% per annum in the 25% of patients who are on aspirin and <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive. Assuming event rates of 4 per 1000 per year in the intervention arm and 8 per 1000 per year in the control arm then 7250 person-years are required per study arm to obtain this number of events and approximately 3300 participants will need to be randomised per study arm (6600 total) assuming an average follow-up of 2.3&#x000a0;years and allowing for 2% loss to follow-up per year.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>3.1.15</label><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to analyse time to first episode of hospitalisation because of definite or probable peptic ulcer bleeding, to estimate a hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval comparing treatment arms, adjusted for regional centre.

The analysis will compare resource use between the two arms, with key cost drivers for gastric bleed management being recorded. The economic analysis will be via Markov decision analysis models, with an assumed life expectancy of 14.0&#x000a0;years for men and 16.0&#x000a0;years for women aged 65 or more, with an indication for aspirin, based on results from the ACTION study (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><label>3.1.17</label><title>Post-Trial Care</title><p>GP care of participants continues as usual after randomisation. All participants will be told which arm they were in at the end of the trial, along with the trial results, to enable them and their GP to make an informed decision on whether or not eradication therapy for those on placebo would now be beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><label>3.1.18</label><title>Monitoring and Audits</title><p>An important component of this trial is the attempt to develop low-cost, streamlined, simplified methodologies to bring outcomes studies within the affordability of academic investigators. New MHRA guidelines from 1 April 2011 are helpful to this aspiration. For Type A trials, a low-intensity approach to monitoring is advised, taking into account the trial risk assessment, and specifics of the trial design. As this is a low risk trial, with the majority of the study data captured via electronic methods, required monitoring surrounds just those participants who experience a trial endpoint.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0150"><label>3.2</label><title>Results</title><p>After approximately 2.5&#x000a0;years of recruitment, we have now sent out invitation letters to over 115,000 patients, have heard from almost 23,000 volunteers (~&#x000a0;20% volunteering rate), and have consented 17,628 participants to date, 3038 of which have been positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> (17% prevalence). Recruitment will continue until 87 adjudicated endpoints have occurred. We have run follow-up MIQUEST searches in 178 practices to date, and have identified 21 potential endpoints in <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive participants. Further details will now be collected to enable adjudication of these events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0155"><label>3.3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>HEAT is an innovative trial, both medically and methodologically. If its hypothesis is supported, it will have identified a cost effective strategy that reduces the risk of the adverse events increasingly associated with the alternative strategy of PPI prophylaxis (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Nealis and Howden, 2008</xref>). If there is specifically a reduction in the incidence of bleeding ulcers, the results of the trial will strengthen an explanatory paradigm that suggests that the principal effect of low dose aspirin is an anti-haemostatic rather than an erosive one, requiring <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection for the development of an ulcer that bleeds because of impaired haemostasis. Data that associate aspirin use more strongly with duodenal than gastric ulceration (<xref rid="bb0030 bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Yeomans et al., 2005; Sostres et al., 2015</xref>) may support this paradigm and an analysis of ulcer site is part of the study plan. With the likely increase in aspirin use following the recognition of its apparent ability to prevent and slow cancer growth (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Din et al., 2010b</xref>), <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication could make a difference to the health of an increasing number of people, either by supporting a strategy of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication or, in the event of a negative result, PPI prophylaxis. Application of the trial's results may differ between countries where its incidence is declining (<xref rid="bb0125 bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Calvet et al., 2013; Axon, 2014</xref>) versus those parts of the world where <italic>H. pylori</italic> prevalence remains high, as is peptic ulceration and its complications. Regardless of the trial's results, its methodological advances remain important for future low-cost outcomes studies.</p><p>Our pilot study and the first 30&#x000a0;months of the current trial show that assessment and recruitment of large numbers of patients in primary care is feasible. This is due to the relative ease of screening for patients using the MIQUEST search tool, with efficiency also enhanced by use of the automated postal system that ensures invitations are received by several hundred patients per practice within 48&#x000a0;h of their identification.</p><p>Endpoint identification via automated Read code searches is perhaps the most time- and cost-saving element of this trial, removing the requirement for face-to-face follow-up of 6600 randomised participants, and increasing the completeness of data recording, which is often lost with participant- and practice-reported outcomes.</p><p>The establishment of the NIHR Clinical Research Network has had a major influence in facilitating the trial, which in turn is arguably a model of the reach of clinical research that is possible under the auspices of the CRN. If successful the trial will show that large-scale studies of important clinical outcomes across the whole of medicine can be conducted at a fraction of the cost of those conducted by industry. This will in turn restore some balance in the generation of data for evidence-based medicine by increasing the influence of investigator driven assessment of clinical issues that are not of direct interest to funding bodies with substantial funds, such as the pharmaceutical industry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0130"><label>4</label><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Miss Jennifer S.
