Thus, these 2 components&#x02014;diet and energy expenditure&#x02014;are the cornerstones of prevention and treatment programs of obesity.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>Interventions in schools to prevent obesity have been established as an important strategy to address the problem, but previous research has shown that interventions towards healthy behaviors have had humble results.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Observed effects imply high levels of knowledge, awareness, and positive attitude towards healthy eating,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> yet underscoring the problem that information and positive attitudes are not enough to produce actual change.</p><p>In this context, some interventions have used nudge strategy to alter people's behavior in a predictable way to make healthy behavior more likely.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Nudging is an aspect of the choice architecture (the way of presentation and framing of choices) that alters the individuals&#x02019; choice in a predictable and desirable way, without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> assuming that individual behavior is strongly influenced by the environment in which decisions are taken.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>Some studies conducted in developed countries have reported success in nudge interventions. Williamson et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> observed positive results in food consumption after several changes in the school cafeteria environment. Wansink et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> found a positive effect in making vegetables more attractive, by giving them nicknames, increasing their consumption in American school cafeterias. However, some studies did not find significant association between the use of nudge and healthier eating by the adolescents investigated. Bucher et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> observed that point-of-purchase messages had no effect on vegetable basket sales in a college foodservice setting. Coyle et al<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> showed that the presence of a salad bar was not associated with greater fruit and vegetable consumption in elementary schools.</p><p>Systematic reviews showed that the choice architecture seems effective to promote healthier food choices,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> and the most effective strategy was to increase food availability.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> However, the authors concluded that there is an important literature gap,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and few high-quality studies evaluated nudge strategy in real-life scenarios<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> and quantified the impact of these strategies on health outcomes, mainly obesity.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>Adolescents are highly susceptible to environmental influences, suggesting that nudging is an interesting tool in the prevention of obesity and school a strategy place to promote nudging.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>This project is a factorial trial which continues previous research called PAAPPAS study (Portuguese abbreviation of &#x0201c;parents, students, community health agents and teachers for healthy eating&#x0201d;).<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> The present project will be conducted in schoolchildren, keeping the already consolidated components of primary prevention and including actions that aim to improve the adherence response to the interventions and providing a broad spectrum of actions to reach adolescence-based obesity prevention, including changes in School environment. More specifically, the present research aims to estimate the effect of &#x0201c;nudge&#x0201d; strategies on the students&#x02019; body mass index (BMI), from changes at the school environment, with the aim of creating school cafeterias that guide smarter food choices.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and setting</title><p>PAAPPAS Nudge is a randomized community-based, school-based trial designed to promote healthful choices in a low-income scenario, which will be held in 2018 school-year in 18 municipal public schools in the municipality of Duque de Caxias, metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://duquedecaxias.rj.gov.br/portal/">http://duquedecaxias.rj.gov.br/portal/</ext-link>).

Considering the intracluster correlation and refusal rate, the total sample size required was increased, leading 1300 adolescents, which can be achieved achieved with 10 schools with 4 to 5 classes of 30 students each one.</p><p>In addition, a subsample of 96 adolescents (48 boys and 48 girls) was calculated to detect a mean difference in daily energy expenditure of 110&#x0200a;kcal and a coefficient of variation equal to 1 (standard deviation [SD] of 110&#x0200a;kcal),<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> with an &#x003b1; of 0.05 (2-sided) and &#x003b2; of 0.10.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> The adolescents were sampled from 1 intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;48) and 1 control school (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;48).</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Intervention</title><p>The activities will occur during the 2018 school-year and will combine different intervention strategies: educational interventions (in the classroom) and modifications in the environment (school canteens and sports court).</p><p>Group 2 will receive classroom-based educational activities based on an earlier study, which was developed in the same city and constituted a school-based intervention with the objective of reducing the consumption of sweetened beverages and biscuits, and increase the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and beans.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p><p>In group 3, changes in the environment will be included that will facilitate both physical activity and healthy food choices. Interventions will be based on a nudge strategy, a tool of the architectural field of choice, which is defined as a way of influencing choices without limiting personal decisions or having to implement actions or interventions of greater cost and operational difficulty.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> The concept of nudging is based on the theory of the double process originated in the field of psychology, which involves the division of human cognition into 2 systems: the reflective and the automatic. The first is rational and involves conscious decisions, whereas the latter is more controlled by instinct.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> These 2 systems are taken into account for a number of cognitive biases, which explains, for example, why people, though conscious, have difficulty in translating intentions into actions. Using the understanding of these 2 biases is possible to changing behavior developing new ways of how food choices are presented in an environment, and individuals are unconsciously &#x0201c;motivated&#x0201d; to adopt healthy choices.</p><p>The approaches can be divided into passive and active. The passive approach, also called choice architecture, seeks to induce healthy choices through small changes in the environment. The active approach includes placing reminders in the environment. In the school context, the intention is to change the environment in which schoolchildren are inserted with the perspective of associating convenience with healthier practices and making less healthy practices less convenient, aiming to increase the consumption of healthier foods and stimulate the practice of physical activity. The convenience of healthy practices both preserves the power of choice (students are not required to consume healthy food or engage in physical activity) and encourages healthy behavior.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> describes the intervention components and evaluation tools conducted in PAAPPAS Nudge.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Intervention components, description, and evaluation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e8898-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Interventions regarding food consumption were based on those strategies of the Smarter Lunchrooms Movement (SLM)&#x02014;an intervention study conducted in US school lunchrooms to led students to eat more fruits and vegetables, with positive results.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> In the present study, school lunchrooms will be the central place of modifications regarding food consumption, where the strategies that were effective in SLM will be reproduced:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1)</label><p>Arrange the fruits served in the school lunch in a prominent position, in containers of bright and contrasting colors, to serve them.
