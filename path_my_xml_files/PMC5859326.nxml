However, the impact of such programs may differ, depending on, for example, characteristics of a child (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hinshaw, 2007</xref>). Identifying moderators of treatment success could assist teachers and other educational professionals to determine which students might benefit best from behavioral teacher programs.</p><p>The Positivity and Rules program is a manualized behavioral self-help program for teachers (PR program; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Veenman et al., 2016</xref>) targeting ADHD symptoms in the classroom. The program does not require additional teacher training, which fosters long-term sustainability at little cost. The practical and easy-to-use manual includes a universal program involving psycho-education, classroom management and behavioral strategies (e.g., reward and time-out system), and a Daily Report Card (DRC) to target specific behavioral goals in individual children. Beneficial effects have been reported of the PR program on teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and social skills (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Veenman et al., 2016</xref>). In line with meta-analytic literature indicating that positive program effects are often restrained to proximate measures (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013</xref>), the positive program effects were not present for less-proximate measures (i.e., actigraphy, classroom observations and peer ratings; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Veenman et al., 2017</xref>). Given the paucity of low-intensive behavioral teacher programs, the PR program could be a valuable contribution to existing intervention options. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify moderators of treatment outcome of the PR program to determine which children could benefit most from the PR program.</p><p>Based on the available literature, both child and classroom characteristics were selected that might moderate the effectiveness of the PR program. Regarding demographic characteristics, the moderating effects of age and gender are worth investigating given the age-dependent decline of ADHD symptoms and conduct problems (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lahey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Faraone et al., 2006</xref>) and gender-specific manifestation of problem behavior, with less externalizing and more internalizing problems in girls than in boys (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gershon and Gershon, 2002</xref>). Regarding age, results are inconsistent, with some (meta-analytic) evidence suggesting that older children might profit more from (parent-based) behavioral programs (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">van den Hoofdakker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Comer et al., 2013</xref>) and other (meta-analytic) evidence indicating no moderating effect of age (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Beauchaine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Enebrink et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Thijssen et al., 2017</xref>). With regard to gender, results are also inconclusive. No moderating effect of gender was found in the Multimodal Treatment Study that compared the effectiveness of medication treatment, behavior management, combined treatment (medication and behavior management), and care as usual, nor in the internet-based parent program of Enebrink and colleagues (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Enebrink et al., 2012</xref>). However, superior treatment effects for boys with aggressive and oppositional behavior have been found in two other studies involving a behavioral classroom intervention (Good Behavior Game; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kellam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Witvliet et al., 2009</xref>) and in a low-intensive version of the Incredible Years behavioral parent program (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lavigne et al., 2008</xref>). An explanation for the larger program effects for boys might be that there is more room for improvement given their higher levels of externalizing behavior problems (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gershon and Gershon, 2002</xref>). Differential treatment response may also depend on parental educational level as it seems that families with limited social and economic resources are less likely to benefit from behavioral treatments (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Rieppi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chronis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hoza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl et al., 2006</xref>; but see also <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lavigne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">La Greca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Leijten et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Susceptibility to behavioral treatments could also depend on severity of a child&#x02019;s problem behavior at baseline. Superior treatment effects are found for children with more severe behavioral problems compared to children with less severe symptomology (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Reyno and McGrath, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lavigne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kolko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Thijssen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Leijten et al., 2018</xref>), although other studies report worse treatment effects for children with more severe behavioral problems (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Owens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Van Lier et al., 2004</xref>). More room for improvement would explain why larger effects were observed for children with more severe problem behavior. However, a low-intensive behavioral self-help program such as the PR program might not be sufficient to target the specific needs of children with severe and persistent dysfunction (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">van den Hoofdakker et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Investigating the moderating effect of social functioning might also be fruitful. Literature showed limited effects of a behavioral program for children with both behavioral and social problems (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Spilt et al., 2013</xref>). This seems plausible as the difficulties faced by these children might be more severe and persistent. Moreover, the perceived efficacy of teachers targeting problem behavior in children with both behavioral and social problems could be lower than children who only experience behavioral problems. Children with adequate social functioning might be more open to the introduction of new behavioral strategies in the classroom and could thus be more responsive to behavioral interventions where the focus lies on reinforcing positive behavior.</p><p>Since children with ADHD have high rates of comorbid problem behavior such as conduct problems and internalizing behavior (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Angold et al., 1999</xref>), it is important to know whether comorbid problem behavior moderates the effectiveness of our teacher program. In general, studies investigating comorbidities suggest no moderating effect of comorbid ODD/CD on the effectiveness of behavioral programs (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pelham and Fabiano, 2008</xref>). Other studies, however, do suggest more treatment gains for children with ADHD and high levels of internalizing problems (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">March et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Van der Oord et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">van den Hoofdakker et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, differential treatment response could depend on the existence of comorbid problem behavior. Given the low intensity of the PR program, the program might be less effective for children with comorbid problem behavior who often have more functional impairments and worse long-term prognoses than children with ADHD only (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Biederman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Connor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bauermeister et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Finally, classroom variables such as teaching experience and class size are considered as relevant moderators. Experienced teachers are generally more confident in managing ADHD in the classroom (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al., 1994</xref>), and increased teacher self-efficacy is positively related to performance (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Schunk, 1984</xref>). Therefore, experienced teachers might more effectively apply behavioral and classroom management strategies in their classroom and superior treatment effects may thus be expected. Class size could also differentially affect the efficacy of behavioral interventions, because teachers perceive class size to be a barrier for managing ADHD in the classroom (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mulligan, 2001</xref>). In smaller classes, students receive more individual attention from the teacher and students are less likely to be distracted or disrupted by other children (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Blatchford et al., 2011</xref>). The personalized approach in smaller classes might be crucial during behavioral interventions for children with ADHD.</p><p>To summarize, the current study investigated the moderating effects of diverse child characteristics and classroom variables on the beneficial effects of an 18-week self-help behavioral teacher program on teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and social skills. Based on the low intensity of the PR program, we hypothesized superior treatment effects for children of higher educated parents and for children with relatively less severe symptomology and no comorbid problem behavior. No predictions were made regarding age and gender given the highly inconsistent literature. Furthermore, children with well-developed social skills were expected to benefit more from the PR program. Finally, it was hypothesized that more teaching experience and smaller classes would foster the program&#x02019;s effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study sample (<italic>N</italic> = 114) comprised primary school children (6&#x02013;13 years) who displayed high levels of ADHD symptoms in the classroom and took part in an earlier study assessing the effectiveness of the PR program (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Veenman et al., 2016</xref>).

The program involves elements of effective behavioral teacher programs (e.g., the classroom component of the Summer Treatment Program; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>) such as psycho-education for the teacher, classroom behavior management strategies (e.g., physical adjustments within the classroom, effective instructions), and contingency management (e.g., reward and time-out system; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chronis et al., 2004</xref>). These program elements are implemented by the teachers themselves in their classrooms. During the 18-week program students with ADHD symptoms and their classmates are administered a universal program encompassing basic behavior strategies used throughout the entire day (e.g., positively formulated rules, effective instructions and a reward system). Although several techniques will be familiar to most teachers, the manual instructs teachers how to systematically and adequately implement all intervention elements by providing detailed practical instructions on implementation. In addition, the PR program contains an individual program for students with ADHD symptoms, involving a DRC to reward children for achieving specific behavioral goals. The individual program consists of three intensity levels, differing in the number of times per day behavioral goals are evaluated and rewards are provided. Practical examples (e.g., examples of non-material rewards), work sheets (e.g., DRC), and flow diagrams (e.g., of the Time-out System) are included in the manual to facilitate program implementation.

Most teachers (81%) reported adequate or good implementation of the universal reward system during the entire intervention, with the remaining 19% reporting inadequate implementation in 1 or 2 weeks during the course of the entire 18 weeks. Teachers reported to have used all elements of the DRC adequately most of the 18 weeks (<italic>M</italic> = 0.78% of the time; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.23).

The SWAN is an 18-item rating scale measuring the presence and severity of ADHD symptoms on a continuum. This questionnaire consists of a Hyperactive/Impulsive, Inattentive, and Combined scale, of which the average item score on the Combined scale was used as outcome measure. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from -3 (far above average) to +3 (far below average). In the current study, items were reverse scored so that higher scores indicated more ADHD symptoms. The SWAN has high internal reliability (0.94&#x02013;0.96) and validly assesses ADHD symptoms (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lubke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2009</xref>). The ADHD scale of the SDQ consists of five items and measures ADHD symptoms on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true, and 2 = certainly true), using the total score as outcome measure. The composite reliability of the SDQ ADHD scale is high (0.94&#x02013;0.96), as well as the average variance extracted (0.77&#x02013;0.82; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Niclasen et al., 2013</xref>). The internal consistency of the SDQ ADHD scale (Dutch version) is also good (&#x003b1; = 0.89) and the concurrent validity is adequate (<italic>r</italic> = 0.78; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Van Widenfelt et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To assess the child&#x02019;s social skills, the Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS, teacher version) was administered (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gresham and Elliott, 1990</xref>). The SSRS consists of 30 items divided over three subscales (Collaboration, Assertiveness and Self-Control). Items are rated on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = sometimes and 2 = often) and the total score was used as outcome measure. Adequate internal consistency and high predictive validity have been reported for the SSRS (&#x003ba; = 0.77; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Van der Oord et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Moderator Variables</title><p>Moderator variables were measured prior to the start of the intervention to assess which factors moderated the effectiveness of the PR program.</p><sec><title>Demographic Characteristics</title><p>The demographic characteristics used as moderators in the current study were age (in years), gender (using boys as reference group), and parental educational level. Parental educational level was measured as the average of both parents&#x02019; educational level using an adapted version of the Dutch educational classification system (1 = primary education, 2 = secondary vocational education, 3 = secondary general education, 4 = undergraduate school, 5 = graduate school; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Verhage, 1983</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Severity of Problem Behavior</title><p>Severity of ADHD symptoms at baseline was measured using the SWAN (see section &#x0201c;Outcome Measures&#x0201d;) and severity of conduct problems and internalizing problems at baseline was assessed with the SDQ (measuring conduct problems with the Conduct scale, and internalizing problems as the sum of the Emotional and Peer Problems scale). Each SDQ scale (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Van Widenfelt et al., 2003</xref>) consists of 5 items on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true and 2 = certainly true). The internal consistency of the scales is adequate (0.74 &#x0003c; &#x003b1; &#x0003c; 0.76), as well as the composite reliability (0.88&#x02013;0.96) and average variance extracted (0.73&#x02013;0.85; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Niclasen et al., 2013</xref>). Self-reported anxiety at baseline was measured using the Spence Children&#x02019;s Anxiety Scale (SCAS; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Spence, 1997</xref>). The SCAS consists of 44 items, which are scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often, and 3 = always). The total score was used as moderator variable. The reliability of the SCAS is high (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 0.92 and McDonald&#x02019;s omega = 0.95) and validity is also well established (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Spence, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nauta et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Social Functioning</title><p>The moderators related to social functioning were teacher-reported social skills as measured by the SSRS (see section &#x0201c;Outcome Measures&#x0201d;) and peer acceptance.

Teachers and parents were recruited through educational consultant associations, the national parent association for children with developmental problems, and the study&#x02019;s website. In case teachers were interested in participating, they enlisted one or two students displaying ADHD symptoms in their classroom. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents, teachers, and participants older than 11 years. Participants were screened for eligibility by the first author BV. ML, who had not been in contact with any participants, was responsible for the subsequent computer-generated randomization to allocate children to the intervention or control group. Teachers were aware of treatment allocation given their involvement in treatment delivery. Parents and children were also aware of treatment allocation, as they were aware of the obvious classroom changes (e.g., the rewarding system for the entire classroom and the use of the DRC). Although the universal program was used in the entire classroom, only children displaying ADHD symptoms in the classroom were included as participants in this study. Dependent variables were measured at three time points: at baseline (T<sub>o</sub>), 6 weeks after start of the PR program (T<sub>1</sub>), and after 18 weeks at the end of the intervention (T<sub>2</sub>). For the children in the intervention group, the SWAN was also administered in week 9, 12, and 15 after start of the intervention to monitor progress and to adjust the intensity level of the individual program (see <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Veenman et al., 2016</xref>). For all moderating variables, baseline scores were used. All participating teachers received a small financial compensation (control group: &#x020ac;50; intervention group: &#x020ac;125). This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the medical ethical committee of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the medical ethical committee of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (reference number 2011/196).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>To assess which factors moderate the effectiveness of the PR program, multilevel regression analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">IBM Corp, 2011</xref>). All randomized subjects participated in the intention-to-treat analyses, regardless of the amount of missing data. For all measures, the percentage of missing data was low (3.6% for the SWAN; 2.6% for the SCAS, and 1.8% for the SDQ, SSRS and Peer Rating). Missing data were not imputed as multilevel analyses adequately deal with missing data (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Twisk et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Four hierarchical levels were used: observations were nested within students, students were nested within classrooms, and classrooms were nested within schools (level 4; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Heck et al., 2013</xref>). First, the overall intervention effects on ADHD symptoms (measured by the SWAN and SDQ ADHD scale) and social skills (measured by the SSRS) were estimated by using Group as dichotomous independent variable, while controlling for baseline levels of the dependent variable. Subsequently, separate multilevel regression analyses were conducted to assess the moderating effects of the demographic characteristics (gender, age, and parental educational level), severity of problem behavior (ADHD symptoms, conduct problems, internalizing problems, and anxiety), social functioning (teacher-reported social skills and peer acceptance), and classroom variables (teaching experience and class size). This was first done by centering all moderators (except for gender), after which the moderator and interaction between group and moderator were added to the original model that consisted of Group and baseline level of the dependent variable.</p><p>The moderating effects of comorbid problem behaviors (conduct problems, internalizing problems, anxiety problems, and social skills) were assessed by looking at three-way interactions between group and all possible pairs of comorbid problem behaviors (e.g., group &#x000d7; ADHD symptoms &#x000d7; conduct problems; group &#x000d7; ADHD symptoms &#x000d7; anxiety symptoms; etcetera). Similar three-way interactions were used to assess whether the level of social skills in combination with other problem behaviors (ADHD symptoms, conduct problems, internalizing problems, and anxiety) moderated treatment gains on social skills. In case of significant three-way interactions, <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses were performed to assess treatment effects for four different groups, using a median-split for both variables (e.g., anxiety and ADHD symptoms). If an interaction involved the SWAN ADHD scale (measuring ADHD symptoms), the term &#x02018;relatively high&#x02019; and &#x02018;relatively low&#x02019; levels of ADHD symptoms were used to describe children scoring at one of the extreme ends of the ADHD continuum.

Significant moderating effects were found for age and parental educational level on ADHD symptoms (as measured by the SWAN), indicating that the effect of the PR program on ADHD symptoms was larger for older children and for children from highly educated families. Results on the SDQ ADHD measure suggest larger treatment gains for children with both high levels of ADHD symptoms and low levels of anxiety, while program effects appeared absent for children with high levels of both ADHD symptoms and anxiety. The effects of the PR program on social functioning was significantly moderated by peer acceptance, indicating that the intervention was more effective for children who were less accepted by peers at baseline, and by the interaction between social skills and conduct problems, indicating superior program effects for children who scored low on social functioning and did not have serious conduct problems.</p><p>This study isolated what type of children would benefit most from our self-help behavioral teacher program. Results show that our intervention might be more effective for older children, for children from highly educated families, and for children with high levels of ADHD symptoms in the absence of other problem behavior (i.e., conduct problems or anxiety). These findings are in line our hypothesis that this low-intensive behavioral teacher program could be more effective for children from highly educated families, and those without many comorbid psychopathology. For children from low educated families and for those with severe comorbid problem behavior, more intensive therapeutic support might be needed to successfully reduce ADHD symptoms and improve social functioning (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">van den Hoofdakker et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the moderating role of age, our results are in line with (meta-analytic) evidence that also revealed larger effects of behavioral programs for older children (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">van den Hoofdakker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Comer et al., 2013</xref>) although there is also meta-analytic evidence revealing no moderating effects of age (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl et al., 2006</xref>). Perhaps, older children can more easily inhibit their impulses and comply with the challenges imposed by teachers implementing the PR program than younger children, because brain development and socialization improves with age (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Faraone et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The absence of a moderating effect of gender is in line with the MTA study where gender did not moderate treatment outcomes either (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>), and suggests that the PR program is equally effective for boys and girls. However, it could also be that no moderating gender effect was found due to the high percentage of boys participating in our study (84%), resulting in limited power to detect gender differences. Indeed, moderating effects of gender have been found in other studies where roughly half of all participants were girls (see for example <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lavigne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Witvliet et al., 2009</xref>). More research on samples with a more equal gender distribution is necessary to confirm whether the PR program is equally effective for both boys and girls.</p><p>Our finding that the PR program is more effective for children from highly educated parents is in line with several reviews discussing predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes in children with ADHD (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chronis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hoza et al., 2006</xref>). In most of those treatments, however, parents were involved in delivery of treatments (e.g., medication and parent programs), in which case the moderating role of parental educational level could be explained by greater involvement and greater treatment adherence of highly educated parents (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">La Greca et al., 2009</xref>). This explanation is less likely in our study where parents were not involved in treatment delivery. A more likely explanation might be related to teachers&#x02019; attitudes and expectations. Children from families with a low socioeconomic status (SES, often quantified by parental education) are often perceived less positively by teachers and teachers have lower expectations of these children in terms of academic and behavioral functioning (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">McLoyd, 1998</xref>). Hence, it is possible that teachers also expect less treatment improvement in these children.</p><p>The current results indicate that the PR program is equally effective for all children with ADHD symptoms, regardless of the severity of their ADHD symptoms, which is in line with meta-analytic evidence (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Reyno and McGrath, 2006</xref>). However, children with comorbid conduct or anxiety symptoms do seem to profit less from this program. More specifically, no treatment gains on ADHD symptoms were found for anxious children with high levels of ADHD symptoms, while large improvements on ADHD symptoms were found for non-anxious children with high levels of ADHD symptoms. The reason that others did find larger treatment gains for behavioral programs in children with ADHD and comorbid anxiety (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">March et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Van der Oord et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">van den Hoofdakker et al., 2010</xref>) could be related to the larger involvement of parents in these programs. Parents of children with ADHD and comorbid anxiety symptoms could be more anxious and overprotective toward their child than parents of children without comorbid anxiety symptoms (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Pfiffner and McBurnett, 2006</xref>) and might thus be more inclined to conform to treatment protocols (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Van der Oord et al., 2008</xref>), possibly resulting in larger treatment gains. In this manualized teacher program, parents were not involved in treatment delivery at all, which could explain the different results of this study. Perhaps, the perceptions of teachers can explain the lower gains of the PR program for anxious participants. Anxious children are likely to show very intense help-seeking and proximity-seeking behaviors toward teachers, which could result in teachers perceiving the child as challenging and causing frustration (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pianta and Nimetz, 1991</xref>), thus impeding treatment gains. Providing teachers with more elaborate information on comorbid internalizing and externalizing in children with ADHD and additional therapeutic support might help to increase the effectiveness of the PR program (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gillberg et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>For children scoring low on social functioning, the PR program appears to be more effective in improving teacher-rated social skills, particularly if conduct problems are absent or not very severe. Possibly, children with limited social skills who do not display oppositional or aggressive behavior (e.g., children who are shy or withdrawn) have more room to improve their social functioning thanks to enhanced classroom structure and positive reinforcement provided by the PR program. In contrast, children with both limited social skills and conduct problems, might be more likely to oppose the changes made in the classroom during the implementation of the PR program, which could thus result in smaller benefits for those children.</p><p>The current findings need to be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, power was somewhat limited due to the relatively small sample size, urging cautious interpretation of the current findings. Second, our sample mainly comprised boys, limiting the reliability of the finding that the PR program would be equally effective for boys and girls. This problem is common in ADHD research though, where boys are clearly overrepresented in the diagnosed ADHD population (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gershon and Gershon, 2002</xref>). Third, we acknowledge that we did not assess the influence of other potentially interesting variables on treatment outcome, such as problems at home (e.g., maternal depression or marital problems) or several teacher variables (e.g., teachers&#x02019; treatment expectations, treatment acceptance, and compliance). Fourth, this study did not investigate the influence of non-specific treatment effects on treatment outcomes such as positive treatment expectations. Future research is thus necessary to distinguish the specific from non-specific treatment effects.</p><sec><title>Summary</title><p>This study investigated the moderating effects of several child and classroom variables on the effectiveness of a low-level behavioral teacher program (PR program) in children with ADHD symptoms. Results indicated that the PR program could be more effective for older children and for children from higher educated families, while comorbid conduct or anxiety problems in combination with high levels of ADHD symptoms appeared to impede treatment gains. Hence, it appears that this self-help teacher program is suitable for children not facing additional challenges, but may not be able to address the needs of children from low educated families and those with comorbid psychopathology. The current findings underline the importance of using the PR program in a preemptive stage before behavioral problems escalate or transfer to multiple domains.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>BV: data collection, statistical analyses, literature review, and writing entire manuscript.
