However, successful visualisation of the larynx and tracheal intubation using some of the indirect laryngoscopes or video laryngoscopes (VL) requires hand-eye coordination.

The McGrath<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (MGR) VL has 95% success in cases where intubation with conventional direct laryngoscopy with the Macintosh blade (MAC) has failed.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] VLs are now included in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) difficult airway algorithm (2013) both as an initial approach in anticipated difficult airway, as well as in the non-emergency pathway as an alternative approach following unsuccessful intubation attempt with MAC scope.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In case of non-channel VLs, for the introduction of the tracheal tube, additional training in the right technique of tube manoeuvring during intubation is necessary.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Airway learning for the novice anaesthesiologist, usually, starts with direct laryngoscopy and novel airway devices are dealt with in the advanced course.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] With the current difficult airway algorithm supporting the use of VL, a few important questions that need to be answered are: (1) Does experience with MAC blade translate to better results at tracheal intubation with a VL? (2) What is the best time to introduce the technique of tracheal intubation using VLs to trainee anaesthesiologists?</p><p>Several studies have compared the time to intubation (TTI) of non-channelled VLs with the standard Macintosh laryngoscope by paramedics, novice anaesthesiologists,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and anaesthesiologist experienced in indirect laryngoscopy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, there is a paucity of clinical trials addressing the issue of experience and ease to intubate with VLs compared to conventional laryngoscopy. This prospective, randomised, clinical trial was designed to compare use of MGR series 5 (Manufactured by Aircraft Medical, UK) and Truview<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (TVW) (Manufactured by Truphatek, Israel) laryngoscopes with the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope for endotracheal intubation by novice and experienced anaesthesiologists. This trial aimed to ascertain whether learning of VLs is as easy as direct laryngoscopy using MAC blade and whether experience with the standard MAC influences the performance of tracheal intubation with VLs. The MGR and TVW scopes were selected based on their availability at our institute and both being non-channelled IDLs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI No. 2012/04/002562). A written informed consent was taken from all patients.We had three groups of intubating anaesthesiologists, six in each group. Group novice to intubation (NTI), included residents who had recently commenced training in anaesthesia and had no prior experience in tracheal intubation. Group novice to videoscope (NVL), novices to VLs, included 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> year residents who were well experienced with MAC (performed at least 50 successful tracheal intubations) but had never used a VL.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Group expert (EXP) included experienced anaesthesiologists who had experience with MAC, as well as VLs. At least six prior successful intubations in patients for each VL was the criterion laid down to qualify as experienced in VLs.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus, intubating anaesthesiologists in Group NTI were novices with all types of laryngoscopes, those in Group NVL were novices to VLs, while intubating anaesthesiologists in Group EXP were experienced with all types of laryngoscopes.</p><p>Consent for participation was taken from all participants. Novices did not perform any tracheal intubations outside the study. Novices were given a lecture and demonstration on various intubation techniques (Group NTI for all laryngoscopes, Group NVL for VLs) and optimisation manoeuvres followed by hands-on training on the Laerdal Airway Management Trainer (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway). The novices had to perform 5 successful intubations with each laryngoscope on the trainer.</p><p>The study design was aimed to randomise, each patient to an intubating anaesthesiologist and a laryngoscope within one of the three pre-defined groups. The sample size was calculated using power analysis software for ANOVA design and defining two main factors of influence on our primary end point - Time to intubate (TTI): Type of laryngoscope and experience of intubating anaesthesiologist. Based on experience, there exist a moderate variation in the intubation time for the MAC scope, with a mean duration of 59 s by novices to around 29 s by experienced[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with a standard deviation of 29 s (longest found in literature)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Using post-hoc multiple comparison procedure and assuming a moderate variation of mean time to intubate with a moderate standard deviation, it was found that 41 patients would be needed in each group to achieve 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.5 between the groups and a level of significance of 0.05. For the sake of simplicity, we decided to include 42 (multiple of 3) patients in each group.</p><p>American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade I-II patients, above 18 years scheduled to undergo elective surgical procedures requiring general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation were included after obtaining written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were refusal to consent, history of difficult airway or anticipated difficult airway, that is, Mallampati Classification (MPC) III and above and or other clinical findings suggestive of difficult airway, the presence of indications for rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia and patients with body mass index (BMI) over 30. Patients were randomised to have tracheal intubation performed by an anaesthesiologist, from one of the three pre-defined groups by computer generated program. Each intubating anaesthesiologist had a set of seven opaque envelopes containing the name of the laryngoscope in a random order. These envelopes were prepared at the very beginning of the trial, to ensure that each intubating anaesthesiologist did at least two intubations with each scope. Thus, there were 42 intubations in each group, 14 with each scope.</p><p>Baseline vitals were recorded. After pre-oxygenation for 3 min, anaesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5&#x02013;2 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1&#x02013;1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) administered intravenously. The patients&#x02019; lungs were ventilated using a 50:50 mixture of air and oxygen with isoflurane at dial setting of 1.5% and vecuronium (0.15 mg/kg) were administered for muscle relaxation. Four minutes later, tracheal intubation was done by the intubating anaesthesiologist using the allocated scope. Respective operative room consultant anaesthesiologist was present during intubation. No guidance or aid was given to the intubators during intubation, except when external manipulation of the larynx, or a stylet was asked for by the intubating anaesthesiologist. Data related to intubation were recorded by an independent observer.</p><p>The duration of the intubation attempt was defined as the time elapsed from the insertion of the blade between the dental arches to the first upwards deflection on the capnograph. A failed intubation was defined when the user could not intubate the patient's trachea after two attempts. Each attempt was terminated after 90 s or if the oxygen saturation on pulse oximeter fell below 90% whichever was earlier. After two failed attempts with the allotted laryngoscope, the attending consultant performed tracheal intubation using a technique of his choice. In case of two attempts, the time to intubate was taken as the sum of duration of each intubation attempt. However, the cases in which intubation failed as defined above, the time to intubate was not considered in the analysis with respect to intubation time.</p><p>Optimisation manoeuvres like external laryngeal pressure and airway aids required like stylet or bougie were recorded. For intubations with VLs, a pre-shaped stylet was used as recommended and was not considered as an additional intubation aid. Anti-fogging measures were standardised for both scopes.</p><p>Airway trauma assessment included blood on laryngoscope blade, visible trauma to lips, oral mucosa or teeth. In patients with blood on the laryngoscope blade; a check scopy was done by the consultant. Once tracheal intubation was accomplished successfully, the performers were asked to grade the glottis view according to the Cormack and Lehane (CL) grading and score the ease of use of the laryngoscope on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (ranging from 1 for extremely easy to 10 for extremely difficult).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Following surgery, the patients were evaluated for subjective symptoms of sore throat and hoarseness on NRS[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which were then grouped as: None (0), mild (1&#x02013;3), moderate (4&#x02013;6), severe (7&#x02013;10).</p><p>Parametric data like age, BMI were compared using ANOVA. Categorical data which included ASA status, MPC, CL grade, failure rate, optimising manoeuvres, trauma, sore throat, hoarseness were all compared using Chi-square. For all of the above analysis, a value of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. As the time to intubate (TTI) and NRS scores were not normally distributed, a comparison was made using Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparisons between the three scopes for each group and between the three groups for each scope were done using Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni's correction. <italic>P</italic> value was corrected to 0.016.

The TTI in Group NTI was similar for all three scopes. Anaesthesiology residents who were experienced with MAC but were novices to VLs (Group NVL) took significantly more time with VLs compared to MAC. In addition, there was no difference in TTI and failure rates with VLs between novices to intubation (Group NTI) and those experienced with MAC but novices to VL (Group NVL). In the experienced arm (Group EXP), a 20 s difference in TTI between VL and MAC was found.</p><p>Previous mannequin study that compared intubation time and ease of use of MGR[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with MAC by novices have found no difference between the scopes. In our clinical trial, no difference was found in the intubation time and NRS for the three scopes by the NTI group; suggesting that performance of novices is similar with the direct laryngoscopy with MAC blade as with the VLs.</p><p>There are a few clinical studies, which look at the use of VLs by novices in patients[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Di Marco <italic>et al</italic>. in 2010 compared learning and performance of tracheal intubation by novices using the Airtraq<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or MAC laryngoscopes in a randomised controlled clinical trial.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Airtraq<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> laryngoscope was judged easier and had a shorter intubation time than MAC by the novices. Airtraq<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> laryngoscope is a channelled VL. As tube manipulation is not tested with channelled VL, the results of this study may not be directly comparable with our study with non-channelled VLs. Nouruzi-Sedeh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in their clinical trial compared the success rate of MAC and the Glidescope<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technique performed by personnel inexperienced at intubation, the Glidescope<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> had better success rate than MAC (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In this study, each participant intubated 5 times with each scope and an improvement in success rate and TTI was seen from the first to fifth attempt, with the VL. Hence, in order to minimise the effect of experience gained during the study, we limited the number of intubations to not more than three with each scope.</p><p>Studies have looked at the performance of VLs by anaesthesiologists[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and paramedics[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] experienced with MAC blade but who had never used VL before, similar to our Group NVL. These studies also suggest that there may be differences in the performance of these intubating anaesthesiologists with different VLs. Experienced anaesthesiologists, but novices to VLs required a longer time for intubation in a standard manikin using MGR (40.7 s) compared to Venner<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> A.P. Advance (29.4 s) and MAC scope (26.1 s), (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Lye in one manikin study compared the use of four scopes: Pentax AWS<sup>?</sup>, C-MAC<sup>?</sup>, Bonfils<sup>?</sup> and MAC by two group of physicians with different levels of airway management experience.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The groups included novice anaesthetists of grade medical officers versus skilled anaesthetists (with MAC scope). This study concluded that after a teaching session and familiarisation with new scopes, novices were equally successful at intubation attempts with these scopes as skilled anaesthetists, even in difficult airway scenarios. In our study, we found no difference in TTI with VLs between Group NTI and Group NVL. In the background of above studies, the results of Group NTI and NVL suggests that experience with MAC blade does not translate to better performance with VL.</p><p>Intubating anaesthesiologists from Group NVL (novice to VL, experienced with MAC) had a high failure rate with MGR. Similar results were seen in a manikin study by Sharma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Only 48% of participants, who were experienced anaesthesiologists but novice to VLs could intubate within 3 min using MGR with a median of three attempts. This difference occurred despite the majority of anaesthesiologists obtaining a CL grade 1 view. This suggests that while VLs improve the visualisation of the glottis, additional skills at tube manipulation is required to guide the tracheal tube into the trachea and that these skills are not developed with experience at conventional laryngoscopy.</p><p>No guidance or aid was given to the intubating anaesthesiologists during intubation. Though all novices were explained and briefed about optimisation manoeuvres, the use of these techniques was not seen in the NTI group reflecting the lack of clinical experience of the NTI group and also as all patients had CL I/II, the novices might not have felt the need to ask for optimisation manoeuvres. Trauma with the use of stylet in with videoscope is known.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, two instances of trauma needing pressure in the form of throat packing was seen in the Group NVL. This may have occurred due to persistent attempts to pass the tube leading to trauma in the hands of the conventionally trained anaesthesiologist. Knowing that experience with MAC blade does not help in intubation with VLs, we propose that the introduction of VLs is best done early during training when the young minds are more cautious and patient in acquiring new skills.</p><p>Ray <italic>et al</italic>. in their manikin study with novices and VL found that success rate for tracheal intubation using the MAC scope was higher after using the MGR but converse was not true, suggesting that MGR can aid the teaching of direct laryngoscopy, but conventional laryngoscopy did not help in learning VLs.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This finding further reinforces the need to introduce VL early in training.</p><p>In the experienced group, we found TTI about 20 s longer with MGR and TVW scopes suggesting that intubation using non-channelised VL as a technique takes a little longer than direct conventional laryngoscopy by MAC. This is similar to other studies which have shown that tracheal intubation needs more time with VLs[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] even if the laryngoscopy time - that is, time to visualise the cords, did not differ between VL and MAC.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>This study is probably the only clinical trial that has compared the influence of experience with standard direct laryngoscopy on learning of VLs. The strength of this study is the comparison with three groups of varied experience-NTI, experienced in MAC but a novice to VLs and lastly experienced in MAC and VLs. The three groups help to dissect out the influence of experience on the use of VLs. However, the study has its own limitations. Both VLs included were non-channelled VL based on the availability in our institute. Hence, the results may not be applicable to other VLs, especially channelled VLs. With newer VLs and modifications of existing VLs constantly entering the market, performance assessment of such a diverse group of devices can never be perfect.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The criteria laid down to qualify as experienced with VLs are based on literature, which currently is mainly from manikin studies. The possibility of narrowing out the difference in TTI between VLs and MAC, as found in our data, with further experience in VLs, cannot be ruled out.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Novice anaesthesiologists rated the ease of intubation with VLs similar to conventional laryngoscopy. Experience with MAC did not help improve performance with VLs. One needs to gain experience in the technique and the hand-eye coordination that is needed for intubation with non-channelised VLs. With the accepted role of VLs in failed intubation, the authors propose the introduction of VLs early in the training of young anaesthesiologists.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>The authors would like to thank Mrs. S.
