It is a member of a newly defined class of drugs, the piprant class, that block prostaglandin receptors. Grapiprant is an EP4 piprant, also known as an EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist (EP4 PRA).<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> It binds to human and rat EP4 receptors with high affinity.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> In several rat pain models of inflammatory pain, grapiprant was shown to be effective in pain reduction<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> and in a rat model of adjuvant&#x02010;induced arthritis, grapiprant was shown to inhibit paw swelling, inflammatory biomarkers, and synovial inflammation.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>
</p><p>Many FDA&#x02010;approved drugs are available to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA) in dogs (e.g., carprofen,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim13948-note-0101">1</xref> firocoxib,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim13948-note-0102">2</xref> meloxicam<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim13948-note-0103">3</xref> , and deracoxib<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim13948-note-0104">4</xref>), all of which work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes. The adverse effect profile of the cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting nonsteroidal anti&#x02010;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is well established. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required language in the precaution section of the package inserts of these drugs warning that, as a class, they may be associated with renal, gastrointestinal (GI), and hepatic toxicity. Specifically, labels of these drugs warn of &#x0201c;the potential to produce GI ulceration and/or GI perforation.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim13948-note-0102">2</xref> Because grapiprant's mechanism of action targets the EP4 receptor, it does not inhibit the production of prostanoids, which are important in a variety of physiological functions that maintain normal homeostatic functions, including maintenance of GI integrity. Therefore, grapiprant may represent a treatment that could avoid the adverse effects associated with inhibition of cyclooxygenase in dogs.</p><p>Grapiprant binds to the canine EP4 receptor with high affinity and has been shown to be extremely well tolerated in a study in which it was given daily for 9 months to laboratory Beagles at doses up to 15 times the therapeutic dose.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Our study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of grapiprant given PO q24h for 28 days in client&#x02010;owned dogs with OA.

This same joint was evaluated throughout the study, regardless of whether another joint also was affected by OA. The joint chosen could not be an intervertebral joint.</p><p>The selected joint was evaluated using the veterinary assessment (VA) which included 7 components: (1) lameness at a trot, (2) lameness at a walk, (3) weight bearing on the affected limb, (4) willingness to raise the contralateral limb, (5) abnormal extension or range of motion, (6) pain or resistance on palpation and forced movement of the joint, and (7) swelling. Each component was rated on a scale of 0&#x02013;4 (unremarkable, slightly affected, moderately affected, very affected, severely affected). Dogs were assigned a TOS which was the sum of the scores for each of the 7 components and could range from 0 to 28.

Pairwise comparisons were assessed comparing the grapiprant group to placebo at a 2&#x02010;sided 0.05 significance level.</p><p>Secondary outcome variables included the percentage changes in PSS and PIS scores from day 0 to day 28. Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum values) were presented for day 0, day 28 and for the percentage changes from day 0 to day 28. Analysis of variance modeling was employed to assess possible differences between treatment groups.

Five adverse events were observed describing increased calcium (Ca) concentrations (above the reference range of 8.8&#x02013;11.2 mg/dL), 1 in the placebo group and 4 in the grapiprant&#x02010;treated group.

This dog was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after completion of the study. A second dog, which also had an increased baseline serum Ca concentration (11.3 mg/dL) that further increased to 12.4 mg/dL, was being treated with a corticosteroid during the study.

In addition, grapiprant used for 28 days in this population of dogs was found to be safe. Adverse events were relatively mild and of short duration. No dog was withdrawn from the study, despite a higher frequency of transient vomiting in the grapiprant&#x02010;treated dogs. These findings are important because grapiprant represents the first approach to daily PO treatment of pain and inflammation in dogs with OA with a mechanism of action targeted to binding and antagonizing a prostaglandin receptor (EP4) rather than inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of a drug for pain in dogs, studies rely on the owner to accurately report clinical signs, and veterinarians to evaluate these clinical signs when dogs are presented to veterinary clinics. In recent years, the FDA has required companies to rely on owner assessments as the primary effectiveness variable in studies evaluating drugs for OA in dogs. Furthermore, instead of comparing treatment groups using median or mean population data, the FDA has required that a predetermined definition of success be used to classify each dog as either a treatment success or failure. Subsequently, the number of dogs in each group that were treatment successes is compared to assess the effectiveness of the drug treatment. This approach makes it difficult to compare data across studies, unless the same definition of treatment success was used, which is seldom the case.</p><p>In our study, the definition of treatment success was based on a previously published rigorous evaluation of the power of various possible definitions of treatment success to differentiate between placebo treatment and treatment with carprofen in dogs with OA evaluated by the CBPI.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Using this analysis, the definition of treatment success was chosen as PSS decreasing &#x02265;1, PIS decreasing &#x02265;2, and the overall impression score as the same or better on day 28 compared to day 0. Each of these scores (PSS and PIS) are mean values of 4 and 6 questions, respectively, and therefore a decrease represents an improvement in several questions in each score. Results of the study show that 48.1% of grapiprant&#x02010;treated dogs were classified as treatment successes compared to 31.3% of placebo&#x02010;treated dogs, a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .0315). In addition, to be enrolled in the present study, dogs had to have both PIS and PSS &#x02265;2. Only 1 other study has been conducted using the same enrollment and success criteria as its outcome.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> In an analysis of a placebo&#x02010;controlled, randomized, masked study of the treatment carprofen daily for 14 days compared to a placebo (n = 116 dogs), similar results were seen, with 45.6% of carprofen&#x02010;treated dogs classified as treatment successes, compared to 23.7% of placebo&#x02010;treated dogs. Because these 2 studies are the only studies in which these exact success criteria were used (albeit the present study was a 28&#x02010;day study, whereas the carprofen study was a 14&#x02010;day study) they represent a valid comparison of these 2 treatments for OA in dogs.</p><p>Less than 50% of the dogs were considered treatment successes in these studies because the definition of treatment success required a decrease in mean scores &#x02265;1 (pain severity) and &#x02265;2 (pain interference), which is rigorous. A decrease in the mean score requires that the majority of the questions need to improve by &#x02265;1 categories. Decreases in the PIS and PSS by &#x0003c; 1 point each are also meaningful to the owner, but to maximize the power of the analysis, we chose the above definition of treatment success in our study.</p><p>Other drugs for the treatment of OA in dogs have been evaluated using a variety of effectiveness measurements, including various owner questionnaires, veterinary assessments, and objective measurements of gait analysis (eg, force plate). Efforts have been made to evaluate the evidence in these studies based on quality of study design, including masking, randomization, number of animals included, and statistical power.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Many of these clinical studies have been reviewed with the overall conclusion that, regardless of method of evaluation, the cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting drugs show effectiveness for the treatment of pain associated with OA in dogs.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Specifically, drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of the pain and inflammation associated with OA in dogs have demonstrated effectiveness in randomized clinical studies, either compared to another approved drug or a placebo.</p><p>Our study indicates that the EP4 receptor antagonist drug grapiprant showed effectiveness comparable to cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting NSAIDS. Whether the production of PGE<sub>2</sub> is inhibited using a cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor or the target EP4 receptor responsible for pain and inflammation is blocked, the end clinical effect would likely be comparable.</p><p>Cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting drugs used in dogs with OA produce their effect by lowering circulating concentrations of all prostanoids, including PGE<sub>2</sub>. Grapiprant directly binds the EP4 receptor and blocks PGE<sub>2</sub> from exerting its biological effect. By blocking the binding of PGE<sub>2</sub> to its receptor, the signaling pathway for pain and inflammation is interrupted. Thus, grapiprant and other EP4 receptor antagonists would be expected to have similar efficacy to appropriate doses of cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting NSAIDs in the treatment of OA in dogs. The approach of specifically targeting the EP4 receptor may result in other benefits, because other off&#x02010;target effects caused by a decrease in prostanoids and needed for normal physiological function (as seen with the cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting class of drugs) would not be expected with grapiprant.</p><p>Although in most dogs the chronic use of cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting drugs PO at label dosages is well tolerated,<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> several adverse effects, some serious, have been associated with these drugs such as GI, renal, and hepatic toxicity.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> The true incidence of cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting NSAID&#x02010;induced adverse effects in animals is unknown,<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> but likely is underestimated.</p><p>In our study, grapiprant treatment resulted in a higher frequency of vomiting compared to placebo treatment. Most occurrences were mild and sporadic, and none prompted owners to remove their dogs from the study. This finding, and the slight increase in diarrhea or soft stool and anorexia or inappetence when compared to the placebo&#x02010;treated group, indicates mild effects on the GI system. These mild, transient GI effects were also noted in a 9&#x02010;month safety study in which grapiprant was administered daily to Beagle dogs at up to a dosage that was equivalent to 15 times the clinical dosage.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> In this long&#x02010;term, high&#x02010;dose study, occasional soft&#x02010;formed or mucus&#x02010;containing stools and rare occurrences of vomiting were observed in all groups, including controls, with a higher incidence in grapiprant&#x02010;treated dogs. None of the dogs required treatment for these mild GI signs. In that study, grapiprant did not cause GI ulceration or perforation as has been seen in dogs treated with cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting NSAIDS.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Grapiprant&#x02010;related histopathological changes in this 9&#x02010;month study were limited to 1 animal in the 50 mg/kg group (equivalent to 30.5 mg/kg of tablet formulation)<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> that had mild regeneration of the mucosal epithelium of the ileum. The lack of GI pathology is not surprising, given that grapiprant blocks only the PGE<sub>2</sub> EP4 receptor, leaving the other PGE<sub>2</sub> and prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>) receptor pathways intact, both of which are important in GI homeostasis.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> In our study as well as the 9&#x02010;month high&#x02010;dose study, no effects on the liver or kidney were observed in clinical pathology evaluations.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that it did not evaluate the effectiveness and safety of grapiprant for &#x0003e;28 days. Additionally, no objective measurement of lameness was conducted, such as force plate analysis. However, the CBPI tool is validated for use by owners to identify changes in pain in dogs with OA, whereas no force plate measurement had been validated for this application. Grapiprant, like the cyclooxygenase&#x02010;inhibiting NSAIDS, decreases inflammation, but clinical studies generally do not include a direct measurement of inflammation (eg, histopathological evidence). The only measurement of inflammation in our study was the subjective evaluation by the veterinarian of joint swelling as part of the TOS. A decrease in inflammation would be expected to occur in grapiprant&#x02010;treated dogs, based on its mechanism of action, and data seen in rodent models.<xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13948-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Veterinary assessment was based on the evaluation of a single joint chosen by the veterinarian as the joint that in his or her opinion was most severely affected. Given that OA is most commonly a multijoint condition, choosing only 1 joint for evaluation may have either under&#x02010; or overestimated the effect of grapiprant. However, given the 1 : 1 randomization, this potential bias would be equally likely in both groups. Another limitation of this study was that, given the study size, it is unlikely that rare adverse events would have been detected. Wider clinical use is required to fully evaluate the risk versus benefit of any new therapeutic agent.</p><p>Our study clearly indicates that the EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist, grapiprant, when given daily at a dosage of 2 mg/kg for 28 days to dogs with OA, results in demonstrable owner&#x02010; and veterinarian&#x02010;assessed improvement in clinical signs when compared to placebo. Furthermore, in dogs of different ages and breeds with concomitant clinical conditions and receiving other medications, grapiprant&#x02010;related adverse events were mild and transient, and no SAEs were seen. These data, therefore, support the conclusion that the EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist, grapiprant, represents a promising new treatment modality for the pain and inflammation associated with OA in dogs.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim13948-sec-0028"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge Sean Matthews for assistance with statistical analysis and the staff at AlcheraBio for assistance in conducting the study.</p><p>
