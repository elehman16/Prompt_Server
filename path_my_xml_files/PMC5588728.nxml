One of the most significant and clinically relevant vector-borne diseases in dogs is known as piroplasmosis or babesiosis, caused mainly by <italic>Babesia canis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The clinical signs associated with canine babesiosis vary from a mild transient illness to acute disease due to severe haemolysis that potentially leads to mortality. Clinical findings include anorexia, pale mucous membranes, icterus, pyrexia, and splenic enlargement. Next to these clinical signs, babesiosis in dogs is diagnosed by microscopy, IFAT or PCR or a combination of these techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The protozoan parasite <italic>B. canis</italic> is transmitted mainly by adult <italic>Dermacentor reticulatus</italic> ticks, also known as the ornate dog tick. After <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>, <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> is the second most prevalent tick species in central Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although its prevalence varies depending on local environmental conditions, the distribution of <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> is expanding northwards in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For example, recent reports indicate that <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> has become widely established in Wales and South East England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to increased international travel of pets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], climate change as well as changes in land use and host distribution, contribute to the expanding tick distribution. Furthermore, the total duration of tick questing activity over the year and the presence of <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> in winter months was shown to have increased in Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Germany, Slovenia, Hungary and Slovakia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In parallel with the geographical expansion of its vector, <italic>B. canis</italic> is increasingly reported in new endemic foci, for example in UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of canine babesiosis is reported to be high in those regions where the tick is known to be common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The expansion of <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> and the findings of significant <italic>B. canis</italic> infection rates justify the recommendation for year-round tick control measures in these areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several treatments are known to kill <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> ticks and reduce <italic>B. canis</italic> transmission. In addition to the topically applied contact acaricides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], systemic isoxazoline compounds have been shown to prevent <italic>B. canis</italic> transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of a single treatment with sarolaner (Simparica&#x000ae;; Zoetis) at the minimum recommended label dose of 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg in the prevention of <italic>B. canis</italic> transmission when dogs are challenged with infected <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> ticks 21 and 28&#x000a0;days after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and ethical review</title><p id="Par7">In total, 24 dogs (14 males and 10 females) were enrolled in the study.

Several controls were included in the PCR, confirming that: (i) there was no PCR inhibition (internal control); (ii) the PCR mastermix was not contaminated with DNA (no template control); (iii) the primers in the mastermix performed adequately (positive control); (iv) canine DNA did not yield a false positive amplification product (negative control); (v) that the DNA extraction did not introduce DNA contamination (extraction control). A 100% efficacy (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0002) in the prevention of canine babesiosis was demonstrated, as no dogs tested positive for both IFAT and PCR during the study.The geometric (arithmetic) acaricidal efficacy was 93.0% (87.9%) and 94.6% (93.6%) on day 29 in group 2 and 3, respectively. On days 30 and 33, no live ticks were found on any of the treated dogs. Therefore, acaricidal efficacy was 100% in both treatment groups. The <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> tick counts were significantly lower (t-test: 6.88&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;<italic>t</italic>

Previously, sarolaner was shown to be efficacious in blocking the transmission of <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> and <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> by <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the current study, the ability of sarolaner to prevent the transmission of <italic>B. canis</italic>, causing one of the clinically most significant tick-borne diseases in dogs, was evaluated. Sarolaner is known to be highly effective against ticks, with a persistent efficacy of at least five weeks after a single treatment at the minimum recommended label dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, a single treatment with sarolaner provides efficacy within 24&#x000a0;h for five weeks against <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As such, sarolaner treatment has the potential to prevent <italic>B. canis</italic> transmission, as it takes 48 to 72&#x000a0;h after tick attachment for <italic>B. canis</italic> to be transmitted from an infected tick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The rapid and consistent acaricidal efficacy of sarolaner against <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> was confirmed in the present study and indeed resulted in the prevention of <italic>B. canis</italic> transmission even at the end of the monthly dosing interval.</p><p id="Par22">The experimental infection model used in this study was previously developed and described for the evaluation of the prevention of <italic>B. canis</italic> transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The advantage of an experimental model is that the challenge load can be standardized for all dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which is not the case under field conditions. A high number (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;50) of ticks was used for infestation and ticks had a high (25%) infection rate with <italic>B. canis</italic>. In previous studies, infection rates of 8% to 16% were reported in experiments evaluating the efficacy of systemic products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and between 2% and 44% in studies evaluating the efficacy of topically applied acaricides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the field, the <italic>B. canis</italic> prevalence in individual <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> ticks in Europe has been reported to be between 2.3% and 14.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The severe challenge, the evaluation of the efficacy towards the end of the treatment period and the treatment at the minimum recommended label dose in the current study, allowed evaluating a worst case scenario for <italic>B. canis</italic> transmission. In other studies with systemic acaricides, such as afoxolaner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and fluralaner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the commercial band dosing was used.</p><p id="Par23">In the current study, all placebo-treated animals developed clinical symptoms within one week after tick infestation. As <italic>B. canis</italic> infects the red blood cells and causes haemolysis, potentially resulting in severe disease and death, these dogs were immediately treated after they displayed clinical symptoms and tested positive by blood smear. The treatment did not impede the PCR diagnosis as the blood samples of all placebo-treated animals yielded an amplification product seven days after the infestation. Furthermore, all placebo-treated animals seroconverted. The infection pressure in this study was thus adequate to transmit <italic>B. canis</italic> infestation and cause clinical disease within a week after infestation.</p><p id="Par24">As in a number of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] a dog was considered as <italic>B. canis</italic>-positive if both IFAT and PCR testing indicated infection. In the current study, a faint PCR amplification product was detected in 9 blood samples taken from sarolaner-treated dogs 21&#x000a0;days after infestation. The faint banding, as well as the inconsistent amplification in two consecutive PCR runs, suggests the presence of a low amount of template DNA in these samples. Although all PCR controls indicated that contamination during the DNA extraction or during PCR did not occur, DNA contamination of the blood sample prior to the start of the DNA extraction cannot unequivocally be excluded. Alternatively, the faint amplification products may result from the transmission of a low number of mature <italic>B. canis</italic> sporozoites present in the salivary glands of the ticks used for infestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Under normal life-cycle conditions, the tick&#x02019;s attachment to the host&#x02019;s skin initiates the maturation of the sporozoites in the salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Under experimental conditions the maturation of sporozoites may be induced before the tick attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], leading to a shorter transmission time than under field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The potential transmission of a low number of sporozoites did however not result in clinical disease, and none of these nine sarolaner-treated dogs seroconverted which would be expected in the event of successful transmission of viable protozoons, even at a low infective dose. Schetters et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] indeed described that the onset of the immune response after <italic>B. canis</italic> infection but not the infection dynamics are dependent on the initial infectious dose. The extended follow-up for 42&#x000a0;days following infestation ensured that the sarolaner-treated animals with a faint PCR amplification product in the samples collected 21&#x000a0;days after infestations did indeed not seroconvert.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par25">The current study confirms the rapid and consistent acaricidal efficacy of sarolaner against <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> and its ability to prevent canine babesiosis caused by <italic>B. canis,</italic> under high challenge conditions and at the minimum recommended label dose. The persistent efficacy and rapid speed of kill for five weeks provided by sarolaner ensures a continued protection against tick infestation and subsequently against pathogen transmission in a monthly treatment regime.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the animal caretakers for their contribution to the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par26">The study reported here was funded by Zoetis.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par27">The data supporting the conclusions of the study can be reviewed upon request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors assisted with the study design, study conduct, interpretation of the data and manuscript writing.
