The direct relationship has been established between plaque levels and the severity of periodontal diseases. The most rational methodology toward the prevention of periodontal diseases would be regular, effective removal of plaque by the personal oral hygiene protocol.</p><p>Procedures for plaque control include mechanical and chemical means. Mechanical means include brushing, flossing, use of interdental cleansing aids, and oral prophylaxis. These methods have proved to be very time-consuming and their effectiveness would depend on skills and technique of the individual carrying out these procedures. The fact that most people experience difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of plaque control particularly at interproximal sites necessitates the use of chemicals for control of plaque. Thus, chemical plaque control can be used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control procedures.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Recently, a number of chemical agents have been advocated such as essential oils, fluorides, bisbiguanides, sanguinarine, quaternary ammonium salts, and triclosan which are either available in a toothpaste/dentifrices or in the form of a mouthwash. Among them, chlorhexidine is regarded as gold standard in dentistry for the prevention of dental plaque. The various mouthwashes available today are having certain side effects and are also expensive. Chlorhexidine mouthwash though very effective also has certain side effects such as brown discoloration of the teeth, oral mucosal erosion, and bitter taste.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, there is a requirement was felt of an alternative medicine that could provide a product already enmeshed within the traditional Indian set-up and is also safe and economical.</p><p>Turmeric commonly known as &#x0201c;<italic>Haldi</italic>&#x0201d; is a popular spice frequently used in Indian foods and curry.

The results indicated that two daily application with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate effectively prevented plaque formation. In our study, chlorhexidine gel showed a significant reduction in the mean plaque score at 0, 14<sup>th</sup>, and 21<sup>st</sup> day from baseline similar to the study by L&#x000f6;e and Schiott.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This may be because of the anti-plaque property of chlorhexidine gluconate and concentration used in our study was 0.2%, and routine oral hygiene were also advised. The study carried out by Francetti <italic>et al</italic>. showed the similar anti-plaque activity of chlorhexidine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Our results related to turmeric are consistent with a study carried out by Bhandari and Shankwalker[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] where turmeric was used as a mouth wash. Reduction in mean PI was observed from 0 to 21<sup>st</sup> day. In our study, similar results were obtained with subjects using turmeric gel. This may be because of the anti-plaque effect of turmeric. A comparable anti-plaque effect was found with turmeric and chlorhexidine mouthwash in our study. This may be because of turmeric, which was in pure and completely water-soluble form, so the available concentration was more, and it may also be because of its anti-plaque property. Significant plaque reduction from the baseline to day 14 and to day 21 was observed with both the mouthwashes. Comparing the mean PI between the groups, the PI did not differ (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) between the two groups at baseline.

This may be due to the property of substantivity of chlorhexidine and also the action of chlorhexidine at different levels of plaque formation. Though independently turmeric showed anti-plaque effect, in comparison to chlorhexidine it was observed to be less effective.</p><p>In our study, the anti-inflammatory action of turmeric was evaluated on clinical parameters using the GI and SBI, which showed a significant reduction.

In the above studies, in relation to turmeric anti-inflammatory effect was observed but not in relation with the gingiva. In the present study, anti-inflammatory effect of turmeric was evaluated on clinical parameters using GI and SBI.</p><p>The possible mechanism of action of turmeric as an anti-inflammatory agent could be due to the inhibitory action of inflammatory mediators of arachidonic acid metabolism. It selectively inhibits synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane while not affecting synthesis of prostacyclin. Turmeric, by virtue of its anti-inflammatory property reduces inflammatory mediators and causes shrinkage by reducing inflammatory edema and vascular engorgement of connective tissue.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It has also been shown that <italic>curcumin</italic> incorporated in collagen which acts as a supportive matrix for slow release increases wound reduction and enhances cellular proliferation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Based on the observations of our study, it can be concluded that chlorhexidine gluconate, as well as turmeric gel, can be effectively used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control in the prevention of plaque and gingivitis.
