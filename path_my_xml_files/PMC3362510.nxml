Using the Internet to provide psychodynamic treatments is one way of improving access to psychological treatments for MDD. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of an Internet-based psychodynamic guided self-help treatment for MDD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ninety-two participants who were diagnosed with MDD according to the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were randomised to treatment or an active control. The treatment consisted of nine treatment modules based on psychodynamic principles with online therapist contact. The active control condition was a structured support intervention and contained psychoeducation and scheduled weekly contacts online. Both interventions lasted for 10 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mixed-effects model analyses of all randomised participants showed that participants receiving Internet-based PDT made large and superior improvements compared with the active control group on the BDI-II (between-group Cohen's <italic>d</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.11).

Several forms of psychotherapy have been found to be effective in the treatment of MDD <xref rid="pone.0038021-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Among these, cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT) has a strong empirical base <xref rid="pone.0038021-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have found that it is possible to deliver CBT as Internet-based guided self-help <xref rid="pone.0038021-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and an increasing number of studies show that this treatment format can be as effective as face-to-face CBT for mild to moderate MDD and anxiety disorders <xref rid="pone.0038021-Cuijpers2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Guided Internet treatments have provided a way to reach out to more patients in a manner that in most cases requires less therapist time <xref rid="pone.0038021-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) is another psychological treatment that is effective for depression <xref rid="pone.0038021-Driessen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, it is not known if it is possible to deliver PDT for MDD as guided self-help via the Internet. To our knowledge, no trial on Internet-delivered PDT has been published. It is important to examine if Internet-delivered PDT is effective, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, since patients may prefer it above CBT. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a 10-week psychodynamic treatment for MDD, delivered in the form of guided self-help via the Internet. We compared the treatment to an active control condition that consisted of psychoeducation and scheduled support, also given for 10 weeks via the Internet. Significant within-group effects were expected for both conditions, but the effects for the treatment group were expected to be larger on measures of depression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Board of Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden.

Participants were recruited nationally through an advertisement in a major Swedish newspaper two weeks before the treatment began. Additional participants were recruited from a waiting list for another treatment trial for depression. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Board of Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants during the online screening. Inclusion criteria for the study were a) being at least 18 years old, b) having a total score in the range of 15 to 35 on the self-rated version of the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) <xref rid="pone.0038021-Svanborg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, c) no assessed risk of suicidality (see below for details), d) if on medication, unchanged dosage of psychiatric medication during the three months preceding the screening, e) no concurrent psychological treatment, f) not having other primary disorders that needed different treatments or that could be affected negatively by the treatment, g) a diagnosis of MDD according to the DSM-IV, with current acute episode of depression or an episode in partial remission.</p><p>Applicants to the study were instructed to complete an online screening containing demographical questions and the outcome measures described below. A participant was contacted for a telephone-based diagnostic interview if he or she had completed the screening and met the initial inclusion criteria. In the telephone interview, diagnostic questions about depression and anxiety disorders were asked in addition to questions about use of medications and psychological treatments. Additionally, an assessment of suicidal ideation was conducted.</p><p>Six final semester-M.Sc. clinical psychology students who had been trained in the diagnostic procedures conducted the interviews. To ensure reliability and quality in the procedure, a psychiatrist was available for consultation during the entire assessment phase. Before a participant was included, the psychiatrist and the senior researcher reviewed the screening results and the interview protocol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038021-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the participant flow throughout the trial and reasons for exclusion.

Similarly, this intervention lasted for 10 weeks. During the first week of support, all participants received text material on depression. The text was 15 pages long and contained general information about depression, including DSM-IV criteria, epidemiology and treatment alternatives. All participants were assigned to an individual therapist who provided the support. Every Monday the participants were contacted by the therapist and were asked questions about the previous week. The therapists were instructed to give support, but not to use any specific psychological techniques other than basic therapeutic skills such as empathic listening and asking further question to help the clients to express their experiences and emotions. In addition to the scheduled online support, the participants could send messages to the therapists at any time during the week and were then given response within 24 hours during weekdays. The intervention given to this group was similar to how non-directive supportive therapies have been described <xref rid="pone.0038021-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

All therapists had completed their clinical training as well as 16 weeks of internship. Each therapist was responsible for 7 to 8 treatment participants from the treatment group and an equal number of participants from the control group. Therapists were randomly allocated to participants, with the restriction of not having more than 8 participants from each group. For the entire duration of the study the therapists received continuous supervision from an experienced psychotherapist with psychodynamic orientation, who had previous experience of the psychodynamic treatment manual. Typically, supervision consisted of examination of specific online interactions as well as more general therapeutic issues. Clients from both groups were discussed during supervision. During treatment, the therapists also had the possibility to consult the psychiatrist, e.g. on medication issues or if a participant expressed suicidal ideation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Data analyses</title><p>All analyses were performed using SPSS 19 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Independent <italic>t</italic>-tests and <italic>&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup></italic>-tests were used to test for group differences in demographics, pre-treatment data and in clinical significant improvement. Differences between the psychodynamic treatment and the structured support were primarily investigated by modelling interaction effects of group and time. In order to adhere to the intention-to-treat principle, the continuous outcome variables were analysed using mixed effects models, given their ability to handle missing data <xref rid="pone.0038021-Gueorguieva1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. All analyses used Maximum Likelihood estimation. Random intercept models were selected for all measures except for the BDI-II. Group, time and their interaction were included as predictors in these models. For the BDI-II, where weekly measures were available, several models were compared using available information criteria, and the model with best fit was chosen. This model included a fixed linear effect of time with a random intercept and slope. The covariance between the random intercept and slope was not significant, so it was not included in the model. Error terms across time were modelled with a first-order autoregressive covariance structure with heterogeneous variances. Differences in average rates of growth between the two groups were examined by a fixed effects interaction between group and time. Between-group differences at post-treatment were analysed using independent <italic>t</italic>-tests.

The treatment was compared to an active control in the form of a supportive treatment that contained psychoeducation and scheduled online contacts. The main finding was that participants who received psychodynamic treatment improved more than those who received the scheduled support. Between-group effect sizes on measures of depression were large and the treatment effects were maintained at the 10-month follow-up. The results indicate that psychodynamic guided self-help is effective in the treatment of depression and that it is possible to deliver psychodynamic therapy via the Internet.</p><p>When developing the psychodynamic guided self-help treatment, we made the assumption that the core ingredients of psychodynamic theory could be retained. Internet-based treatments still involves therapist contact, albeit different from face-to-face treatment. The treatment manual aimed to preserve the psychodynamic principles and was derived from a book by an experienced psychoanalyst <xref rid="pone.0038021-Silverberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>One fundamental aspect of psychodynamic psychotherapy is the therapeutic relationship <xref rid="pone.0038021-Blagys1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A therapist contact of 10 to 15 minutes per week and client may seem insufficient to establish a strong relationship. However, the therapists acted in a personal manner and aimed to build a strong therapeutic alliance, e.g. by using supportive techniques and by answering any messages within 24 hours. Although alliance was not directly measured in this study, it is known that a strong therapist-client alliance can be established in Internet-based treatments <xref rid="pone.0038021-Knaevelsrud1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, even when the therapist contact is brief <xref rid="pone.0038021-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Consequently, this treatment seems to be more supportive than expressive, using the supportive-expressive distinction established by Luborsky <xref rid="pone.0038021-Luborsky1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Since all communication in the guided self-help treatment was in a medium similar to e-mail, it was neither possible for the therapists to do any in-session exploration of the clients' affective experience nor any interpretation of transference processes, which are interventions which distinguishes psychodynamic face-to-face treatments from e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy <xref rid="pone.0038021-Blagys1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>The psychodynamic guided self-help treatment had a continuous focus on identifying affective, cognitive and interpersonal patterns that had led to problematic behaviour for the client. Furthermore, several treatment modules had an emphasis on past experiences as well as on interpersonal experiences. These are also typical elements of psychodynamic therapy <xref rid="pone.0038021-Blagys1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. While not including homework in the classical sense, the treatment modules contained descriptions of techniques that the participants were encouraged to apply in their own lives. This focus and encouragement of activities outside-of-session is traditionally associated with cognitive-behavioural treatments <xref rid="pone.0038021-Blagys2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, but in actual practice many psychodynamic practitioners tend to use homework <xref rid="pone.0038021-Kazantzis1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Ten weeks are indeed an unusually short duration for a psychodynamic treatment, making it reasonable to question if such a treatment is possible to conduct in such a short time. It is possible that the decrease in symptoms may have continued for the treatment group if the treatment had been longer than 10 weeks. However, results from the Sheffield studies have shown comparable effects between 8- and 16-week psychodynamic therapy, indicating that psychodynamic treatment indeed can be as short as 10 weeks and that longer therapy may not necessarily result in larger effects <xref rid="pone.0038021-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>There are limitations that must be addressed. First, the participants were recruited from the community and we cannot be sure that this treatment would work in a clinical setting, e.g. an outpatient psychiatric facility. However, mean depression severity as measured by the BDI-II at intake (<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26.51) is close to the limit of 29 that Beck proposes for severe depression <xref rid="pone.0038021-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and the fact that a majority of the participants had a comorbid anxiety disorder seems to parallel clinical reality <xref rid="pone.0038021-Kessler3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A second related concern was the large number of participants who had college- or university level education. This might bias generalizability of the results, since it is possible that guided self-help is especially well suited for educated clients. However, there are data indicating that 50% of patients seeking psychotherapy have some college education <xref rid="pone.0038021-Vessey1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and that educated patients may be more inclined to seek help for mental health problems <xref rid="pone.0038021-Howard1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>As a third limitation, we allowed the participants to have a parallel treatment of medication if stable for three months, which was true for 25% of the participants. This is common procedure in previous trials from our group (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0038021-Andersson2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). Medication status was unrelated to change on the BDI-II in this trial, but we cannot rule out that there was a small additive effect of medication in the sample.</p><p>A fourth limitation that needs to be addressed concerns the therapists in the study who all were psychologists in training, albeit during the last semester of training in a five year program and under regular supervision. There are some indications in the literature that students may be less effective as therapists when conducting face-to-face therapy <xref rid="pone.0038021-Cuijpers3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore it is not possible to rule out that experienced psychotherapists would have performed even better. However, this can be contrasted with recent indications that a computer technician can conduct Internet-based CBT as good as a clinician <xref rid="pone.0038021-Titov1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These recent results call for further research on who can conduct guided self-help treatments.</p><p>A related concern is that psychologists in training conducted all diagnostic interviews. Although the M.I.N.I. was designed to be administered by non-experts <xref rid="pone.0038021-Sheehan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, there is a possibility that the study sample could have been more adequately defined. The interviewers were all trained in the procedure, but there were no procedures to ensure inter-rater reliability, which is a further limitation. The lack of blinding is also an important limitation, as it may have biased the results on the clinical interviews. Future studies should make use of more formal training in diagnostic procedures and blinding of assessors.</p><p>There are some implications of this study in addition to the aforementioned. While a significant number of randomised controlled trials have been conducted investigating the effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy, there has been a recent call for high quality, adequately powered trials targeting specific disorders <xref rid="pone.0038021-Gerber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. As pointed out by Connolly Gibbons, Crits-Christoph and Hearon <xref rid="pone.0038021-ConnollyGibbons1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, there is no trial on depression that demonstrates the superiority of a manualised psychodynamic monotherapy over a control condition or another treatment. In that respect, one implication of this study is that it adds to the empirical base of psychodynamic treatment of depression. This study indicates that psychodynamic treatment might be on par with other treatments for depression. However, before any further conclusions are drawn, the results need to be replicated in other sites. In addition, direct comparisons to other established bona fide treatments (e.g., cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy) need to be conducted.</p><p>This study also shows that psychodynamic psychotherapy is possible to deliver as guided self-help, which naturally has implications for dissemination of psychotherapy in general. There is a lack of psychodynamic therapy in other treatment formats than individual and group. Using the Internet format of delivery makes it possible to reach individuals who lack access to therapists nearby, or who simply do not want to meet face-to-face.</p><p>The availability of psychodynamic treatments that are possible to deliver via the Internet may also influence therapists' attitudes towards Internet treatments. There are some indications that CBT therapists may have a more positive attitude towards Internet-based treatments than therapists with psychoanalytic orientation <xref rid="pone.0038021-Mora1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038021-Wangberg1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus, one implication of this study is that psychodynamic/psychoanalytic therapists in general may become more positive towards this treatment modality, which in the long run could mean that more patients get access to evidence-based treatments.</p><p>In summary, this trial demonstrates the efficacy of a treatment that presents psychodynamic principles in self-help text, accompanied by encrypted e-mail contact with a therapist working in a supportive fashion and aiming to build a strong alliance. The findings from this study add to the empirical base of psychodynamic treatments for depression and indicate that it is indeed possible to conduct psychodynamic treatment as guided self-help via the Internet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0038021.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
