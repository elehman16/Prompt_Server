We hypothesised that use of rapid MRSA detection followed by contact precautions and single room isolation would reduce MRSA acquisition.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a pre-planned prospective interrupted time series comparing rapid PCR detection and use of long sleeved gowns and gloves (contact precautions) plus single room isolation or cohorting of MRSA colonised patients with a control group. The study took place in a medical-surgical intensive care unit of a tertiary adult hospital between May 21<sup>st</sup> 2007 and September 21<sup>st</sup> 2009. The primary outcome was the rate of MRSA acquisition. A segmented regression analysis was performed to determine the trend in MRSA acquisition rates before and after the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>The rate of MRSA acquisition was 18.5 per 1000 at risk patient days in the control phase and 7.9 per 1000 at-risk patient days in the intervention phase, with an adjusted hazard ratio 0.39 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.62). Segmented regression analysis showed a decline in MRSA acquisition of 7% per month in the intervention phase, (95%CI 1.9% to 12.8% reduction) which was a significant change in slope compared with the control phase. Secondary analysis found prior exposure to anaerobically active antibiotics and colonization pressure were associated with increased acquisition risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Contact precautions with single room isolation or cohorting were associated with a 60% reduction in MRSA acquisition. While this study was a quasi-experimental design, many measures were taken to strengthen the study, such as accounting for differences in colonisation pressure, hand hygiene compliance and individual risk factors across the groups, and confining the study to one centre to reduce variation in transmission. Use of two research nurses may limit its generalisability to units in which this level of support is available.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/">http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/</ext-link> (Project Grant number 454495); the Victorian Department of Human Services, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.health.vic.gov.au/">http://www.health.vic.gov.au/</ext-link> (Public Health Research Project award); a Sylvia and Charles Viertel Charitable Foundation Clinical Investigatorship, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anz.com/anztrustees">www.anz.com/anztrustees</ext-link>; and a Victor Hurley Medical Research Fund Grant-in-Aid.

Recently, some have questioned strategies that target individual healthcare-associated pathogens, as they are time and resource intensive, compared with using generic population-based interventions, such as hand hygiene, antibiotic stewardship, and care bundles <xref rid="pone.0058112-Wenzel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058112-Kirkland1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

For example, results from the paper proposing that a &#x0201c;program of universal surveillance, contact precautions, hand hygiene, and institutional culture change was associated with a decrease in health care&#x02013;associated transmissions of and infections with MRSA in a large health care system&#x0201d; have been challenged by mathematical modelling suggesting that the control program could have only contributed marginally to the reduction in infections that was reported <xref rid="pone.0058112-Gurieva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Despite guidelines intended to raise standards of reporting and research, the infection control literature remains methodologically poor with inadequate data and inappropriate analyses common <xref rid="pone.0058112-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Only one study that we are aware of has examined the effectiveness of isolation precautions alone. This study found that single room isolation with glove and gown use could modestly reduce MRSA transmission, although the estimate has considerable uncertainty and the study did not account for other factors such as hand hygiene compliance <xref rid="pone.0058112-Kypraios1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>At our institution, MRSA is endemic. Contact precautions are not usually used when managing MRSA colonised patients. Neither active surveillance nor contact precautions are mandated in the state of Victoria. We performed a quasi-experimental research study in our intensive care unit (ICU) population between May 21<sup>st</sup> 2007 and September 21<sup>st</sup> 2009. Our hypothesis was that MRSA acquisition would be reduced if single room isolation (or cohorting) accompanied by use of gowns and gloves for MRSA colonized/infected patients (identified via active surveillance using rapid detection methods) were used in an ICU compared with a pre-intervention control group in whom these precautions were not used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design overview</title><p>This study was a planned, prospective interrupted time series, with a pre-specified date for change in management after 14 months of study, not related to outcome measures. The study was formally implemented as a research study with predefined protocol and endpoints and was initiated by the researchers with no institutional imperative. The study was performed to answer one specific question and the intervention was not influenced or triggered by rates of MRSA, clinical outcomes or any other unspecified influence. The study took place between May 21<sup>st</sup> 2007 and September 21<sup>st</sup> 2009, with a change-over date of 21<sup>st</sup> July 2008.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) is a university-affiliated tertiary adult hospital with 350 beds. The medical-surgical ICU consists of 24 beds, six single and 18 open-bay. Surgical patients, consisting of trauma, cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, and general specialities, comprise 70% of ICU admissions. Other specialities at RMH include haematology/oncology, bone marrow transplantation and renal transplantation. Post-operative cardiothoracic surgery patients are admitted to this ICU routinely for monitoring. Nurse-to-patient ratios in ICU are 1&#x02236;1 except for patients in step-down care for whom the ratios are 1&#x02236;2. The infection control service made regular visits to the ICU during the study period.</p><p>Consecutive patients admitted to the RMH ICU during the study period were included. The study observed 4317 patients, admitted 4781 times. The source of admission was from home in 80% of patients, a chronic care institution in 1% and other hospitals for the remainder. The crude mortality rate of patients was 7.6%.</p><p>The study was approved by the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee. The committee did not require that individual patient consent be sought as the study was considered to be a quality improvement initiative.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Screening and intervention</title><p>In both study phases, patients were screened for MRSA, but results were not specifically acted upon in the control phase. Results were available to clinicians but no specific infection control precautions were used; instead patients with MRSA colonization were managed according to usual hospital practice, as follows. Staff were required to wear plastic aprons for all patient contact. Contact precautions were not routinely used when caring for MRSA colonized or infected patients and isolation/cohorting was not practiced. On the rare occasion where a patient was deemed to be likely to shed high quantities of MRSA, such as an MRSA positive wound with discharge that could not be contained, he/she would be cared for with contact precautions and isolation/cohorting, although this almost never occurred. Use of alcohol-based hand rub solution (ABHRS) was hospital policy for hand disinfection. Hand hygiene was actively promoted, with regular compliance monitoring and feedback. MRSA decolonization was not routinely used. Antibiotic management of patients in the ICU was not altered for the purposes of the study.</p><p>In the intervention phase, results of MRSA screening were conveyed to the ward by telephone and colonized patients were cared for using contact precautions and isolation/cohorting, detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058112-t001">Table 1</xref>. The only change during the study period was introduction of the study intervention. During both phases of the study, research nurses were employed to ensure compliance with swabbing, contact precautions and isolation/cohorting as well as data collection. During most of the study, this involved seven days per week of nursing time.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0058112-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0058112.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Study characteristics and intervention.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0058112-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0058112.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

Swabs were cultured in both phases. In the intervention phase, swabs were additionally processed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Culture results were used to determine the study outcome (MRSA acquisition) in both phases. PCR results were used only to determine isolation status of patients during the intervention phase and were not used in outcome calculations to ensure that detection bias did not occur if PCR and culture had different sensitivities for detecting MRSA. If a patient was detected to be MRSA positive either via clinical culture or screening swab culture, this was also used to determine isolation status (although most patients that were positive on clinical culture had already been detected using PCR and were thus already in contact precautions). During the intervention phase, positive results obtained via PCR or via culture were telephoned through to the ICU when available and patients were placed in contact precautions as soon as possible.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Hand hygiene and infection control compliance monitoring</title><p>Observations of compliance with hand hygiene and infection control precautions were made for one hour per week on most weeks throughout the study.

The study had an 80% power to detect a significant difference in hazard with a two tailed P value of 0.05, assuming a hazard ratio of 0.5.

As such we determined to continue the pre-intervention observation phase until at least 12 months or at least 50 acquisitions were observed, whichever was the longer period. A review at 11 months determined the threshold of 50 acquisitions had not been reached and both phases were reset to a 14 month duration.

This study is unique as it tested a single intervention that was instituted as a planned prospective research study, with the analysis taking into account serial dependence that inevitably occurs when studying communicable diseases in a confined setting. Segmented regression demonstrated that there was no trend in MRSA acquisition rates prior to the intervention phase, but there was both a drop in acquisition rates immediately after the intervention and further decline during the intervention phase.</p><p>The secondary findings from this study are of interest, but are not intended to suggest causal associations. Anaerobically active agents were the only antibiotic class that was associated with MRSA acquisition in the multivariate analysis. This is unexpected, but may suggest an effect on resident flora, as has been shown with VRE <xref rid="pone.0058112-Donskey1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The association of high bed occupancy with reduced MRSA acquisition warrants further consideration. High ward occupancy may lead to fewer contacts per patient which has been predicted by some models to lead to lower transmission of infection <xref rid="pone.0058112-McBryde1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>PFGE of the MRSA isolates showed the presence of multiple clones with several predominating at different times. Therefore there appears to be no outbreak of a single PFGE type during the study, but rather importation (and possibly onward transmission) of several types. This is not unexpected given the relatively low acquisition rate compared with the admission prevalence.</p><p>We employed research nurses to optimise compliance with the intervention. This however, means that the results may not be generalizable to other institutions where this level of support is not available.</p><p>A number of studies have examined the utility of active surveillance with conflicting results <xref rid="pone.0058112-Harbarth1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058112-Robicsek1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, but we have found no studies testing contact precautions in the context of rapid detection as a single intervention in a prospective, systematic way. Most of the publications reporting effectiveness of contact precautions used them as one of multiple serial interventions in observational outbreak reports <xref rid="pone.0058112-Jernigan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058112-Harbarth2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. One previous study found that patients in single room isolation had no less MRSA acquisition than those cohorted, but that study did not incorporate rapid diagnosis and contact precautions <xref rid="pone.0058112-Cepeda1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>A recent cluster randomised trial found that use of active surveillance with expanded contact precautions did not reduce transmission of MRSA <xref rid="pone.0058112-Huskins1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although this methodology is regarded as the optimal study design, that study had high baseline variation in transmission rates and delays in screening, which reduced its power. Although our study was only performed at a single centre, it took into account serial dependence, bias and clustering in the analysis by incorporating colonization pressure into the daily hazard analysis.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate how this intervention is associated with reduction in MRSA acquisition. In the intervention phase, MRSA patients spent 76.4% of their time in contact precautions and 46.5% in single rooms from the date of their first positive swab (or admission date if they were known to be colonized). Although this was less than the study aimed to achieve, the time in contact precautions was substantially higher than in the control phase, and it may have been sufficient to account for a reduction in transmission, akin to models examining improved but imperfect hand hygiene compliance <xref rid="pone.0058112-Pittet1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The study design cannot exclude temporal effects or a Hawthorne effect. However, it should be noted that the number of colonized patients entering the ICU was slightly higher in the intervention phase than the control phase, that hand hygiene compliance did not significantly change and no other interventions took place during the study.</p><p>A finding of efficacy of rapid detection and isolation/cohorting and contact precautions does not lead the authors to conclude necessarily that this intervention is essential. The costs, labour, and time requirements of this intervention were considerable. A cost-benefit analysis is currently being performed to evaluate this intervention compared with other general intervention measures. Adverse effects of isolation are not insignificant and need to be taken into account as well.</p><p>The value of the current pathogen-specific intervention is likely to be contingent on local context such as background rates of MRSA colonization and infection and community-associated MRSA rates and ability to detect MRSA and institute contact precautions rapidly. The most recent data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network showed that MRSA was responsible for only 8% of device- and procedure- associated healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) <xref rid="pone.0058112-Hidron1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The intervention in this study was 60% effective, having a potential effect of reducing total HAIs by only 5%. Thus, any intervention directed at MRSA alone will only have a small effect on the total number of HAIs, as has been suggested previously <xref rid="pone.0058112-Wenzel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Generic population measures that reduce the incidence of HAIs caused by all organisms, such as enhanced hand hygiene, antibiotic stewardship, environmental cleaning and bundles of care <xref rid="pone.0058112-Pronovost1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, have greater potential to reduce HAIs. The authors recommend that proven generic measures be adopted as a priority and the decision to adopt pathogen-specific screening and contact isolation be made according to local context including relative burden of MRSA and available resources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0058112.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
