A prospective, double-blind, randomized study was carried out to compare the quality of postoperative analgesia and side-effect profile between epidurally administered butorphanol and nalbuphine as an adjuvant to 0.2% ropivacaine.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of eighty patients, 43 men and 37 women between the age of 18 and 65 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class I E and II E, who underwent intestinal perforation repair surgery were randomly allocated into two groups ropivacaine with butorphanol (RB) and ropivacaine with nalbuphine (RN), comprising of 40 patients each. Group RB received 0.2% ropivacaine containing 2 mg butorphanol while Group RN received 0.2% ropivacaine containing 10 mg nalbuphine through thoracic epidural catheter. Quality of analgesia, cardiorespiratory parameters, side-effects, and the need of rescue intravenous analgesia were observed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The demographic profile and ASA Class were comparable between the groups. RN group had good quality of analgesia and stable cardiorespiratory parameters for the initial 6 h of postoperative period, after which they were comparable in both groups.

Eighty patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Class I E and II E, between 18 and 45 years of age undergoing emergency laparotomy for intestinal perforation repair were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were contraindication to epidural anesthesia, allergy to local anesthetic, cardiac disease, psychiatric disease, respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, acid-base disorders, and history of drug abuse. In the operation theater, two intravenous (i.v) access using wide bore cannulas were secured in all patients. Premedication done with i.v injection ranitidine 0.5 mg/kg and injection glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. All noninvasive monitoring devices (noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiograph [ECG] leads, pulse oximetry [SpO<sub>2</sub>], and temperature probe) were attached, and the baseline cardiorespiratory parameters were recorded. Patient dehydration status was corrected preoperatively using ringer lactate solution. All cases of exploratory laparotomy were conducted under general anesthesia with standard protocol. Intraoperatively, patient heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), SpO<sub>2</sub>, ECG, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, and urine output were monitored. Intraoperative fluid and blood loss were replaced using ringer lactate solution and packed red cells. After completion of skin closure and dressing, under maintenance of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned laterally, and epidural catheterization was done at T9&#x02013;T10 interspinous space using loss of resistance technique. The patient made supine from lateral position and extubated after adequate reversal. Patients were shifted to postoperative recovery room, and monitoring was continued. Once the patient in postoperative room complain of pain (visual analog scale [VAS] of &#x0003e;3), the study started. Test dose of 3 ml lignocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000) was injected through the epidural catheter and the patients were randomly allocated to one of the following two groups in a double-blinded fashion based on a computer-generated code: Group RN (<italic>n</italic> = 40): Received 0.2% ropivacaine with nalbuphine 10 mg and Group RB (<italic>n</italic> = 40): Received 0.2% ropivacaine with butorphanol 2 mg. In both groups, 14 ml of test drug was administered epidurally by the investigator who was blinded to the trial. Epidural top up was repeated 6 hourly for 24 h. During the study period, patient's heart rate, MAP, respiratory rate, and VAS score was noted at 15 min after the drug administration and 2 hourly for the first 6 h, and then 6 hourly for the next 18 h. Side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, motor blockade (Bromage scale &#x0003e;1), deep sedation (Ramsay sedation score &#x0003e;3), shivering, and pruritus were noted. All patients were given rescue analgesic (injection diclofenac 75 mg i.v) whenever they complained of pain or VAS score &#x0003e;3 before the next epidural top up. Hypotension (fall in systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;20% of baseline) was treated with fluid boluses and injection mephentermine 6 mg i.v bolus. Bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;50/min) was treated with 0.02 mg/kg of injection atropine. Nausea and vomiting were treated with 0.1 mg/kg of i.v ondansetron. Postoperative maintenance i.v fluids were given as per body weight.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was selected on the basis of crossover pilot study of 15 patients in both groups to detect a projected difference of 35% between the two groups for quality of analgesia for type I error (&#x003b1;) of 0.05 and power of study 0.8. At the end of the study, all the data were compiled systematically and analyzed using unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test. Statistical Package for Social Science (IBM Software Group, Chicago, IL 60606, USA) version, 20.0 for windows, was used to compare the continuous variables between the two groups.

Acute postoperative pain can cause detrimental effects on multiple organ systems such as cardiovascular stress, autonomic hyperactivity, tissue breakdown, increased metabolic rate, pulmonary dysfunction, fluid retention, dysfunction of the immune system, delayed return of bowel function, and development of chronic pain syndromes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Opioids as epidural adjuvants to local anesthetics improve the quality of analgesia and provide a dose-sparing effect. Since both nalbuphine and butarphanol have k-agonist and &#x003bc; antagonistic properties, we chose to investigate the analgesic efficacy of nalbuphine and butorphanol, as an epidural adjuvant to 0.2% ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Thoracic epidural for postlaparotomy pain</title><p>The postlaparotomy pain is the major cause for respiratory morbidity and delays the early ambulant resulting in increase in length of hospital stay. The surgical incision for laparotomies extends from sub-xiphoid level to supra-pubic level covering almost seven spinal dermatomes (T7-L1). Hence, we did epidural catheterization at T9&#x02013;T10 interspinous space and took constant drug volume of 14 ml (2 ml per spinous segment) in both groups for the study. It is based on the previous studies by Kato <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Saravana Babu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Quality of postoperative analgesia</title><p>In our study, postoperative pain was assessed using VAS. The test drugs were given when the VAS score is &#x0003e;3, because, in the immediate postoperative period, the residual effects of intraoperative anesthetic drugs make the patients to tolerate minimal pain due to residual analgesia and hypnosis.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Although VAS score started decreasing after 15 min of drug administration in both groups, it was significantly lower in RN group than RB group till first 6 h, thereafter VAS score became comparable in both groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Furthermore, the need of rescue analgesia (injection i.v diclofenac 75 mg) was higher in the RB group (20%) than RN group (2%) during the first 6 h only. This shows that ropivacaine with nalbuphine having an earlier onset of action than ropivacaine with butarphanol, breaks the pain cycle early and effectively, leading to decreased need of rescue analgesia in the immediate postoperative period. Our study results on quality of analgesia are similar to the previous studies by Chatrath <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Kaur and Bajwa,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] where addition of nalbuphine to local anesthetics provided effective postoperative epidural analgesia when compared to other opioids.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Postoperative hemodynamic</title><p>Although there are chances of hemodynamic instability with epidural local anesthetics, the heart rate, and MAP remained &#x000b1; 20% around the baseline. This is due to the lower concentration of ropivacaine (0.2%) blocking the pain impulses effectively, sparing the autonomic and motor blockade. These findings were similar to the study results of Doss <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Bhattacharyya and Dutta.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In RN group, heart rate, MAP, and respiratory rate was significantly lower than RB group during the first 6 h. This may be due to decreased VAS score and increased patient satisfaction in the RN group during the first 6 h. These results were in accordance with the previous studies conducted by Weber <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Li <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Postoperative side-effects</title><p>The side-effect profile in both groups was quite favorable as none of the patients had motor blockade or respiratory depression. Although the incidence of nausea was little higher in both groups, none of them had vomiting. The incidence of dry mouth, pruritus and shivering was very low in both the groups and found to be nonsignificant. Both nalbuphine and butorphanol provided adequate, arousable level of sedation with no incidences of deep comatose state. This may be due to their antagonistic properties against &#x003bc; opioid receptors. These findings were similar to the previous studies conducted by Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Chatrath <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Epidural catheterization under general anesthesia</title><p>Placing epidural catheter under general anesthesia has lot of controversies, but there was no evidence to suggest it as unsafe.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Literature by Fischer,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] has discussed the incidence of nerve damage following regional blockade in both awake and anesthetized patients.
