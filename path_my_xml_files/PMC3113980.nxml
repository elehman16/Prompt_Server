The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of case management in a sample of oncological outpatients with the intent of rehabilitation after cancer treatment.

To determine the health-related quality of life the general questionnaire FACT G is used. The direct correlation between self-management and perceived self-efficacy is measured with the Jerusalem &#x00026; Schwarzer questionnaire. Patients satisfaction with the care received is measured using the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care 5 As (PACIC-5A).

Thus, it is important to offer patients targeted rehabilitation and integrated care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Analyses of 'survivors' after a five-year survival time revealed various psychosocial problems with impact on the patient's quality of life and career depending on the illness and care received [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Since cancer diseases develop into chronic conditions, patients not only expect physical rehabilitation, but also a broad range of services offered to develop skills which can enable them to cope with the long term consequences of cancer diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For this reason provision of individual- and group-oriented rehabilitation programs satisfies the patients' demands for continuity in care and for encouragement to develop self-management skills as described in the Chronic Care Model of the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This is in accordance with Bergeson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], who call for an efficient care network for the chronically ill to contain the following: 1. Access to and continuity in care, 2. Close involvement of patients in the provision of their own care, 3. Supportive measures for self-help or self-management, respectively, 4. Coordination of care between individual institutions and service providers.</p><p>Ambulant rehabilitation following cancer therapy is not well established in Switzerland. Despite the fact that psychosocial counselling, psycho-oncological therapy and opportunities to increase physical fitness are widely offered, the needs of the patient cannot be met. According to patient surveys the following problem areas were defined: inadequate information on side-effects and on consequences of the acute treatment, lack of process in communication, problematic transition from acute care to aftercare and rehabilitation, serious economical consequences and insufficient preparation for return to work. Patients value additional information and support on the following topics: information on cancer diseases, conduct in case of therapy and handling thereof in daily life, an overview of offers of support and counselling, advice on and guidance in matters related to pain, fatigue, dietary change, hair loss, and complementary or alternative medical therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similarly, patients expect to be offered physical movement programs and counselling on psychological strain and the resumption of daily chores/work, financial matters and worries, as well as counselling for relatives. Patients in rehabilitation have the following objectives: physical fitness, dietary changes, weight reduction and capacity to deal with psychological stress. They have the following expectations of their doctors: holistic understanding of rehabilitation with coordinated services offered targeting the various aspects of quality of life, information on rehabilitation services offered, reintegration into everyday and professional life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Dissatisfaction of the patient does not arise due to a lack of rehabilitation and advisory services, but rather due to insufficient information on existing offers and failure of doctors to document their needs and consecutively failure to refer them to the appropriate therapeutic and counselling services. After cancer therapy, many patients do not have the energy to get themselves the necessary information they need and to claim for support. Case management, where a case manager (rehabilitation coach) provides coordination and exchange of relevant information between doctors and other care providers, is therefore one way to tackle these problems actively.</p></sec><sec><title>Case Management</title><p>Case management (CM) used in the care of the chronically ill, is described in several ways; targets and interventions range from coordinating multidisciplinary therapies with adequate provision of the relevant information to patients and therapist to the assessment of patients' needs and thus the appropriate interventions. Case management can function as a communication centre for all parties involved, but can also serve as a main contact person (primary nurse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consequently, CM wants to support the complex information needs of the mostly chronically ill patients taking into account the segmented structure of the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hence, emphasis is put on support for and activation of self-management in order to enhance health- conscious behaviour, learning to deal with the burden of the illness and providing the opportunity for regular contacts with care providers. This approach is part of the Chronic Care model of the WHO. CM is a collaborative process adhering to a system, that tries to compile patient needs and resources, goals of rehabilitation, planning and execution of interventions and evaluations in collaboration with the patient, and, if necessary with their relatives. Considering oncology, CM is successfully applied in the follow-up after therapies and can help to improve the recording of cancer treatments and its symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, a systematic review comprising seven trials found no concluding evidence regarding the effectiveness of case management due to differences in interventions and trial endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><sec><title>Fostering self-management</title><p>It is assumed that the fostering of self-management helps patients to manage the rehabilitation phase more easily and to develop skills to improve their health status. Adequate self-management requires a lot from the chronically ill patient. Suffering from cancer often causes mental stress, fear, uncertainty and insecurity for one's life and future. Effective self-management programs aim to support patients in developing strategies to positively improve their health status. The encouragement of self-efficacy is a relevant concept, that means to promote an optimistic outlook as well as faith in the ability to handle new or difficult situations by means of one's own competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Many patients need additional counselling and coaching to develop the skills needed to deal with the sequels of illness and medication, with stress and other emotional strain; dietary changes; the promotion of physical fitness through exercise; the continuation or adjustment of the patient's role in the family, and in their professional and daily life. The following five elements in self-management programs should be encouraged the most: problem solving; decision making; use of resources; building a relationship between patient and care team; implementation of an action plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary goal of the trial is to assess whether the quality of life of cancer patients with usual care plus case management is significantly better compared to usual care alone one year after a first therapy.</p><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>a) ability to work recorded in days of sick leave</p><p>b) self-efficacy</p><p>c) planned health care utilisation (general practitioner/oncologist, specialists and hospitalisation), illustrated as number of contacts</p><p>d) unplanned consultations (general practitioner/oncologist, specialists and hospitalisation), illustrated as number of contacts that were unplanned</p><p>e) Satisfaction with medical care</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The trial is a multicentre, two-arm randomised controlled study.

The rehabilitation coach offers supplementary patient-orientated advice and instruction and thus encourages self-management. In this way, the belief in self-advocacy through the accomplishment of a more positive mental outlook can be strengthened. The patient is allocated to a rehabilitation coach who will advise and guide the patients during the rehabilitation phase, and, if necessary, during the chronic phase of the illness. The 'motivational interviewing' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] with the aim to influence behavioural changes by communicating in an accepting and empathic way, serves as basis for communication with patients. The role of the rehabilitation coach is assumed by an experienced, qualified nurse with additional training in oncology care and further training in case management, hired by the Institute of General Practice and Health Services Research, Zurich. For five days and with ongoing weekly training the rehabilitation coaches were prepared and supported in the requirements during a specially designed training program. The equivalent of 120% employment percentage has been made available for the trial to be distributed among four rehabilitation coaches.

The standard deviation of FACT is 5.4 according to literature; the level of significance was set at 0.05, also a power at 0.8. The power analysis revealed a sample size of 102 patients. Assuming a drop-out rate of 30% due to the severely ill patient population, 132 patients would need to be enrolled. The calculation of the sample size was done with the aid of Southwest Oncology Group computers.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patients who are about to complete or have recently completed cancer therapy (see inclusion criteria), will be informed about the possibility to participate in the trial by their oncologist or the nursing staff. If a patient is interested in participating in the trial, the patient's name and telephone number will be forwarded to the study nurse after written consent has been given. The study nurse will contact the patient, inform him or her orally and in writing about the trial (goals/randomisation/intervention) and clarify the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In order to determine the patient's distress level, the distress thermometer is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A score above 3 on a Likert scale ranging from 0-10 indicates 'distress'; a score above 7 indicates severe 'distress' and requires medical psychiatric treatment. Severely distressed patients will not be included in the trial, which means that patients with depression can likely be ruled out.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Workflow of trial</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-103-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Treatment allocation will be done by random permutation within blocks with block sizes of 2 and 4.

As the size of the participating centres is not necessarily related to the contribution of the participating centres regarding the patient recruitment we will not perform a randomisation stratified by centre. The randomisation is done independently of centres, rehabilitation coaches and the study nurse.

The number of cancer patients has increased over the last years. With the different improved possibilities of cancer treatment, however, there are an increasing number of patients who survive cancer and are confronted with the sequels of their disease and its treatment. Depending on cancer type and treatment there are several severe consequences which can be overwhelming for patients, so that they often need help. They are confronted with pain, fatigue, distress, diet and rehabilitation needs. Managing all these problems can be a daunting challenge for patients. Concerning the rehabilitation of cancer patients, the lack of systems to recognize rehabilitation needs ranks among the major problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Screening for rehabilitation needs in the population of oncology outpatients is a bigger challenge than the screening of inpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus a case manager can provide effective support by indentifying rehabilitation needs and furthermore act as coordinator in the approach of and during rehabilitation measures.</p><p>Case management has proved to be effective for example regarding quality of life of patients with chronic diseases namely diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>When it comes to oncology, case management is mainly used in the follow up of abnormal cancer screening and in cancer treatment, but it is not yet common in the rehabilitation of cancer patients. In a review Robinson-White et al. describe that patient navigation in the population of breast cancer patients seems to be a successful method to encourage women to proceed from breast cancer screening to diagnostic assessment and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Regarding oncology rehabilitation, the effect of case management has not yet been proven. A review including seven papers could not draw any significant conclusions concerning the effectiveness of case management on cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The authors' explanation for this result is the small number of only seven papers and the significant differences between the case management interventions and effects aimed at. Case management in oncology rehabilitation is not well-established in Switzerland. A major challenge of the study will therefore probably be the recruitment of the patients due to the physicians' and patients' scarcely existing awareness of this issue. The function of people working in the field of case management has various titles such as care coordinator, care/case/disease manager or discharge planner and it includes various skills and a great number of different tasks. A great number of case managers, though, who participated in a cross-sectional descriptive study perceived similar activities and skills as being essential regarding their practice. Considering the evolution of case management, Tahan and Campagna could observe a trend towards professionalization with a growing number of the people concerned having a corresponding degree. With regard to the future development, cost- effectiveness of case management is perceived as one important topic amongst others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Case management seems to be about to find its place in the health care system and confirm its existence. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of case management in a sample of oncological outpatients with the intent of rehabilitation after cancer treatment. The main focus will be on the quality of life. The increasing importance of multidisciplinary care in oncological rehabilitation gives reason for the implementation of the case manager who can assume the role of a coordinator and act as an interface between the different disciplines.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>CCM: Chronic Care Model; CM: Case management; GP: general practitioner; PACIC: Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care; WHO: World Health Organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>IB conceived of the study and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
