Injection atropine was given in increments of 0.3 mg in case of bradycardia (fall in pulse rate of &#x0003e;20% from the baseline value). Heart rate and NIBP was recorded after every 5 min initially and every 15 min thereafter. After completion of surgical procedure patients were observed in the postoperative ward for degree of postoperative analgesia, postoperative motor block and return of sensory function. Degree of postoperative analgesia was assessed by using the 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) (where 0 denotes no pain and 10 denotes worst imaginable pain)[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h.

The aim of this randomized double-blinded study was to investigate the efficacy and adverse effects of a small dose of intrathecal clonidine added to hyperbaric bupivacaine for patients undergoing lower abdominal surgeries. Bupivacaine is a potent LA with a long duration of action. The amount of LA usually used for spinal anesthesia is larger in relation to the minimum concentration required to block the various types of nerve fibers. Use of smaller doses of bupivacaine reduces the duration of spinal block, but sometimes at the price of a small number of blocked dermatomes. In this study, 3 ml of injection bupivcaine 0.5% was administered to all the patients undergoing SAB.</p><p>Our results showed that the addition of a small dose of clonidine increased the duration of sensory block, motor block and duration of analgesia in patients undergoing SAB. Thus, addition of clonidine improved duration of the block and analgesia time.</p><p>Clonidine is a selective partial agonist for alpha-2 adrenoreceptors. It is known to increase both sensory and motor block of LA.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Since clonidine is a mixed &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist, high clonidine doses cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which results in a U-shaped hemodynamic dose-response curve.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The analgesic effect following its intrathecal administration is mediated spinally through activation of postsynaptic alpha-2 receptors in substantia gelatinosa of spinal cord and it works by blocking the conduction of C and A delta fibers, increases potassium conductance in isolated neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and intensifies conduction block of LA.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Roh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] recently suggested that one of the mechanisms for the enhanced potency of intrathecal clonidine administration in a rat model of neuropathic pain is its ability to modulate spinal cord N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation via suppression of NR1 phosphorylation.</p><p>A small dose of intrathecal clonidine is not usually associated with systemic side-effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, or sedation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Accordingly, studies using very low doses of intrathecal clonidine such as 15-30 mcg[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in humans found no hemodynamic instability. Most of studies using 37.5-150 mcg of clonidine intrathecally reported significant hypotension and bradycardia[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] while with higher doses of 300 and 450 mcg, relative hemodynamic instability was observed, suggesting a pressor effect on peripheral sites.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The hemodynamic stability of our patients was better maintained in the control group than in the study group comparing the number of patients who needed a vasopressor. This was similar to the findings of Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] where only one patient each in 15 &#x003bc;g and 30 &#x003bc;g group needed vasopressor or atropine. The average percentage fall from the baseline was also comparable in our study.</p><p>We did not see statistically significant hypotension in the study group except at 50 min and 55 min, compared to control as far as SBP was concerned. Statistically, significant difference was noted in the study group at 5 min and 45-60 min when compared with the control as far as DBP is concerned, which was in contrast to the findings of Strebel <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and similar to the findings of some other authors, such as Niemi,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Grandhe <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who used higher doses of clonidine.</p><p>In this study too, we observed significantly lower mean values for SBP and DBP in the study group as compared to control group at different time intervals.</p><p>Duration of motor block was prolonged after the addition of clonidine to bupivacaine. The results were comparable to the studies of Niemi,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Grandhe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Duration of sensory block was also prolonged in the study group. Similar observation were seen in the studies conducted by Niemi,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Grandhe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>A major finding in this study was the efficacy of the study group to prolong the analgesic effect, which is reflected in longer duration of time for analgesia requirement and lower VAS scores for pain at different time intervals. Intrathecal clonidine clearly increases the duration of both sensory and motor block, as well as postoperative pain relief.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The findings in this study are thus in conformity with the findings of Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who reported that the addition of clonidine 15 and 30 &#x003bc;g to bupivacaine prolonged time to first analgesic request and decreased postoperative pain with minimal risk of hypotension.</p><p>Three studies conducted with isobaric bupivacaine and clonidine reported no significant hypotension. The doses used were 75 and 100 &#x003bc;g clonidine with 13.75 mg bupivacaine,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 150 &#x003bc;g clonidine with 15 mg bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] On the other hand, Klimscha <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have reported a significant fall of MAP and heart rate after the intrathecal injection of 150 &#x003bc;g clonidine and 5 mg isobaric bupivacaine. These authors argued that the hypotensive effect of clonidine was revealed because a low dose of bupivacaine was used. They hypothesized that when a larger dose of LA is used, the hypotensive action of clonidine is masked by dense axonal blockade produced by the LA. In this study, a 3 ml dose of 0.5% bupivacaine was used in combination with 50 &#x003bc;g of clonidine and three cases of hypotension were reported in the study group as against none in the control group.</p><p>De Kock <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] recommended a dose of 15-45 &#x003bc;g of clonidine as optimal for supplementing spinal anesthesia. In our study, 50 &#x003bc;g clonidine supplementation was compared with placebo. Kaabachi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] investigated the efficacy and safety of intrathecal clonidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg in adjunction to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia in adolescent. The duration of sensory block was the primary outcome measure. They found that clonidine prolonged the duration of both the sensory and motor block.</p><p>Saxena <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in a study aimed to evaluate the lowest dose of intrathecal clonidine as adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine that would produce maximum benefit with minimum side-effects. The mean time from injection to onset of block was lower, while duration of analgesia and motor blockade was longer in all the clonidine groups. The authors concluded that addition of clonidine to bupivacaine significantly reduces the onset time with increase in the duration of spinal block as compared to bupivacaine alone with 30 &#x003bc;g as optimum dose, which is similar to our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We hereby conclude that use of clonidine 50 &#x003bc;g added to bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia effectively increases the duration of sensory block, duration of motor block and duration of analgesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gustafsson</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Schildt</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adverse effects of extradural and intrathecal opiates: Report of a nationwide survey in Sweden</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>1982</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>479</fpage><lpage>86</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6896150</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sethi</surname><given-names>BS</given-names></name><name><surname>Samuel</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sreevastava</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of analgesic effects of low dose intrathecal clonidine as adjuvant to bupivacaine</article-title><source>Indian J Anesth</source><year>2007</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>415</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bier</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Experiments regarding cocainization of the spinal cord</article-title><source>Zietschrift Chir</source><year>1899</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>361</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><comment>Translated in classical files.
