prematurity screening in the Indian population, it&#x02032;s time to set
our own guidelines&#x02033; by Dr. Vasumathi Vedantham.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>In this regard we would like to bring to the attention of readers
how early intervention with vision stimulation therapy can help
congenitally blind children with retinopathy of prematurity.</p><p>In one of the studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> which involved vision stimulation
in the rehabilitation program, 25% of the sample size showed
progression from perception of light to perception of objects.</p><p>In a retrospective study done at our center, 104 case
records of children aged between three and 24 months,
who were referred to the vision rehabilitation center with
congenital causes of blindness during the period January 1
2006 to December 31 2006, were analyzed. Vision stimulation
for infants and small children can be done by optical and
non-optical aids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The children with no fixation to light were
subjected to vision stimulation therapy using diode lights of
primary colors with red, green and blue lights that flicker and
move from one light to another. The children were exposed to
these lights for 15 min every day. The parents were educated
on how to use these lights and were asked to come for a follow-
up periodically up to 24 months. The success of the therapy
was defined as child developing fixation to light or being able
to reach for the objects. The children were followed up in the
sixth, 12th, 18th and 24th months. The diagnostic profile of the
children who had vision stimulation therapy is as follows.</p><p>Thirty-two children had cortical blindness, 13 had delayed
visual maturity, and 10 had Leber&#x02032;s congenital amarosis, seven
were diagnosed to have retinopathy of prematurity, seven
with disc pallor, six were found to have retinitis pigmentosa,
five had persistent hypertrophic primary vitreous and three
had albinism. Others which included aphakia, nystagmus,
microphthalmos, chorioretinitis and bilateral retinal detachment
accounted for 21. Out of the104 children, 40 (38.46%) children
had a mean follow-up of 12 months. Of those who came for
follow-up, 29(72.5%) children showed improvement with
vision stimulation therapy and eleven (27.5%) showed no
improvement from the initial presentation.</p><p>In this study we did not find any correlation between a
particular ocular disorder and the time of presentation to have
a favorable or a less favorable outcome.</p><p>An ophthalmologist can play an optimistic role in the
management of these congenitally blind children, as vision
stimulation is proven to help most children with vision
impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vedantham</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Retinopathy of prematurity screening in the Indian
