This prospective randomised study was conducted on 60 adult patients, 30 each in two groups, of ASA I-II who were posted for laparoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia. After preoxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl and vecuronium. PLMA or ETT was inserted and cuff inflated. Nasogastric tube (NGT) was passed in all patients. Anaesthesia was maintained with N<sub>2</sub> O, O<sub>2</sub>, halothane and vecuronium. Ventilation was set at 8 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 12/min. The attempts and time taken for insertion of devices, haemodynamic changes, oxygenation, ventilation and intraoperative and postoperative laryngopharyngeal morbidity (LPM) were noted. There was no failed insertion of devices. Time taken for successful passage of NGT was 9.77 s (6-16 s) and 11.5 s (8-17 s) for groups P and E, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) or end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between the two groups before or during peritoneal insufflation. Median (range) airway pressure at which oropharyngeal leak occurred during the leak test with PLMA was 35 (24-40) cm of H<sub>2</sub>O. There was no case of inadequate ventilation, regurgitation, or aspiration recorded. No significant difference in laryngopharyngeal morbidity was noted. A properly positionedPLMA proved to be a suitable and safe alternative to ETT for airway management in elective fasted, adult patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. It provided equally effective pulmonary ventilation despite high airway pressures without gastric distention, regurgitation, and aspiration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Endotracheal tube</kwd><kwd>IPPV</kwd><kwd>laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>oropharyngeal seal pressure</kwd><kwd>Proseal LMA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In spite of tremendous advances in contemporary anaesthetic practice, advances, airway management continues to be of paramount importance to anaesthesiologists. Till date, the cuffed tracheal tube was considered as the gold standard for providing a safe glottic seal, especially for laparoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] The disadvantages of tracheal intubation, which involves rigid laryngoscopy, are in terms of concomitant haemodynamic responses and damage to the oropharyngeal structures at insertion. Postoperative sore throat is also a serious concern. This precludes the global utility of the tracheal tube and requires a better alternative.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] Over a period of time, new airway devices have been added to the anaesthesiologist&#x02019;s armamentarium.</p><p>Proseal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) has a dorsal cuff, in addition to the peripheral cuff of LMA, which pushes the mask anterior to provide a better seal around the glottic aperture and permits high airway pressures without leak. The drain tube parallel to the ventilation tube permits drainage of passively regurgitated gastric fluid away from the airway and serves as a passage for gastric tube.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] The PLMA is a relatively new airway device in developing nations. This study is therefore undertaken to compare PLMA with standard tracheal tube for the number of attempts and time taken for insertion, haemodynamic changes, oxygenation, ventilation and intraoperative and postoperative laryngopharyngeal morbidity (LPM) occurring during general anaesthesia in young healthy adult patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining the Ethics committee approval and written informed consent, this prospective randomised study was conducted on 60 healthy patients. The patients were of either sex belonging to ASA physical status grade I and II, aged 20-65 years and body weight 40-76 kg, who underwent laparoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia. Patients with anticipated difficult airway, obesity (body mass index &#x0003e; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), oropharyngeal pathology, cardiopulmonary disease, cervical spine fracture or instability, or at increased risk of aspiration (gastro-esophageal reflux disease, hiatus hernia, and pregnant patients) were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were randomised for airway management with the PLMA or endotracheal tube (ETT) by opening an opaque envelope inside the operation theatre containing the computer-generated random assignment into two groups of 30 each. Patients in group P were to receive a PLMA and patients in group E were to undergo endotracheal intubation. Patients were premedicated with oral alprazolam 0.5 mg the night before surgery and on the day of surgery. After intravenous (IV) access was obtained, ranitidine 50 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg were administered 30 minutes before surgery. In the operation theatre, standard monitors were attachedand baseline parameters were recorded. Injections of midazolam 0.02 mg/kg, glycopyrrolate 0.005 mg/kg, and fentanyl 1-2 &#x003bc;g/kg were administered 1-2 min before induction. After preoxygenation with 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 3-5 minutes, anaesthesia was induced with injection of propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg till the loss of verbal commands. Neuromuscular blockade to facilitate placement of device was achieved by vecuronium 0.08-0.1 mg/kg. Following induction and adequate paralysis, the corresponding airway was inserted in each group. The airway devices were inserted by anaesthesiologists with at least 1 year experience with PLMA and ETT. In group P, size 3 or 4 PLMA (according to weight) was used. For the purpose of standardisation, we used the introducer for inserting the PLMA for all cases as recommended by the manufacturer. In group E, endotracheal intubation (7.5 in females and 8 in males) was performed in standard manner. The time interval between holding the airway device to confirmation of correct placement by bilateral air entry on chest auscultation was noted.</p><p>Correct placement of the devices was confirmed by:</p><p>

We chose this study because increased intra-abdominal pressure from pneumoperitoneum requires higher airway pressures for adequate pulmonary ventilation, for which the PLMA has proved to be adequate in previous[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] studies. Although PLMA was easier to insert with higher success rate (86.67%) in the first attempt than the ETT (83.33%), this was not statistically significant. Mean time taken for successful placement was 15.77 s and 16.93 s for groups P and E, respectively.

These factors may be of clinical relevance in patients with hypertension, head injury, and ischaemic heart disease.</p><p>There was minimum haemodynamic stress response with PLMA when compared with endotracheal intubation.

All patients were administered gargles and steam inhalation. After 24 hours, none of the patients in the Proseal group had sore throat; however, two patients in group E had persistent sore throat till 48 hours. Higgins <italic>et al</italic>. and Shroff <italic>et al</italic>. also found the greatest incidence of sore throat in patients undergoing intubation than in those in whom a PLMA was used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] The virtual absence of sore throat in PLMA group could be explained by the fact that it is a supraglottic device and mucosal pressures achieved are usually below pharyngeal perfusion pressures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>Although endotracheal intubation is the gold standard in laparoscopic surgeries done under general anaesthesia, the PLMA proved to be an equally effective airway tool in laparoscopic surgeries in terms of adequate oxygenation and ventilation with minimal intraoperative and postoperative complications. The haemodynamic stress response was also minimal with PLMA when compared to endotracheal intubation. It provided equally effective pulmonary ventilation despite high airway pressures without significant gastric distention, aspiration, and regurgitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Hence, we conclude that the PLMA proved to be a suitable and safe alternative to ETT for airway management in elective fasted, adult patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
