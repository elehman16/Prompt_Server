In this report, we measured the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in severely burned patients with sepsis after the initiation of continuous vein-vein hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) to evaluate the clinical usefulness of CVVHDF on the removal of key mediators. The vital sign indices, such as the heart rate (HR), respiration (R) and central venous pressure (CVP), were recorded at 0 and 42 h in each group. Further, the laboratory examinations indexes, such as the white blood cell count, blood sugar, serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, were detected in venous blood samples. Twenty-two severely burned patients suffering from sepsis were randomized into the control group (A, <italic>n</italic> = 11) and the experimental group (B, <italic>n</italic> = 11). The patients in group A underwent conventional treatment, and those in group B received conventional+CVVHDF treatment. The vital signs, such as the HR, R, and CVP, and laboratory examination indices, such as the blood cell count, blood sugar, serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine, dropped significantly in group B compared with those in group A at 42 h (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The plasma levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured at 0, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 42 h after the start of CVVHDF and at the same time points after the patients were diagnosed with sepsis in group A. The plasma levels of TNF-&#x003b1; in group B decreased by 32% at 18 h after the start of CVVHDF and decreased by 43% at 42 h after the start of CVVHDF; however, these levels were increased compared with the normal values (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The plasma levels of IL-6 decreased at 18 h after the start of CVVHDF (0.274 &#x000b1; 0.137 ng/ml). Following a brief increase at 24 h, the plasma levels of IL-6 again decreased continuously until the end of the investigation (0.192 &#x000b1; 0.119 ng/ml). The plasma levels of IL-8 in group B decreased by 56% at 18 h after the start of CVVHDF, but they were increased compared with the normal values (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The plasma levels of IL-8 in group B decreased by 70% at 42 h after the start of CVVHDF, but they were increased compared with the normal values (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The MODS incident was 4 of 11 in group A compared with 1 of 11 in group B (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In conclusion, CVVHDF can effectively reduce the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as the MODS incidence in patients with serious burns.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Burn</kwd><kwd>inflammatory</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>continuous vein-vein hemodiafiltration</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is a major complication of severe burn and is one of the principal causes of death in burned patients. As an initial factor, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) caused by sepsis are the principal causes of death in burned patients. Despite the impressive advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of sepsis, the mortality rates in burned patients that are associated with sepsis remain high. In 1992, sepsis was considered a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that is caused by a serious infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and this definition of sepsis is still used today. The foundation of the clinical pathophysiology of sepsis is SIRS while the etiology resulting in SIRS with the sepsis status is infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Sepsis due to bacterial infection or SIRS due to non-infectious causes, such as trauma like burns, develops in part from the release of many biologically active inflammatory mediators. Great importance has been attached to the study of treating sepsis after burns worldwide. Continuous vein-vein hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) can effectively eliminate the endogenous and exogenous toxins and regulate homeostasis. Thus, CVVHDF can become an effective treatment option for sepsis. From June 2003 to October 2012, burned patients with sepsis were treated with optimized CVVHDF in our working unit, and good clinical effects have been achieved.<table-wrap id="TabA"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">

The CVVHDF was conducted near the bed; the displacement liquid was Port formula, and the blood flow rate was maintained at between 80 and 100 ml/min.

According to the research, CRRT can eliminate the inflammatory mediator in extracorporeal circulation and improve the prognosis of sepsis and MODS in animal experiments.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Furthermore, its effectiveness is related to the treatment strength and method.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] CVVHDF has already been widely applied to treat acute severe patients.</p><p>In the early stage of burn sepsis, CVVHDF could improve organ function and prevent MODS. Its mechanism may be the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>CVVHDF eliminates the inflammatory medium and cell factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, to interrupt the progress of SIRS towards MODS and MOF; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>CVVHDF improves the cardiopulmonary function. CVVHDF can eliminate some toxins that could injure the cardiopulmonary function, perfect the lung function of gas exchange, correct the volume load and alleviate the cardiac preload.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The severity of multi-organ function injury and case fatality rate are positively correlated with the plasma levels of inflammatory medium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and IL-6 is the main member of the cytokine network, possibly playing a significant role in various infectious diseases. Additionally, it is a marking signal that reflects the inflammatory response of the body. Particularly in such pathological states as sepsis and SIRS, it can detect increasing IL-6 levels, and its level is closely related to the degree of infection and prognosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] TNF-&#x003b1; is an endogenous cell regulatory factor that is generated by the activated mononuclear macrophage system; it is also the main factor of immediate inflammatory reactions. Currently, TNF-&#x003b1; is thought to come from burn patients&#x02019; Kupffer cells, which are found in the liver. TNF-&#x003b1; has a dual-directional regulation function, and only a small dose of TNF-&#x003b1; can enhance the immunity of the burn patient. A continuous and high level of TNF-&#x003b1; could hint at a poor prognosis of severe infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p><p>Burn patients with sepsis in our hospital were treated with CVVHDF for 12 h, and the blood flow rate was maintained at between 80 and 100 ml/min. The treatment lasted for 42 h. According to the research results, CVVHDF can effectively reduce the content of various inflammatory factors, thereby decreasing the incidence rate of MODS. Further, CVVHDF treatment can effectively decrease the laboratory examination indices, such as the white blood cell count, blood sugar, serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. This can improve the environment in the body of severe burn patients with sepsis. Therefore, CVVH treatment is more effective in the primary stage of sepsis. In future research, we will attempt to adopt larger samples for further research to obtain more scientific evidence for the treatment of burn sepsis with CVVHDF.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Reasons for Submission to Burns &#x00026; Trauma</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>About the Journal</title><p>Burns &#x00026; Trauma, official journal of Chinese Burn Association, is a peer-reviewed online journal published quarterly.
