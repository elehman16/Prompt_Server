Currently, no HZ vaccine is indicated for immunocompromised patients. The HZ subunit vaccine candidate (HZ/su), containing recombinant varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E and AS01<sub>B</sub> Adjuvant System, showed &#x0003e;90% efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in immunocompetent adults in all age groups &#x02265;50 years. Here we report HZ/su immunogenicity and safety in HM adults &#x02265;18 years of age who completed or are undergoing ICT.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>In this phase III, observer-blind, multicenter study (NCT01767467), participants were randomized 1:1 to receive HZ/su or placebo (2 doses, 1&#x02013;2 months apart) &#x02265;10 days pre- or post-ICT. Humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity (CMI) were assessed. The co-primary immunogenicity objectives were to evaluate HZ/su vaccine response rate and compare the immune response to HZ/su and placebo in participants excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at 1 month post-dose 2 (M2). Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded for 7 and 30 days after each dose, respectively. Serious AEs (SAEs), disease-related events and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were recorded throughout the study. Partial safety results up to 6 months post-dose 2 are shown (partially blinded, ongoing study).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Of 562 participants (283 HZ/su 283; placebo 279), (mean age 57.3 [HZ/su 56.8; placebo 57.8] years), 415 were included in the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for humoral immunogenicity and 132 in the ATP sub-cohort for CMI. M2 immune responses were higher in the HZ/su group (Table 1). Both co-primary immunogenicity objectives were met (Figure 1). The most frequent local and general solicited AEs were pain and fatigue, reported by 48.2% and 47.8% of all participants (per-group data remain blinded). The frequency of unsolicited AEs, SAEs and pIMDs in the 2 groups was similar (Table 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>HZ/su induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses at M2 in HM adults excluding NHBCL and CLL, who completed or are undergoing ICT. No safety concerns were observed up to 6 months post-dose 2.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0453"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0454"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0455"/></fig></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
