Dexamethasone pulse therapy can be considered as an alternative to pulse methylprednisolone therapy. A prospective randomized control trial was carried out in 21 patients comparing pulse dexamethasone therapy versus pulse methyprednisolone therapy in Graves's ophthalmopathy. This study proved that pulse dexamethasone therapy is a cheaper and equally effective therapy for Graves's ophthalmopathy and the cost of therapy is reduced to at least 1/8<sup>th</sup> s.

A total of 21 patients, all of whom were having active moderate to severe Graves's ophthalmopathy were recruited for the study. Seventeen patients were biochemically hyperthyroid at the start of the study and four patients were euthyroid (with or without treatment). After getting informed consent, patients were divided into two comparable groups with regard to age, smoking status, activity and severity of Graves's ophthalmopathy and thyroid status [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Out of the 21 patients, 10 patients received pulse methyprednisolone therapy, (500 mg intravenous [i.v.] weekly for 6 weeks and 250 mg i.v. weekly for next 6 weeks) and 11 received pulse dexamethasone therapy 100 mg i.v. for 6 weeks followed by 50 mg i.v. for 6 weeks. All patients received pantoprazole injection before the pulse steroid therapy. Patients were followed-up for 12 weeks and the following parameters &#x02013; clinical activity score, measures of severity - diplopia, lid retraction and exophthalmos and other parameters such as weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, aspartate amino transferase and alanine amino transferase (ALT) were assessed at baseline and 3 months after therapy. A Student <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test were used to analyze the results using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences statistical software version 13 (IBM USA).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-17-157-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>After 3 months of therapy with pulse dexamethasone, there was a statistically significant change in clinical activity score (CAS), with mean CAS falling from 4.8 to 1.0 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Also, dexa has a better effect on reduction of exophthalmos. The dreaded complication of fulminant hepatic failure, associated with high dose of methylprednisolone, is not seen with dexa therapy. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is not required with dexamethasone therapy, reducing the cost of therapy. There is a slightly increased incidence of diabetes and weight gain with dexamethasone therapy, but patient who developed diabetes, reverted to normal blood glucose after 3 months.</p><p>Pulse dexamethasone therapy can be considered as a cheaper and safer alternative of pulse methylprednisolone therapy in the treatment of Graves's ophthalmopathy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bartley</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The epidemiologic characteristics and clinical course of ophthalmopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disease in Olmsted County, Minnesota</article-title><source>Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc</source><year>1994</year><volume>92</volume><fpage>477</fpage><lpage>588</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7886878</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kahaly</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hommel</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Dittmar</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Randomized, single blind trial of intravenous versus oral steroid monotherapy in Graves&#x02019; orbitopathy</article-title><source>J Clin Endocrinol Metab</source><year>2005</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>5234</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15998777</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van Geest</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sasim</surname><given-names>IV</given-names></name><name><surname>Koppeschaar</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalmann</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Stravers</surname><given-names>SN</given-names></name><name><surname>Bijlsma</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Methylprednisolone pulse therapy for patients with moderately severe Graves&#x02019; orbitopathy: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study</article-title><source>Eur J Endocrinol</source><year>2008</year><volume>158</volume><fpage>229</fpage><lpage>37</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18230831</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weissel</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauff</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fatal liver failure after high-dose glucocorticoid pulse therapy in a patient with severe thyroid eye disease</article-title><source>Thyroid</source><year>2000</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>521</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10907999</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marin&#x000f3;</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Morabito</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Brunetto</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Bartalena</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinchera</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Marocci</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute and severe liver damage associated with intravenous glucocorticoid pulse therapy in patients with Graves&#x02019; ophthalmopathy</article-title><source>Thyroid</source><year>2004</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>403</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15186621</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
