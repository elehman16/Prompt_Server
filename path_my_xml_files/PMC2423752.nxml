		<p>The growing popularity of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has made extensive series
comparing laparoscopic and conventional cholecystectomy in a prospective, randomized way
nearly impossible. To evaluate LC we compared retrospectively 800 laparoscopic with 748
conventional cholecystectomies (CC). Of the 800 LC, 10 (1.2%) were converted to laparotomy.
6 conversions were related to aberrant anatomical features or features making dissection very
difficult, 4 conversions were due to complications. There were 5 (0, 6%) intraoperative complications
during LC and 4 (0.5%) during CC. Postoperative morbidity was 2.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 17) after LC
and 3.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 28) after CC. Particularly the incidence of wound problems was only 0.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 4)
after LC while it was 1.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 10) after CC. Overall morbidity was 2.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 22) for LC and
4.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 32) for CC. Mortality rate after CC was 0.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 3), there were no deaths after LC.
Common bile duct-injury rate was 0.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) for both groups. Complication rates after LC
have been rapidly decreasing with growing experience. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can safely
be performed by appropriately trained surgeons in more than 90% of patients suffering from
gallbladder disease. The low morbidity and mortality together with the significant advantages to
patient recovery makes laparoscopic cholecystectomy the treatment of choice for symptomatic
cholecystolithiasis.</p>
