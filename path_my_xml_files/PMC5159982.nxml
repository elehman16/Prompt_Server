However, studies have reported conflicting results when using a control group in research to test the true effectiveness of real acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Some studies have consistently shown that both real and placebo acupuncture had advantages over untreated control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], while some studies have suggested that real acupuncture is more effective than placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; others have failed to show benefits of real acupuncture over placebo one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although the reasons for such contradictory results are not fully clarified, they call attention to a further investigation about placebo-controlled groups in researches in acupuncture field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Randomized clinical trials double blinded serve as gold standard when comparing the effects of an active against placebo-controlled group. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In clinical trials with acupuncture or any other type of device or drug, the ideal is that the control device used is physiologically inert and indistinguishable from real treatment to not produce therapeutic effects and to provide comparison with real treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Clinical trials that incorporate these controls by using placebo gained notoriety because they tried to follow the concept of control as ideal in literature. Patients must not detect the type of treatment they are receiving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In some cases, the investigator who applies acupuncture also has no knowledgement if the application was real or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The lack of a consensus led to the development and use of various placebo acupuncture devices used in the scientific setting, such as the Streitberger device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Park Sham device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], devices using adhesive foam on the skin to prevent the needle penetration into the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], application with toothpick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or pressure at the point only with the guide tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some authors develop their own placebo acupuncture strategies, but these are not always visually similar to real acupuncture, which does not allow the application in visible regions of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>To minimize this gap in the literature, this study selected three distinct placebo acupuncture techniques widely used in clinical trials such as 1) Park sham device, 2) insertion and removal of the needle and 3) needle and foam. Only the Park Sham can be used as a double blinded. Our study aimed to investigate whether the placebo acupuncture techniques are indistinguishable from each other and also to the real acupuncture. Moreover one wanted to identify which placebo device is more effective for bliding the subjects when applied to both abdominal and lumbar points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Type of Study</title><p>This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Random distribution was performed by using sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes, containing numbers from 1 to 14, corresponding to 14 study groups. Randomization was blocked in a proportion of 1:1, in order to assure proportionality of the number of subjects allocated in 14 groups.</p><p>Two types of investigators participated in the study: investigator 1 and investigator 2. Investigator 1 was responsible for the evaluation of subjects and measurement of all variables, before and after treatment. Investigator 2 held the administration of treatment, applying the technique of acupuncture. Investigator 1 didn&#x02019;t know which treatment patient was receiving. This procedure ensured that the study was double-blinded, since the subjects evaluated were instructed to not look at the needles during the procedure and only investigator 2 had knowledgement of the technique used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample</title><p>Only healthy subjects with no pain or discomfort in the region selected for the puncture, aging 18 years or more who have never received treatment by acupuncture were recruited to this study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included: 1) pregnant or who have recently given birth with birth in the last 3 months; 2) cutaneous lesions in the puncture site; 3) active infectious processes; 4) nerve tissue or disease affecting the region of dermal puncture; 5) inability to understand the instructions or consent to the study; 6) psychiatric disorders; 7) presence of auditory, visual or communication disturbance; or 8) moderate or severe cognitive or psychiatric disorder.</p><p>Recruitment of subjects occurred at the buildings of the Federal University of Sergipe, and after acceptation to be included they got through the screening room and were considered fit to participate in the survey, then they were conducted to carry out the initial steps.

When it is pressed, the smaller guide tube containing the needle inside, slides inside the larger tube; if the needle is conventional, it penetrates the skin, but if it is unconventional (blunt needle), just press the skin without penetrating, we use the second type of needle, because we want to use only the placebo park sham mode.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study showed that all placebo acupuncture groups had similar results to the group that received real acupuncture for masking the patients, both at the ST25 BL52 points, suggesting that any of these placebo methods can be used in future research to simulate real acupuncture.</p><p>With regard to the occurrence of discomfort at the moment of puncture, no difference was found between subjects receiving placebo or real puncture, in both acupoints analyzed. This may not be considered as a key determinant aspect for the choice of placebo method, therefore besides analyzing the presence or absence of discomfort, respondents who reported discomfort were questioned about its intensity, which did not differ between groups.</p><p>The location for the needling sensation, also known as &#x0201c;Qi&#x0201d;, had its occurrence in puncture point in all groups investigated, and was not diffuse as reported in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but when analyzing the duration of this sensation in each subject, the real group BL52 and Real group&#x02009;+&#x02009;insertion and removal ST25, showed a greater sensation period of needling than the others, corroborating with work. Similarly, Junnila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] observed chronic pain patients also had a needling sensation for longer periods than 2 min.</p><p>In contrast, Park Sham BL52 group and Real group&#x02009;+&#x02009;needle and foam BL52 showed shorter duration for the needling sensation, and this sensation is one of the main events in individuals who receive real acupuncture therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To our knowledge, this study is the first clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of masking procedure of three methods of placebo acupuncture versus real acupuncture in healthy subjects.</p><p>The coping strategy of pain has an important role regarding to reduce pain intensity. Patient who undergoes to therapy and conveys confidence about its effectiveness, even if the subject feels to having control, or to being part of driving this therapy, it has been shown to be a catalyzing factor that results for pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], once that this one is one of the main reasons for seeking placebo acupuncture techniques that adeuately simulates as much as possible the feeling promoted by real acupuncture.</p><p>One of the main challenges faced by non-penetrating placebo acupuncture methods is to simulate the senation usually promoted by the puncture, since some studies reported that this sensation is directly related to the depth of needle penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. According our findings, since the real group BL52 and real&#x02009;+&#x02009;foam and needle BL52 group, both of them using invasive procedures for stimulation, produced a greater time period for the puncture sensation than in noninvasive technique Park Sham BL52 group, which so the feeling sensation may be a determining factor to the volunteer research believes in the veracity of the technique.</p><p>The literature provides a large amount of placebo acupuncture techniques, such as Park Sham device, developed by Park et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which aims to serve as a masking to both patient and acupuncturist. In the research setting, for validation purposes, this device was firstly used in healthy subjects and then in patients who had suffered stroke, and, in both cases, the placebo device was not detected as placebo or not penetrating by the volunteers. These data confirm our findings, because the placebo acupuncture devices showed results similar to real acupuncture at both ST25 and BL52 points, when individuals were asked if they believed they had received real placebo treatment. Similar results were also found in other studies with healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Some placebo acupuncture devices that intended to mask both acupuncturist and patient were not effective to do it as acupuncturists found that it was a fake device, while the volunteers believed it was real acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Other studies have shown that placebo acupuncture technique is not effective to mask even the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Mechanical changes were measured by using computerized system, and showed that, at the moment of insertion and removal of needles, professional modifies the forces of application and removal when using placebo methods compared to real acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which is always a possibility of perception for the patient who has previous experience with acupuncture, to identify the difference on the technique, which was not observed in our study because we measured a high credibility index.</p><p>In our study, we had groups that used real acupuncture in a body area and a placebo method in another one in the same subject, in order to simulate the occurrence of individuals who had previous experience with acupuncture. Interestingly, the result for masking the participants was similar to the groups receiving real acupuncture or placebo device. In a study with eight experienced acupuncturists in order to develop a regulation for usig a method of non-invasive sham acupuncture, it became clear that to maintain an appropriate standard is required frequent contact between all professionals who will apply the placebo technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Studies with real acupuncture and sham acupuncture showed similar therapeutic results to increase muscle strength in the quadriceps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], treatment of low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and for pain relief in knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], suggesting that the therapeutic results of this study has a strong relationship with the placebo effect. However, studies in which acupuncture was applied in patients with muscle pain in the upper trapezius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] or with nonspecific low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] pointed out that the real acupuncture therapy was more effective than placebo acupuncture for pain relief.</p><p>Our findings indicated a low level of discomfort at the moment of puncture in subjects treated with all the methods investigated in both acupuncture points, however, this intensity was not different between groups; this suggests that the intensity of discomfort can not be considered a determining factor for the choice of placebo method to be used in clinical trials investigating the effects of acupuncture. These data corroborate findings by H&#x000fc;bscher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] that evaluated the effect of acupuncture and placebo group with no intervention in muscle soreness, noting that no difference in the intensity of discomfort was observed in the first 48 h between study groups. Whereas after 72 h, only the acupuncture group showed a significant reduction in the intensity of discomfort.</p><p>Subjects were asked if acupuncture was pleasant or not. Most of them in all groups said that acupuncture had been nice and no differences were found between the methods, showing once again that all placebo and real acupuncture techniques were similar to each other for the pleasantness factor, which should be regarded as a decisive factor for the choice of the placebo method to be used in the clinical research setting, whether in the abdominal point ST25 or lumbar point BL52.</p><p>Our findings contribute to modern science that seeks to avoid erroneous conclusions in no placebo-controlled studies, which provides differences in results between the groups investigated, regardless of the odds and potential that the belief of healing provides these improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A systematic review with 250 random clinical trials demonstrated superior therapeutic effect, around 17%, for the groups that did not use masking in comparison to the groups who performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Our clinical trial occurred with random distribution and volunteer was unaware about the acupuncture technique that would be received, researchers responsible for the assessment also had no knowledge about allocation, and were trained to conduct the survey question about the subjects&#x02019; belief if they received placebo or real admnisration of needle, characterizing it as a double-blinded study. Studies that mask the volunteers as the evaluators have fundamental importance, because the person who is aware that a real treatment method was not performed will be less prone to follow the protocol of the test, search for additional treatment and making the data less reliable, as well as blind investigators are less likely to transfer expectations to volunteers ensuring more impartial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results allow to state that all the placebo groups were similarly effective to promote appropriate masking of the study subjectsand therefore all of them are reliable alternatives to characterize a placebo-controlled group in the research setting using acupuncture at either abdominal or lumbar points. All groups showed low intensity of sensory discomfort, which was similar between the methods studied. Furthermore, the puncture sensation was reported as located by most individuals in all groups for the ST25 and BL52 points. The groups that had a higher maintenance puncture sensation time were those stimulated with real acupuncture at acupoint BL52 and real acupuncture&#x02009;+&#x02009;insertion and removal in acupoint ST25. Most individuals of all groups have reported that the acupuncture treatment was a pleasant therapy received.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>Bl 52</term><def><p>Bladder 52</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>St 25</term><def><p>Stomach 25</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Thanks to those who helped in the recruitment and running of the collection, Emanuelle Lais Santos Passos, Maria Morgana Lima Silva, Carlos Roberto Xavier Santos Filho, Wendell Medeiros Cardoso, Erika Thatyana Nascimento Santana.</p><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p>We would like to thank FAPITEC, Sergipe organ which funded our research.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All the data that led to this conclusion as well as the information of the made materials and methods are available in the link below or via email:</p><p>
