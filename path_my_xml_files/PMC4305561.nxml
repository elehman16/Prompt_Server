suboccipital muscle inhibition (SMI) and self-myofascial release (SMFR) techniques in the
suboccipital area on the flexibility of the hamstring. [Subjects] Fifty persons with short
hamstrings participated in this research. According to the results of the finger-floor
distance (FFD) test, the subjects were allocated to SMI and SMFR groups of 25 subjects
each. [Methods] The SMI and SMFR techniques were applied to the groups. For the analysis,
we used the FFD test and the straight leg raise (SLR) test for the flexibility of
hamstring. The evaluator was blindfolded. [Results] In the SMI group, FFD, SLR, and PA
were significantly changed after the intervention, and in the SMFR group, there was a
significant change in SLR after the intervention. In a comparison between the groups, FED
was found to be significantly increased in the SMI group. [Conclusion] Application of the
SMI and SMFR to persons with short hamstrings resulted in immediate increases in
flexibility of the hamstring. However, we could see that the SMI technique was more
effective.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Suboccipital muscle inhibition</kwd><kwd>Self-myofascial release</kwd><kwd>Short hamstring</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shortening of the hamstring has a negative impact on the posture of the pelvic region. The
increase in stiffness of the hamstring may serve as a cause of low back pain (LBP)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it is also a common characteristic of
back pain patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The increase in
stiffness of the hamstring produces more burdens on the back and causes improper motion
patterns in the lumbopelvic region<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shortening of the hamstring can be examined
by the finger-floor distance (FFD) and straight leg raise (SLR) test, and if a person cannot
touch the floor with his/her fingertips in the bent-forward position or the SLR is lower
than 80&#x000b0;, the person is considered to have reduced hamstring extensibility<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that the flexibility of the hamstring increased as a result
of an intervention targeting the suboccipital muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the suboccipital muscle inhibition (SMI) technique is a method
of relaxing the tension in the four muscles located between the occiput and axis, which
regulates the upper cervical vertebra (rectus capitis posterior major, rectus capitis
posterior minor, obliquus capitis inferior, and obliquus capitis superior) ; these muscles
are known to be associated with regulating body posture as well as rotation of the head<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When the tone of suboccipital muscles falls, it has been reported that the tone of knee
flexors such as the hamstrings also decreases due to relaxation of the myofascia<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is because the hamstrings and
suboccipital muscles are connected by one neural system, which passes through the dura
mater<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Myers<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> called this the superficial back line.</p><p>The SMI technique is a method of inducing relaxation of the fascia by applying soft
pressure to the suboccipital area of the patient while he/she is lying comfortably, and it
can be easily applied by a therapist. However, the disadvantage is that it cannot be done by
patients themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, self-myofascial release (SMFR) is a technique that can be applied at
home or in the office by patients themselves, without any help from a therapist or
limitations regarding time or space, and recently, the effect of SMFR using a foam roller on
the hamstring has been studied<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most of the known research
results have been for cases of applying MFR directly<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and research in which SMFR was applied to the original part of the
shortened area, such as the suboccipital muscles, has been rare.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we applied the SMI and SMFP techniques to the suboccipital area
of the short hamstring of subjects and compared the effects on the flexibility of the
hamstring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 50 subjects with short hamstrings attending C University and K University
were recruited, and according to the results of an FFD test, they were equally divided into
SMI and SMFR groups of 25 subjects each. The criteria for selection of subjects were as
follows. 1) In the FFD test, in which the subject stands and bends down without bending
his/her knees and the distance between the fingertips and the floor is measured, the
distance between the fingertips and the floor should be more than 5&#x02005;cm. 2) The angle in the
SLR test should be less than 80&#x000b0;. 3) In the popliteal angle (PA) test, in which the subject
maintains the angle of the hip at 90&#x000b0; and tries maintain the angle of the knees as straight
as possible in the supine position, the angle of the knees should be more than 15&#x000b0;.</p><p>The criteria for exclusion of subjects were as follows. 1) Those who experienced whiplash
syndrome caused by traffic accidents. 2) Those who had the symptoms of disc herniation or
low back pain. 3) Those who had had neck or back surgery or indicated they felt pain when an
experimental intervention was applied. The assessments and interventions were conducted in
separate spaces, and the evaluators were blindfolded so that they could not see the status
of the subjects. All assessments were conducted 10 minutes before the intervention and 5
minutes after the intervention, and each assessment was conducted 3 times; the mean values
of the results were used. Written informed consent has been obtained from each subject. This
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Pusan
(CUPIRB-201-018).</p><p>The FFD and SLR tests were used to evaluate the flexibility of the hamstring. 1) In the FFD
test, the subjects stand on a flat box that has a vertical grid, and bend forward and down
as much as they can without bending their knees, and the distance between the floor and the
fingertips is measured. 2) In the SLR test, the subject is in a supine position, and the
evaluator lifts the subject&#x02019;s right leg. The leg should be maintained straight, and if the
evaluator feels resistance or the subject reports pain, the evaluator stops at that point
and measures the angle of the hip and lower leg using goniometry. When measuring the angle,
the evaluator needs to be cautious to ensure that the subject&#x02019;s ankle or pelvis does not
rotate. When measuring the angle, the axis of goniometry needs to be located at the greater
trochanter of the thigh, the moving arm needs to be positioned to be parallel with the outer
epicondyle of the fibula, and the fixed arm needs to be maintained horizontal to the floor.
3) In the PA test, the subject is in a supine position, and the right hip and the knee are
bent at 90&#x000b0;. In this state, the evaluator straightens the knee within the pain-free range
and measures the angle of the knee. The axis of the goniometer is located at the outer
epicondyle of the thigh, the fixed arm is positioned vertically relative to the floor, and
the moving arm is positioned parallel to the outer epicondyle of the fibula. The PA is a
good indicator for evaluating the shortening of the hamstring<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The intervention techniques were as follows. The SMI technique was conducted while each
subject was in a supine position with his/her eyes closed. The experimenter places his/her
hands below the subject&#x02019;s occiput and applied pressure to the area below the atlas, which
was the first cervical spine, in the upward direction, toward the subject&#x02019;s nose, toward
himself/herself, and in the direction of the head, and this induced relaxation of the
suboccipital muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SMI technique
was applied for 5 minutes. SMFR was conducted while each subject was in a supine position
with his/her eyes closed. A triangle-shaped pillow was placed under each subject&#x02019;s occiput
to apply pressure to the suboccipital area of the subject&#x02019;s head, and to prevent the head
from reclining, an air cushion was used to maintain the parallel position of the neck. In
addition, the subject was allowed to rotate the head to the right or left with the range of
the pillow so that he/she could relax the suboccipital muscles in the desired area. SMFR was
applied for 5 minutes.</p><p>Results were analyzed using SPSS 18.0, and the significance level was set at 0.05. To
compare the effects of application of the SMI and SMFR techniques, the pared t-test was
conducted, and to compare the effects between the groups, independent t-test was
conducted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>General characteristics of the subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the subjects (N=50)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMI (n=25)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMFR (n=25)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (m/f)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (y)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.8 (4.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.3 (4.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.4 (10.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.6 (9.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.5 (10.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.2 (9.6)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means (standard deviations).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

SMFR techniques in subjects with shortening of the hamstring. Regarding the SMI group, a
significant increase in FFD and SLR was found after the intervention and an increase of
flexibility of the hamstring was confirmed. This matches the research results of
Aparicio<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and supports his empirical
hypothesis. In the SMFR group, FFD and PA were found to have increased after the
intervention, although the increases were not statistically significant. Regarding the SLR
test, the results showed a significant increase after the intervention compared with before
the intervention, and it was confirmed that the SMFR technique contributes to increased
flexibility of the hamstring.</p><p>The fact that both techniques could increase the flexibility of the hamstring may be
because the superficial back line was relaxed through relaxation of the suboccipital
muscles<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The suboccipital muscles are
the &#x0201c;proprioceptor monitors&#x0201d; that contribute significantly to regulation of head posture,
and they have the most muscle spindles in the human body<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among them, in particular, the rectus capitis posterior minor
muscle, which has 36 muscle spindles per gram, is known to contribute greatly to regulation
of posture and the degree of tension<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, the results of this study indicated that SMI was more effective in increasing
flexibility of the hamstring than SMFR, and this was probably because SMI provides more
traction compared with SMFR. One of the features of SMI is application of soft traction to
feel the tension of the soft tissues and remove the muscle barrier by repeatedly relaxing
and straining, which has been compared to &#x0201c;peeling an onion&#x0201d;<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Though SMFR allows the subject to move his/her neck to the right
or left against the wooden pillow to apply pressure to the tensed area around the
suboccipital muscles and it can lead to relaxation, it is somewhat difficult to apply
traction.</p><p>What is needed for effective relaxation of the fascia is proper pressure and soft extension
on the area where fascia limitation is felt. Manheim<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> specified that &#x0201c;in myofascial release, when the fascia is extended,
never ignore the end-feel&#x0201d; and emphasized the importance of soft extension. Application of
SMFR to the suboccipital muscles are a good technique that individuals can use to apply
appropriate pressure to relax muscles by giving feedback to him/herself, but in terms of
extending soft tissues, it is difficult for the subject to apply it him/herself without the
intervention of a therapist, and this is probably why SMFR is less effective than SMI in
myofascial release.</p><p>According to the results of this research, SMI and SMFR, which were applied to subjects
with shortening of the hamstring, resulted in immediate increases in flexibility of the
hamstring, and it was confirmed that SMI was more effective.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gajdosik</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hatcher</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitsell</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Influence of short hamstring muscles on the pelvis and
