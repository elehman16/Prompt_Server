Obesity is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and many other noncontiguous diseases. The economic costs associated with the management of obesity and obesity-related diseases are remarkable.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Overweight and obesity are determined by combination of factors such as; genetic, nutritional, metabolic, behavioral, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic influences.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, overweight and obesity in most individuals result from excessive energy consumption and/or inadequate physical activity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies in this area showed that one in four children aged 6&#x02013;14 years is presently overweight in developed and developing countries,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] which ranges from 11% to 39%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found similar in boys and girls,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or significantly different between genders, with difference found in studies that reported higher prevalence of overweight and obesity in either girls[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or boys.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The level of prevalence in European school children is reported to be as high as 27.7% and 28% for boys and girls of the eastern region, respectively.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Based on published data in this regards prevalence rates of overweight and obesity for Iranian school children is 13.8%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Physical factors such as an increase in sedentary lifestyles and the availability and marketing of foods, an increase in the use of computers and television viewing, greater dependence on vehicles for transportation, and decreases in physical activity in schools are considered major determinants of obesity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Some international surveys suggest that the proportion of students who did not participate in at least 20 min of regular physical activity on 3 or more of the past 7 days and did not do at least 30 min of moderate physical activity on 5 or more of the past 7 days was 33.4%. The percentage of students who participated in no vigorous or moderate physical activity during the past 7 days was 11.5%, the percentage of students who attended physical education class daily was only 28.4%, the percentage of students who watched 3 or more hours of TV/day on an average school day was 38.2%, the percentage of students who ate five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day during the past 7 days was 22%, the percentage of students who were at risk for becoming overweight was 15.4%, while the percentage of students who were overweight was 13.5%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only a few data are available about the effects of school-based physical activity programs on overweight and obese students in the city of Isfahan and even in our country, Iran. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the effects of a short-term physical activity intervention on obesity and cardiovascular fitness of middle school boy students in the city of Isfahan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>To examine the efficacy of a selected short-term exercise program for improving aerobic fitness and body composition of children, this semi-practical study has been conducted. A number of 127 middle school boy students, with written consent of their parents or guardians, volunteered to take part in this study and selected as subjects. Subjects selected from a different area of the city of Isfahan, who based on preliminary assessments during February to May 2011, have been determined as overweight or obese. For the entry conditions, participants were in good health, free from musculoskeletal dysfunctions, and metabolic and heart diseases. None of the subjects was on medication at the time of the study.</p><p>All of the subjects were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Participants were in good health, free from musculoskeletal dysfunctions, and metabolic and heart diseases. None of the subjects was on medication at the time of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurements</title><p>Subjects completed a physical activity and medical history questionnaire as each subject underwent 1-day testing session. During this session, anthropometric assessments and physical fitness tests were carried out.</p><p>Skin folds at three sites (triceps, sub-scapular, and medial calf) were obtained using a caliper. The landmarks were identified and measured according to Lohman and Timothy procedure,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the mean of three measurements was used for representing skinfold thickness. Body-fat percentage was determined according to gender-specific equations as following: If triceps and sub-scapular skin folds &#x0003e;35 mm; %fat = 0.546 &#x02211;SF + 9.7 females; and if triceps and sub-scapular &#x0003c;35 mm; %fat = 1.33 [&#x02211;SF] &#x02013; 0.013 [&#x02211;SF]<sup>2</sup> + 2.5 females.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Standard calibrated scales and stadiometers were used to determine the height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of students. Heights were measured by a stadiometer (Novin, Iran) to the nearest 0.5 cm, while body mass were obtained to the nearest 0.2 kg using a calibrated balance beam scale (Novin, Iran). BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Children's waist-circumference was measured using a flexible tape at the level of the narrowest point between the lower costal border and the iliac crest, and Hip circumference was measured at the widest region.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Cardiovascular or aerobic fitness of subjects was determined using pacer 20 m shuttle-run test.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Subjects were required to run back and forth on a 20 m course and be on the 20 m line at the same time a beep is emitted from tape. The frequency of sound-signals increased in such a way that running speed started at 8.5 km/h and was increased by 0.5 km/h each minute. When the subjects could no longer follow the pace, the stage the subjects were able to run for was recorded and used for calculating the aerobic power or VO<sub>2</sub> max in children.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>All intervention subjects participated in a twice-weekly training program. The selected 6 weeks intervention program consisted of adding two 90 min sessions of physical education courses for selected students in their leisure time. With collaboration of school principals, teachers, school health services and parental committees, our physical activity intervention was programmed to increase participants&#x02019; physical activity during both school hours and their leisure time, for 6 weeks intervention period.</p><p>In addition, we prepared physical activity and nutritional fact sheets for parents (including student-parent tasks), and hence that they were informed of the program they had to follow in holidays. Furthermore, the intervention schools received some exercising equipment (such as balls, jump ropes, etc.) to promote physical activity during exercise intervention time period. The physical activity intervention program included 10 min of warm up, performing push-ups, curl-ups, 20 m shuttle-run tests in groups, practicing some basic sport skills like soccer, volleyball, basketball and badminton, playing one of the mentioned sports for 20&#x02013;30 min and finally 5 min cool down activities. The intervention strategies were aimed to increase the total physical activity level of all participants in general and specifically overweight or obese boy students.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics was run on all the variables.

Our intervention was associated with significant weight loss, reduced BMI, reduced body-fat percentage, and increased cardiovascular fitness, however we believed that duration of intervention was too short and many factors we have to control in this regards. Preventive or treatment programs for childhood obesity require a multidisciplinary approach and should include dietary modifications, nutritional education, changes in life style, behavioral modification, and parental involvement.</p><p>In a school-based intervention that was held in Britain and implemented in 10 primary schools with 634 children, it was found that the program resulted in remarkable improvements to achieve aims of the study.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Furthermore, in an intervention in Britain, with the aim of reducing consumption of carbonated drinks to prevent excessive weight gain in children, consumption of carbonated drinks was decreased (0.6 glasses with average glass size of 250 mL.) in the intervention group, whereas it increased in the control group; which in 12 months resulted in a decrease in the percentage of overweight and obese children in the intervention group, while it increased in the control group.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In a study carried out on American-Indian students aged 8&#x02013;11 years old, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based multi-component intervention for reducing body-fat percentage in different states, it consisted of four components: Classroom curriculum, food service modifications, physical activity and family involvement. It has been reported that, the body-fat percentage levels of subjects decreased in terms of physical activity implementation but, significant differences were not found.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In some studies, it has been reported that a multi-component school-based intervention can affect physical activity patterns in adolescents by increasing overall physical activity.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Effects of this intervention seemed to be more profound in girls than boys, low-active adolescents compared with high-active adolescents, participants with normal weight compared with overweight, and for participants with parents having middle education level as opposed to high and low education levels, respectively.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The findings above mentioned researches revealed that implementation of interventional strategies in the school system may have a beneficial effect on public health by increasing overall physical activity among adolescents and possibly among children, and low-active adolescents in particular.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, as we mentioned in some literatures in this regard, comparison studies of different kinds of school-based interventions are necessary to distinguish the most effective strategies to prevent obesity or improvements of health status of children.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>We believe that more accurate measurement methods of physical activity and multidisciplinary approaches are required to determine the effects of school-based physical activity interventions in children. Moreover, it is better to have control groups to modify and control other covariates. Hence it is regrettable to express that the present study lacks this feature. Finally, it can be said that unfortunately duration of intervention in this study was short due to inadequate facilities and other problems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The data of this study demonstrated that although duration of school-based program of this study was short, but intervention resulted in significant positive effects on body-fat percentage, BMI, WHR and aerobic fitness of the participants. Our results suggest that aerobic fitness as an indicator of physical activity is linked to decreased level of adiposity in children. According to the results of the present study and the fact that Iranian academic curriculum includes only 90 min physical activity per week, initiatives should be put forward to promote physical activity in Iranian children in both school and out-of-school environments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants for their cooperation and dedication.
