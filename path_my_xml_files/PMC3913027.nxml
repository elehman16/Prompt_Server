Recently, parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is licensed for the treatment of osteoporosis, has been shown to potentially accelerate bone healing in animal and human studies. If its administration could allow a faster functional recovery after pertrochanteric hip fracture, then a patient's hospital stay may be reduced and rehabilitation could be potentially accelerated. PTH can currently only be administered by subcutaneous injection. The acceptability of this intervention is unknown in this elderly population. The aim of this pilot study is to inform the design of a future powered study comparing the functional recovery after pertrochanteric hip fracture in patients undergoing standard care versus those who undergo administration of subcutaneous injection of PTH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is an open label, prospective, randomised, comparative pilot study with blinded outcomes assessment to establish feasibility of the trial design. Patients will be randomised to receive a 6-week course of PTH or usual treatment. Functional outcomes will be assessed at 6&#x02005;weeks and 12&#x02005;weeks. Blinded assessment will be used to minimise the effect of bias of an open label study design. A nested qualitative study will investigate the patient experience of, and expectations following, hip fracture and the patient important aspects of recovery compared with the outcome measures proposed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results will be analysed to establish the potential recruitment, compliance and retention rates using 95% CIs, and trial outcomes quoted with SDs and 95% CIs for the effect size.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the South West 2 Research Ethics committee (reference 10/H0206/34). The findings of this study will be disseminated to the medical community via presentations to orthopaedic, orthogeriatric and osteoporosis societies, and their relevant specialist journals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN Register reference number: ISRCTN03362357.</p><p>Eudract Number: 2010-020081-22</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Geriatric Medicine</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation Medicine</kwd><kwd>Qualitative Research</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Blinded assessments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Multicentre, randomised controlled trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Validated outcome measures used.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Qualitative interview of patient experience.&#x02003;&#x02002;&#x02003;&#x0200a;&#x0200a;&#x0200a;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Open label study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pilot study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Multiple questions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Vulnerable elderly population.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the UK, an estimated 70&#x02005;000 people are admitted to hospital per year due to a hip fracture. The recovery from hip fractures, in terms of outcome for the patient and timescales, requires extensive resources from the health and social services and has great implications on the quality of life and social support for the individual, despite the current treatment options available.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patients in this population rarely recover their preinjury mobility and independence.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is licensed for the treatment of osteoporosis but there is a growing number of animal studies suggesting it can aid fracture healing.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> What is currently unknown is the effectiveness of this for patients who have sustained hip fractures. A short-term medical addition of PTH to the current management of these patients has the potential to improve the rate of functional recovery and as a consequence to reduce the risks of longer hospital stays, period of dependence on services and potentially quicken functional recovery.</p><p>PTH has been shown to improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of refracture in osteoporotic humans.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Preclinical studies have shown PTH to have a beneficial effect on callus formation, in terms of quality, with regard to trabecular formation, and acceleration of the remodelling phase.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The proposed mechanism for these effects is thought to be via increasing osteoblast-induced bone formation and proliferation of mesenchymal cells when mediated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is thought to be stimulated by the inflammatory mediators following a fracture.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Therefore, PTH influences the amount of bone laid down, and the rate at which the bone is remodelled, achieving an increased amount of bone tissue, including increases in trabecular thickness.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This is thought to lead to accelerated healing of fractures. Despite the evidence from animal studies regarding the benefits in treatment of fractures,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;14</xref> the dosage, duration and cost-effectiveness of treatment remain in question.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Presently, subcutaneous injection remains the only licensed administration route<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and although there are other potential delivery systems under investigation these are not yet licensed for use.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The number of publications, expert reviews and animal studies discussing the role of intermittent PTH in fracture healing in orthopaedic, gerontology and endocrinology literature demonstrates the high level of interest and belief in this new application of PTH. Currently, the impact that this treatment may have on patients and their recovery is unknown. The use of a daily injection therapy in elderly acutely injured patients can be viewed as difficult to implement. This pilot study is necessary to investigate how reasonable it is to expect this population to be able to cope with the injection therapy and whether, due to the number of unknown circumstances within the study design, including the proposed outcome measures, it will function appropriately for a full-scale, appropriately powered study which will answer the question of efficacy.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Primary objectives</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To establish the potential recruitment, compliance and retention rates for this intervention and trial design to inform sample size calculation, feasibility and design for the full study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To trial the outcome measures intended for use in the future full study&#x02014;to test for time and ease of completion in follow-up clinics and tolerance of participants and to explore the validity and appropriateness of the suggested measures from the patients&#x02019; perspective.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To clarify and define &#x02018;standard&#x02019; medicinal care for osteoporotic fractures received by the comparison group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To establish the feasibility and acceptability of injection therapy over 6&#x02005;weeks in the elderly and acutely injured population.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This is an open label, prospective, randomised, comparative pilot study with blinded outcomes assessment to trial the study design.

They will be provided with a written patient information sheet and the trial will be discussed, including the concept of randomisation and an explanation of the treatment and follow-up included in both arms of the trial (including potential side effects of the intervention and potential participation in the qualitative substudy). The patient will be given a minimum of 24&#x02005;h to discuss their participation with whomever they choose. They will also be given contact information of the research team during this time for any further information required. Where possible, potential patients will be given as long as required to consider their participation.

The current research suggests a treatment regime of daily subcutaneous injection, between 21 and 56&#x02005;days,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which closely matches the requirement for subcutaneous injections of low molecular weight heparin for thromboprohylaxis advised for this patient group.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As a consequence, a 6-week period of treatment was decided for this study due to matching the current requirements for subcutaneous injections for thromboprophylaxis. Additionally, if 6&#x02005;weeks do not give a significant benefit, then the clinical improvement anticipated is unlikely to lead to functional improvement of the patient.</p><p>A recent study completed by Eli Lilly<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> looked at the effect of intermittent PTH on distal radial fracture healing. Measuring the time to radiographic healing, the results showed a reduced healing time in the 20&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day treatment group. The results did not show a significant reduction in time to healing measured by cortical bridging on radiograph for the 40&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day group compared with the placebo group and no dose response was observed between the 20 and 40&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day groups (given for 8&#x02005;weeks). This supports the intention to trial 20&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day. A greater functional difference should be demonstrable in hip fracture healing compared with the upper limb healing due to the role in weight-bearing, essential in activities of daily living. There may be a greater demonstrable effect in the hip fracture population if the extent of osteoporosis is greater. It is recognised by the study group that there is discussion regarding the potential reduction of effect of PTH if there is vitamin D deficiency<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and this will therefore be monitored in all patients.</p><p>Prescription of calcium and vitamin D will continue as per standard treatment. Prescription of other osteoporosis medications such as bisphosphonates and strontium will be stopped or delayed until following the 6-week PTH treatment time. Teriparatide is licensed for the treatment of severe osteoporosis and the prevention of further fragility fracture; therefore, delaying the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy does not present any risk to the patients. A review of osteoporosis medication would be indicated as standard care if a patient has been receiving a bone protection medication and has suffered another fragility fracture. After completion of the 6&#x02005;weeks PTH treatment time, the patient may begin or continue normal osteoporosis treatment which will be prompted by a letter to the participant's general practitioner (GP).</p><p>The participants randomised to the intervention arm will be assisted with the injection in the immediate postoperative phase. They will receive training to administer the injection individually from the clinical or research team prior to discharge and provided with written supporting information. The option of a carer administering the injection will be discussed as appropriate when the situation occurs.</p><p>Participants will be asked to return the injection pens to the research team at the 6-week follow-up.

Comparisons of outcome variables following randomisation will be carried out using an intention-to-treat methodology and an appropriate methodology will be used where follow-up outcome data are not available. In the full study, this may mean data imputation using regression techniques, but in the pilot study, there will be insufficient data to carry out the regressions robustly and last observation carried forward may be used to prevent omission of patients. Treatment effects between the groups will be calculated and CIs calculated. In the full study, in the unlikely event of large differences between the groups at baseline, regression techniques may be employed to demonstrate the treatment effect before and after controlling for these differences.</p><p>Thematic analysis of the qualitative data will be undertaken.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Interview transcripts will be coded and themes produced from those codes will be used to recommend domains which describe the process of &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; or &#x02018;getting better&#x02019; from the patients&#x02019; perspective and priorities.</p><p>The interviews will be audio-recorded and fully transcribed to allow coding and analysis in an ongoing and iterative manner.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Interview transcripts will be anonymised using the participants&#x02019; trial ID.
