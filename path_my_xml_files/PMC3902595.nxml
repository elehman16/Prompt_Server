The trial group there was moderate decrease in AEC which shows decrease in the magnitude of allergy so it may be inferred that it is more effective in allergic conditions. 5.27% of increase in ALC in the trial group suggests an increased lymphocytic recruitment, when it is associated with decreased ESR (rules out the chronic infection/inflammation). The possible explanation is the increased cell-mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T8" position="float"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Comparative effect on laboratory parameters in Group A and B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-281-g008"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Serum proteins and biomarkers</title><p>Trial drug showed a marked decrease in IgG and IgE. Decrease in IgG within normal limits (highly above the cut off mark of &#x0003c; 200 mg/dL to consider the person as immune compromised) suggests the subsidence of infection as there is lesser requirement of IgG after subsidence of infection. There was a marked decrease noted in the serum IgE levels in the trial group which indicates a definite role of the drug against allergy phenomenon. On serum proteins, the drug showed a statistically significant decrease in the serum globulins which may be because of decrease in various Ig levels (mainly IgE and IgG). The control drug had minimum effect on the Ig parameters. On serum proteins, the control drug also showed a statistically significant decrease in the serum globulins, this can also be attributed to a decrease in various Ig levels. On the contrary, there was marginal increase in serum albumin levels in the control group which may be the indication of improved nourishment and metabolic status. From the above data, it may be inferred that the trial drug probably reached up to Ig's (humoral immunity) stratum of the immune system to exhibit its dynamics. Whereas the control drug had minimum action on these humoral parameters, it might thus be influencing the immune system through its action on innate and/or cell-mediated immunity or through normalizing the digestion and metabolism [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Overall effect of therapy and follow-up findings</title><p>There was 54% of relief in the overall condition of recurrent <italic>Kasa</italic>/RRTI found in Group A and it was 52% in Group B.

The pungent principles present in both the formulations act as potent antitussives,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] probably by blocking the vagal sensory afferents by counter-irritant and local anesthetic mechanism.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Piperine, one of the principle components present in both the formulations has recorded its role in modulating the membrane permeability[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which may permit potassium ion influx and have a role on the ion gated mechanism of the mucosal C-type vagal receptors and may up-regulate the cough threshold.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] When administered along with honey, additional demulcent and mucokinetic actions further enhance the antitussive action. <italic>Tamalaki</italic> (<italic>Bhumyamalaki</italic>), <italic>Kantakari</italic>, <italic>Shringi</italic>, and <italic>Madhu</italic> have systemic antiviral and antimicrobial[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] actions which help in controlling the systemic infection of different origins.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] <italic>Pippali</italic>, <italic>Haritaki</italic>, <italic>Punarnava</italic>, <italic>Amalaki</italic> and <italic>Madhu</italic> have immunomodulatory activity[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which helps in eliminating the infection or regulating the allergic responses.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] On long-term usage, these also potentiate immune system as a whole and prevent recurrence or decrease the magnitude manifestation of infections and allergic phenomenon. The probable action of the drug against allergic response may be by causing an immunological shift from IgE type humoral response toward an IgG or Ig-M type response against invading antigen. The clinical study also supported the action of <italic>Kasahara Dashemani</italic> group of drugs on the humoral mechanism of immunity.</p><p>The control drug <italic>Indukanta Vati</italic> has ingredients which can be divided in to three sets. The first one is <italic>Dashamoola</italic> which is a well-known <italic>Vatahara</italic>, <italic>Shothahara</italic>, and <italic>Rasayana</italic>; whereas the other group contains <italic>Panchakola</italic> which is <italic>Ushna</italic>, <italic>Teekshna</italic>, and <italic>Vatakaphahara</italic>. The third group contains other drugs namely <italic>Puteeka</italic>, <italic>Devadaru</italic>, and <italic>Yavakshara</italic> each having different pharmaco-therapeutic actions. The drug is administered with Madhu as an adjuvant. The antitussive action of the drug is similar to that of <italic>Kasahara Dashemani Vati</italic>. Here, <italic>Madhu</italic> and <italic>Dashamoola</italic> which have additional <italic>Shothahara</italic> property act locally to alleviate the <italic>Shotha</italic> in <italic>Kantha</italic>. <italic>Panchakola</italic> exhibits its <italic>Pachana</italic> and <italic>Dipana</italic> properties and remove <italic>Ama</italic>; it also causes <italic>Sroto Shodhana</italic> and clears up all the bodily channels. The restoration of <italic>Agni</italic> improves digestion, assimilation and metabolism. As <italic>Dhatu Preenana</italic> is optimized, there will be unobstructed production of subsequent <italic>Dhatu</italic>. Ultimately, the essence of all <italic>Dhatu</italic> &#x0201c;<italic>Ojas</italic>&#x0201d; will be nourished and thus improve <italic>Sharira Bala</italic> and <italic>Vyadhikshamatva</italic>.</p><p>In modern perspective, the mode of action can be explained as follows. The drugs such as <italic>Devadaru</italic>, <italic>Yavakshara</italic>, and <italic>Madhu</italic> have mucolytic, expectorant, and demulcent properties; the constituent drugs of <italic>Panchakola</italic> act as pharyngeal counter irritants and block the receptors of cough reflex and through collective mechanism, they act as immediate cough relievers. The drugs of <italic>Dashamoola</italic> (<italic>Bilva</italic>, <italic>Agnimantha</italic>, <italic>Gambhari</italic>, <italic>Shyonaka</italic>, <italic>Gokshura</italic>, <italic>Prishniparni</italic>), <italic>Puteeka</italic>, and <italic>Devadaru</italic> possess anti-inflammatory action and these help in reducing the inflammation of the respiratory tract.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Majority of the drugs (<italic>Devadaru</italic>, <italic>Puteeka</italic>, <italic>Agnimantha</italic>, <italic>Patala</italic>, <italic>Kantakari</italic>) of this formulation have antiviral, antibacterial, or antimicrobial actions which help in eliminating systemic infection. On long-term intake, because of efficient digestion and assimilation, the body gets adequate nutrition. As the body metabolism is normalized by the action of <italic>Panchakola</italic>, there is less production of free radicals.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Kasahara Dashemani Vati</italic> was more effective in <italic>Vata Pradhana</italic> and <italic>Pitta</italic> Pradhana <italic>Kasa</italic>, showed better action on RRTI with primarily allergic etiology and was marginally better than <italic>Indukanta Vati</italic> in improving <italic>Vyadhikshamatva/Bala</italic>, even though both have a significant effect. Whereas <italic>Indukanta Vati</italic> was better in <italic>Kapha Pradhana Kasa</italic> and on RRTI with primarily infective etiology. When considering specific immune-modulation on humoral immunity, <italic>Kasahara Dashemani</italic> is the better drug of choice when compared to <italic>Indukanta Vati</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Atkins</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>DY</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Behrman</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kliegman</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenson</surname><given-names>HB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Diagnosis of allergic diseases</article-title><source>Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics</source><year>2008</year><volume>1</volume><edition>18th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Saunders Elsevier</publisher-name><fpage>938</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eggenberger</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Les infections des voies respiratoires les plus fr&#x000e9;quentes chez l&#x0203a;enfant dans la pratique ambulatoire [Respiratory tract infections most frequently seen in pediatric outpatient care]</article-title><source>Ars Med</source><year>1993</year><volume>83</volume><fpage>24</fpage><lpage>40</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kvaerner</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Nafstad</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaakkola</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Upper respiratory morbidity in preschool children: a cross-sectional study</article-title><source>Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg</source><year>2000</year><volume>126</volume><fpage>1201</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11031406</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agnivesha</surname></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Yadavji Trivikramji</surname><given-names>Acharya</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Charaka Samhita, Commentary, Chikitsa Sthana, Kasa Chikitsa Adhyaya (18/11)</article-title><year>2009</year><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan</publisher-name><fpage>540</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hibbert</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tonsils and Adenoids</article-title><source>Scott.
