Early-life influences play an important role in the development of non-communicable diseases. Indeed, maternal lifestyle and conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus or obesity can affect the risk of diabetes in the next generation. Lifestyle changes can help to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a protocol for an unblinded, community-based, randomised controlled trial in two arms to evaluate the efficacy of a complex behavioural change intervention, combining motivational interviewing provided by a community health promoter and access to a habit formation mobile application, among young Malaysian women and their spouses prior to pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><p>Eligible subjects will be Malaysian women in the age group 20 to 39&#x000a0;years, who are nulliparous, not diagnosed with diabetes and own a smartphone. With an alpha-value of 0.05, a statistical power of 90&#x000a0;%, 264 subjects will need to complete the study. Subjects with their spouses will be randomised to either the intervention or the control arm for an 8-month period. The primary endpoint is change in waist circumference from baseline to end of intervention period and secondary endpoints are changes in anthropometric parameters, biochemical parameters, change in health literacy level, dietary habits, physical activity and stress level. Primary endpoint and the continuous secondary endpoints will be analysed in a linear regression model, whereas secondary endpoints on an ordinal scale will be analysed by using the chi-squared test. A multivariate linear model for the primary endpoint will be undertaken to account for potential confounders.

Today 387 million people are living with diabetes whereas 46.3&#x000a0;% remain undiagnosed. The prevalence of DM is expected to increase to 53&#x000a0;% by 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. DM is an important public health concern in Malaysia. Over the past two decades, the population of Malaysia has grown rapidly and the prevalence of DM in Malaysia has increased dramatically, along with the prevalence of obesity, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015 estimated the prevalence of DM in adults 18&#x000a0;years old and over was 11.6&#x000a0;% in 2006 and 17.5&#x000a0;% in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of DM has almost tripled over the past two decades in the younger generations (20&#x02013;39 years old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>There is a body of evidence showing that lifestyle changes, such as achieving a healthy body weight, can help to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Complex behavioural change interventions, or lifestyle intervention trials, have also moved in the past decade from targeting high-risk to low-risk populations and interventions have also been targeted earlier in the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The use of new communication technologies, such as computer-based interventions, and empowerment techniques such as goal setting, have been found to be helpful and eventually more effective than other interventions on weight loss and self-management of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Lifestyle interventions seek to delay or halt the development of T2DM and achieve, e.g. a healthy body weight. Goal setting requires a coordinated team effort that involves the person at risk in the decision-making process. Evidence demonstrates that structured, intensive lifestyle programmes involving participant education, individualised counselling, reduced dietary energy and fat intake, regular physical activity, and frequent participant contact are necessary to produce long-term weight loss of 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept describes how during early life (at conception, and/or during foetal life, infancy and early childhood), the environment induces changes in development that have a long-term impact on later health and disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Early-life influences play an important role in the development of NCDs, and maternal lifestyle and conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or obesity can affect the risk of diabetes in the next generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Besides complications of pregnancy such as GDM, hypertension, and preeclampsia that directly affect the pregnancy outcome, the mother&#x02019;s health during pregnancy affects her child&#x02019;s risk of becoming overweight or obese. If the mother makes lifestyle choices that lead to unbalanced nutrition, obesity, stress, smoking and others, her child is more vulnerable to diabetes and other NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Children born to mothers with GDM have a four to eight times higher risk of obesity, glucose intolerance and T2DM in adolescence or young adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The Jom Mama project has been designed to develop an intervention which responds to this rising public health challenge, focusing on young Malaysian women and their spouses. The overall aim of the Jom Mama project is to demonstrate whether a complex behavioural change intervention will change markers of health in the young Malaysian woman in the pre-conception period, before evaluating whether the intervention affects the pregnancy course and the neonate susceptibility to obesity and diabetes. The Jom Mama project is a public-private partnership between the Ministry of Health (MoH), Malaysia; the University of Southampton, UK; the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa; the Steno Diabetes Centre, Denmark; and Novo Nordisk, Denmark. The project was initiated in 2012 and is following Intervention Mapping guidelines, which is a systematic framework to develop health promotion programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The Jom Mama project is conducted in three phases; phase 1: to develop knowledge on the lifestyle of young couples in Malaysia and identify the barriers and facilitators of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; phase 2: to develop intervention matrices and develop an intervention package based on the outcome from phase 1; and phase 3: to implement and evaluate the developed intervention package in a randomised control trial (RCT). In this paper we will present the study protocol for an unblinded, community-based, RCT with two arms to evaluate the complex behavioural change intervention developed in phase 2 of the Jom Mama project.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a complex behavioural change intervention combining behaviour change counselling provided by community health promoters (CHPs) and utilisation of an E-health platform to enhance women&#x02019;s health prior to pregnancy. This will be measured through the change in waist circumference after the 8-month intervention period between female subjects exposed to the intervention and female subjects exposed to standard of care in a control group. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on health literacy, dietary habits, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and stress level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The trial is designed as an unblinded, RCT to assess the efficacy of a complex behavioural change intervention aiming to improve the overall health of young women prior to their first pregnancy.

Other sites in Seremban such as the state marriage registration office, temples and churches or other sites (work places, malls, gyms, etc.) will also be approached for recruitment purposes. A research officer will meet the young couples face-to-face and provide an explanation of the study rationale and a description of the Jom Mama project. The women and spouse will be given an opportunity to ask questions and those who are interested in the study will have their contact details recorded for further contact and arrangements for a baseline visit. If possible, the couple will be given a clinic appointment for baseline measurements at one of the five designated primary health clinics in Seremban. If the couple need time to consider their involvement, the research officer will follow-up with three phone calls over the next 3&#x000a0;weeks. If, at these phone calls the couple accepts participation in the trial, a baseline appointment will be made. If the couple does not answer the three phone calls or rejects the offer to participate, they will be dropped from the participation registration list.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention has two components. The first component is an interaction with a CHP who will be in contact with the women and their spouses during the 8-month intervention period. These contacts will be a combination of three face-to-face meetings, three phone calls and communication through Whatsapp group chat. The CHP will use motivational counselling techniques, i.e. motivational interviewing, to support and motivate the young women and their spouses to live a healthier lifestyle. The second component is an E-health platform which consists of two elements: (1) a mobile application in the form of a habit formation application, where subjects and spouses can select different challenges for obtaining a healthy diet, more physical activity and less sedentary behaviour during the intervention period; and (2) a web-based back-end interface which can be accessed by the CHP, which will be her tool to assess the women and their spouses&#x02019; lifestyle situation. The CHP uses a dashboard to follow the progress of subject and spouse in performing the challenges, and uses the information to interact with the subject and her spouse during the contact points in the intervention. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> presents screen shots of the web-based application the CHPs are using. The CHP will function as a personal coach to engage, support and guide the young woman and her spouse toward achieving and maintaining a healthier lifestyle. During the interaction over the intervention period of 8&#x000a0;months, the CHPs will assess the subject and her spouse&#x02019;s health risks and behaviour, share information on healthy living and support the subjects and spouses to reach their personal health goals.

Prior to the start of the intervention, the community nurses undertook training in becoming a CHP. This was a 5-day training programme with sessions in motivational interviewing techniques, the use of the E-health platform and basic knowledge of healthy diet and physical activity. The training was carried out by local trainers who are social-psychologists with expertise in motivational interviewing techniques, professional dieticians and physical activity experts. During the trial, refreshment training with the social-psychologist trainers will take place to support and help the CHPs in addressing challenging situations they encountered with the young women and their spouses.</p><p>The mobile application is a habit-formation application, which incorporates personal goal setting, progress tracking and general information on healthy lifestyles. The mobile application has two key components comprising diet and physical activity. Under each domain several challenges have been developed which can be selected by the subject on a monthly basis in dialogue with the CHP. The application will suggest several challenges for healthy eating, such as making healthy food choices and healthy food preparation, and interactive options for the subject to stay active and prevent sedentary behaviour. In addition, the mobile application will also provide information on what constitutes a healthy lifestyle and further information on how to stay healthy before pregnancy. The mobile application is available on iOS and Android operating systems.

In addition, there are existing national Malaysian data on population waist circumference, which allow for the study results to be comparable on a national level. In the present trial, the primary endpoint is predicted to provide a 2-cm reduction of waist circumference in the intervention group compared to the control group, which will reflect a reduction of central fat distribution. The reduction of 2&#x000a0;cm in waist circumference as a primary endpoint is based on the mean from a number of studies indicating that a decrement of waist circumference is possible with a lifestyle changing intervention over a period of 8&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The variation between the two time-points in these studies was small (standard deviation (SD) of 3&#x02013;5) after the intervention period, and we therefore assume an expected within-person estimate of SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>The secondary endpoint will be as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Change in BMI from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in waist-to-height ratio from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in waist-to-hip ratio from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in weight from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in glycated haemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in the fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides) from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in the level of health literacy, as measured by the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLC-EU-Q47) from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in dietary intake, as measured by a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour, as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) used in national health surveys in Malaysia, from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in stress levels, as measured by the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21-items (DASS-21) used by general practitioners in the Malaysian primary health care system from baseline to after 8&#x000a0;months</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Other endpoints</title><p>The incidence of GDM, confirmed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), will be assessed in the subjects who will complete the intervention period and who become pregnant in the post-trial monitoring period.

Only the subject in the couple will provide a 10-mL blood sample to measure glycated haemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and a fasting lipid profile (triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC)). Due to the need for a fasting lipid profile analysis, the subject will be asked to come to the clinic after fasting for a minimum of 9&#x000a0;h. In line with this, the data collection time-points are planned to be in the morning. The European Health Literacy Tool Q-47 (HL-EU-Q47) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (HL-EU Consortium 2012), the Malaysian Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), modified to be used in the current trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21-items (DASS-21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] will be used to collect data on level of health literacy, dietary pattern, physical activity level, and stress level, respectively. Data such as socio-demographic parameters and family history of diabetes will be collected by structured interviews with the study nurse. The spouse will undergo the same data measurements, with the exception of blood sampling. At the end of the data collection, and before subject and spouse leave, data will be checked by the study nurse and site coordinator or research officer, to ensure that all data forms and questionnaires have been filled correctly. When data collection is completed the data collection forms and questionnaires will be signed-off by the study nurse and site coordinator or research officer. At the end of the baseline visit, if the subject is randomised to the intervention, the first contact with a CHP will be made. The subject and spouse will be introduced to the mobile application and it will be installed on the subject&#x02019;s and spouse&#x02019;s smartphone device. If the subject and spouse have sufficient time the CHP will proceed with the first contact point. If the subject and spouse do not have the time, an appointment will be set in the next 5&#x000a0;days either at the clinic or at the couple&#x02019;s house.

Documentation as well as corrections, if necessary, will be done in accordance to Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All protocol-required information collected during the trial must be entered on a data collection form containing the four questionnaires. The original completed data collection form will be send to IHSR, MoH Malaysia, where double data entry will be performed by two independent data clerks. The completeness, validity and plausibility of data are examined by validating programmes, which thereby generate queries. The generated queries will be checked with original data collection forms and all changes from the original data are documented on audit files. Data will be maintained and analysed in the statistical Stata programme, version 12.0 or higher (StataCorp LP). Monitoring will be performed regularly by an independent clinical research organisation from Malaysia to check the completeness of the contents of records and the data collection forms, the adherence to the protocol and the progress of enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change in waist circumference between the intervention and the control group after the 8-month intervention. The alternative hypothesis is that the decrement in waist circumference will be bigger in the intervention group compared to the control group after the 8-month intervention. A linear regression model will be used to assess the difference in the change of waist circumference from baseline to end of intervention, with the difference in waist circumference as the independent variable, treatment (intervention versus control) and baseline waist circumference as covariates. Additional tests will be performed for the impact of the intervention in both high- (waist circumference above 80&#x000a0;cm) and low-risk (waist circumference below 80&#x000a0;cm) groups. This will be done by subgroup analysis or by assessing the proportional changes in the primary endpoint. Each subgroup will also be analysed in a linear regression model. The continuous secondary endpoints will be analysed in a linear regression model, whereas the difference in the change of each secondary endpoint from baseline to end of intervention, will be the dependent variable, treatment (intervention versus control) and baseline value as covariate. Regarding health literacy (HL-EU-Q47), physical activity (IPAQ) and stress (DASS-21) all the variables are ordinal and, therefore, independence between intervention and control groups will be tested with the chi-squared test. Change in nutrient intakes will be compared between the groups using a generalised linear model, with additional adjustments for total energy intake. Nutrient and food patterns before and after the intervention will be explored in both groups separately by using dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis. Multivariate analysis will be performed to assess the association between exposure to the intervention, primary endpoints and secondary endpoints (BMI, waist-to-height and waist-to-hip ratio, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid profile, blood pressure, health literacy, physical activity, dietary intake and stress level) using linear regressions. In this model the secondary endpoint will be included in the model as covariates and the estimated coefficients will be presented unadjusted and adjusted for appropriate and/or effect modifier and/or confounders. Furthermore, interactions between the secondary endpoints will also be explored. Several supportive analyses will be performed. The first supportive analysis will explore the relation between subjects&#x02019; and spouses&#x02019; change in waist circumference and other anthropometric measurements, diet, physical activity, health literacy and stress. A second supportive analysis will explore whether a short intervention period (subjects who become pregnant between 4.1 and 8&#x000a0;months in the intervention period), will also have an impact on the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints. A time variable explaining how long they have been included in the intervention will be included in the models as a covariate. At the end of the 12-month post-intervention monitoring period, a full analysis will be conducted on subjects who become pregnant within 12&#x000a0;months after completing the intervention. This will be done by assessing the incidences of GDM among women who became pregnant between treatment groups, using a chi-squared test. Additionally, a logistic regression model to explore associations between the number of subjects with GDM and several secondary endpoints will be conducted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Ethical, regulatory and data management considerations</title><p>The study protocol version 4.0 dated 12 August 2015 has received ethical and governance approvals by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health Malaysia (protocol number: NMRR-14-904-21963) on 21 September 2015. The study is performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent will be taken from each participant prior to study enrolment by trained study nurse.

Other studies assessing the prevention of GDM and T2DM have mainly focused on high-risk groups or the intervention entry point has been in the first trimester of the women&#x02019;s pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], whereas few RCT studies exist on low-risk populations or on an intervention entry point in the pre-conception period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. To develop population strategies, instead of targeting high-risk groups it is imperative to widen the focus to the general population, especially in a country such as Malaysia where the prevalence of diabetes and obesity has increased alarmingly in the last 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One European study has shown that limited guidelines and policies exist in this area, as guidelines and policies are designed to mainly target high-risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, this study may contribute evidence to this important area which is needed to support policy-makers in making rational decisions to improve population health.</p><p>A pilot test was conducted prior to trial implementation and has identified a number of challenges. A major challenge that has been found is that the intervention addresses a challenging period for young Malaysian couples, whereby busy work schedules and lack of time affect participation rates and generate low interest in such an intervention. While it would be ideal to collect spousal data at baseline and endpoint, it will be made optional for the spouse to attend both baseline and endpoint visits if they are unable to attend in order to continue with recruitment. Based on these observations, it is expected that the recruitment period will be longer than initially anticipated.</p><p>The combination of motivational interviewing through a CHP and E-health platform is a novel approach. Training the community nurses to become CHPs involves an interactive approach beyond their conventional training programmes; this provided new learning experiences for these nurses to build higher capacity in patient engagement. The E-health platform is also a new experience for the primary health care services in the Seremban district and considerable time was needed to train community nurses with the necessary IT skills. Another key challenge faced was the limited usage of the E-health mobile application due to poor Internet connectivity in the district of Seremban. In mitigating this challenge, Wi-Fi hotspots in the designated primary health clinics have been set up to enable participating women and their spouses to download the mobile application in a secured Internet environment. Additionally, several changes have been made to the E-health platform to make it more robust.</p><p>The proposed trial will not directly assess the long-term effects of the intervention on the risk of the offspring developing T2DM. Given the complexity of developing, implementing and evaluating complex behavioural change lifestyle interventions, this trial will focus on improving the pre-conception health in young women prior to their first pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started recruitment in November 2015.
