In view of the aging population with chronic pain and the lack of evidence-based pain management programs locally, we developed a multicomponent intervention incorporating physical exercise and cognitive behavioral techniques and examined its long-term effects against treatment as usual (i.e., pain education) in older adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain in Hong Kong.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">We are conducting a double-blind, cluster-randomized controlled trial. A sample of 160 participants aged &#x02265;&#x02009;60 years will be recruited from social centers or outpatient clinics and will be randomized on the basis of center/clinic to either the multicomponent intervention or the pain education program. Both interventions consist of ten weekly sessions of 90 minutes each. The primary outcome is pain intensity, and the secondary outcomes include pain interference, pain persistence, pain self-efficacy, pain coping, pain catastrophizing cognitions, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and hip and knee muscle strength. All outcome measures will be collected at baseline, postintervention, and at 3 and 6 months follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed using mixed-effects regression to see whether the multicomponent intervention alleviates pain intensity and associated outcomes over and above the effects of pain education (i.e., a treatment &#x000d7; time intervention effect).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Because the activities included in the multicomponent intervention were carefully selected for ready implementation by allied health professionals in general, the results of this study, if positive, will make available an efficacious, nonpharmacological pain management program that can be widely adopted in clinical and social service settings and will hence improve older people&#x02019;s access to pain management services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IIR-16008387.

With rapidly aging populations, the number of people worldwide experiencing pain is expected to increase sharply in the decades to come. Research in Western countries consistently shows the prevalence of pain rising to a peak of 30&#x02013;65% in the age group of 55&#x02013;65 years and then declining somewhat to around 25&#x02013;55% among those aged 85 years or over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Worldwide, the most common pain disorders reported by older people include arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis), back pain, and fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The high prevalence of pain in the older population can be explained by the higher rates of surgical procedures, injury, and disease in later life. Age-related neurophysiological changes, such as decline in pain tolerance and increased pain sensitivity, also contribute to an increased risk of pain in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Even if there is a slight reduction in pain prevalence in the very advanced age group due to the survivor effect (i.e., persons with less favorable health conditions would have had early mortality), it is estimated that 25&#x02013;55% of very old adults have at least one pain problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) figure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2270_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par6">Despite the high prevalence of pain and its medical and psychiatric comorbidities in later life, pain is often underreported in older people. Many older persons are stoic regarding mild aches and pain sensations because it is often assumed that pain is an inevitable part of the aging process and should be tolerated. In fact, there are common cultural and social myths about pain and its management in older people that are shared by healthcare professionals as well as the general public, who often underestimate the extent of pain experienced by older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, many believe that older people get used to the pain and should therefore be given a lower priority for treatment than younger patients with similar clinical characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, many elders assume a passive role in healthcare and are hesitant to report pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As a result, older people may be at a disadvantage in terms of access to pain management services, such as being underrepresented in multidisciplinary pain management programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Even after they are admitted to such programs, older people are often provided with less treatment and fewer treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This stands in contrast to the fact that the pain they experience is often of a chronic nature and has potentially serious physical and psychosocial consequences, including a lower health-related quality of life, increased depression and anxiety, sleep disturbances, social isolation, and impaired cognitive performance and functional ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For instance, a study showed that 46% and 53% of chronic nonmalignant pain patients aged &#x02265;&#x02009;72 years were diagnosed with major depressive disorder and reported suicidal ideation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Although it has been widely recognized that multidisciplinary pain management that incorporates analgesic medication with nonpharmacological approaches such as psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy), physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and alternative medicine is more effective in pain reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the pharmacological approach remains the mainstay treatment for pain relief among older patients in many parts of the world, including Hong Kong. Part of the reason is the lack of evidence-based nonpharmacological pain management programs in these communities.</p><p id="Par8">In the pain management literature, both physical activity and cognitive behavioral therapy have been found to be effective in alleviating pain intensity and the degree to which pain interferes with daily functioning in adults in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and older adults in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], leading to one evidence-based guideline for combining both approaches in the management of chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, whereas there were relatively more physical activity interventions for older people, only a few studies have incorporated cognitive behavioral techniques, and most of these studies suffer from small sample sizes and no or short follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that a recent randomized trial of 141 older adults with chronic pain showed that cognitive behavioral techniques, when combined with physical exercise, were superior to exercise alone or a wait-list control group across a range of outcomes, including pain intensity, pain-related distress and disability, dysfunctional cognitions, and a functional reach test, with small to medium effect sizes 1 month postintervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This was, to the best of our knowledge, the only study to date incorporating cognitive behavioral techniques and physical exercise in a randomized trial for older adults with chronic pain. More studies are necessary to verify the therapeutic benefits of such multicomponent interventions and to see if the benefits can be generalized to other cultural groups. We therefore are conducting a cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate the long-term effects (up to 6 months postintervention) of a multimodal intervention combining physical exercise and cognitive behavioral techniques on alleviating the intensity of pain in older adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain in Hong Kong.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives and design</title><p id="Par9">In a cluster-randomized controlled trial with two arms, we aim to evaluate the long-term effects of a newly developed multicomponent pain management intervention incorporating physical exercise and cognitive behavioral techniques against a pain education program (i.e., treatment as usual) in older adults. The activities included in the multicomponent intervention were carefully selected so that they could be readily implementable by allied health professionals in general to enhance adoption of the program in clinical practice, especially in places such as Hong Kong, where personnel in certain specialties are lacking. The primary outcome is pain intensity, whereas the secondary outcomes include pain interference, pain persistence, pain self-efficacy, pain coping, pain catastrophizing cognitions, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and hip and knee muscle strength. All outcome measures will be collected at baseline, postintervention, and 3 and 6 months follow-up.&#x000a0;Key aspects of the study&#x000a0;design can be found in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par10">Both interventions have ten weekly sessions of 90 minutes each. The pain education program was derived from a brochure on pain management that is distributed in public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong (i.e., treatment as usual), and it covers general information about chronic pain (including the impact, cause, and type), pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacological pain relief strategies, community resources, and pain-related sleep difficulties and possible ways to alleviate them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It was necessary to adapt the educational brochure, a reading material, into an interactive format with the same duration as the multicomponent intervention program so that any difference in treatment outcome between the two programs cannot be attributed to differences in format, exposure, and intensity (i.e., placebo effects). <italic>See</italic> Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details of the pain education program.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pain education intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Session</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Session 1</td><td>Situation of chronic pain among Hong Kong older adults<break/>Difference between chronic pain and acute pain<break/>Types of chronic pain</td></tr><tr><td>Session 2</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Impact of chronic pain on older adults<break/>Interaction between chronic pain, bodily function, and psychological condition<break/>Impact of chronic pain on social relationships with others<break/>Understanding the vicious cycle related to chronic pain</td></tr><tr><td>Session 3</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Causes of chronic pain<break/>Different types of chronic pain</td></tr><tr><td>Session 4</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Addressing misunderstandings about chronic pain<break/>Drug and nondrug therapies</td></tr><tr><td>Session 5</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Introducing the pain ladder recommended by the World Health Organization<break/>How to take medicine appropriately<break/>Addressing the concerns of taking medicine<break/>Side effects of drugs and things to notice (part A)</td></tr><tr><td>Session 6</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Side effects of drugs and things to notice (part B)<break/>Physiotherapy<break/>Stimulation (electrotherapy, acupuncture)<break/>Surgery<break/>Aromatherapy</td></tr><tr><td>Session 7</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Psychological strategies to deal with chronic pain<break/>Hydrotherapy<break/>Music therapy</td></tr><tr><td>Session 8</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Different types of medical imaging in managing chronic pain<break/>How to cooperate with doctors in dealing with pain</td></tr><tr><td>Session 9</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Adjustment of walking speed<break/>Introducing correct bodily postures<break/>Introducing safety guidelines for physical exercises<break/>How to exercise correctly</td></tr><tr><td>Session 10</td><td>Review of previous session<break/>Sleep problems related to chronic pain<break/>Impact of insomnia<break/>Managing sleep problems<break/>Healthy sleeping habits<break/>Social resources</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par11">The physical exercise component of the multicomponent intervention was developed on the basis of existing self-help physical exercise manuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] on exercises suitable for older adults with musculoskeletal pain. The activities used in the intervention include stretching and strengthening exercises that have been shown to be the most effective among different exercise types for alleviating pain and improving function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, participants are given balance training that, along with strengthening exercise, can reduce fall rates in older people by improving the ability to control and maintain the body&#x02019;s position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Each of the ten sessions begins with a 45-minute physical exercise program that includes a 5-minute warmup and 10-minute stretching, 15-minute strengthening, 10-minute balance, and 5-minute cooldown exercises.</p><p id="Par12">The physical exercises are followed by a 40-minute training on cognitive behavioral techniques before a 5-minute conclusion. The psychological modules of the multicomponent intervention were designed using cognitive behavioral principles, focusing on participants&#x02019; cognitions, feelings, and behaviors in response to pain. In particular, the intervention emphasizes motivating participants to modify their dysfunctional thoughts that prevent them from engaging in physical and social activities and exploring realistic alternatives. These modules therefore complement the physical exercise component by reducing resistance to engage in physical and other activities that have the potential to reduce pain and related problems. The other techniques, including relaxation exercise, goal setting, assertive communication skills, self-compassion, positive self-statement, and stress management, are also applied. The modules are based partly on existing manuals on pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and guidelines for pain management for older adults using cognitive behavioral principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

To facilitate self-management, a brochure with summarized content of each session is to be given to each participant at the end of each session to bring home. Two home visits at 2 and 5 months after the intervention, respectively, are paid to each participant to answer any questions they have about practicing the skills at home and to consolidate their learning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par14">We aim to recruit 150 participants from 20 social centers for older people and outpatient geriatric/pain clinics (i.e., clusters) in Hong Kong, with 6&#x02013;12 participants per cluster.

The Chronic Pain Grade questionnaire pain intensity subscale has three items measuring pain intensity at present, at the worst time, and on average within the past 3 months on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as could be). The original scoring averages the three items and multiplies it by 10 to yield a maximum of 100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The visual analogue pain scale is a continuous outcome measure consisting of a 10-cm line from 0 to 10 with low- and high-end points of &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pain as bad as could be&#x0201d;; respondents are asked to put an &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; on the line to indicate their pain intensity in the preceding week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The Faces Pain Scale consists of six facial expressions to illustrate a spectrum of pain intensity in the past week and is scored 0 (no pain facial expression) to 5 (extremely pain facial expression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Finally, the Verbal Rating Pain Scale asks respondents to rate their pain intensity by choosing from among six descriptors: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, 3 = severe pain, 4 = very severe pain, and 5 = worst possible pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Besides the pain intensity subscale, all are single-item measures. In this study, the scores for the Faces Pain Scale and the Verbal Rating Pain Scale will be multiplied by 2 to obtain possible maximum scores of 10 for both instruments. For the primary outcome measure, we will form a composite measure of pain intensity by aggregating the scores of the six items from the four instruments described above (here, scores of the Chronic Pain Grade questionnaire pain intensity items are not multiplied by 10, so that all items of the composite measure have a maximum score of 10). In a pilot study of 694 Hong Kong older adults, this composite measure had a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of 0.90.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pain interference</title><p id="Par20">The pain interference subscale of the Chronic Pain Grade questionnaire (&#x003b1; = 0.89 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]) contains three items measuring the degree to which pain has interfered with daily activity, social activity, and work ability in the past 3 months on a scale of 0 (no interference) to 10 (pain interference as bad as could be).

Evidence-based nonpharmacological interventions are very much needed. Such interventions are preferably designed in such a way that they are deliverable by a range of healthcare workers in different settings to improve access to pain management services, especially in places such as Hong Kong, where specialist manpower is very tight or lacking. The interventions should also be implementable at home to facilitate self-management by older adults.</p><p id="Par35">The present multicomponent intervention was designed according to these principles and considerations, on the basis of existing evidence and guidelines about the use of physical exercise and cognitive behavioral techniques for the management of pain. This intervention is being subjected to an evaluation against a pain education program in a double-blind, cluster-randomized controlled trial. Although this pain education program was developed on the basis of an existing brochure, it is, in theory, a more &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; and powerful intervention in the sense that it invites participants to question, explore, discuss, and interact rather than simply to receive information passively, such as when reading a brochure. The design also ensures that participants in the two treatment arms will have the same degree of treatment exposure (i.e., the number of sessions and their durations are the same), thus providing a rigorous assessment of the efficacy of the multicomponent intervention. Positive findings derived from this trial are expected to encourage society-wide adoption of this intervention program for the benefit of our aging communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par36">Trial recruitment started in May 2016 and was estimated to last until November 2017 (protocol version 1, dated January 27, 2017).
