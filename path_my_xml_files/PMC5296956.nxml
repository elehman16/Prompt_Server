This protocol paper outlines an implementation-effectiveness study of the Integrated Solutions for Sustainable Fall Prevention (iSOLVE) intervention which has developed integrated processes and pathways to identify older people at risk of falls and engage a whole of primary care approach to fall prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This protocol paper presents the iSOLVE implementation processes and change strategies and outlines the study design of a blended type 2 hybrid design. The study consists of a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial in 28 general practices and recruiting 560 patients in Sydney, Australia, to evaluate effectiveness of the iSOLVE intervention in changing general practitioner fall management practices and reducing patient falls and the cost effectiveness from a healthcare funder perspective. Secondary outcomes include change in medications known to increase fall risk. We will simultaneously conduct a multi-methodology evaluation to investigate the workability and utility of the implementation intervention. The implementation evaluation includes in-depth interviews and surveys with general practitioners and allied health professionals to explore acceptability and uptake of the intervention, the coherence of the proposed changes for those in the work setting, and how to facilitate the collective action needed to implement changes in practice; social network mapping will explore professional relationships and influences on referral patterns; and, a survey of GPs in the geographical intervention zone will test diffusion of evidence-based fall prevention practices. The project works in partnership with a primary care health network, state fall prevention leaders, and a community of practice of fall prevention advocates.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The design is aimed at providing clear direction for sustainability and informing decisions about generalization of the iSOLVE intervention processes and change strategies. While challenges exist in hybrid designs, there is a potential for significant outcomes as the iSOLVE pathways project brings together practice and research to collectively solve a major national problem with implications for policy service delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinial Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=368286&#x00026;isReview=truealternatively">ACTRN12615000401550</ext-link>

Primary care, which can include general practice, allied health services, community health, and community pharmacy, is generally the first point of contact people have with a health system. General practitioners (GP), in particular are relied on to manage the needs of older patients who are falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, there is currently no clear model for engaging GPs in fall prevention, and few older people are asked by their GP about falls or are offered interventions to prevent falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This leaves a huge gap of missed opportunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Among those GPs that do address falls, few base their falls prevention practice on recognized clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further, the development of care plans and routine use of allied health professionals in fall prevention has been slow. This has been attributed to organizational barriers, difficulty for GPs in initiating referral and/or reimbursement processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], time constraints, a lack of educational materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and limited understanding of what allied health professionals can offer in fall prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While there has been research about the acceptability and uptake of care plans, there is limited research on the efficacy of multidisciplinary team approaches as an intervention to improve clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Another major problem for evidence uptake is that successful trials of fall interventions have more often been provided within a research context. Several studies have failed to find fall prevention effects from interventions that identify older people at risk of falls in general practice followed by referral to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It appears that usual care may not reflect evidence-based fall prevention. To determine why multi-factorial programs are successful or not, careful consideration needs to be given to the content of the fall prevention intervention, the process in which the intervention content is delivered and if the intervention is targeted to the appropriate group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Lovarini et al.&#x02019;s systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] demonstrated a lack of fall prevention research empirically testing sustainability of intervention implementation. We need to find ways of implementation in real-life contexts that are evidence-based, generalizable, and are sustainable.</p><p>A systematic review of qualitative studies investigated factors influencing the implementation of falls prevention programs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] This review included studies that collected information on the views of older people and health professionals. Barriers and facilitators include practical considerations (economic, access, time), adaptability of the program for the community served (social and cultural factors), and psychosocial factors (being identified as a faller, impact of falls, client preferences, the way advice is delivered and by whom). A systematic review of interventions conducting training and dissemination of evidence to healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] provides evidence that training can improve implementation, but conclusions were based on six studies of which only one was a controlled trial. There was mixed support for effectiveness of changes to primary care management of falls, peer or lay-volunteer interventions, and community awareness campaigns.</p><p>Identified factors for uptake and implementation of fall prevention in primary care include accessible pathways for referral which identify people most at risk, engagement in collaborative partnerships and developing opportunities for knowledge transfer and up-skilling, thereby building capacity and ensuring better outcomes and broader population reach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, Ganz et al.&#x02019;s implementation of fall prevention into a veteran&#x02019;s organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found that the key to cultural change was collaboration and links between older people and health service providers and the development and support of healthcare organizations/systems to better deliver falls prevention interventions. Mahoney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], when implementing a community-based fall prevention program for widespread dissemination in the USA, demonstrated how evidence-based training needs to be supported by implementation guidelines for partner organizations to ensure successful adoption.</p><p>In order to test a model where general practice and allied health services are integrated and evidence-based, we conducted a small feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] involving two GP practices consisting of eight GPs and two private practices of physiotherapists and occupational therapists, with fall prevention interventions delivered under a Medicare rebate system (Enhanced Primary Care for Allied Health Professionals) providing partial service payment. Individual measures showed clinically important changes with excellent adherence.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim and research questions</title><p>To better inform authentic sustainable population approaches to fall prevention, we have developed the Integrated Solutions for Sustainable Fall Prevention (iSOLVE) project. The aim of iSOLVE is to establish integrated processes and pathways to identify older people at risk of falls and engage a whole of primary care approach to fall prevention. We will achieve this by improving access to appropriate fall prevention interventions for older people, ensuring ongoing knowledge acquisition and sustainable action by medical practitioners and allied healthcare professionals; implementing decision-making support within general practice; and generating pathways to facilitate implementation through collaboration within a regional health network.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research questions</title><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The primary effectiveness research questions are to evaluate if the iSOLVE model will be effective in (i) reducing falls in patients of participating practices compared to control practices and (ii) increasing general practitioners&#x02019; engagement in fall prevention management and referral practices compared to the control GPs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The primary implementation research questions will (i) investigate how the iSOLVE strategies are adopted (or not) at individual (GP and allied health professional (AHP)) practice, and primary care network levels; and (ii) identify the factors that will facilitate the embedding of the intervention in usual care, and thus its sustainability.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><p>Our study uses a type 2 blended design which places equal importance on evaluating both intervention effectiveness and implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This design is aimed at providing clear direction for sustainability and informing decisions about generalization of the iSOLVE strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We will test the effectiveness of the iSOLVE pathways model through a cluster randomized controlled trial to determine effectiveness for individual patients and change in GP referral behaviours. The implementation evaluation is utilizing a multi-methodology process including in-depth interviews and surveys, social network mapping, and surveying of GPs in the geographical intervention zone.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p>Partnerships are crucial in all phases of the project: development, implementation and in longer term plans for dissemination and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] We are conducting the project in a metropolitan area and partnering initially with the Northern Sydney Medicare Local which, due to change in Federal Government policy, was replaced in 2016 by the Sydney North Primary Health Network (SNPHN), effectively doubling its geographic area. The networks have a role in educating and engaging primary care and allied health professions to enable access to effective health services. Another partner is the New South Wales (NSW) state Clinical Excellence Commission&#x02019;s Fall Prevention Program which provides state-wide leadership in implementing NSW Health Falls Policy and sharing of knowledge and resources. Our final partnership is with the community of practice of fall prevention advocates. An advisory committee consisting of 14 members represents the range of allied health, community pharmacy, and primary care physicians within the district, along with consumer representation. The committee members are a highly skilled group with a broad range of perspectives on implementing fall prevention, providing support, advocacy, and informal guidance to the project.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The iSOLVE intervention</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>Our theoretically informed iSOLVE pathways model will be integrated within one region, the Sydney North Primary Health Network (SNPHN) using the GP practice as the core focus to develop and implement effective clinical pathways by re-shaping the professional connections between potential fall service providers and the GP practice. Building decision support tools, pathways, routine referral processes, and active networks will be a way of levering evidence into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The development has been guided by the knowledge-to-action framework (KAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which uses practical steps to implement and sustain evidence in practice: adaptation of knowledge to the local context, assessing barriers to implementation, tailoring the intervention, and evaluating outcomes. Michie et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] behaviour change wheel provides a resource for determining key elements of behaviour change within iSOLVE such as understanding what aspects of incentives, enabling and training are key to effective functioning of our emergent model. Further, the normalization process theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], considered a major theory to guide the sustainability of healthcare innovations, will frame our understanding of, and our approaches to, how new practices can be routinely used by organizations as it focuses on processes to enable new practices to become embedded. And finally, Lau et al.'s review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] provides a useful and practical example of factors which influence change in practice in primary care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Components of the iSOLVE pathway model of intervention</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides a description of the four components of the iSOLVE intervention and summarizes the planned active ingredients of these components. <italic>Component one</italic>: <italic>Identifying and managing fall risk in general practice</italic> comprises individual face-to-face training and a comprehensive set of tools to support GP&#x02019;s in knowledge translation, education, and in identifying and managing fall risk. <italic>Component two</italic>: <italic>Knowledge translation</italic>, <italic>education</italic>, <italic>and up-skilling the allied health local workforce</italic> comprises evidence-based fall prevention workshops, sharing implementation strategies and opportunities for linking services to GP practices. <italic>Component three</italic>: <italic>Referral pathways in primary care</italic> outlines the role of GPs, allied health, and the SNPHN in fall prevention and the strategies used to facilitate patient pathways to fall prevention assessment and to the different intervention options.

Identifying and managing fall risk in general practice: knowledge translation and synthesis</td></tr><tr><td>1.1 Individual face-to-face training sessions</td><td>
<italic>An individual face-to-face training session</italic> is used to educate GPs in the various components of the iSOLVE intervention including decision support tools, evidence-based interventions, potential referral pathways and fall prevention strategies. The training is based on academic detailing which is characterized by principles such as involvement of a &#x0201c;peer&#x0201d; to enable rapport and credibility, concise graphic print materials and applies social marketing principles to facilitate behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>1.2 Decision support tools and fall management tailoring. GP resources (e.g., background information/evidence, case studies, Medicare reimbursement options)</td><td>
<italic>Decision support tools and fall management tailoring</italic> introduced in the GP training session. These decision making tools enable fall risk assessment and management and are part of a practice resource package for the GP. The decision tool and resources are adapted from a primary care resource for falls prevention, developed by the Centers for Disease Control in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. A working group who were experts in fall prevention research, (LC, CS, ATi) drawing from the US resource and using evidence from systematic review meta-analyses of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and of risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], developed the iSOLVE risk assessment/fall management algorithm and decision tools. The US <italic>Stay Independent Patient Check List</italic> and the <italic>GP Fall Risk Assessment chart</italic> were updated based on the iSOLVE algorithm. A new chart, <italic>Tailoring Interventions to Fall Risk</italic>, was developed which maps risk factors and risk factor profiles to appropriate interventions. This was based on the intervention evidence (e.g., medication review; balance, and strength training) and additionally, where intervention evidence did not exist, was based on modifiable risk factor evidence which strongly supported a guideline for practice (e.g., postural dizziness). Other iSOLVE resources include background information supporting the evidence for interventions; five case studies which each illustrate the algorithm and tailoring options and were validated by a local expert group; a detailed summary of known medications to be a risk of falling; Medicare reimbursement options for GPs; and, examples of &#x0201c;how to talk with patients about falls.&#x0201d; A summary of local allied health professionals who offer fall prevention services and who attended the workshops is provided for each GP with contact details.</td></tr><tr><td>1.3 GP computer systems</td><td>
<italic>GP computer systems supports</italic>: The decision tools can be embedded into the GP systems and software by a fall prevention add-on developed for the practice software supported by the SNHN. Embedded decision tools in practice software recognize the barriers to GPs adoption of new practices and the need for speed and efficiency. The software add-on automatically creates the iSOLVE decision support tools. Once the GP completes the Fall Risk Assessment, the program produces the recommended, individualized, and tailored interventions that match their fall risk. Sample referral forms are provided. There are hard copies of all these documents, so that the whole process can be manually done if the GP chooses to or if the practice is not computerized.</td></tr><tr><td>1.4 Fall or fall risk alert to GP</td><td>
<italic>Fall or fall risk alert to GP:</italic> People who report a fall in the past year or report &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to one of the risk questions on the <italic>Stay Independent Fall Check list</italic> will indicate an alert to the GP who then starts the process of assessment and management. Where practices agree a tablet device will be given to people 65&#x000a0;years and over by the practice nurse in the waiting room and the fall screen completed to assist in determining risk factors. If the tablet is used, this automatically sends the fall risk information to the GP&#x02019;s software to speed up the process.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5 GP managing patient fall risk</td><td>

We have assumed 50% will fall in the control group, based on previous trials. A reduction to 35% is feasible, as a reduction of this size was found in a previous meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Allocation is concealed using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. Patient lists of eligible patients are compiled by the GP practice. The allocation of practice to group occurs after the GP baseline survey, and patient lists are generated and allocation is done by a researcher not involved in practice recruitment or data collection (LC). Practices are recruited by the project manager (ATa) who also advises them of their allocation. Another researcher who is blinded to the group allocation of the GP practices contacts individual participants to explain the study, obtains signed consent, and conducts the assessments.

Patients are asked to record falls using a prospective falls calendar to be completed on a daily basis and returned by mail monthly. Fall calendars also prompt patients to record the circumstances of a fall, whether any injuries occurred and whether any medical help was sought as a result of the fall. If a person does not return their fall calendar, they are telephoned to determine whether they have fallen. A 12-month follow-up survey ascertains patient engagement in fall prevention interventions or activities over the past year, interaction with GP about fall prevention, current medications including dosage and frequency. Medication survey questions will also generate data to determine prevalence and change over 12&#x000a0;months in medication exposures that have been associated with increased risk of falls with Drug Burden Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] as the major secondary measure.

For the primary analysis of falls, negative binomial regression will be used to compare the total number of falls per person in the two groups, using an offset for exposure time and accounting for clustering. GP engagement in fall prevention management and GP referral practices will be assessed using questions 11 and 12, respectively, of the 12-month GP survey and corresponding questions on the baseline survey. For management, a score from 0 to 3 will be allocated to each of the first three items and summed to give a total out of 9. The total score for each GP at 12&#x000a0;months will be compared between groups using regression analysis with baseline score as a covariate and adjusting for clustering by GP practice. For referral practice, the number of types of practitioners (out of 13 possible) to whom a GP sometimes or often refers older patients at risk of falling will be counted. The change from baseline for each GP will be compared between groups using Poisson regression, adjusting for clustering by GP practice.

The evaluation will also enable a deeper understanding of the coordinating role that the Primary Care Network can play in this area. In developing an intervention within an existing set of processes, referrals, and relationships (the GP and allied health settings), Normalization Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] can enable identification of facilitation factors. NPT focuses on the &#x0201c;work&#x0201d; of the intervention&#x02014;and how changes in the work that is required to identify and refer people at risk of falls can become routinized into the everyday practice of the GP.

The AHP implementation planning strategies compiled from data collected at the workshops will be used as an additional data source. The surveys include a combination of open-ended and Likert scale response questions; practice change, frequency of assessment and interventions related to fall prevention, referral patterns (to/from), type of services offered, and level of confidence in related skills. Demographic questions record profession, service sector, and nature of employment status.

We will explore who in their social or professional networks have influenced their knowledge and learning of fall prevention and the depth of such influence, the people who they see as important in providing fall prevention services and if there are associations between these relationships and GP fall management and referral practices. An alluvial map can show how the impact of differing professional roles can change between, before, and after the academic detailing intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>The social network analysis of personal relationships with professionals who provide a clinical service to falls patients will first describe the structure of each network of referral relations.

In the second stage, we will quantify the contribution of relational processes that may have contributed to the structure of referral networks that we observed using exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and model the probability of a referral relationship formation. ERGMs provide statistical tests to assess if these effects are significantly different from zero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Analogous to odds ratio in logistic regression models, model coefficients are interpreted as additive factors on the log odds of forming a relationship around referral. Significant and positive coefficients indicate higher log odds of forming a relation in accordance with the underlying process; negative coefficients make it less likely.

The longer term aim is a model that could be used for widespread dissemination. Historically, there have been a number of challenges in implementing prevention programs into primary health. Over the past decade, there have been calls for improved detection of early fall risk, awareness and access to services, and strengthening pathways between referrers and service providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>The advantages of a blended effectiveness-implementation design is that it uses mixed-methods which are designed to evaluate both content and context as a way of accelerating research into practice, in particular by avoiding lengthy step-wise approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It also offers a way of optimizing our knowledge and understanding as there is a blending and interaction of both intervention and implementation, and it provides opportunities for triangulation and richly validated findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>At the same time, this approach raises a number of methodological challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While core features of design rigor in cluster randomized trials are being adhered to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], this is a pragmatic trial in which the intervention is being delivered in a real-world setting. We therefore have less control both of intervention fidelity for GPs and also of whether and how the recruited patients follow through with any GP-advised strategies, recommendations, or referrals. Given resources in a hybrid design need to cover a variety of expertise and personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the fact that we minimized patient secondary assessment compared to what would be usual in an effectiveness/explanatory trial, there is a limited opportunity to capture, for example, quantitative adherence data and validated measures of participant engagement. Contamination may occur as allied health professionals who attended workshops could see control patients referred to them for other reasons or from other sources, as they have been encouraged to identify people who have fallen or at risk of falls, combined with their new skills to implement fall prevention. There are the usual generalization issues related to cluster randomized trials in defining how included practices (and patients) might differ from those not included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Initial recruitment via newsletters may have included those most keen, and ongoing recruitment has been expanded to include multiple methods. Despite this, so far, we have experienced a high response rate and interest by GP practice indicating fall prevention is a topic of interest to many GPs. While threats to external validity may be heightened in this blended design, we are applying robust trial rigour, will review self-report of patient engagement in fall prevention over the follow-up period, and active dissemination of the GP resources and processes throughout the SNHN will not occur until completion of the cluster randomized trial.</p><p>As an implementation project, the context of one geographical area may well be different from others, such as rural versus metropolitan, thus introducing an effect modification. Willis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] warn how intentions for embedded strategies into existing services can be hindered by a reliance on material resources for continuation rather than embedding the processes based on key features for sustainability. Further, we know that training is a crucial and necessary first step in the process of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] but much more needs to be understood about how change occurs and what planning is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Our expectation is that the qualitative analysis approach using Normalization Process Theory will give the necessary depth of understanding to the contextual issues related to implementation and sustainability. This should enable us to place appropriate emphasis on the lessons we will learn, what the key drivers for change are and what can be generalized, or what will need further research.</p><p>While challenges exist, there is potential for significant outcomes as the iSOLVE pathways project brings together practice and research to collectively solve a major national problem with implications for policy service delivery. The project outcomes will be a multi-disciplinary pathway model for fall prevention that will have been tested empirically in an urban area. It will provide evidence of resource need and allocation, and feasible processes and guidelines for fall identification and prevention in general practice and community-based healthcare practices. Practical outcomes include training modules and processes as well as a model for organizational and system support needs for implementation and sustainability of GP and allied health evidence-based practice in falls prevention. Partnerships with regional, state, and professional organizations provide opportunities for widespread dissemination, leadership, and diffusion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to acknowledge the engagement and support from our partners, initially Di Sfiligoi from the Northern Sydney Medicare Local and, later, Cynthia Stanton and staff from the Sydney North Primary Health Network, Margaret Armstrong, Northern Sydney Local Health District Coordinator for NSW Fall Policy, and all the members of our Advisory Board.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The project is supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council ((NHMRC) Partnership grant 1072790).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study will be available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed to the conception, design or acquisition of data, have been involved in drafting or revising the manuscript and all authors have given approval for the final version of this paper submitted.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Consent for publication</title><p>No individual personal data is included in the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The trial was registered prospectively with the Australian New Zealand Clincial Trial Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12615000401550">ACTRN12615000401550</ext-link>) and approved by the Human Ethics committee of The University of Sydney (2014/848).
