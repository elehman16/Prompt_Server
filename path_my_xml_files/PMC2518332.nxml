In addition, 6-month EXU therapy is at least comparable in efficacy to subcutaneous insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>).</p><p>Previous controlled studies of EXU in type 2 diabetic patients have shown slight but consistent treatment group differences in pulmonary function in favor of comparators, using nonstandardized lung function testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). These small differences occurred early, did not progress for up to 2 years, and were not clinically meaningful. However, these studies were not designed specifically to examine respiratory safety primary end points.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to provide a robust evaluation of the long-term pulmonary safety of EXU versus subcutaneous insulin. Adult patients with type 2 diabetes were evaluated by means of validated, highly standardized pulmonary function testing, trained coordinators, and centralized data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). A secondary objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of EXU versus subcutaneous insulin.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This is an ongoing, randomized, open-label, 5.5-year, parallel-group study in 84 centers in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil. Data from the first 2 years of treatment are reported here. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the independent local institutional review boards of all participating centers, and all patients provided written informed consent. The study is being conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Patients who had type 2 diabetes for at least 1 year, were aged 35&#x02013;75 years, were receiving a stable subcutaneous insulin regimen for at least 2 months, and had BMI &#x02264;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, A1C levels of 5.5&#x02013;11&#x00025;, and fasting plasma C-peptide concentrations &#x02265;0.2 pmol/ml (&#x02265;0.6 ng/ml) were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had unstable diabetes or recurrent severe hypoglycemia, poorly controlled asthma, significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other respiratory disease, abnormal lung function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s &#x0005b;FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0005d; &#x0003c;70&#x00025; of predicted, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity &#x0005b;DL<sub><sc>co</sc></sub>&#x0005d; &#x0003e;120&#x00025; or &#x0003c;70&#x00025; of predicted, or total lung capacity &#x0005b;TLC&#x0005d; &#x0003e;130&#x00025; or &#x0003c;70&#x00025; of predicted) or if they had reported smoking in the previous 6 months. The predictive equations of Hankinson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>), Crapo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), and Miller et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>) were used to establish baseline percent predicted lung function for FEV<sub>1</sub>, TLC, and DL<sub>CO</sub>, respectively. A 12&#x00025; adjustment in TLC and DL<sub>CO</sub> predicted values was applied for subjects of self-reported black race.</p><p>After a 4-week run-in, during which all patients optimized subcutaneous insulin use, patients were randomly assigned at week 0 to receive either subcutaneous insulin (regular or a short-acting analog) or prandial EXU, both in combination with intermediate- or long-acting insulin (NPH insulin, Ultralente, or insulin glargine). Randomization was performed using a computer-generated schedule. EXU was administered within 10 min before meals. The initial dose was based on body weight, and subsequent doses were adjusted to achieve blood glucose concentrations of 80&#x02013;120 mg/dl before meals and 100&#x02013;140 mg/dl at bedtime.</p><p>Primary end points were the annual rates of decline for FEV<sub>1</sub> and DL<sub>CO</sub>. Pulmonary function tests were performed at screening, weekly for 3 weeks before randomized treatment was started and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of treatment. Baseline pulmonary function was defined as the means of the values obtained after screening and before randomization (weeks &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;1). The pulmonary function tests used validated, highly standardized methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). All study coordinators performing pulmonary function tests underwent a 2-day training session and were required to show theoretical and practical competencies before performing any tests. The same type of lung function analyzer (Collins CPL; Collins Medical, Braintree, MA) was used at all centers to minimize intermachine variability. All testing was performed according to American Thoracic Society guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Data were collected centrally at Ferraris Respiratory (Louisville, CO) and assessed for quality.</p><p>Secondary end points for efficacy assessments included A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hypoglycemic events, insulin dose, and body weight. Baseline for A1C, FPG, and body weight was defined as the average of all measurements after screening and before the first dose of study drug. Baseline insulin dose was the week 0 dose of subcutaneous insulin. Hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia were defined as described by Hollander et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>).</p><p>Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and clinical laboratory testing. Serum samples for measurement of insulin antibodies were obtained at baseline; at weeks 3, 6, 12, and 18; at month 6; and at 3-month intervals thereafter. Dyspnea was assessed in all patients by means of the baseline (BDI) and transition dyspnea index (TDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). The BDI was established 1 week before treatment was started, and the TDI was established after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This trial was designed to estimate the difference in annual rates (slopes) of lung function decline between EXU and subcutaneous insulin. The datasets, models, and procedures used have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). It was estimated that a sample size of 243 patients per group would allow determination of the between-treatment group differences in the annual decline in lung function with a precision of &#x000b1;22.4 ml/year for FEV<sub>1</sub> and &#x000b1;0.4 ml &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; mmHg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for DL<sub><sc>co</sc></sub>. This estimate was based on a two-sided 90&#x00025; CI, assuming standard deviations for the annualized rates of decline of 150 ml for FEV<sub>1</sub> and 2.5 ml &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; mmHg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for DL<sub>CO</sub>. The precision was also based on the normal approximation of the test statistic for the comparison between two means.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 635 patients were randomly assigned to either EXU (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 319) or to subcutaneous insulin (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 316). Three patients in the EXU group and five in the subcutaneous insulin group withdrew before receiving the study treatment. Of the remaining patients, 225 in the EXU group and 237 in the subcutaneous insulin group completed 2 years of treatment (supplemental Fig. A1, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-0159">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-0159</ext-link>). Demographics of the patients at screening are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The two groups were well matched in terms of demographic characteristics, duration of diabetes, baseline lung function, and glycemic control. The majority of patients were using insulin lispro or insulin aspart at baseline (EXU 65.9&#x00025;; subcutaneous insulin 72.4&#x00025;), and most were injecting three times per day. At randomization, 41.9&#x00025; of EXU and 39.8&#x00025; of subcutaneous insulin patients were taking insulin glargine as their basal insulin.</p><sec><title>Pulmonary function</title><p>Small decreases from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> were observed in both treatment groups (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The mean &#x000b1; SE changes in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline at 2 years (last observation carried forward &#x0005b;LOCF&#x0005d;) were &#x02212;0.121 &#x000b1; 0.013 l in the EXU group and &#x02212;0.099 &#x000b1; 0.012 l in the subcutaneous insulin group, giving an adjusted mean treatment difference (EXU &#x02212; subcutaneous insulin) of &#x02212;0.023 l (90&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.047 to 0.002). These mean differences were not driven by outlier EXU-treated subjects with large declines in FEV<sub>1</sub> (data not shown). Comparison of the mean annualized rates of change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to month 24 and from months 3 to 24 showed that the treatment group difference occurred during the first 3 months of treatment and did not progress thereafter. Specifically, the mean annual rates of change for up to 24 months were &#x02212;0.069 &#x000b1; 0.006 l/year in the EXU group and &#x02212;0.061 &#x000b1; 0.006 l/year in the subcutaneous insulin group, giving an adjusted treatment group difference of &#x02212;0.007 l/year (90&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.021 to 0.006). From months 3 to 24, the corresponding figures were &#x02212;0.058 &#x000b1; 0.007 and &#x02212;0.058 &#x000b1; 0.006 l/year in EXU- and subcutaneous insulin&#x02013;treated subjects, respectively (adjusted treatment group difference 0.000 l/year &#x0005b;90&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.016 to 0.016&#x0005d;).</p><p>Mean changes in DL<sub>CO</sub> are shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>.

Overall, 22 patients (7&#x00025;) in the EXU group and 4 (1.3&#x00025;) in the subcutaneous insulin group discontinued treatment because of adverse events (Fig. A1). Twelve of the adverse events resulting in discontinuation in the EXU group were judged to be treatment related and included cough (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7), asthma exacerbation (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3), weight gain (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 1), and dyspnea (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 1). None of the adverse events that resulted in discontinuation in the subcutaneous group were treatment related.</p><p>The adverse event profiles of the two groups were comparable, except for a higher incidence of cough in EXU-treated patients. The incidence of cough was highest during the first 3 months of treatment in the EXU group (23.1&#x00025;) and decreased during subsequent 3-month periods (Table A1, available in the online appendix).

At 2 years, the median changes from baseline were 10.6 &#x003bc;U/ml in the EXU group and 0.0 &#x003bc;U/ml in the subcutaneous insulin group. No correlation between insulin antibodies and A1C, FPG, frequency of hypoglycemia, or insulin doses was observed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This is the first report of long-term pulmonary safety in insulin-using type 2 diabetic patients receiving EXU. Using highly sensitive and precise validated methods to assess pulmonary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>), small, clinically nonmeaningful treatment group differences in the change in FEV<sub>1</sub> during the first 3 months of treatment favoring subcutaneous insulin were identified, confirming previous findings with EXU in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Most notably, the between-group differences did not increase after 3 months for up to 2 years, and pulmonary function declined at similar rates in both groups during months 3 to 24, reflecting an age- or diabetes-related decline in pulmonary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). The mechanism of the early treatment effect of EXU on FEV<sub>1</sub> is unknown and remains under study. No significant difference in the annual rate of change in DL<sub>CO</sub> was observed between the two treatment groups.</p><p>The annualized decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> in both the EXU and subcutaneous insulin groups between months 3 and 24 (&#x02212;0.058 l/year) was greater than that reported in the general population (&#x02264;0.040 l/year) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>), adding to the growing literature suggesting that reduced lung function is a chronic complication of type 2 diabetes. In a prospective study of 125 type 2 diabetic patients, FEV<sub>1</sub> decreased by a mean of 0.071 l/year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>), and histopathological changes have been reported in the lungs of patients with diabetes in preliminary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Although respiratory dysfunction is rarely a presenting complaint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>), further studies are warranted to understand the impact of diabetes on lung function.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that the treatment targets were not met, and it is conceivable that the mean A1C of 7.3&#x00025; would have been lower if a more structured insulin titration algorithm was used. Despite comparable levels of long-term A1C control and slightly less hypoglycemia, EXU therapy was also associated with greater reductions in FPG levels and significantly less weight gain than subcutaneous insulin over 2 years. This FPG finding has been observed in previous EXU studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>) and may be related to EXU pharmacokinetics such that prandial use reduces late postprandial hyperglycemia after dinner, improves overnight glucotoxicity, and reduces hepatic glucose production.</p><p>Adverse events in the two treatment groups were similar except for a higher incidence of cough in the EXU group during the first 3&#x02013;6 months of treatment, with incidence decreasing during subsequent 3-month periods. Cough tended to occur within minutes after inhalation, was usually mild in severity, and was seldom productive. Dyspnea was rare in both groups, although the incidence was higher in EXU-treated patients than in those receiving subcutaneous insulin. The majority of dyspnea episodes were mild, and the index scores indicate that patients seldom experienced dyspnea during everyday activities and that no clinically significant increases in dyspnea occurred during treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). For subjects who underwent HRCT scans, the incidence of abnormal HRCT results was comparable between treatment groups and did not worsen up to month 24.</p><p>Insulin antibody formation was more marked after administration of EXU than after subcutaneous insulin administration, a finding consistent with those of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). However, antibody formation in response to EXU was not correlated with glycemic control, insulin dose, hypoglycemic episodes, change in FEV<sub>1</sub>, or tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Recently, in a 3-month, highly standardized type 1 diabetes study, no association was found between the time course of changes in lung function and antibody responses, either at the beginning or on discontinuation of EXU therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>).</p><p>In summary, 2-year prandial EXU therapy showed a small nonprogressive difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> and comparable sustained A1C improvement but lower FPG levels and less weight gain than seen in association with subcutaneous insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec>
