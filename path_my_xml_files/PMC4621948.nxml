This study assessed the effectiveness of the partial use of intraoral devices and counseling in the management of patients with disc displacement with reduction (DDWR) and arthralgia.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p> A total of 60 DDWR and arthralgia patients were randomly divided into three groups: group I (n=20) wore anterior repositioning occlusal splints (ARS); group II (n=20) wore the Nociceptive Trigeminal Inhibition Clenching Suppression System devices (NTI-tss); and group III (n=20) only received counseling for behavioral changes and self-care (the control group). The first two groups also received counseling. Follow-ups were performed after 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months. In these sessions, patients were evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale, pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), maximum range of motion and TMJ sounds. Possible adverse effects were also recorded, such as discomfort while using the device and occlusal changes. The results were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey&#x02019;s and Fisher Exact Test, with a significance level of 5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> Groups I and II showed improvement in pain intensity at the first follow-up. This progress was recorded only after 3 months in Group III. Group II showed an increased in joint sounds frequency. The PPT values, mandibular range of motion and the number of occlusal contacts did not change significantly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p> The simultaneous use of intraoral devices (partial time) plus behavioral modifications seems to produce a more rapid pain improvement in patients with painful DDWR. The use of NTI-tss could increase TMJ sounds. Although intraoral devices with additional counseling should be considered for the management of painful DDWR, dentists should be aware of the possible side effects of the intraoral device&#x02019;s design.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Temporomandibular joint disorders</kwd><kwd>Temporomandibular joint disc</kwd><kwd>Arthralgia</kwd><kwd>Occlusal splints</kwd><kwd>Behavioral control</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) embraces a group of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions that involve the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the masticatory muscles and all associated tissues<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

Nowadays, although the maintenance of a normal disc/condyle relationship can be temporarily achieved, this is not the final treatment&#x02019;s intention, but is used to reduce pain severity.

According to the manufacturer, NTI-tss allows for optimum musculoskeletal stablility (anterior-superior) in the condylar position. In the event the patient&#x02019;s condylar position is not optimal, the patient&#x02019;s condyle may re-position more posteriorly/superiorly during resolution of their symptoms.

Before PPT measurements, each patient undertook a short training session for familiarization with the algometer, its hand-held device and its application method. The probe was then held perpendicularly at the lateral pole of the TMJ to apply the pressure over the TMJ. The pressure application rate was approximately 0.5 Kgf/cm<sup>2</sup>/sec.

</xref>. The reasons for this fact could be attributed to different mechanisms. The partial maintenance of a normal disc/condyle relationship (only at night time) and/or reduced joint pressure, which could decrease overload to retrodiscal tissues, allowing for healing and adaptive changes to occur is probably an important occurrence in this scenario<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. The fact that patients wearing the splints only on a part-time basis allowed for the &#x0201c;contact&#x0201d; between the condyle and retrodiscal structures during normal function, which can help to stimulate the fibrosis witnessed and the formation of a &#x0201c;pseudodisc&#x0201d;, providing protection to structures previously damaged. It is a different strategy from those who perpetuate this &#x0201c;therapeutic&#x0201d; position with irreversible treatment, as had been suggested in the past.</p><p>Other action mechanisms could explain the earlier progress for those wearing occlusal devices, such as the presence of a new intraoral condition, which are designed to interfere with the impact of certain trigeminal neural circuits<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>, somehow affected the overall pain perception. A recent study with NTI-tss devices and a stabilization splint for muscular TMD management reported similar results<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The improvement for the control group certainly illustrates the benign aspect of these conditions and may be a warning about the need for irreversible procedures<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. In fact, a recent 2 &#x02013; to - 3 year follow-up study showed that the percentage of patients with arthralgia decreased almost 53% without management, which agrees with the favorable natural course of the condition<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Not only the natural evolution of the disease, but also placebo effects and also the regression towards the mean may have played an important role in the effectiveness of the different modalities for TMJ pain management.</p><p>Besides the change in pain intensity, no significant differences were found for PPT values between groups.

Pain has been accepted as a sensation, influenced by several aspects, so it is difficult to determine how much of the reported pain is a result of a localized stimulation of the injured site, impairment of peripheral or central pain pathways or due to some emotional component<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Moreover, it is possible that the placement of the algometer did not directly stress the injured tissues in TMJ cases, despite being within the area of self-reported pain<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, which unfortunately we were unable to determine in this investigation.</p><p>As mentioned above, the use of repositioning splints in the present study did not define objective permanent disc recapturing. The exact disc position before and after management could not be established as a magnetic resonance image (MRI) and was not a part of the methodology. The resolution of clicking is probably due to morphological alterations in the disc itself, which could eliminate the physical barrier for jaw translation and thus decrease the sound<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. In this study, the resolution of TMJ clicking was not the primary objective as splints are no longer used for this purpose<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>Only the group that wore NTI-tss device showed an increased frequency of TMJ clicking sounds. Part of the occlusal force applied on the teeth is transmitted to the TMJ and the more anterior the teeth contact, the higher the load over the temporomandibular joint <italic>per</italic> unit of bite force<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. As NTI-tss design does not permit contact in the posterior region, its use may have increased TMJ loading over time<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. As a consequence, the remodeling process of the disc may have been compromised in this group. The initial discomfort in using the device could also explain these findings.</p><p>Full-time use of anterior positioning devices has frequently been associated with posterior open bite, occlusal alterations and muscle contracture of the lateral pterygoid<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> (2005), however, showed in a long-term study, that partial use of the devices did not significantly change the number of occlusal contacts or cause any skeletal problems, which was also was found in this study. Although only devices that change the maxilo-mandibular relationship were tested in this investigation, one should be advised that improvements in pain and dysfunction have also been reported with the use of a &#x0201c;regular&#x0201d; stabilization, flat splint, with no changes in mandibular positioning<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. This modality could be a good, reliable and safe option to manage those patients.</p><p>Adverse effects can also occur with NTI-tss use. Occlusal changes were reported in previous studies after 3 to 6 months<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. In this study, no occlusal alterations or adverse effects were found. However, as discuss above, patients had reported discomfort in using NTI-tss during the first 15 days.</p><p>The low number of individuals in the final follow-up, especially in the control group, and the short-term nature of the evaluation must be considered when judging our results. Over time, 45% of patients dropped out. The use of a intraoral device may have motivated the patient to not miss appointments as the patient&#x02019;s feeling of being &#x0201c;under treatment&#x0201d; is an important influence in maintaining interest as the number of patients that dropped out was lower in groups I and II. Moreover, the patients&#x02019; treatment expectations about the behavioral counseling are unknown and could have influenced the treatment&#x02019;s adherence and outcomes and also the dropout rate.</p><p>As a significant improvement, it had also been obtained that with counseling and behavioral strategies only, the use this therapy is suggested to be part of a conservative management for arthrogenous TMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Occlusal devices such as the anterior repositioning occlusal splint and NTI-tss or behavioral changes are effective in the management of the pain associated with disc displacement with reduction. The simultaneous use of occlusal devices appears to produce a faster improvement. The use of NTI-tss could increase TMJ sounds (noise) and its effectiveness and safety are still to be proven in long-term studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref
