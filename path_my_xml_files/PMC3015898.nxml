High-grade visibility guarantees the completeness and safety of the surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> Limited damage to the abdominal muscular fascia minimizes postsurgical symptoms, and, therefore, increases the speed at which a patient can return to normal activity and minimizes the deterioration in patient's quality of life. Consequently, minimal invasiveness is achieved, which is one of the most important properties of laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>The minimal invasiveness of laparoscopic surgery is enjoyed by the vast majority of patients, but not all. Some experience an unpleasant postsurgical symptom, ie, shoulder pain, seemingly specific to laparoscopic surgery. Occasionally, shoulder pain is so severe that patient's quality of life is markedly damaged, though transient. The genesis of shoulder pain is not clearly understood. Although it is generally regarded as a symptom related to CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum, shoulder pain may occur in gasless laparoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> It has been suggested that shoulder pain is reducible by creating pneumoperitoneum with warm, humid CO<sub>2</sub>, not with cold, dry CO<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> However, the controversy remains. Several reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> question the benefits of warm, humid CO<sub>2</sub>. What is interesting as to shoulder pain is that drainage after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces early postlaparoscopic pain, including shoulder pain, and, furthermore, that suction drainage is more effective than passive drainage in reducing pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> This indicates that the residual CO<sub>2</sub> or air in the abdomen is the culprit of postlaparoscopic shoulder pain, and drainage can be an answer to the question of how to reduce or prevent this symptom. However, the story is not that simple. Routine use of drainage is not justifiable, because it increases wound infection rates and delays hospital discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup></p><p>We developed a working hypothesis that complete evacuation of the residual CO<sub>2</sub> could enhance patient satisfaction by reducing unpleasant early postlaparoscopic symptoms. The method, we thought, for forcibly evacuating residual CO<sub>2</sub> is to open all the ports and fill the abdomen with warm saline at the end of laparoscopic surgery. By doing so, CO<sub>2</sub> in the abdomen, being lighter than saline, rises and escapes through the open ports. This idea is the result of a literature survey, where it has been suggested that abdominal gas is removable by instillation of 2 to 3 liters of Ringer's lactate and placement of a 5-mm blunt probe in the umbilical incision to purge the abdomen of gas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> This is a very attractive idea, but no scientific relevance is provided in the literature. We, therefore, decided to conduct a prospective, randomized, comparative study to validate this working hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Our routine laparoscopic surgery procedures consist of the following:

They were not informed of their grouping. Of the 40, 19 patients entered Group I where our routine procedures were adopted as shown above and served as the control group. The remaining 21 patients entered Group II, where step 8 of our routine procedures was replaced by instillation of warm saline into the abdomen through one of the 2 suprainguinal ports until it spilled out of the remaining open trocars. The amount of saline pumped in ranged from 1000 mL to 1500 mL.</p><p>After the surgery, shoulder pain was evaluated with the visual analog scale (VAS) twice daily (AM and PM) until Day 3 of the surgery. VAS scores were obtained through patient interviews by nurses who were blinded to the patient's grouping.

However, this does not imply that the surgery is free of unpleasant symptoms. One of the unpleasant postsurgical symptoms is shoulder pain. A considerable number of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery experiences shoulder pain. Occasionally, shoulder pain is so strong that the patient needs analgesics and is forced to lie in bed for some time, albeit transiently. It is desirable to prevent or diminish this symptom.</p><p>The Cochran Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> shows that postlaparoscopic shoulder pain is preventable by evacuating the residual CO<sub>2</sub>, but the way to prevent it, ie, through drainage, is not justifiable. It has been suggested that the residual CO<sub>2</sub> could be evacuated by instillation of 2 to 3 liters of Ringer's lactate into the abdomen at the end of the surgery and, by doing so, postoperative pain could be markedly diminished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> This is a very attractive hypothesis, but its scientific relevance has not been shown. We decided to evaluate and validate this hypothesis.</p><p>As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref></bold>, no between-group difference was observed as far as the basic characteristics of the patients were concerned. This implies that randomization worked properly and effectively in the present study, and, therefore, patient bias was negligible. Another important aspect as to the credibility of the study is that VAS scores were assessed and recorded by nurses blinded to the patient's grouping who interviewed the patients on the scheduled occasions. We believe that by using this system highly reliable data were collected.</p><p>What we have observed in the study is that the time course of shoulder pain after laparoscopic surgery was strikingly different between the groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). When laparoscopic surgery was ended with our previous routine procedures (Group I), shoulder pain VAS scores started to increase at Day 1AM of the surgery, formed a peak at Day 1PM, and decreased gradually thereafter. One of the patients in this group reported a VAS score as high as 6 points at Day 1PM. Because the pain became worse when she was in an upright position, she unwillingly stayed in bed for that whole day and the following day as well. Additionally, there are 5 more patients to be mentioned in this group. They had VAS scores as high as 4 points at Day 1PM and experienced some limitations in their daily activity. In contrast to this, when laparoscopic surgery was ended with abdominal filling with saline (Group II), shoulder pain VAS scores remained low throughout the investigation period. None of the patients in this group reported VAS scores greater than 3 points.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, we hypothesized that abdominal filling with saline at the end of laparoscopic surgery might force the residual CO<sub>2</sub> to pass through the open ports and that the forced evacuation of the residual CO<sub>2</sub> might prevent postlaparoscopic shoulder pain. The hypothesis was indeed validated. Furthermore, this seems to have another good feature. Patients receiving abdominal filling voided a considerable amount of urine during the night of surgery. This implies that abdominal saline is transferred rather quickly through the peritoneum into the general circulation. It is quite likely, if this is the case, that the amount of intravenous infusion can be reduced. Then, the patient can move more freely and easily, without the lines connected. This might enhance patient satisfaction.</p><p>We have now applied this abdominal filling to all of the laparoscopy patients as one of the new routine procedures. No patient has reported any negative effects from this procedure.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yoshiki</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Taniguchi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Tokushige</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Suginami</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group>
