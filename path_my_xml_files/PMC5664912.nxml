Fluralaner is a novel systemic parasiticide that is effective against poultry mites (<italic>Dermanyssus gallinae</italic>, <italic>Ornithonyssus sylviarum</italic>) in chickens after oral administration. The evaluation of the safety of this new product in breeder chickens is particularly relevant because poultry mite infestation affects long cycle production systems, such as layers and breeders farms, for which the productivity heavily depends on the health of the reproductive function. This study was designed to investigate the safety for reproductive performances of fluralaner in male and female chickens at 3 times the recommended dose (1.5 instead of 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight) and 2 times the recommended duration (4 administrations instead of 2 administrations, with a 7&#x000a0;day interval between administrations).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This randomized, parallel-group, blinded study included 432 Bovans brown parent stock chickens (48 males and 384 females, 17-week old). Birds were randomly assigned to 16 pens (three males and 24 females per pen), and then each pen assigned to one of the two treatment groups (8 pens, i.e. 216 birds per group). Fluralaner was administered via drinking water on a total of four occasions 7&#x000a0;days apart, at daily doses of 1.5&#x000a0;mg fluralaner/kg body weight, equivalent to 3 times the recommended dose of fluralaner per administration and 2 times the recommended number of administrations. Birds supplied with non-medicated drinking water served as controls. The treatments were given at time of peak egg production in the bird&#x02019;s life: i.e. at 30 to 34&#x000a0;week of age. During that period, all adult chickens were clinically observed. The reproductive performances were carefully monitored including the number of eggs laid, egg weight, fertility and hatchability. Furthermore, the health and viability (up to 14&#x000a0;days of life) of randomly selected chicks was also monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">There were no clinical findings related to fluralaner treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between the reproductive performances of treated and control groups, nor in their progeny chickens viability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Oral administration of fluralaner was well tolerated by breeder chickens with a safety margin of approximately 3-fold obtained. Fluralaner had no effect on the egg number, weight and fertility, and no effect on egg hatchability or chick viability. Based on these results, a safe use of the new mite treatment proposed with fluralaner administered via drinking water is expected in layer and breeder field industrial conditions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fluralaner</kwd><kwd>Breeder hens</kwd><kwd>Chickens</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Poultry red mites</kwd><kwd>Drinking water</kwd><kwd>Parasiticide</kwd><kwd>Isoxazoline</kwd><kwd>Reproduction</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par11">The poultry red mite (<italic>Dermanyssus gallinae</italic>) is a blood-sucking ectoparasite of domestic and feral birds, and is particularly important in commercial layers and breeders. Infestation by this parasite is associated with a decreased health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], stress and decline of egg quality. Increased hen mortality is observed in severe infestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The egg production period (above 1 year) in the layers and breeders industry contributes to the establishment of strong parasite populations in facilities, which are difficult to eradicate. The replacement of traditional cages by enriched cages provides better hiding opportunities for poultry red mite (PRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, PRM is widespread in commercial layer and breeder facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Few products are licensed for use against mites in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Fluralaner is a novel systemic parasiticide, inhibitor of ligand-gated chloride channels (&#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and L-glutamate gated chloride channels) with significant selectivity for arthropod neurons over mammalian neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Fluralaner provides efficacy against infestation with PRM in chickens after oral administration via drinking water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The recommended treatment dosage of fluralaner oral solution for chicken is two administrations of 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight, given at 7&#x000a0;days interval. The general safety of such fluralaner treatment has been investigated in laying hen by Prohaczik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The authors have shown that fluralaner is well tolerated in poultry, with a high margin of safety. However, fluralaner treatment against PRM is administered while birds are in lay of infertile eggs (commercial layers) or of fertile eggs (breeders), and no data are available on fluralaner impact on reproductive performances in any avian species.</p><p id="Par12">This study was designed to investigate more specifically the safety for reproductive performances of this novel parasiticide, fluralaner, in male and female chickens at 3 times the recommended dose (1.5 instead of 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight) and 2 times the recommended duration (4 administrations instead of 2 administrations, with a 7&#x000a0;day interval between administrations). In this study, the treatments were given at time of peak egg production in the bird&#x02019;s life, when the reproduction system is the most stressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>General</title><p id="Par13">This randomized, parallel-group, blinded study included parent stock chickens.

Eggs allowed to hatch were incubated for 21&#x000a0;days: eggs were set for 18&#x000a0;days in a commercial incubator controlling temperature (36.7&#x02013;38.9&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and humidity (62&#x02013;69%), then the eggs were transferred and set for 3&#x000a0;days in a commercial hatcher controlling temperature (36.1&#x02013;37.2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and humidity (62&#x02013;68%) to hatch the progeny. On the day of hatching, selected trays of eggs were briefly removed from the hatcher, evaluated, and then returned to the hatcher in order to monitor the progress of hatching at approximately two-hour intervals. Completion of hatching was determined based on the number/% of chicks that hatched, if the navel/yolk sac area was dry, and if the feathers were dry. Hatching was considered complete when approximately 95% of the hatched chicks had dry feathers, and all of the eggs were removed from the hatcher at the same time. When monitoring of hatched chicks was required, chicks were housed in a barn, daily temperatures and humidity were recorded and ranged between 18.9&#x02013;35.6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 18&#x02013;81%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par18">The different phases of the study are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study timelines</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13071_2017_2480_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Both groups received a total of 4 administrations (A1 to A4) 7 days apart, starting on first day of Week 11, until first day of Week 14. Four administrations correspond to two times the recommended duration of treatment. The treatment period (4&#x000a0;weeks) extended for at least one estrous cycle in females (1&#x000a0;day, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), one egg formation period (11&#x000a0;days, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), and one spermatogenic cycle in the males (13&#x000a0;days, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]).

Confirmatory analyses of the batches of medicated water prepared were conducted to determine the actual concentrations of fluralaner supplied to pens. On each administration day, the amount of medicated water provided to each pen was weighed, as well as the amount remaining after 6&#x000a0;h, to determine the amount of medicated water ingested actually by each pen. The actual fluralaner doses consumed per pen were calculated. The pens from the control group received non-medicated well water. Analysis confirmed that no fluralaner was detected in any of the batches of water provided to the chickens from the control group.

For chick viability binomial variables (newly hatched or at 14&#x000a0;days-old), the majority of responses were the same and abnormal data were too sparse for analysis (only one chick (control group) from Week 10 (baseline) was abnormal for all binomial viability variables). Newly hatched chicks weight at week 14 chicks was 41.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;g and 41.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;g in the control and the fluralaner-treated groups respectively. Fourteen days later, the chicks had grown to 106.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.3&#x000a0;g and 104.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.9&#x000a0;g for females and 105.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.7&#x000a0;g and 112.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.1&#x000a0;g for males, in the control and the fluralaner-treated groups respectively. No differences were detected between groups for chick weight (at hatching or at 14&#x000a0;day-old) and down feather length.

Oral administration of fluralaner via drinking water to laying hens at dose rates of up to 3&#x000d7; the recommended dose and 2 times the recommended treatment duration did not lead to any treatment-related findings that could be detected through careful clinical observations of reproductive performance of parents and health of the progeny chickens. Oral administration of fluralaner via drinking water was well tolerated by breeder chickens, a safety margin of approximately 3 was demonstrated. Based on the present results, the use of the new fluralaner treatment against mites, administered via drinking water, is expected to be safe for breeder chickens under field industrial conditions, and to have no negative impact on their reproduction.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CFR</term><def><p id="Par5">Code of Federal Regulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA</term><def><p id="Par6">Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GABA</term><def><p id="Par7">&#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP</term><def><p id="Par8">Good laboratory practices</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRM</term><def><p id="Par9">Poultry red mite</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VICH</term><def><p id="Par10">Veterinary International Committee on Harmonization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank HMS Veterinary Development Inc., 3346 Avenue 248, Tulare, CA 93274, USA for assistance with the study.
