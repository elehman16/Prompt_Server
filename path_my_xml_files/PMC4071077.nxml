DOMS is associated with muscle pain, decreased range of motion, muscle fiber disruption, altered joint kinematics, decreased strength, and acute tissue damage; each of which contribute to an impairment in future athletic performance and/or predispose individuals to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Activities that involve high force eccentric muscle loading (e.g. plyometric exercises, the lowering phase of resistance training, and downhill running) induce the most severe cases of muscle damage. Symptoms of diffuse pain and tenderness associated with DOMS typically subside within 5 to 7&#x000a0;days after the inciting event. As such, studies evaluating the time course of DOMS typically include post-exercise data collection intervals as long as 168-h (1-wk) into the recovery period.</p><p>Delayed onset muscle soreness is a multi-factorial process and potential mechanistic theories include both anatomical/physiological and biochemical components. For example, anatomical/physiological mechanisms include connective tissue damage and muscular micro-trauma, and biochemical mechanisms include inflammation, and oxidative stress. Acute elevations in perceived pain and tenderness are the result of nociceptor stimulation in damaged muscle fibers and surrounding connective tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Chronic symptoms of pain and tenderness are likely due to increased intramuscular pressure from the local pro-inflammatory response (e.g. IL-1&#x003b2;, hsIL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, hsCRP, and others) which peaks in the early phase of recovery and typically persists for 5&#x02013;7 days after eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic modalities for the management of DOMS related symptoms are numerous and include cryotherapy, stretching, massage, compression, ultrasound, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, several dietary supplements have been tested (e.g. protein powders, vitamin C, fish oil, and chondroitin sulfate) with varying success (see review by Connolly et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). The present placebo-controlled study examined the effects of a proprietary supplement, StemSport (StemSport, Stemtech, San Clemente, CA.), on the severity and time course of DOMS following acute eccentric upper arm exercise. StemSport contains an extract from the botanical Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA; blue-green algae), which has recently been shown to elevate human bone marrow derived stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Jensen et al. reported that a novel compound from AFA binds to the ligand-binding area of human L-selectin. L-selectin appears to play a role in cell adhesion and the release of bone marrow stem cells into the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Drapeau et al. recently hypothesized that bone marrow-derived stem cells may accelerate the tissue regeneration process in some animal models of injury and may play a role in recovery from muscle damaging exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>StemSport also contains a proprietary blend of herbal antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory substances (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Preliminary data suggest that supplementation with StemSport may accelerate tissue repair and restore muscle function earlier than would occur otherwise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The manufacturer of StemSport claims that &#x0201c;by assisting in increasing the number of adult stem cells in the bloodstream the StemSport concept may help your body naturally repair, rebuild and recover faster, so you can return to activity and athletic participation more quickly&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>StemSport ingredient list and purported benefits</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Ingredient</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Amount per serving</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Purported benefit</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02009;<bold>1.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Proper positioning, timing, and form for the DOMs protocol were thoroughly explained by the study team and subjects were allowed to practice the protocol with light weights prior to the first supplementation period/actual day of testing. DOMS protocol prior to actually performing it. A preacher curl bench with adjustable height was used to isolate the biceps brachii muscle group of the non-dominant arm. Subjects repetitively performed all eccentric contractions, while study personnel performed the concentric phase of the bicep curl. The DOMS protocol was designed to be performed with continuous repetitions until exhaustion (i.e. there was not a prescription of sets and repetitions and there was no allotted rest interval within the protocol). Each subject started with a 15.91&#x000a0;kg dumbbell and performed eccentric contractions until unable to lower the weight under control over a three second count (if unable to perform one successful repetition with a 15.91&#x000a0;kg weight, subjects began with a 13.63&#x000a0;kg weight). The weight decreased in 2.27&#x000a0;kg (5 lbs) increments after a participant could no longer complete repetitions at a given weight all the way down to a final weight of 2.27&#x000a0;kg (5 lbs). The DOMS protocol was complete once the subject was unable to lower a 2.27&#x000a0;kg weight under control. Verbal cues were provided throughout the fatigue protocol, including encouragement to exert full strength and reminders about the minimum three second count. Upon completion of the DOMS protocol, each subject was provided with an arm sling to secure the non-dominant arm against the body with the elbow flexed at 90&#x000b0;. Subjects were asked to wear the sling up to the start of day 3 (72-hours post-DOMS exercise) and remove it only to perform activities of daily living (i.e. bathing, getting dressed, sleeping, driving).</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up measures</title><p>Measures of pain and tenderness, muscle function, and blood draws for inflammatory markers were repeated 24-hours, 48-hours, 72-hours, and 168-hours (1-week) following DOMS protocol.

The effects of AFA on inflammation are limited to animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the effects of AFA on systemic inflammation and other markers of DOMS in humans.</p><p>Most recently, AFA has been suggested to be a potential bone marrow stem cell mobilizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Studies from Jensen et al. (2007) and Drapeau et al. (2010) indicate that a novel compound from AFA appears to play a role in the release of bone marrow stem cells into the circulation, and it has been suggested that bone marrow-derived stem cells may accelerate the tissue regeneration process in some animal models of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It has been further hypothesized that AFA plays a role in recovery from muscle damaging exercise via increasing bone marrow-derived stem cells, although this has not been tested directly in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study, a 5:1 concentrate of AFA concentrate fed to healthy volunteers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) produced a 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1% increase in number of circulating CD34+ stem cells at 60&#x000a0;minutes (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, the placebo only produced minor fluctuations in levels of stem cells in the blood circulation over 2&#x000a0;hours. It has been hypothesized that acute increases in post-exercise circulating levels of stem cells may be beneficial for tissue regeneration and recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Stem cell counts (e.g. CD34+) were not specifically measured in the present study, however, given that recovery of muscle function was similar between conditions, it is unlikely that any AFA induced change in circulating stem cells plays a major role in recovery from upper arm DOMS.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies in the literature, we did not observe an association between circulating inflammatory markers and others markers of DOMS (e.g. pain and tenderness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, this may be related to the relatively small muscle mass utilized in our DOMS protocol which may not have been a potent stimulus for increasing circulating cytokines. Future studies should attempt to study AFA supplementation in response to an eccentric exercise protocol designed to produce a much larger inflammatory response (i.e. downhill running).</p><p>Leukocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages are attracted to damaged tissue within hours of tissue injury and remain present for up to 24&#x000a0;hours, or as has been shown in macrophages, up to 14&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Neutrophils and macrophages assist in degradation of damaged muscle tissue primarily through production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Degradation of damaged tissue is also initiated by the expression of many local pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, etc.). Circulating IL-6, which has both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions, is related to the level of DOMS, and there is some debate as to whether the post-exercise IL-6 response is required for muscle adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Elevated levels of IL-6 persist for at least 48&#x000a0;hours after eccentric upper arm exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Less is known about the post-exercise time course of TNF-&#x003b1;, although studies have detected elevated levels of TNF-&#x003b1; for up to 5&#x000a0;days during DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The present data do not support a role of AFA in suppressing circulating levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, or CRP in humans in the basal state or in response to an acute bout of upper arm eccentric exercise designed to induce DOMS.</p><p>Besides AFA, StemSport contains a proprietary blend of several herbal substances potential antioxidant or anti-inflammatory properties (Cat&#x02019;s Claw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Mangosteen juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], Radix Rehmanniae Preparata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], Nattokinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], Serrapeptase and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and Curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For example, Curcumin, an ingredient derived from the spice Tumeric, has been shown in a few studies to reduce DOMS related pain and swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and has a potential role is reducing obesity-related inflammation. However, our data tend to agree with the majority of studies in the literature which show that oral antioxidant supplementation has minimal to no effect on reducing subjective ratings of pain, tissue swelling, or decrements in muscle function after a bout of eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It should be noted that data in the literature now support an inhibitory effect of oral antioxidant supplementation on the skeletal muscle adaptations exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In addition, supplementation with the popular antioxidant ascorbic acid has been shown to delay the recovery process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>A possible limitation of this study was the use of DOMS to examine the utility of StemSport. It is possible that the amount of tissue damage associated with the DOMS protocol may have been too great for StemSport to have an effect. It is possible that if a less disruptive regimen was applied (e.g. strength training) StemSport supplementation may enhance chronic adaptations to whole body resistance training. Also, future studies may consider investigating the effects of AFA, independent or in combination with the other herbal substances. Strengths include study design (placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial) and measurement of both subjective markers of DOMS as well as bio-markers of the inflammatory process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Supplementation with StemSport compared to a placebo was unable to accelerate recovery from upper arm eccentric exercise.
