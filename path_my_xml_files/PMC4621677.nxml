In addition to this regulated pathway, it appears that the kidney also releases unprocessed prorenin via a constitutive pathway.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Control of renin secretion is a key determinant of the activity of the RAAS. Renin regulates the initial, rate-limiting step of the RAAS. Results of the present study showed that both HS and lisinopril increased plasma renin by 2.29% and 2.27%, respectively, which agree with earlier reports that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors therapy is associated with a decrease in angiotensin II and aldosterone and an increase in renin release.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The increase in plasma renin may be a compensatory mechanism resulting from reduced ACE and aldosterone production.</p><p>In two separate clinical trials, inhibition of ACE by HS was reported[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and this could be another important antihypertensive mechanism of action. Subsequent studies confirmed that HS has ACE inhibitory action.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] These workers attributed this action to the presence of anthocyanins which are one of the major groups of compounds present in aqueous extract of HS.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] They reported that anthocyanins are the bioactive compounds producing different antihypertensive actions such as inhibition of angiotensin I and angiotensin II converting enzymes as earlier suggested.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The HS standardization protocol used in the present study[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] confirmed the presence of anthocyanins in the extract (20 g of HS dissolved in 1 L of water yielded 10.04 mg of anthocyanin). In the present study, the decrease in serum ACE caused by HS was comparable to that of lisinopril though none of the treatment was significant compared to placebo. The effects of both active treatments on PA confirmed the similarity between the actions of HS and lisinopril on RAAS; both significantly reduced PA compared to placebo that confirms earlier reports by other workers where ACE inhibitors were found to reduce the secretion of aldosterone.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The high percentage reduction in PA suggests that apart from ACE inhibition, other renal antihypertensive mechanisms such as direct blockage of angiotensin II type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor binding to angiotensin II may also be present like anthocyanins have done in other plant species.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Similar to ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers reduce BP by decreasing systemic vascular resistance. Reduced systemic vascular resistance results from a combination of inhibition of angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, reduced sympathetic nervous system activity, and reduced extracellular volume.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The high Mg<sup>2+</sup> content in HS may also contribute to the decreased secretion of aldosterone since Mg<sup>2+</sup> has been shown to suppress aldosterone production through intracellular calcium mobilization.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This action may also be an additional mechanism through which HS exerts antihypertensive action.</p><p>The effect of HS on RAAS was greater though not significant compared to that of lisinopril (a known ACE inhibitor); 6.63% versus 5.6% reduction in ACE and 32.06% versus 30.01% reduction in PA. This finding strengthens the hypothesis that apart from ACE inhibition, HS may have additional inhibitory actions on RAAS such as AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blocking and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-mediated aldosterone inhibition as earlier suggested. The higher percentage satisfactory reduction in BP in HS group compared to lisinopril (76% vs. 65%) confirms earlier reports that apart from RAAS mechanism that HS possess other antihypertensive mechanisms of action. However, further experimental evidence may be required to confirm the AT<sub>1</sub> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> inhibition mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The result of the present study has shown that both aqueous extract of HS and lisinopril exerted similar effects on RAAS in mild to moderate hypertensive Nigerians. Both treatments reduced serum ACE and PA. The action on aldosterone was much higher than that on ACE and this could be due to a combination of several factors such as blockage of AT<sub>1</sub> receptors and inhibitory action of Mg<sup>2+</sup> present in HS on aldosterone secretion. Further studies are, however, required to investigate these mechanisms.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title/><sec id="sec3-14"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-15"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We express our appreciation to the Management of Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Parklane, Enugu for allowing us to use their facility and providing technical support during the study.
