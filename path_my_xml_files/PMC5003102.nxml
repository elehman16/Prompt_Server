This subpopulation analysis assessed whether olanzapine is superior to placebo specifically in the treatment of Chinese patients with bipolar I depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a subpopulation analysis of a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled trial among 12 Chinese study centers. Eligible inpatients and outpatients were randomized to olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day) or placebo. Patients were primarily assessed by the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale total score. Secondary assessments used a range of other efficacy and safety measures. This subpopulation analysis was underpowered to show statistically significant differences between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 210 patients (mean age 32.9 years at baseline, 54.3% females) were random-ized. Similar proportions of patients treated with olanzapine (75.0%) and placebo (72.9%) completed the double-blind phase. Baseline-to-endpoint least-squares mean &#x000b1; standard error decrease in the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale total score in the olanzapine group (&#x02212;13.55&#x000b1;0.80) was similar to that noted in the parent trial (&#x02212;13.82&#x000b1;0.65). However, the difference between olanzapine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.44); this finding was also true for the secondary efficacy measures. A post hoc analysis showed a greater emergence of mania in the placebo group, which likely reduced the treatment difference between olanzapine and placebo in the primary efficacy measure. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of olanzapine, including a higher incidence of weight gain (&#x02265;7%) in the olanzapine group (24.1% vs 1.4%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Olanzapine provides similar improvement in depression among Chinese and non-Chinese bipolar I patients. The lack of a statistically significant difference between the olanzapine and placebo groups in this Chinese subpopulation analysis may relate to an a priori lack of study power, and underestimation of the effect of olanzapine because of a greater emergence of mania in placebo-treated patients and missing data associated with a high early discontinuation rate.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

The parent trial recruited inpatients and outpatients from Japan, People&#x02019;s Republic of China, Taiwan, Korea, and the United States. Only patients recruited in People&#x02019;s Republic of China were included in this subpopulation analysis. A total of 12 Chinese study centers with investigators specialized in psychiatry contributed patients to this trial. The first patient enrolled into the parent trial on August 27, 2007, and the last patient completed the study on July 9, 2010.</p><p>The parent trial was approved by applicable ethical review boards and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and consistent with good clinical practices and applicable regulatory requirements. Ethics committees at the following sites provided ethical approval for the study: Shanghai Mental Health Center Institutional Review Board; Guangzhou Fangcun Mental Hospital Institutional Review Board; Beijing Anding Hospital Institutional Review Board; Institutional Review Board, 1st Affiliate Hospital of Harbin Medical University; Institutional Review Board, Institute of Mental Health, Beijing; Nanjing Brain Hospital Institutional Review Board; The Institutional Review Board of 1st Affiliate Hospital of Kunming Medical College; People&#x02019;s Hospital Wuhan University Institutional Review Board; Xiangya Medical College Institutional Review Board; Institutional Review Board, Zhejiang Medical University Affiliate; The Institutional Review Board of Xi Jing Hospital Affiliated to 4th Military Medical University; West China Hospital Institutional Review Board.

Screening was undertaken at Visit 1. At Visit 2, eligible patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment in a 2:1 ratio to olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day, Zyprexa<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Eli Lilly and Company) or placebo determined by a computer-generated random sequence. Patients in the olanzapine group received olanzapine 5 mg/day once daily; after 3 to 7 days (Visit 3 or 4) at this dose, patients underwent a forced titration to 10 mg/day olanzapine once daily. On the basis of the investigator&#x02019;s judgement, the once-daily olanzapine dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day or decreased to 5 mg/day at subsequent once-weekly study visits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Male and female patients aged &#x02265;18 and &#x0003c;65 years who met diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode and for bipolar I disorder, depressed, according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), were eligible for randomization and double-blind treatment. In terms of key inclusion criteria, patients must have had a current Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD-17) score &#x02265;18 at Visits 1 and 2, and have experienced at least one previous manic or mixed episode, as defined in the DSM-IV-TR, before Visit 1 and within the past 6 years without currently being in a manic episode (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] total score &#x02264;8 at Visit 2). Patients were excluded principally if they had a history of serious unstable medical illness, diabetes, hemoglobin A1c &#x02265;6.5% (or blood glucose level indicative of diabetes), serious psychiatric illness other than bipolar depression, or current rapid-cycling mood disturbance. Patients were also excluded for recent substance dependence or use of clozapine, depot antipsychotics, or central nervous system medications other than mood stabilizers. However, certain agents were allowed as concomitant medications in the acute phase of the trial. Investigators were instructed to maintain benzodiazepine use at a minimum level throughout the study. Lorazepam was permitted, if necessary, as a first-line treatment to alleviate anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Efficacy measures and objectives</title><p>Efficacy was assessed using a number of common and well-validated psychiatric measures. The primary efficacy measure was the MADRS, an investigator-rated scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms consisting of ten items, each scored from 0 to 6 in increasing order of severity.<xref rid="b16-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Secondary efficacy measures were:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness, an investigator-rated measure of illness severity that allows rating of mania, depression, and bipolar illness. The score ranges from 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).<xref rid="b17-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>HAMD-17, a 17-item multiple-choice questionnaire used to rate the severity of depression by interview and observation.<xref rid="b18-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Each question has three to five possible responses, and total scores range between 0 and 52.

The secondary objectives of this trial were based on the secondary efficacy measures and assessed as the mean changes from baseline to LOCF endpoint for HAMD-17 score, YMRS total score, and CGI-BP Severity of Illness scores for mania, depression, and bipolar disorder. Additional severity assessments of response, remission, and recovery were conducted as part of the secondary assessment of efficacy. For these assessments, response was defined as a baseline-to-endpoint reduction of &#x02265;50% in MADRS total score. Remission was defined a priori as at least one post-baseline MADRS total score &#x02264;12 (&#x0201c;symptomatic remission&#x0201d;) and was defined post hoc as at least one post-baseline MADRS total score &#x02264;5 or &#x02264;7 (as recommended by the International Society of Bipolar Disorders).<xref rid="b21-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Recovery was defined as a MADRS total score &#x02264;12 for &#x02265;4 weeks at completion of the 6-week study.</p><p>In addition to these efficacy measures, data were collected on treatment adherence and use of concomitant medications such as benzodiazepines and anticholinergics. Treatment adherence was defined as the number of days the patient took the study medication as prescribed divided by his or her total number of expected days of study drug exposure during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety measures</title><p>All adverse events occurring during the course of the study were documented via a case report form. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), events that first occurred or worsened after initiation of therapy, were summarized by system organ class and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term. Vital signs and weight were assessed at each visit. Clinical laboratory testing and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were assessed at Visits 1 and 9, with additional scheduled collections for clinical chemistry, lipid panel, electrolyte, and hematology measures undertaken at Visits 2 and 5. Further clinical laboratory tests were conducted any time a patient completed or discontinued the study, and when clinically indicated. The incidence and severity of extrapy-ramidal symptoms in various categories (parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and dyskinesia) were measured by the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). Emergence of mania, which prompted discontinuation, was defined as the first occurrence of a YMRS total score &#x02265;15. The suicidality module of the MINI was administered at every visit during the double-blind phase to further monitor patient safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In the parent trial, 514 patients were randomized, with 343 into the olanzapine group and 171 into the placebo group. Sample sizes were calculated for the parent trial to allow 90% power (Type II error =0.1) to detect a treatment difference of 3.9 in the MADRS total score change from baseline. The parent trial was powered for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in the global patient population, which included geographic regions in which olanzapine has not been studied in bipolar depression. Hence, a conservative effect standard deviation (SD) of 12.38, corresponding to an effect size of 0.315, was used. However, the statistical power for the Chinese subpopulation was calculated at 55% (Type II error =0.45). On this basis, the Chinese subpopulation analyses were underpowered and not expected to provide statistically significant results.</p><p>Efficacy and safety analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population of Chinese patients, and all safety variables were analyzed using the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of treatment. One patient randomized to the olanzapine group was thought not to have received treatment and was excluded from the safety population (although it was determined after unblinding that this patient did receive treatment). All tests of treatment effect were conducted at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, and no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Regarding the handling of dropouts or missing data, total scores for MADRS, YMRS, HAMD-17, DIEPSS, and MINI (suicidality module) rating scales were the sum of individual items. If &#x0003e;25% of items were missing, then the total score was considered missing, whereas if &#x0003c;25% of items were missing, then the total score was imputed from the available items.</p><p>Continuous data were assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models of pairwise comparisons and generally included terms for treatment and the baseline measurement value as a covariate. Type III sums of squares were used to adjust for unbalanced data in the interactions of these models of variance. Importantly, an ANCOVA model was used for the primary analysis of change from baseline to endpoint in MADRS total score. Sensitivity analyses of the primary analysis were performed using observed case and a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) ANCOVA. In addition, ANCOVA models were also used for secondary efficacy measures (YMRS, HAMD-17, CGI-BP), fasting glucose and lipid levels, the suicidality model of the MINI, as well as vital signs and weight. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, which is useful for categorical data and for analysis of proportions, was used to assess the incidences of discontinuation, concomitant medication usage, response rate, and adverse events. The log-rank test, based on survival distributions, was used to compare treatments for the time to discontinuation, time to response, time to first remission, time to first relapse, and time to first emergence of mania. The Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, for analyzing stratified categorical data, was used to analyze the rate of recovery. Finally, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to analyze differences between groups for DIEPSS total scores and for laboratory analytes other than fasting glucose and lipids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Post hoc analysis</title><p>A post hoc analysis was performed to explore the influence of the emergence of mania and consequent discontinuation on the primary efficacy measure. Initially, this involved determining the incidence of emergence of mania in the olanzapine and placebo groups for the overall population and various country-specific subpopulations. Individual changes in MADRS scores among patients who experienced mania episodes were then analyzed. To specifically explore the impact of mania emergence on MADRS reductions in the olanzapine and placebo groups, two approaches were used. Firstly, the MADRS score of the visit before mania emerged was used as the endpoint for analysis. Secondly, patients with emergence of mania were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>In this Chinese subpopulation analysis, a total of 210 patients (mean &#x000b1; SD age 32.9&#x000b1;10.9 years at baseline, 54.3% females) were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ndt-12-2077">Figure 1</xref>).

In the United States subpopulation, emergence of mania was reported in one of 60 patients (1.7%) and two of 30 patients (6.7%) in the placebo group. Hence, emergence of mania was significantly more common in placebo-treated patients than olanzapine-treated patients both in the overall population and relevant country-specific subpopulations. Emergence of mania was not recorded in either treatment group for the subpopulations in Japan (n=156), Taiwan (n=28), or Korea (n=30).

Further, the improvements with olanzapine treatment on key measures of depression such as MADRS, HAMD-17, and CGI-BP Depression were consistent with the findings of previous studies in patients with bipolar disorder.<xref rid="b9-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The safety profile of olanzapine in this subpopulation analysis was also consistent with that seen in the overall population and with the known safety profile of olanzapine, including data from studies in Chinese populations.<xref rid="b13-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These findings suggest the level of response to olanzapine in depressed Chinese patients with bipolar I disorder parallels that observed in non-Chinese patients. This observation is not surprising given that similar responsiveness to olanzapine in Chinese and non-Chinese patients has been observed in other studies of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.<xref rid="b15-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Despite the beneficial response to olanzapine seen in this Chinese population, differences between the olanzapine and placebo group in both primary and secondary efficacy measures did not reach statistical significance as they did in the overall population. The primary and most obvious reason for this was the small size of the Chinese subpopulation enrolled in this analysis, which led to a lack of statistical power to detect a statistically significant difference between olanzapine and placebo groups at the outset. However, additional post hoc data analyses conducted in response to questions related to this study raised by the China Food and Drug Administration strongly suggest that the treatment effect of olanzapine was underestimated by both the greater emergence of mania and a higher rate of early discontinuation among placebo-treated patients.<xref rid="b25-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Emergence of mania during treatment was more common in the placebo group than in the olanzapine group and mainly occurred in the Chinese subpopulation (three of five patients overall). The higher incidence of mania emergence in placebo-treated patients is understandable given that placebo cannot prevent relapse of mania as effectively as olanzapine. The large, sudden decreases in MADRS score noted mainly in patients treated with placebo most likely represented a switch from a depressive to a manic episode rather than an improvement in depression. Finally, the difference in MADRS changes from baseline between olanzapine and placebo groups increased when using the MADRS score of the visit before mania emerged or when excluding patients with emergence of mania from the analysis. Based on these analyses, it is likely that emergence of mania caused a spurious overestimate of the treatment effect for the placebo group, resulting in an underestimate of the treatment difference between the olanzapine and the placebo groups. The influence of mania emergence on this treatment difference would be specifically greater in the Chinese subpopulation given its greater contribution of patients with this outcome. Early discontinuation led to missing data, especially in the placebo group from which patients withdrew due to a lack of efficacy. Use of the LOCF method in the ITT analysis meant that missing data was imputed by assuming that the MADRS total scores remained unchanged after patients dropped out, which may have led to biased estimates toward smaller (conservative) mean differences between treatment groups. Reanalysis using the observed case method by including only patients (n=159) who completed 6 weeks of treatment found that the difference in mean change in MADRS total score between olanzapine and placebo groups increased from &#x02212;1.05 to &#x02212;2.12. It should be pointed out that the US National Research Council&#x02019;s Panel on the Handling of Missing Data in Clinical Trials has recommended that single imputation methods (such as LOCF) &#x0201c;should not be used as the primary approach to the treatment of missing data unless the assumptions that underlie them are scientifically justified&#x0201d;.<xref rid="b26-ndt-12-2077" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Instead, the MMRM model is able to provide unbiased estimates and, when reanalyzing our imputed missing data using the MMRM method, we found an increase in the treatment difference between the olanzapine and placebo groups. In summary, it appears that both the higher incidence of mania and higher rate of early discontinuation in the Chinese subpopulation compared with the overall population potentially led to an underestimation of the treatment difference between olanzapine and placebo in the Chinese subpopulation.</p><p>There are several limitations of this subpopulation analysis. As mentioned, the lack of a priori statistical power makes it difficult to interpret key findings, particularly the lack of statistically significant differences in efficacy measures between treatment arms. This subpopulation analysis is also subject to limitations of the parent trial, including stringency of the criteria used to define recovery considering the short study duration, and applicability of the results only to patients who met the inclusion criteria. Future studies should consider including patients with broader patient characteristics within the Chinese subpopulation and including study numbers at enrollment that produce sufficient statistical power.</p><p>In summary, olanzapine appears to have a similar magnitude of antidepressant treatment effect in Chinese patients with bipolar I disorder as in patients in other regions. The lack of statistically significant difference between olanzapine and placebo is primarily thought to relate to the small sample size of Chinese patients and resulting lack of statistical power in this subpopulation analysis. Further, the treatment effect of olanzapine was likely to have been underestimated by the disproportionately larger number of discontinuations related to mania episodes and large reductions in MADRS score among placebo-treated patients with emergence of mania.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company, manufacturer/licensee of Zyprexa<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (olanzapine).
