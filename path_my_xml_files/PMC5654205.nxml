We reviewed our initial experience regarding the efficacy and safety of this technique for symptomatic and obstructive BPH.</p><p><bold>Material and methods:</bold> During the last year, 35 patients with a mean age of 65.3 years (between 53 and 80) and symptomatic BPH were treated by laser prostatectomy using KTP/532 laser energy at 120W. The procedure was performed through a 21F continuous-flow cystoscope with normal saline as irrigant. All patients underwent standard urologic evaluation using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the urinary peak flow rate (Qmax), ultrasound measurement of prostate volume and residual urine volume, assay of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE). The mean prostatic volume was 45cm3 (range 30&#x02013;70cm3). The patients were reassessed postoperatively at 3 and 6 months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In all cases, KTP laser vaporization was successfully performed, with a mean operating time of 57 minutes (range 20-120 minutes). In most cases, we used just one fibre, the mean energy released being 170.000 Joules (range 80.000-270.000). The mean hospital stay was 24 hours. No major complications occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively, and no transfusions were necessary. All patients were catheter-free after 1 month. At 3 and 6 months, the mean urinary peak flow increased from the preoperative value of 8.5mL/sec to 23.7mL/sec and 21.2mL/sec, respectively. The mean IPSS decreased from 19.0 to 9.5 and 7.5 at 3 and 6 months, and the mean post-voiding residual volume (PVR) decreased from 90.5 to 30.5mL and 15.0 mL. Two patients were admitted for secondary hematuria and urinary infection, and 7 patients presented irritative low urinary tract symptoms during their first postoperative check-up.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> BPH photoselective vaporization using 120W Green Light laser is a safe and easy to learn technique, with good functional results and a low rate of complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser</kwd><kwd>photoselective vaporization prostatectomy (PVP)</kwd><kwd>benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)</kwd><kwd>120W Green Light laser</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="Introduction" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gold standard treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is represented by the transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Alternative therapies have been developed aiming to reduce the level of complications while maintaining efficacy. These methods included microwave therapy, transurethral needle ablation, and a range of laser procedures (laser prostatectomy - LP). LP involves tissue coagulation or vaporization. Tissue coagulation results in gland debulking by necrotic tissue sloughing, while vaporization produces an instantaneous debulking of prostatic tissue.</p><p>The latest addition to laser therapy for BPH is photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP). Since its introduction in 1998 by Malek et al [<bold><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></bold>], PVP was characterized by a relatively simple technique, excellent clinical outcomes, low morbidity and cost effectiveness. The use of Green Light led to a considerably increased success in the field of LP [<bold><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></bold>]. This procedure results in rapid vaporization of prostatic tissue, with good outcome reported after up to 5 years of follow-up.</p><p>In our country, PVP was performed as a national premiere in the Department of Urology of &#x0201e;Saint John&#x0201d; Emergency Clinical Hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|method" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>During the last year, 35 patients with a mean age of 65.3 years (between 53 and 80) and symptomatic BPH were treated by PVP.</p><p>All patients underwent standard urologic evaluation using IPSS, Qmax, ultrasound measurement of prostate volume and residual urine volume, PSA and DRE. The mean prostatic volume was 45cm3 (range 30&#x02013;70 cm3).</p><p>Patients with a Qmax &#x0003c; 15mL/sec or ultrasonographically measured PVR &#x0003e; 70mL in conjunction with an IPSS &#x0003e; 7 were considered to be suitable candidates for laser therapy.</p><p>In addition, the use of anticoagulants didn&#x02019;t represent an exclusion criterion, nor did any history of acute urinary retention. 6 of the treated patients were in retention, 7 patients were receiving anticoagulants, and 5 patients had prostates &#x0003e; 50mL.</p><p>Patients with suspected prostate cancer based on elevated PSA values or a suspicious DRE were excluded from treatment.</p><p>All procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia with normal saline as irrigant.</p><p>The first 20 procedures were performed through a 21F continuous-flow cystoscope. For the last cases, we used the new green laser Wolf cystoscope (22.5F) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The new Green Laser Wolf cystoscope

This system operates with a fiber that emits a beam which is more collimated and more powerful than the old 80-W KTP laser.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Green Light HPS (High Performance System) 120W Laser

At the same time, we located the ureteral orifices and the bladder neck (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). </p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Preliminary cystoscopy, evaluating the prostate size

Creating a working space when starting the procedure is imperative, as it allows the fiber to move more easily, thus avoiding tissue contact and consequent fiber degradation. This space will provide good orientation during surgery and will also permit optimal irrigation during lasing; an important feature as far as visibility is concerned.</p><p>The working space was generated by central approach (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). At the end of this operatory stage, we were able to establish the limits for the future vaporization (the bladder neck as superior limit, and the verum as inferior limit). </p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Creating the working space 
</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMedLife-1-454-g004"/></fig><p>The next step was represented by the vaporization of the lateral lobes in a symmetrical manner, layer by layer, aiming to obtain a smooth surface. The objective of this module should be to achieve a concave surface on each side, by removing the lateral prostatic tissue as completely possible (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). </p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Vaporization of the lateral lobes

The more recent guidelines of the 6th International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Disease from 2005 state that the KTP laser produced a promising challenge to TURP [<bold><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></bold>].</p><p>Since its initial clinical application, numerous studies have been published on PVP, and included long-term outcome at 5 years, comparative studies with regard to TURP, and results in patients with larger prostates, on anticoagulants, as well as in high risk cases.</p><p>The functional results of the Green Laser at 3 and 5 years favorably match those of TURP, however describing an essentially improved complications&#x02019; profile.
