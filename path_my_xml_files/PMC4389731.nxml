A longitudinal study of infants with IDA showed that the developmental disadvantage persists long term despite iron therapy. Early stages of iron deficiency, termed non-anemic iron deficiency (NAID), provide an opportunity for early detection and treatment before progression to IDA. There is little research regarding NAID, which may be associated with delayed development in young children. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of four months of oral iron treatment plus dietary advice, with placebo plus dietary advice, in improving developmental outcomes in children with NAID and to conduct an internal pilot study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>From a screening cohort, those identified with NAID (hemoglobin &#x02265;110 g/L and serum ferritin &#x0003c;14 &#x003bc;g/L) are invited to participate in a pragmatic, multi-site, placebo controlled, blinded, parallel group, superiority randomized trial. Participating physicians are part of a primary healthcare research network called TARGet Kids! Children between 12 and 40 months of age and identified with NAID are randomized to receive four months of oral iron treatment at 6 mg/kg/day plus dietary advice, or placebo plus dietary advice (75 per group). The primary outcome, child developmental score, is assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at baseline and at four months after randomization. Secondary outcomes include an age appropriate behavior measure (Children&#x02019;s Behavior Questionnaire) and two laboratory measures (hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels). Change in developmental and laboratory measures from baseline to the end of the four-month follow-up period will be analyzed using linear regression (analysis of covariance method).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide evidence regarding the association between child development and NAID, and the effectiveness of oral iron to improve developmental outcomes in children with NAID. The sample size of the trial will be recalculated using estimates taken from an internal pilot study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01481766">NCT01481766</ext-link>) on 22 November 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0635-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>NAID</kwd><kwd>IDA</kwd><kwd>Screening</kwd><kwd>MSEL</kwd><kwd>ELC</kwd><kwd>Serum ferritin</kwd><kwd>Hemoglobin</kwd><kwd>Pre-school children</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia</title><p>Nationally representative data from the United States indicates a prevalence in children one to three years of age of 9% and 3%, for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. European children (one to three years of age) have been reported to have similar rates: 5 to 20% for iron deficiency and 3 to 9% for IDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although there are no similar nationally representative data for Canadian children, regional studies suggest a similar rate that has led <italic>Hartfield</italic> to conclude that &#x02018;iron deficiency is an inadequately addressed and significant public health problem among Canadian infants and children&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Current recommendations regarding screening for iron deficiency anemia in primary care practice</title><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has concluded that universal screening for anemia should be performed, with determination of hemoglobin concentration, at approximately one year of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Universal screening should also include an assessment of risk factors associated with iron deficiency: prematurity, low birth weight, exposure to lead, exclusive breastfeeding beyond four months of age without supplemental iron, weaning to whole milk or complementary foods that do not include iron-fortified cereals or foods naturally rich in iron, feeding problems, poor growth, and low socioeconomic status. Selective screening should be performed at any age when these risk factors for iron deficiency and IDA have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, both the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (1994) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (2006) have concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for IDA in asymptomatic children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These guidelines have focused on IDA, but have not addressed screening for non-anemic iron deficiency (NAID). Furthermore, experts have highlighted the lack of evidence and paucity of high quality investigations on which to base guidelines relevant to iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Current evidence on early child development and iron deficiency anemia</title><p>Studies of the outcomes of IDA have been largely conducted in developing countries due to its high prevalence. Poor developmental outcomes of IDA, which persist long term despite iron therapy, have been summarized in two recent reviews of longitudinal observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A Cochrane systematic review that was updated in 2013 examined the effectiveness of longer term iron treatment, and demonstrated improvements in developmental outcomes for the IDA group receiving oral iron treatment, compared to those receiving placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Studies included in the review also demonstrated that it is possible to detect meaningful changes in tests of children&#x02019;s cognition over a four-month-period. Although the authors of the Cochrane review concluded that there is an urgent need for further randomized trials in children with IDA with long term follow-up periods, there have been no recent trials; most investigators currently consider the question of the association between IDA and development to lack equipoise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Current evidence on early child development and non-anemic iron deficiency</title><p>The authors of the current protocol (KA and PCP) have recently undertaken a systematic review of the literature regarding the effectiveness of oral iron treatment to improve the developmental and hematologic outcomes of young children with NAID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. From the titles of 743 articles, a full-text review was completed on 46, and two randomized controlled trials were found for preschool-aged children with NAID treated with oral iron, 3 to 6 mg/elemental iron/kg daily, versus no treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For both studies, the primary objective was to study children with IDA; however, both included children with NAID randomized to oral iron or no treatment, and this data was available. The first study (n = 29, conducted in Indonesia, published in 1993) showed no statistically significant difference between groups in the post-treatment developmental score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The second study (n = 40, conducted in Turkey, published in 2004) showed a statistically significant difference between groups in the post-treatment mental developmental score, but not in the psychomotor developmental score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Meta-analysis was not possible due to significant heterogeneity. Both studies showed moderate risk of bias due to insufficient information regarding allocation concealment and inadequate reporting of adjustment for covariates (notably, sociodemographic variables); furthermore, mothers were not blinded in the second trial as a placebo was not used. We have concluded that the effectiveness of oral iron treatment in children with NAID to improve developmental outcomes remains in question, and with this equipoise it is ethical and urgent to conduct such a trial. The results of a high quality, adequately powered trial, conducted in a developed country, will begin to establish an evidence base for screening for iron deficiency, with an aim to improve developmental outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Establishment of the TARGet kids! research network</title><p>The investigators of this protocol (PCP, CSB, and JLM) have established a program of research aimed at advancing the scientific basis for preventative primary healthcare for young children. This includes development of a primary care practice-based research network called TARGet Kids! to conduct observational and interventional studies in early childhood to improve child health outcomes through primary prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It represents an innovative collaboration between child health researchers in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, and children&#x02019;s primary care physicians (pediatricians and family physicians) from the Department of Pediatrics and the Department of Family and Community Medicine, also at the University of Toronto.</p><p>Between June 2008 and September 2013, more than 5,000 children, under six years of age have been enrolled in the TARGet Kids! Cohort, with a collection of non-invasive measures, including questionnaires, and physical measures, and laboratory testing has been completed in more than 2,500 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We have leveraged existing TARGet Kids! infrastructure, collaborations, research personnel, and data management system to carry out this randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Developing a focus in child development</title><p>Since September 2008, TARGet Kids! data collection includes the measurement of child behavior (temperament) through a parent-completed questionnaire (Children&#x02019;s Behavior Questionnaire). We have found that children aged between three and five years, with high &#x02018;negative affect&#x02019;, are at higher nutrition risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the current trial, we aim to expand our focus in child development. In order to reach this goal we have established collaborations with researchers in child development. Including a focus in child development in the overall TARGet Kids! initiative is a strategic opportunity, given the importance of healthy developmental trajectories as a critical outcome measure for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Rationale for a focus of research to optimize early child development through screening for non-anemic iron deficiency in the primary care practice setting</title><p>Iron status can be considered as a continuum from normal iron status, to iron deficiency without anemia, and finally, IDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. NAID is the early latent stage of iron deficiency. In NAID, the amount of stored iron is reduced, but the amount of functional iron may not be affected; thereby children who have NAID have no iron stores to mobilize if the body requires more iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. If iron is not provided, NAID may progress to IDA, the most severe form of iron deficiency. This natural history provides an opportunity for early detection through screening by physicians in primary care settings.</p><p>Early detection of NAID presents an important opportunity to provide effective interventions which may improve child developmental outcomes. There are critical gaps in knowledge regarding the effectiveness of iron interventions in improving the development of young children with NAID. This proposal can address this gap, and also assess the feasibility of screening for NAID in the primary care setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of four months of oral iron plus dietary advice versus placebo plus dietary advice, in children with NAID aged 12 to 40 months, to improve their developmental outcomes. We hypothesize that children receiving four months of oral iron plus dietary advice will have better developmental outcomes than those who receive placebo plus dietary advice.</p><p>Secondary objectives include comparing four months of oral iron treatment plus dietary advice versus placebo plus dietary advice, for the following secondary outcomes: laboratory measures of iron indicators (serum ferritin and hemoglobin), and behavioral outcomes such as temperament, in children with NAID.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study design</title><p>The &#x02018;Optimizing Early Child Development for Young Children with Non-Anemic Iron Deficiency in the Primary Care Practice Setting&#x02019; (OptEC) study is designed as a multi-site, pragmatic, placebo controlled, superiority randomized trial. From a screened cohort, children identified with NAID are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to each treatment group. This trial has been designed along the pragmatic end of the pragmatic-explanatory continuum, since it was designed to primarily inform decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Specifically, eligibility criteria, participant compliance, intensity of follow-up, and primary analysis follow pragmatic approaches, while practitioner expertise and adherence, intervention, and follow-up of outcomes follow approaches midway along the pragmatic-explanatory continuum. This protocol was designed following the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and results will be reported according to the 2008 Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Setting</title><p>This multi-site study is being conducted in the offices of primary care practices participating in the TARGet Kids! practice-based research network. The Optimizing Early Child Development in the Primary Care Practice Setting: Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Iron Treatment for Young Children with Non-anemic Iron Deficiency (OptEC) trial is embedded in the TARGet Kids! cohort. The screening cohort includes all eligible children attending their well-child visit with their primary care physician. To date, TARGet Kids! practice sites are located in Toronto, Ontario. There are currently seven pediatric practices and three family medicine practices involved in patient recruitment. Each practice has between three and 10 practicing physicians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Participants</title><p>Children aged 12 to 40 months, whose parents consent to participate in the TARGet Kids! study, constitute the screening cohort of this trial.

However, for all three groups, we exclude children with any of the following: a CRP level &#x02265;10 mg/L; a previously diagnosed developmental disorder; a genetic, chromosomal or syndromic condition; chronic medical condition (with the exception of asthma and allergies), including chronic anemia, iron deficiency, or recent oral iron supplementation or treatment; prematurity, with a gestational age of less than 35 weeks; low birth weight less than 2,500 g; attending the office for an acute illness, such as a viral illness, or other health concern other than for a well-child assessment; any contraindications to receiving elemental iron; the use of any natural health product containing the same medicinal ingredient(s) as the investigational product; or if English is not spoken to the child in the home or in a child care setting.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

A drop-based formulation containing ferrous sulfate (Fer-In-Sol&#x02122;, Mead Johnson Nutrition, Evansville, Indiana, USA) was chosen as the active agent to facilitate ease of administration to young children. The placebo is developed by the Hospital for Sick Children compounding pharmacy, and similar in color and taste to the active agent.</p><p>Children in both the oral iron and placebo group are also given dietary advice to improve iron intake. A guideline for improving iron intake was developed to serve this purpose (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: iron intake guideline). It is based on the recommendations in Canada&#x02019;s Food Guide and the Hospital for Sick Children&#x02019;s online guideline to improve iron intake in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Dietary advice includes recommendations on the varied sources of foods containing high amounts of iron, foods that increase and inhibit iron absorption, and dietary habits that may prevent iron deficiency (such as maximum daily cow&#x02019;s milk intake and limiting the intake of juice).</p><p>Concomitant interventions permitted include over the counter multivitamins which do not contain iron; those prohibited include additional over the counter iron and prescription iron. To monitor adherence at the end of the trial, parents are asked to return bottles, and the amount of iron administered is calculated based on the volume of solution remaining. Parents in both groups are advised of possible adverse effects of oral iron (constipation and black stools), which are reversible and non-harmful, and are encouraged to remain compliant if these develop. A participant information sheet that contains information on the study drug is provided to parents who agree to participate in the trial. No specific criteria are being used for discontinuation or modification of the interventions, as the dose of iron is within the safe and recommended dosages for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Assignment of the interventions to the treatment groups is randomized and the randomization is stratified by clinic site. Block randomization is generated with blocks of variable sizes to ensure that group sizes are similar at the end of each block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The randomization sequence for each clinic site is generated using computer-generated random numbers by KT (biostatistician). Allocation concealment is achieved by having the pharmacy department at the Hospital for Sick Children prepare the treatment and placebo in sealed, serially numbered bottles of similar appearance and weight, according to the allocation sequence. Parents, attending physicians, laboratory personnel, and study personnel conducting the outcome assessments, and data analysts and investigators are blind to the group allocation. Study medication and placebo are supplied in bottles that look identical, and the appearance, consistency, and taste of the liquid are similar. Group allocation will remain concealed until the final data analysis is performed.</p><p>If a subject in the randomized study deteriorates or has persistent, severe, bothersome side effects then unblinding may be necessary. Emergency unblinding will only be done when the clinical treatment of the patient will be different by knowing which arm of the study the patient was on. The physician caring for the subject will contact the principal investigator or co-investigator first to discuss the unblinding procedure. The study investigators should remain blinded if possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Non-randomized children</title><p>Children who are identified with IDA and IS constitute the non-randomized part of the OptEC trial (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: schematic of study plan).

The MSEL measures five distinct developmental skills: gross motor and four &#x02018;cognitive&#x02019; skills (fine motor, visual reception, receptive language, and expressive language). The four cognitive skills are summarized and converted into age-adjusted normalized ELC scores, which has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Secondary outcomes include two laboratory measures of iron status (hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels) and measurement of individual child behavior characteristics (known as child temperament), which is assessed using age-appropriate parent reported questionnaires: the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ), the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ), or the Children&#x02019;s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Rationale for selection of outcome measures for this study</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Assessment of cognitive and motor function</title><p>The MSEL is an individually administered scale for assessment of development that may be applied to young children from birth to 68 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Based on the laboratory results of the screening cohort, research assistants (RA) are instructed to contact the parents of potential participants by phone and request that they return to the physician&#x02019;s office if they agree to participate. The RAs are provided with a scripted telephone dialogue in order to standardize the patient recruitment process. At the physician&#x02019;s office, the RA reviews the consent form with the parent, and the clinic nurse reviews the iron status of the child with the parent and obtains informed written consent. The family has the opportunity to ask the RA, the pediatrician, and/or clinic nurse any questions at any time. For families who provide consent, RAs conduct follow-up phone calls to ensure that the child is taking the study drug and address any questions parents may have. Since the study drug is given for four months, after the four-month follow-up visit no further contact with the participant is conducted before the 12-month follow-up visit. Two weeks prior to the 12-month follow-up visit the RA contacts the participant via phone and schedules the visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>Questionnaire data and physical measurements are collected by the RAs embedded in the practices.

MSS provides customized laboratory and research services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and researchers. Laboratory results are sent electronically to the data management center, as well as faxed to the practicing physicians offices. Children eligible for the randomized trial return to the physician&#x02019;s office where developmental testing is completed using the MSEL, administered by a trained psychometrist under the supervision of a registered psychologist.

For participants with NAID randomized to treatment or placebo groups, no significance testing will be performed on the baseline characteristics; however, we will note any imbalances that have arisen by chance which may be clinically meaningful. All children with NAID randomized to treatment or placebo will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized, following the intention-to-treat principle. In the primary analysis, the difference in developmental and hematologic measures in children with NAID randomized to treatment versus placebo will be assessed using linear regression, with the initial baseline measures included as the adjusting variable (analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In a secondary analysis, additional covariates of clinical or statistical significance (including parent education and family income) will be included in the model. The primary analysis will be a fixed effects model, ignoring stratification by clinic site. A secondary analysis will include a confirmatory analysis using a mixed effects model, with interventions and MSEL scores as the fixed effect and clinic site as the random effect. The non-randomized groups (IS and IDA) will be compared with the NAID groups for difference in their follow-up developmental and hematological outcome using ANOVA. Although efforts to ensure complete data collection and participant follow-up will be maximized, analytic strategies to handle missing data will include imputation techniques, if appropriate.

From these studies (and a larger body of literature identifying the association between cognition and education, employment, and health) 15 points or greater is clearly clinically meaningful.
