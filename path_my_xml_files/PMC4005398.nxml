There are, however, only three published randomized trials on the effect of feedback on the treatment of eating disorders, showing inconclusive results, and there are no randomized trials on the effect of feedback in group therapy. Accordingly the current randomized clinical trial, initiated in September 2012 at the outpatient clinic for eating disorders at Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre, aims to investigate the impact of continuous feedback on attendance and outcome in group psychotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The hypothesis is that continuous feedback to both patient and therapist on treatment progress and alliance will increase attendance and treatment outcome. The trial is set up using a randomized design with a minimum of 128 patients allocated to either an experimental or control group at a ratio of 1:1. The experimental group will receive standard treatment (systemic and narrative group psychotherapy) with feedback intervention, whereas the control group will receive standard treatment only. The participants are diagnosed with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or an eating disorder not otherwise specified, according to the DSM-IV. In the experimental group feedback to the participants, based on the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and the Group Session Rating Scale (GSRS), is actively added to standard treatment. The ORS assesses areas of life functioning known to change as a result of therapeutic intervention. The GSRS assesses key dimensions of effective therapeutic relationships. In the control group, the patients fill out the Outcome Rating Scale only, and feedback is not provided.</p><p>The primary outcome is the rate of attendance to treatment sessions. The secondary outcome is the severity of eating disorder symptoms. Exploratory outcomes are the level of psychological and social functioning, and suicide or self-harm. This is measured with the ORS, Symptom Check List, WHO-Five Wellbeing Index, Sheehan Disability Scale and a modified version of the Self-Harm Inventory.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If the results will confirm the hypothesis, this trial will support feedback as a way to improve group treatment attendance for outpatients with eating disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01693237?term=feedback+versus+no+feedback&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01693237</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Psychotherapy research</kwd><kwd>Outcome</kwd><kwd>Feedback</kwd><kwd>Eating disorders</kwd><kwd>Group psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>Attendance</kwd><kwd>Dropout</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Eating disorders are serious mental disorders affecting up to 10% of the population, primarily women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Characteristics of eating disorders are severe disturbances in eating behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] with significant physical, psychological and social consequences for the individual and his or her relatives. According to the DSM-IV, there are two specific diagnoses: anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Disorders that do not meet the criteria for a specific eating disorder are classified as eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However a third diagnosis, binge eating disorder (BED), is included in the appendix of the DSM-IV as a &#x02018;diagnosis for further study&#x02019;. We are diagnosing BED according to the research criteria defined in DSM-IV. In the fifth version of the DSM, BED is recognized as a free-standing diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><sec><title>Dropout and non-attendance in psychotherapy</title><p>The term &#x02018;dropout&#x02019; refers to patients that choose to end treatment prematurely. It is a common phenomenon in psychotherapy. A recent comprehensive meta-analysis, analyzing 669 studies and 83,834 adult patients with a non-psychotic disorder, reported that, on average, 19.7% of patients dropped out of psychotherapy. The dropout proportion for a subsample of patients with eating disorders was even higher at 23.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Previous research has indicated that patients who discontinue treatment prematurely exhibit poorer treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In group therapy especially, dropout not only affects the patients themselves and their therapists, but can also have an adverse effect on the remaining group members, sometimes resulting in a &#x02018;wave effect&#x02019; with dropouts begetting other dropouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Related to dropout is the phenomenon of irregular attendance to treatment sessions. It has been demonstrated that psychotherapy attendance is associated with the outcome of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and, accordingly, the development and testing of interventions to increase attendance and prevent dropout from psychotherapy is highly relevant.</p></sec><sec><title>Feedback-informed psychotherapy</title><p>One of the ways to specifically address non-attendance and dropout in psychotherapy is by monitoring patient progress. Since 1996, when Howard <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] published their session-to-session measures of client progress, there has been an increasing interest in this method and there are now several outcome monitoring systems available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Most of the effectiveness research of feedback-informed psychotherapy is based on the Outcome Questionnaire System (OQ System) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the Partners for Change Outcome Management System: International Center for Clinical Excellence (PCOMS ICCE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both systems are based on a patient-focused perspective, where the patient&#x02019;s goals, ideas for change, and perceptions of the therapeutic alliance are a focus rather than the specific treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to PCOMS ICCE as &#x02018;feedback-informed treatment&#x02019; (FIT)<italic>.</italic> FIT is defined as &#x02018;a pantheoretical approach for evaluating and improving the quality and effectiveness of behavioral health services&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. By filling out the measures, the patient continuously evaluates the therapeutic alliance and outcome. This feedback allows the therapist to monitor the progress from session to session and to tailor the treatment in dialogue with the patient. FIT consists of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS), the Session Rating Scale (SRS) and the Group Session Rating Scale (GSRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Information about FIT and intervention strategies are accessible in six different manuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In January 2013, FIT was recognized as an evidence-based practice by the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Previous research on the use of feedback in psychotherapy of eating disorders</title><p>Results from previous meta-analyses have indicated that feedback has a significant positive effect on psychotherapy outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, none of these reviews have reported results for subgroups of patients with eating disorders. We therefore searched PsycInfo, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library on 1 October 2013 with the search terms eating disorder*, bulimi* nervosa, anorexi* nervosa, binge eating disorder*, EDNOS and feedback, routine outcome monitoring, and tracking. From the search, we identified three randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] which we will review in the following.</p><p>Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] included 61 women with BN or EDNOS. They were randomly allocated to 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral guided self-care with or without added personalized feedback. The authors found no effect of feedback on treatment dropout (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.672) but it had a significant effect on dietary restriction (<italic>P&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;0.03).</p><p>Truitt <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] included 51 women with AN or BN and randomly assigned them to treatment with or without feedback. In this trial, the feedback (therapists received feedback, patients did not) significantly predicted change in individual global psychological dysfunction (measured with the OQ System) across the course of treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017).</p><p>Simon <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] included 133 women diagnosed with AN, BN or EDNOS in their trial. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with or without feedback using a randomized block design, with therapists serving as the blocking variable (the same therapists provided both treatments). The patients used the OQ System, which, together with Body Mass Index (BMI), was used as an outcome measure. The difference between the feedback condition and no feedback condition at end of treatment was statistically significant and showed an effect size difference of Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.30. The feedback did not have a significant effect on BMI, which was against the researchers&#x02019; initial expectations.</p><p>The results in the Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic> and Truitt <italic>et al.</italic> trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] were challenged by small sample sizes (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;61 and N&#x02009;=&#x02009;51), which limits the generalizability and increases the risk of random errors. In the Truitt <italic>et al.</italic> trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the treatment intervention was not described in the dissertation, which makes the trial impossible to repeat. The feedback method in the Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic> trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] was defined as &#x02018;personalized feedback on current physical and psychological status, risk and problems, and variables facilitating or hindering change&#x02019;. The feedback differs from the OQ System and FIT in frequency (not used regularly during therapy) and seems to focus primarily on symptom status rather than on the therapeutic process. These differences reduce the external validity of the findings. The different outcome measures used in the trials can yield different results: Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic> only reported eating disorders symptoms; Truitt <italic>et al.</italic> reported psychological dysfunction in more broad terms (including the OQ score); and Simon <italic>et al.</italic> used the OQ score and BMI as outcome measures.</p><p>Previous research has indicated that feedback has a promising effect on maximizing the benefits of psychotherapy. Because only three of the identified trials (with different designs, feedback measures and/or timing and outcome measures) included patients with eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the benefits of feedback are still inconclusive for these patients. Furthermore, none of the trials were performed in a group therapy setting. </p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The trial&#x02019;s objective is to examine the benefits and harms of continuous feedback on treatment progress and alliance in group therapy to patients and therapists. We hypothesize that continuous feedback with subsequent adjustments of the treatment, will increase treatment attendance and treatment outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The current trial is an investigator-initiated, randomized clinical superiority trial. The experimental intervention is the addition of feedback to standard treatment, and the design strategy can thus be categorized as additive or constructive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>After the patients have been offered treatment, received information about the trial, and signed the consent form, the patients are allocated to one of two groups (at a ratio of 1:1). The first (experimental) group consists of standard treatment with feedback intervention (feedback: ORS and GSRS are filled out and included in the treatment according to the FIT intervention manual). The second (control) group consists of standard treatment without feedback intervention (no feedback: ORS is filled out but not included in the treatment).</p><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title><bold>

The participants can give their written consent at any point before randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapists</title><p>Fifteen therapists are participating in the trial, three male and twelve female (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;44.3&#x000a0;years, SD 9.1). Their general average experience with psychotherapy is 7.2&#x000a0;years (SD 6.6), and their average experience with the treatment of eating disorders is 3.8&#x000a0;years (SD 5.2).</p><p>As part of the clinical routine, the therapists have case supervision in groups with team colleagues every other week, lasting one and a half hours. The supervision format is systemic and narrative, structured around the idea of &#x02018;reflecting teams&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Before data collection began, the therapists had two training sessions (three hours each) in feedback-informed clinical work, led by an external certified FIT trainer and associate at the International Center for Clinical Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The therapists were introduced to the method and instructed in the use of the measures in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Only two had worked with FIT in previous jobs. Each therapist was placed in both a control group and an experimental group and thus provided both treatments. To ensure that the therapists followed the feedback method and to reinforce the implementation process, the training was supplemented with one and a half hour hour monthly FIT supervision during the data collection period.</p><p>The therapists were assumed to be following the feedback method adequately after this, with no further control for adherence to the method. Because of the lack of published guidelines for the use of feedback in group therapy, the therapists were encouraged to use the feedback according to the guidelines for individual therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In cases where these guidelines were insufficient, the supervisor was involved.</p><p>Immediately after the second training session with the FIT trainer, the therapists answered an attitude survey (Davidsen, AH; allegiance measure; unpublished data) asking if they believed working with GSRS and ORS would make a positive difference in their therapeutic work. All therapists agreed that it would improve their clinical work. This therapist allegiance can potentially positively influence the results and exaggerate an effect of feedback on outcome. In order to investigate if the first attitude survey was influenced by the &#x02018;rush&#x02019; after the training session, we asked the therapists again before they started using the method. The answers were the same in the second survey (Davidsen, AH; allegiance measure; unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Standard treatment</title><p>Standard treatment is offered in both groups, based on recommendations from the Danish National Board of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and on guidelines for treating eating disorders in the Capital Region of Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. After the initial assessment interview a psychiatrist or attending physician decides to offer the patient one of two standard treatments: basic or elaborate. This decision is based upon an assessment of eating disorder severity, co-morbidity, and medical and/or social factors that are believed to complicate the treatment of the eating disorder.</p><p>Treatment length (from the first assessment session to the last follow-up session) is approximately 10&#x000a0;months for basic treatment and 12 to 14&#x000a0;months for elaborate treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. After referral and before starting group therapy, the patient undergoes a psychiatric, medical, and somatic assessment, followed by psycho-education. The treatment program consists of 20 sessions for patients with BN or EDNOS, and 25 sessions for patients with BED. Alongside group therapy, the patients are offered sessions with a dietician and relatives as well as sessions with a social worker (as needed). The patients in the elaborate treatment are offered an extended medical assessment and more sessions with relatives and a dietician. In some cases, patients start psychotropic drugs before or during treatment; this is a possibility in both groups. Patient treatment status is assessed at weekly team conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic approach and elements</title><p>The eating disorders treatment provided at Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre is founded on systemic and narrative theory and a post-modern view on patients and therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The therapists work with individual therapy in the group, which is structured around the principles of the reflecting team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. One of the methods used in the therapy is externalization of the eating disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. With a focus on the patients&#x02019; resources, relations, future and unique outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], patients and therapists address psychological, physiological and social difficulties associated with the eating disorder. The effectiveness of this specific treatment has not been evaluated but a recent meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials showed that systemic therapy, on which the treatment at the Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre outpatient clinic is based, is an effective psychotherapeutic treatment for adults with eating disorders and other psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Structure</title><p>There are seven patients and two therapists in each group. The groups are slow-open, that is, open to new patients as others end treatment. Central to the treatment is a food diary that patients are asked to keep and discuss in the group therapy sessions. Patients are weighed before each session and weight fluctuation is monitored and addressed in the case of rapid weight gain or weight loss. The patients are encouraged to set individual goals for the treatment, typically concerning food, body and appearance, relations, and future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The duration of a group session is 150&#x000a0;minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental group (feedback)</title><p>In the experimental group two sets of measures are added to the standard treatment: ORS and GSRS.</p><p>The patients mark their scores on the ORS and GSRS using a tablet computer with a computer-based application (FIT-Outcomes). FIT-Outcomes (FIT-Outcomes, Hoersholm, Denmark) is an application used to administer, score and aggregate data from the ORS and SRS/GSRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. When the patient has marked his or her scores on the tablet computer, the management system produces a graph illustrating the therapeutic progress on the ORS and GSRS, the cutoff scores and the expected treatment response (ETR). Based on the latest score on the ORS and GSRS, FIT-Outcomes provides immediate feedback to the therapists. The therapists discuss the ORS and GSRS score with the patient in the present or the following group session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The outcome rating scale (ORS)</title><p>Before they are weighed and immediately before each group session, the patients complete the ORS and assess their individual, interpersonal, social, and overall wellbeing during the preceding week. The clinical cutoff score is 25 and the reliable change index (RCI) is 5 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A green alert in the FIT-Outcomes system means that the patient is on track, that is, that the latest score indicates progress similar to successful treatment courses. A red alert means that the patient is off track, that is, that the latest score indicates progress similar to unsuccessful treatment courses.

No substantial deviation from the protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the regulatory authorities except where it may be necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial participants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>The Copenhagen Trial Unit (CTU) will be responsible for the central randomization. They have no clinical involvement in the trial. Randomization is carried out according to a computer-generated allocation sequence with a varying block size kept unknown to the investigators. After each patient is assessed to be eligible for the trial, the trial secretary will call CTU, provide a personal pin code and receive the randomization result.</p><p>The randomization is stratified for eating disorder diagnosis (BN, EDNOS or BED) and treatment type (basic or elaborate). Patients and therapists are naturally aware of the patient allocation but secondary outcome assessment (EDE), statistical analyses, and drawing of conclusions will be done with the blind intact. Blinding is maintained by instructing the intervention team to withhold patient information from the research team. The research team has no clinical contact with the patients from assessment to end of intervention, and the assessors have no knowledge about the patient&#x02019;s randomization status at the end of intervention. In order to prevent the risk of bias, such as when therapists are assessing patient withdrawal, we have a blinded assessor counting the attendance rate and checking each patient&#x02019;s medical file. In order to prevent actual bias, the research team is not present in supervision or when the therapists are discussing patients at conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This trial is carried out in order to improve treatment for patients with eating disorders. If the results support our hypothesis, the addition of feedback can have the potential of improving treatment outcome in diagnoses other than eating disorders. The control group receives a standardized treatment based on recommendations from the Danish National Board of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and on guidelines for treating eating disorders in the Capital Region of Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Risks and benefits</title><p>There are no known or obvious risks concerning participation in this trial. The only inconvenience is that participants are required to spend more time on assessment than in clinical routine assessment (filling out questionnaires as well as attending an extra assessment interview pre and post treatment). The assessment provides additional information about the patient&#x02019;s condition for the intervention team to use in the treatment process. Rating the feedback scales before and after each session can put an extra strain on patients and they are offered assistance in this process. The benefits are estimated to outweigh the risks.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical plan and data analysis</title><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Sample size estimation</italic>
</bold></title><p>We are planning a trial of independent experimental participants and control participants randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Unpublished data (Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre, routinely collected data) from 138 patients with eating disorders at Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre indicate that the mean number of attended treatment sessions is 13.58 and the SD is 5.82 sessions. We expect to find that the participants in the experimental group attend at least three more sessions than the participants in the control group. Using a SD of six sessions, we need to include 64 participants in each group (total 128) to be able to reject the null hypothesis that number of attended treatment sessions in the experimental and control group is equal with probability (power) 80%. The type I error probability associated with the test of this null hypothesis is 5%. We also estimated the sample size using a power of 90%. This resulted in a total of 170 participants (2 &#x000d7; 85 participants). We therefore plan to recruit a minimum of 128 participants, and in order to reduce the risk of type II error, we will aim to recruit up to 170 participants, if possible in the 14&#x000a0;months recruitment period. Power and sample size calculations have been made using the PS Power and Sample Size Calculations program version 3.0.14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] (Dupont &#x00026; Plummer, Nashville, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Power calculations</title><p>We have conducted power calculations for the majority of the secondary and exploratory outcomes (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

All analyses will be conducted blinded with the two intervention groups coded as A and B.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome is the rate of attendance. It is defined as the number of group sessions the patient has attended over the number of planned sessions (20 or 25 sessions). If at group session # n (n &#x0003c;20) the therapist decides that the patient needs not attend further sessions, the number of planned sessions is set equal to n. When a patient discontinues treatment early, the therapists decide whether this is in accordance with the treatment plan (categorized as &#x02018;planned withdrawal&#x02019; or &#x02018;unplanned withdrawal&#x02019;).</p><p>In the analysis of the rate data, the model fit of a Poisson model and a negative binomial model both with offset equal to log (number of planned sessions) are compared and the best fitting model is chosen provided it fits the data reasonably well. In the analysis of continuous outcomes the univariate general linear model is used. If the assumptions of a regression are not fulfilled, a non-parametric test is used (Mann-Whitney).</p><p>All outcomes are analyzed using regression analyses, including the binary intervention indicator. The primary results are those adjusted by the protocol-specified stratification variables and (where measured) the baseline value as covariates. In an exploratory analysis the analyses will be repeated with the categorical variable ID-group (identity code of the group) as an additional covariate, and it will be tested if the outcome depends on the treatment group. Then it will be tested if ID-group and the intervention indicator interact. If so, subgroup analyses of the various treatment groups will be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiplicity</title><p>The primary and the secondary outcome are tested in that order each at the 5% level of significance. If the first test is not significant at the 5% level the null hypothesis of the secondary outcome is accepted without test.</p></sec><sec><title>Missing values</title><p>Missing values of the secondary outcome and/or covariates included in its analysis are imputed using multiple imputation (SPSS), if the percent of missing patients is &#x0003e;5% and <italic>P</italic> of Little&#x02019;s test is &#x0003c;5%. The result of the analysis of the imputed datasets is then the primary result.</p><p>The assumption of multiple imputation is that the data are missing at random, i.e., that for a given quantity with missing values, the distribution of observed values of this quantity conditional on values observed of other quantities is the same as the conditional distribution of the values planned to be observed of the quantity, but missing. If this condition is not fulfilled, the results of the multiple imputation will be biased. To obtain the range of plausible bias that may result if the MAR (missing at random) condition is not fulfilled, we will do the following two analyses using single imputations of the outcome performed as a sensitivity analysis: 1) missing values in group A are imputed by the minimum value observed in the material, while missing values in group B are imputed by the maximum value observed, and the two groups are compared; and 2) vice versa.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Attendance to psychotherapy is a prerequisite for the therapy to have an effect. However, a large proportion of patients end treatment prematurely, which has been associated with poorer treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this trial, we hypothesize that integrating patient feedback in the psychotherapy process will increase attendance and patient outcome. This is the first randomized trial of the effect of feedback on group psychotherapy for patients with eating disorders. Below, we discuss some of the potential limitations and strengths of the F-EAT trial.</p><p>The trial is subject to at least four potential limitations. First, although the trial was designed in order to minimize the risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and the risk of random errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], most outcomes are at risk of being assessed with some bias, as only the secondary outcome measure (EDE) is possible to blind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Previous research has indicated that non-blinded assessors tended to be more optimistic about patient outcome when compared to blinded assessors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Blinding is thus used whenever possible and data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. We employed central randomization with an allocation sequence stratified for prognostic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>Second, the therapists are trained and supervised by an engaged trainer and became excited about the feedback method. The trainer is the only certified trainer in Denmark and is herself involved in the ICCE. It is possible that, as she believes in the benefits of feedback, this might influence the therapist allegiance. The potential allegiance bias was part of our considerations beforehand, however it was important to us that the therapists received proper training and continuing supervision in the feedback method. The alternative would be to collaborate with a less experienced trainer and/or have less training. This solution could imply that the therapists failed to comply with the method or refused to use it, and would pose a greater risk to the trial overall since it would compromise data collection.</p><p>Third, the fact that most therapists provide treatment both in an experimental and a control group can cause a contamination between the groups. However, neither the participants nor the therapists in the control groups are informed of the patients&#x02019; progress, and we therefore hypothesize that any contamination will be minor.</p><p>Fourth, the participants in the control groups use a paper version of the ORS while participants in the experimental groups use a tablet computer to mark their score. These two different versions of the ORS might differ in psychometric properties and thus influence the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. This difference is nevertheless an important premise of the trial design because we hypothesize that the available feedback (from the management system on the tablet computer) will improve attendance and outcome in the experimental groups when compared to the control groups.</p><p>We would also like to emphasize at least three possible strengths of the trial. First, we planned for the participants to be as similar as possible to the patients treated in routine care. We have therefore added as few inclusion and exclusion criteria as possible in addition to the ones normally applied when patients are referred to treatment at Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre. Accordingly, the findings of the trial should have a wide generalizability.</p><p>Second, by using multiple outcome measures (patient-, therapist-, researcher-rated measures, and objective measures), we hope to discuss outcome in broader terms. Previous research comparing patient-reported outcomes and therapist-reported outcomes has indicated that therapists are more positive than patients in their evaluation of symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p><p>Third, we expect to widen the scope of this relatively new area of research by including more clinically distressed patients in routine care.
