[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, acquired knowledge is often quickly forgotten 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Such forgetting raises the important question as to whether the educational process itself might be tailored to improve students&#x02019; retention of the curricular material 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Spaced education refers to educational programs that are structured to take advantage of the pedagogical benefits of the spacing effect 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The spacing effect is the psychological principle that educational encounters that are repeated over time result in more efficient learning 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Using standard e-mail to deliver educational content over spaced intervals, several trials have demonstrated the educational efficacy of this methodology as a means to improve overall learning 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A spaced education item consists of an evaluative component (multiple choice questions) and an educational component (correct answers and detailed explanations of the answers). Upon submitting an answer to a question via e-mail the learner receives the educational component 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Learning styles</title><p>Learning styles are characteristic preferences for alternative ways of taking in and processing information 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As a consequence, some students prefer to work with concrete information (facts, experimental data), while others are more comfortable with abstractions (theories, symbolic information). Some students are partial to visual presentation of information (pictures, diagrams, flowcharts) and others get more from verbal explanations 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Some like to learn by trying things out and seeing and analyzing what happens, and others would rather reflect on things they plan to do and understand as much as they can about them before actually attempting them 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In an ideal situation the teaching style matches with the learning styles of the students avoiding students&#x02019; demotivation. Learning styles can be determined by the Index of Learning Styles (ILS). It is an online questionnaire designed to assess preferences on four dimensions of a learning style model 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The ILS consists of four scales: sensing-intuitive, visual-verbal, active-reflective, and sequential-global. Assessing students&#x02019; learning styles helps educators checking if a certain course fulfills the students&#x02019; needs.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The present study aimed at examining if spaced education</p><p>i) activates students in a way that they spend more time on keeping busy with the learning content.</p><p>ii) leads to a change in correlation between learning styles and examination results in a theoretical radiological science course.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. 42 third-year dental students were scheduled for the theoretical radiological science course. The learning content comprised radiation physics, X-ray production, X-ray interactions, radiation dose, imaging equipment, radiation protection, image creation, and normal radiological anatomy of the teeth and jaws.</p><p>In an introductory explanatory face-to-face session the students were asked to join the study. Participation in the study was optional. Demographic data of the students were documented. The students were randomly assigned to two groups (&#x0201c;traditional group&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;spaced education group&#x0201d;). Each student received a pseudonym as participant of the study. During the introductory session the students had to complete a paper and pen version of the Index of Learning Styles questionnaire (ILS, 
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html</ext-link>). The students indicated their pseudonyms on the questionnaire.</p><p>The ILS consists out of 44 items that refer to four scales:</p><p>i) Sensing (concrete, practical, oriented towards facts and procedures) or intuitive (conceptual, innovative, oriented toward theories and underlying meanings).</p><p>ii) Visual (prefer visual representation of presented material, such as pictures, diagrams, and flow charts) or verbal (prefer written and spoken explanations).</p><p>iii) Active (learn by trying things out, enjoy working in groups) or reflective (learn by thinking things through, prefer working alone or with one or two familiar partners).</p><p>iv) Sequential (linear thinking process, learn in incremental steps) or global (holistic thinking process, learn in large leaps)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The answers to the 44 questions could be given in a bipolar fashion (&#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;). For the determination of the individual learning styles of each single student an online tool was used (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html</ext-link>). One week later, the theoretical radiological science course started. It was delivered as 8 didactic lectures of 45 minutes each. Attendance of the face-to-face lectures was mandatory for both groups of students. The students were asked to document the time they worked on the theoretical radiological science learning content during the duration of the course. While there was no intervention in the traditional group, an intervention was performed in the spaced education group. The intervention was spaced education by the use of e-mails. Following each face-to-face lecture a corresponding e-mail with 3 multiple choice questions on the learning content of the specific lecture was sent out with a delay of 14&#x02009;days (Figure 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The students of the spaced education group received an e-mail reminder 3&#x02009;days after the first e-mail in order to secure the answering of the multiple choice questions within 1&#x02009;week. When the students had returned their answers to a set of multiple choice questions by e-mail, they received another e-mail that included the correct answers and additional explanatory material. 4&#x02009;weeks after the last lecture of the theoretical radiological science course the students of both groups had to fill in the TRIL (Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation) questionnaire which is a validated modular German-language questionnaire for the evaluation of courses at university (Table 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It comprises 6 topics. Topic 1 (&#x0201c;structure and didactics&#x0201c;) consists of 8 questions that concerned the lecturer&#x02019;s skills in didactics and structuring of the learning content. Topic 2 deals with the motivational skills of the lecturer consisting of 8 questions. Topic 3 (5 questions) addresses the lecturer&#x02019;s skills in creating a favorable climate during the course. Topic 4 consisted of 4 questions and asks the students to evaluate practical relevance of the course by providing a connection between theory and practice. Topic 5 subsumes 5 questions on different additional aspects of courses. Topic 6 (&#x0201c;homework&#x0201d;) consisted out of 6 questions that concerned the multiple choice questions sent out by e-mail. This topic had only to be answered by the spaced education group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the course of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6920-12-32-1"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Results of the answers to the TRIL (Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Question no002E</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="3" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Traditional group</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="3" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Spaced education group</bold><hr/></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>p</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center"><bold>n</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Mean value</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>SD</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>n</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Mean value</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>SD</bold></th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td colspan="8" align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Topic 1 &#x0201c;structure and didactics&#x0201c;</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.

Today&#x02019;s students seem to accept the deliverance of spaced education items as a way of providing additional information on lectures.</p><p>It has been show previously that face-to-face lectures favor learners with specific learning styles 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, one learning style is neither preferable nor inferior to another, but is simple different with different characteristic strengths and weaknesses 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, courses should address all learning styles. It is well known that greater learning may occur when teaching styles match learning styles than when they are mismatched 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The combination of face-to-face lectures with spaced education may have the desired effect. The tendency that students with specific learning styles achieved better examination results was leveled. To the best of our knowledge, this effect of spaced education has not been described in the current literature before. Combining face-to-face lectures with spaced education seems to improve the chances of benefiting from a course for all students whose learning style is not completely suited for face-to-face lectures.</p><p>The present study is limited by different aspects. First of all, the number of participants is low. As a consequence, the results have to be confirmed in larger student populations.</p><p>It is difficult to say if the Hawthorne effect influenced the results of the study. It addresses an increase of productivity in the control group that did not receive an intervention as a consequence of increased attention of the observer of the study to this group 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both groups documented the time they spent on keeping busy with the learning content. The spaced education group invested significantly more time. As a consequence it can be assumed that the Hawthorne effect did not play a major role in the present study.</p><p>Another limitation of the study is that in the examination only a limited number of multiple choice questions was used. However, the Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;-value of .72 reveals that the test had an acceptable reliability. Still efforts have to be made to increase Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;-value above .8 in future trials in order to reach a higher level of reliability

Moreover, combining spaced education with face-to-face lectures gives a view to a more balanced way of education that does not prefer specific learning styles.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EN and FS made substantial contributions to conception and study design and wrote the manuscript.
