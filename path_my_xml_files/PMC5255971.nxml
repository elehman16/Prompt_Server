Anaemia can be caused due to multiple factors but one of the major factors is nutritional deficiency. IDA is the most significant contributor of all anaemias and hence IDA and anaemia are often used synonymously. Around 30&#x02013;52% of nonindustrialized population has anaemia in general and iron deficiency in particular.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Iron deficiency and IDA were considered as one among the top 10 risks globally and regionally,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] contributing to the 14<sup>th</sup> leading cause of disease burden in the world global burden of diseases.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] IDA causes 8.4 lakh deaths and 35 million cases of disability adjusted life years (DALYs).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In India, surveys have shown high prevalence of anaemia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Anaemia prevalence was 56.2 percent in women of 15&#x02013;49 yrs of age, 79.2 percent among children aged 6-35 months, 57.9 percent in pregnant women and 24.3 percent in men aged 15-49 yr. Sex prevalence shows that 55% of women and 25% of men suffer from anaemia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It has been estimated that iron deficiency costs India about 5 percent of its gross national product (GNP) annually from loss of lives, resources and productivity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The main reasons for IDA have been determined to be inadequate intake of iron, low bioavailability of dietary iron from plant foods due to inhibitory factors, low levels of absorption enhancers in the diet, repeated pregnancies, increased needs during growth and development among children and adolescents, parasitic infestations and chronic blood loss. Poverty compounds these factors through inadequate access to dietary diversity, safe water, knowledge about safe food handling and proper feeding practices.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Anaemia and iron deficiency is known to have several functional consequences. IDA adversely effects cognitive performance, behavior, physical growth in children. IDA during pregnancy increases the perinatal risks of mother and infant. Overall increase in infant mortality, decreased functioning of immune system, reduced work capacity and productivity, endocrine and neurotransmitter abnormality associated with triiodothyronine, thyroid function general, production and metabolism of catecholamines. increased risk of heavy metal absorption.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Preventive strategies are through food based approaches that cause multi nutritional benefit. Foods rich in iron such as meat, organs of cattle, fish, poultry, legumes and green leafy vegetables are beneficial. Enhancers of Iron absorption such as haem iron of animal origin, ascorbic acid or Vitamin C and inhibitors of Iron absorption like phytates of cereal grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, iron-binding phenolic compounds (tannins) in tea, coffee, calcium of milk and milk products play a determining role. Conventional approach for IDA is through Iron Supplements such as ferrous sulphate etc., However, adherence to the medication is difficult due to various side effects such as epigastric discomfort, nausea, diarrhoea, or constipation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Side effects can be minimized by drug intake along with food, however, doing this reduces the iron absorption by 40%.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Iron preparations inhibit the absorption of other drugs such as tetracyclines, sulphonamides, and trimethoprim.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Hence there is a need to look for newer agents which have a better therapeutic utility.</p><p>Complementary and alternative systems (CAM) or traditional Medicines (TM) which are widely used by the ailing community needs to be explored. In countries such as Republic of Korea and China, in spite of well established conventional health care 86% and 90% of population commonly use TM.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Ayurveda has analysed the different types of anemia under the classification of Pandu roga.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Ayurveda has indicated use of various herbal formulations like dh&#x00101;tr&#x0012b; avaleha[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and iron formulations such as Loha bhasma, Ma&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;ura bhasma, M&#x00101;k&#x01e63;ika bhasma, Gairika, Vimala and Kas&#x0012b;sa[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] for this ailment. Hence the present study was designed with an objective to evaluate effect of a noniron formulation, Dh&#x00101;tr&#x0012b; avaleha with an iron formulation Kas&#x0012b;sa bhasma in patients of IDA.

Studies have established importance of ferrous iron in absorption and therapeutics of Iron deficiency anaemia.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Bhasma is an Ayurveda metal/mineral preparation containing nano particles as a result of the processing that facilitate drug absorption in the body.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A previous study[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] on <italic>&#x0015b;uddha Kas&#x0012b;sa</italic> (pure <italic>kas&#x0012b;sa</italic>) has also showed similar results in terms of significant increase in haemoglobin, Total RBC Count, MCV, MCH, PCV. Poly herbal drug <italic>Dh&#x00101;tr&#x0012b; avaleha</italic> contains various ingredients such as <italic>Va&#x01e43;&#x0015b;alocana</italic> (Silicious concretion obtained from <italic>Bambusa arundinaceae</italic> Willd.), &#x0015a;un&#x01e6d;h&#x0012b; (<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> Rosc.), Madhuya&#x01e63;&#x01e6d;i (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> Linn), Pippal&#x0012b; (<italic>Piper longum</italic> Linn.), M&#x01e5b;dv&#x0012b;k&#x00101; (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), <italic>&#x0015a;arkar&#x00101;</italic> (<italic>Saccharum officinarium</italic> Linn.), <italic>&#x00100;malak&#x0012b;</italic> (<italic>Emblica officinalis</italic> Gaertn.), Honey. <italic>Emblica officinalis</italic> is one of the richest sources of ascorbic acid. Role of ascorbic acid is well established in converting ferric iron to ferrous iron and helping in its absorption in the body.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Ascorbic acid is specially helpful in Indian population who on an average consume more vegetarian foods with low iron bioavailability. Other herbal ingredients through their antioxidant, micro nutrients value might have helped in nutritional uptake and alleviated anemia in the patients. Interventions showed no untoward or adverse reactions. <italic>Dh&#x00101;tr&#x0012b; avaleha</italic> has also shown to have a potential role as an adjuvant in the management of Thalassemia.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Other Ayurveda formulations such as <italic>Dh&#x00101;tr&#x0012b; loha</italic>,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] <italic>Ha&#x01e43;sa ma&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;ura</italic>[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and <italic>Phalatrik&#x00101;di kv&#x00101;tha</italic>[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have also shown favorable outcomes in IDA.</p><p>Improvements not only sustained in most of the parameters but also progressed during the drug withdrawn observational period. The reason for this may be the sustained long term effect of the drugs. The drugs might also have played a role in correcting the defective absorption of micro nutrients such as iron from food supplements. These drugs increase the <italic>agni</italic> (metabolic process) and which in turn help in correcting the deficits in the metabolism. Another study[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] has also shown the therapeutic effect and sustainability effect of Ayurveda formulations in nutritional deficiency anaemia in children.</p><p>Advantage of the <italic>kas&#x0012b;sa bhasma</italic> when compared to the conventional oral iron therapy is the lack of adverse effects. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, heartburn, pain, constipation, and diarrhoea are the most commonly reported side effects, irrespective of the type of conventional iron preparations used. This occasional intolerance is usually viewed as a limiting factor for oral iron therapy, as it may impact patient compliance.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>The present study highlights that Ayurveda intervention can successfully treat IDA. However, scarcity of documentation and lack of validation are few of the hindrances in their propagation. Ayurveda and other traditional medicinal systems have the potential to provide effective, economical and safer medications to IDA which has a large ailing community. A randomized, controlled, open label clinical study could effectively demonstrate the outcome. Outcomes were effectively captured in various subjective and objective parameters. A nonIron formulation, <italic>Dh&#x00101;tr&#x0012b; avaleha</italic> can also a play a significant role in IDA management.</p><p>This study has a few limitations such as lesser sample, shorter duration of intervention. Comparison with the currently used medications of IDA such as ferrous sulphate would have been more beneficial. Assessment of iron state by serum ferritin, Erythrocyte protoporphyrin, Serum iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation, Serum transferrin receptors would have also added value. Detailed study of these drugs and their pharmacokinetic studies can thro&#x01ec9; more light.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study stresses the importance of two Ayurveda medications in the management of IDA. <italic>Kas&#x0012b;sa bhasma</italic> and a nonIron formulation, <italic>Dh&#x00101;tr&#x0012b; avaleha</italic> could effectively improve Hematological parameters of IDA. Improvements not only sustained in most of the parameters but also progressed in few of the parameters during the drug withdrawn observational period.
