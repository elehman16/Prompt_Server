For patients with BPH and OAB, the key of medication treatment was increasing urinary bladder pressure and contraction of bladder to promote urination, inhibiting bladder contraction, reducing afferent sensation to improve storage symptoms. Clinically, &#x000b1;-receptor blocker and M receptor antagonist are the preferred medicines for lower urinary tract symptoms induced by BOO and BPH.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the improvement of storage symptoms is not ideal for some patients when they are treated with &#x000b1;-receptor blocker because the symptoms are induced by detrusor over activity rather than BPH.</p><p>In recent years, &#x003b1;-receptor blocker in combination with M receptor antagonist has been found more effective than single medication in treating urinary tract syndrome.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, further analyzing the effect of &#x003b1;-receptor blocker in combination with M receptor antagonist in the treatment of BPH and OAB is of great clinical significance..</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Research Objects</title><p>One hundred and twenty-four patients with BPH in combination with OAB who were admitted to department of urology of our hospital between April 2014 and December 2015 were selected as the research subjects.

Almost 50% of BPH patients have OAB. Its cause has not been clarified clearly, and it is assumed to be associated to bladder mucosa, myogenic factors or neurogenic factors.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> &#x003b1;-receptor blocker is the preferred drug for the treatment of BPH induced LUTS. Tamsulosin as a novel drug, can significantly inhibit sympathetic nerve &#x003b1;1 receptor, selectively block &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub> receptor, effectively act on the urethra, bladder and prostate, and highly selectively block smooth muscle. Its effect on the symptoms of storage period is not good as expected though its inhibitory effect on the increase of urethral pressure is 13 times that of the inhibitory effect on the increase of vascular diastolic pressure.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>M-receptor blocker mainly works in storage period. It can inhibit the involuntary shrink of detrusor through inhibiting nervous impulse. The effectiveness of M-receptor blocker in combination with &#x003b1;-receptor blocker has been verified by many studies. Kaplan SA et al.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> selected 95 BPH patients who aged no less than 40 years old and had 12 points more IPSS, 3 points more QOL, no less than 8 times of urination each day and no less than 3 times of urination each day and divided them into a control group (N=222), a tolterodine group (N=217), a tamsulosin group (N=215) and a combined treatment group (N=225). After 12-week treatment, it was found that, the combined treatment group had a remarkably lower incidence of urge urinary incontinence, 24-h urination frequency and night urination frequency and significantly improved IPSS and QOL. Chapple C et al.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> compared the effects of placebo and tolterodine on the basis of the application of &#x003b1;-receptor blocker and eventually drew out a similar conclusion. Solifenacin as M3-receptor blocker can significantly relieve the clinical symptoms of OAB patients compared to placebo and have been recommended as the first-line drug in the treatment of OAB.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In this study, the subjective indexes such as IPSS, OABSS and QOL and the objective indexes such as PVR, Q<sub>max</sub>, daytime urination frequency, night urination frequency, urge urinary incontinence and urgent urination frequency in the two groups improved after treatment, and the differences had statistical significance (P&#x0003c;0.05). It indicated that, the clinical effect of tamsulosin in the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia was definite through inhibiting &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub> receptors. The subjective and objective indexes in the observation group except PVR were significantly improved after treatment compared to the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), suggesting solifenacin could inhibit the involuntary contraction of the detrusor, reduce detrusor overactivity, and lower bladder excitability, which is of great significance to the symptoms improvement of patients with BPH in combination with OAB. Solifenacin in combination with tamsulosin was more effective than tamsulosin alone in the treatment of BPH in combination with OAB. The difference of PVR before and after treatment of the two groups was not significantly difference (P&#x0003e;0.05), indicating tamsulosin was unable to improve bladder emptying degree and its efficacy was equivalent to tamsulosin.</p><p>M-receptor blocker associated adverse reactions, especially whether the incidence of acute urinary retention of BPH patients will increase, is concerned by all clinicians. Kaplan SA et al.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> enrolled 398 cases for a double-blind control study and found urinary retention occurred to 3% of patients who were treated with solifenacin in combination with tamsulosin. In the study of Yamaguchi O et al.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, patients who aged more than 45 years old, had no less than 200 mL of residual urine volume, no less than 5 mL/s of Q<sub>max</sub>, no less than 8 times of urination within hour and no less than 12 points of IPSS, and still had OAB after Harnal treatment were given solifenacin; it was found that, the urination frequency significantly reduced, and the overall tolerance was favorable. Wu SL. et al.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> compared the adverse reactions of patients who were treated by either solifenacin or tolterodine. The incidence of adverse reactions in the two groups was 11.7% and 23.5% respectively, and the incidence of mouth dryness which is the major adverse reaction was 5.8% and 10.4% respectively (P&#x0003c;0.05), suggesting solifenacin was more safe and effective in relieving OAB. A latest randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled trial<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> also suggested that, the risks of acute urinary retention was not increased when the patients were given the combined use of solifenacin and tamsulosin. In this study, the incidence of adverse reactions in the two groups suggested no remarkable difference, and there were no cases of acute urinary retention which needed catheterization, which were similar to the aforementioned research results and suggested the combined medication did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, it is effective and safe to treat patients with BPH in combination with OAB with tamsulosin in combination with solifenacin, and its efficacy is better than solifenacin. As the sample size of this study was small, the comparison of adverse reactions between patients who are treated with combined medication or single medication remains to be investigated with studies with a large sample size.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contribution</title><p><bold>HW &#x00026; YHC:</bold> Study design, data collection and analysis.</p><p><bold>YHC &#x00026;
