However, hearing loss has become one of a number of sensory disabilities associated with HIV / AIDS that must now compete for attention by the research and medical community. Friedman and Noffsinger[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] were among the first to advocate that as primary professionals in hearing healthcare, audiologists have a responsibility to inform both themselves and other relevant healthcare professionals about this issue, hence the current study.</p><p>Understanding the effects of HIV / AIDS and the treatment of HIV / AIDS on the auditory system is becoming more important, because patients with HIV / AIDS are living longer due to the positive effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The discovery of antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV / AIDS has changed the face of the HIV / AIDS pandemic internationally, and has also led to changes in the medical field, with people who have HIV / AIDS living for longer periods of time experiencing toxic-related morbidity that influences the quality of life indicators.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] There is a concern, however, that HIV-associated auditory disorders may be seriously underreported. Zuninga[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] makes a reference to anecdotal reports suggesting that hearing loss and dizziness, which are often the initial symptoms of the underlying auditory system disease may not have been reported by patients prior to HAART because many patients focused on the life-threatening complications of the HIV disease rather than on the quality of life issues. This situation is yet to be fully realized in developing countries, such as South Africa, where ARVs have not been available for a long time; and where available, access is not the same for the entire population infected by the virus. People who will benefit from these drugs in these countries may in the near future become more conscious of the quality of life issues and complain about them.</p><p>Numerous clinical, and mostly medically oriented studies have demonstrated the occurrence of hearing loss and other auditory manifestations in HIV / AIDS. Auditory manifestations may be one of the issues that the population will have to deal with; therefore, over and above the management of the known side effects of ARVs, research into the identification and monitoring of all other manifestations of the disease is required. According to the research literature, auditory abnormalities associated with HIV / AIDS and their treatment has been reported in persons with varying degrees of HIV infection, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, as well as in patients on antiretroviral treatment. Indications exist that the HIV effects on the auditory system can be direct as well as indirect; however, this distinction is not always clear and consistent. Early reports in the literature demonstrated that the HIV might directly affect the auditory function due to the fact that the virus is neurotropic and commonly manifests itself neurologically,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] which may be what Kallail <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] term primary causes of auditory system disorders in HIV / AIDS. These direct causes have been reported to possibly give rise to the central pathology observed in this population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] More commonly, however, reports in the literature focus significantly on the indirect effects of the virus on the ear. It is believed that indirect causes that result in hearing loss stem from opportunistic infections that require suppressive therapy, thereby leading to ototoxicity;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] which Kallail <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] refer to as iatrogenic sources. It is important to note that these findings are mainly from developed countries where the presentation and management of HIV / AIDS is different from that in the developing countries, suggesting a need for more research in this area, particularly as the number of adults living with HIV / AIDS in developing countries such as South Africa is still high, and also because the context is different. With regard to auditory manifestations, both identification and monitoring of ototoxicity require rigorous research, to enhance the patients&#x02019; quality of life, particularly as internationally, a link has been established between ARVs and ototoxicity.</p><p>On account of all the diseases and infections that the population with HIV / AIDS present with, it is not surprising to find patients with hearing loss due to ototoxicity, as this population goes through a drug regimen that often involves potentially ototoxic medications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] Bankaitis and Schountz[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] report that the use of experimental antiretroviral drugs, with undocumented or unknown side effects, contributes to this hearing loss. In addition, ototoxic drugs that are often used in the treatment of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis may increase the potential for a drug-induced hearing loss in this population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p><p>Internationally, iatrogenic hearing loss has been associated with many of the drugs used to treat HIV / AIDS and its associated complications. As early as 1998, the potential for a drug-induced hearing loss in an HIV-infected individual at any stage of the disease was reported to be relatively high.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] With all the medications that individuals with HIV are taking and the continual developments in HIV therapies, it is challenging to acquire and maintain a comprehensive knowledge base of HIV-related drugs and their associated ototoxicities. Although the side-effects of many antiretroviral drugs are yet to be determined, HIV-infected individuals are often prescribed medications as a prophylaxis or treatment of opportunistic infections that have been long associated with the development of audiological and vestibular changes. Antineoplastic medications such as vincristine, antifungal agents, including amphotericin B, flucytosine and ketoconazole, immune modulators, aminoglycoside antibiotics, erythromycin, and azidothymidine (AZT) are all widely used in the management of HIV and are all reported to be associated with significant ototoxicity or decreased hearing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] These medications are associated with hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Frequently administered medications for <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia (PCP) (Pentamidine, TMP / SMX, Primaquine) may cause tinnitus, vertigo, dizziness, auditory disturbances, deafness, decreased hearing, hearing loss, and otalgia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] Moreover, the use of experimental medications with relatively unknown toxicity as well as the use of ototoxic drugs such as anti-tuberculosis (TB) medications, in combination, adds to the overall effect on hearing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>In South Africa, one of the most frequently administered treatments for the HIV / AIDS population was TB treatment. South Africa, like many sub-Saharan countries, witnessed a dramatic upsurge of TB cases over the past decade.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] This upsurge in the number of TB cases was expected to continue, largely due to co-infection with HIV, with the emergence of drug-resistant TB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] also being reported. This co-occurrence of HIV/AIDS and TB raises serious implications for the audiologist with regard to the possible association between TB treatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART). As some of the drugs used in the treatment of TB fall under the umbrella term &#x02018;aminoglycosides&#x02019;,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] interactions between these treatments need to be explored. Examples of these aminoglycosides include amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, netimicin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, and apramycin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>] These antibiotics are most notorious for being ototoxic, primarily targeting the renal and cochleovestibular system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] This impact of medications on the hearing function are being reported, although not extensively, with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).</p><p>Although a variety of adverse effects have been attributed to treatment with NRTIs for HIV-1 infection, only a small number of cases of ototoxicity have been reported in literature. Simdon reported three subjects who experienced ototoxicity, all of whom were over the age of 45 and received combination ART with two-to-three NRTIs plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI). All three subjects had prior hearing problems, prior exposure to occupational noise, and all developed significant tinnitus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>] Clearly, the presence of these confounding variables (prior hearing loss, noise exposure history, and older age) needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings from these cases. The authors suggest that NRTIs must be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing hearing loss. Again, the ability to generalize these results is limited as they are based on case reports and not on large samples. These authors suggest that reductions in mitochondrial DNA content induced by NRTIs, as well as mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with aging and HIV-1 infection, may all contribute to auditory dysfunction in older patients with HIV-1 infection. They highlight the fact that prospective studies are necessary to determine the incidence of tinnitus and hearing loss among HIV-1-infected patients and their relation to the use of NRTIs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>]</p><p>Several cases of ototoxicity have been reported in HIV-infected patients treated with zalcitabine;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref>] didanosine;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>] zidovudine;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>] and combinations of zidovudine and didanosine;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref>] stavudine and lamivudine;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] stavudine, lamivudine, didanosine, and hydroxyurea;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] and post exposure prophylaxis with stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>] Moreover, a study of 99 HIV-infected individuals who received antiretroviral drugs showed that hearing loss was common in this population. Hearing loss was significantly associated with being 35 or older and with a history of ear infection, and there was a trend toward an association with a documented receipt of therapy with antiretroviral drugs in the preceding six months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref>]</p><p>As illustrated earlier, previous cross-sectional studies and case reports have shown an association between hearing loss and NRTI therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>] There have been two case reports of hearing loss in persons receiving ART regimens that included NRTIs and a second class of antiretroviral drugs; one with an NNRTI (Nevirapine) and one with a PI (lopinavir / ritonavir), each combined with NRTIs, (both these subjects also received stavudine and lamivudine). One case reported sudden hearing loss two weeks subsequent to the person completing one month of post-exposure prophylaxis, which resulted in long-term hearing loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>] The other case described hearing loss in a subject with extensive HIV pre-treatment, which suggested a possible relationship with the protease inhibitor, although there were other possible explanations noted in Simdon&#x02019;s reply to this case report.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT29">29</xref>]</p><p>One should note that not all of the aforementioned studies utilized sensitive ototoxicity monitoring protocols such as ultra-high frequency audiometry and / or otoacoustic emissions. Furthermore, some of these studies did not follow longitudinal research designs either, which could have allowed the researchers to investigate within-subject changes; but they rather followed the cross-sectional methodology designs. In addition, the reports that other factors such as age, drug interactions, concomitant noise exposure, and so on may have an influence on the ototoxicity of ARVs should be taken into consideration when reviewing the effects of ARVs on hearing.</p><p>Although ototoxic hearing loss has been described in HIV-infected people after beginning NRTIs, there have been extremely limited prospective studies, with one published example of a prospective study by Schouten, Lockhart, Rees, Collier, and Marra.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] Hence, there still need to be extensive investigations to clearly establish and confirm this relationship. The study by Schouten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] investigated hearing changes longitudinally in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HIV-infected subjects, following initiation of regimens containing NRTIs. The goal of their study involved performing a prospective assessment of the contribution of zidovudine (ZVD) and didanosine (ddI) to hearing loss. Changes in hearing levels at all frequencies and in low and high frequency pure tone averages were measured at baseline, 16, and 32 weeks after initiating antiretroviral therapy.</p><p>In Schouten <italic>et al.&#x02019;s</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] study, treatment with ZVD and ddI did not result in loss of hearing, even after taking into account noise exposure, immune status, and age. The results of this prospective pilot study did not support the view that treatment with nucleoside antiretroviral drugs, damages hearing. This finding contradicts reports from previous cross-sectional studies and case reports that have indicated that hearing loss may be common among HIV-infected people due to ototoxic drug therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT31">31</xref>] The results of the prospective study by Schouten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] did not corroborate this relationship and are consistent with the report from the Adult / Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Project Group that demonstrated no association between hearing loss and drugs used in the treatment of HIV. Of note, however, the Adult / Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Project Group study was centred on a retrospective chart review for International Classification of Diseases (ICD) - 9 coding for hearing loss and not on a formal audiometry.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>] This represents a significant weakness in the methodology for a study attempting to determine the ototoxic effects, which can be subclinical in nature, hence requiring sensitive audiological monitoring tools.</p><p>There are at least three criticisms that can be leveled against the aforementioned study by Schouten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] First, this study did not incorporate otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) as part of their monitoring battery, and this could have had a significant impact on their results, as OAEs have been shown to be sensitive to cochlear damage in ototoxicity monitoring. Second, only 33 participants were included in their study, a small sample size that significantly reduces the strength of the study in terms of the ability to generalize the findings. Moreover, a small sample size limits the power of this study to detect a difference and also limits the ability to accurately interpret the results. Third, there was no control group, although the researchers did acknowledge that this was a pilot study. To their credit, these authors&#x02019; pure tone testing included 12 kHz, which is an ultrahigh frequency. Ultrahigh frequencies have been reported to be finely tuned to the effect of damaging environmental factors such as noise and ototoxic drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>]</p><p>Replication of studies, such as Schouten <italic>et al.&#x02019;s</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] longitudinal study, in developing countries such as South Africa, may be challenging due to a number of factors. First, the nature of the HIV / AIDS disease and the population being studied may preclude complete control over the confounding variables that could have had an influence on the results such as interactions of ARVs with other therapies; especially traditional medicine in the form of &#x02018;<italic>ubhejane</italic>,&#x02019; which has been reported to be in widespread use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT32">32</xref>] Although, the current researcher is of the opinion that isolating all the possibly contributing confounding variables may provide a more accurate answer, it may not necessarily provide a practical, relevant, and context-sensitive finding. Within the South African AIDS population for example, it may be impossible to find participants who are only exposed to just one strict ARV regimen without any other medications coming into play. Second, securing a decent-sized comparison groups may be difficult, thereby preventing randomized matching of participants in the comparison group with those in the experimental group. Challenges in obtaining large enough sample sizes for control groups may be due to factors such as, attrition, on account of patients commencing treatment during the study as well as loss to follow-up. Third, ultra-high frequency audiometry, which does not form part of the routine audiological test battery, may influence the type of results found; and this may result in the clinical changes in the ultrahigh frequencies depicted on the audiogram being entirely missed. Finally, the length of time for which audiological monitoring occurred may be too short, due to attrition, to allow for the clinical hearing loss possibly caused by ART to manifest and therefore be detected on the audiogram.</p><p>Nevertheless, such longitudinal studies of patients on various regimens of ARVs need to be conducted. These need to be carried out in order to determine if any hearing changes occur during the period when the patients receive ARVs. Both clinically significant and statistically significant changes need to be investigated, as the presence of statistically significant changes does not necessarily translate to clinically significant findings. It is also critical that measures such as DPOAEs, which are sensitive to microcochlear changes, form part of the methodologies employed, as DPOAEs have been shown to be superior to pure tone audiometry in this regard;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT33">33</xref>] hence the current study, which aims to monitor the auditory status in a group of adults with AIDS receiving HAART (lamivudine, stavudine, and efavirenz), in a hospital outpatient clinic, in Gauteng.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Research, aims, and objectives</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Primary aim</title><p>The primary aim is to monitor the auditory status in a group of adults with AIDS receiving HAART (lamivudine, stavudine, and efavirenz), in a hospital outpatient clinic, in Gauteng.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Specific objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To longitudinally assess hearing function in AIDS-infected adults on HAART (experimental group);</p></list-item><list-item><p>To longitudinally assess hearing function in AIDS-infected adults not on HAART (comparison group);</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare the results of the experimental group with those of the comparison group;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To analyze the hearing function in the group of adults with subclinical hearing loss.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The null hypothesis was that the participants&#x02019; hearing function before and after antiretroviral drug-use would remain the same.

The design utilized was a repeated measures, quasi-experimental design, with pre- and post-treatment testing, and a control group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT37">37</xref>] A quasi-experimental design was reported to be the best design where there were practical and ethical barriers to conducting randomized controlled trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT38">38</xref>] In the current study, although there was manipulation of the independent variables (the antiretroviral drugs) and a control group, there was no random allocation of participants, which led to the study being quasi-experimental instead of experimental in nature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT34">34</xref>]</p><p>The antiretroviral medications and other therapies were the independent variables, with the audiological measures (otoscopy, impedance audiometry, pure tone audiometry, otoacoustic emissions) featuring as dependent variables. The aim was to investigate and monitor the auditory status in a group of adult patients with AIDS receiving ART and other therapies before and during antiretroviral treatment &#x02014; with measures taken before commencement of ARVs, three months after initiation of treatment, and six months into therapy. All of the objectives were examined at baseline (before initiation of ARVs) and with repeated measures (three and six months into treatment) for both the control and experimental group. A comparison of results of the control group and experimental group was done for all objectives.</p><p>One methodological limitation of the current study was related to the time when the last measure was carried out (six months after treatment).

Furthermore, the clinical significance of the findings was also analyzed.</p><p>First, a statistical comparison was done, basing the results on the average change from the baseline. Each frequency&#x02019;s mean change from the baseline for the ears, individually, was computed and then combined for both pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Repeated-measures analysis of variance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT34">34</xref>] was used to compare the mean change from the baseline for the control group and the experimental group, from session to session. In the analysis of the DPOAE data, the baseline DPOAE levels in decibels SPL for each f2 value tested were compared with the corresponding measurements in sessions 2 and 3. The signal-to-noise difference was used as the measure of DPOAE amplitudes. For pure tone audiometry data, the baseline thresholds in decibels HL for each frequency were compared with the corresponding results in sessions 2 and 3 as well.

This early onset of symptoms (although subclinical) again highlights the need for early involvement of the audiologist in the assessment and management of patients with AIDS. Findings from the <italic>subclinical hearing loss</italic> group further illustrate that subtle subclinical changes can only be identified by DPOAEs and not pure tone audiometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> depicts the findings of 45 participants who presented with normal pure tone audiometry results, but showed significant changes on DPOAEs over the three testing sessions.</p><fig id="F0005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mean bilateral DPOAE results (in dBSL) and their standard deviations for the group with normal PTA at the three different sessions (n=90 ears)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-3-142-g005"/></fig><p>The presence of DPOAE changes indicating subclinical changes in hearing status suggested hearing loss that could have possibly been due to medications used by the participants in the experimental group (lamivudine, stavudine, and efavirenz).

However, the current researcher is of the opinion that isolating all the possible contributing confounding variables may provide a more accurate answer, but may not necessarily provide a practical, relevant, and context-sensitive finding. Within the South African AIDS population, it may be impossible to find participants who are only exposed to just one strict ARV regimen without any other medications coming into play. The results of this study are felt to be valuable and applicable to the South African context, and may provide more realistic and context-specific implications; those that are needed for establishment and implementation of ototoxicity monitoring protocols as part of the routine clinical management of adults with HIV / AIDS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>This study displays and highlights an expanded role of the audiologist in Food and Drug Administration processes of drug development, drug approval, and drug monitoring. The sub-clinical hearing changes (cochlea function changes detected before the hearing loss is seen on an audiogram) highlight the importance of DPOAEs in ototoxicity monitoring studies.This research also demonstrates the important role that the audiologist may have in both the assessment and treatment of patients with HIV / AIDS. Finally, implications raised by the current study can be translated into recommendations for the clinical assessment and management of patients with HIV / AIDS who are taking ARVs; education of team members; policy formulation; as well as further research.</p><p>Medical awareness of ARV doses, forms of administration, populationsat risk, and possible synergism with other factors is necessary to developappropriate care in the prescription of drugs with possible or established ototoxicside effects. Furthermore, issues such as risk-benefitanalysis, patient-informed consent, and quality-of-life considerations, are also crucial factors to beconsidered in the management of patients with HIV / AIDS. Regardless of whether the effects of the drug are negligible or not, these effects still need to be determined so that proper patient adherence counseling can take place. It is fundamental that audiologists establish and become aware of the ototoxic effects of medications used to manage chronic conditions such as HIV / AIDS, as also medications prescribed to significant numbers of people - such as 11% of the population afflicted by HIV / AIDS in South Africa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT51">51</xref>] This awareness is critical, to ensure that proper patient education occurs, as patients may not notice ototoxic hearing loss until a communication problem becomes evident, signifying that hearing loss within the frequency range, which is vital for understanding speech, has already occurred. Likewise, by the time the patient complains of dizziness, permanent vestibular system damage may have already occurred.</p><p>Clinically used drugs and chemical agents may potentially causeadverse effects to the human auditory and vestibular systems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT52">52</xref>] Many of these drugs can playa critical role in the treatment of serious or life-threateningdiseases. others offersuch important therapeutic effects compared to the ototoxicside effects that the ototoxicity risk can be considered tobe of minor importance, and such may be the case with HIV / AIDS (a sentiment echoed by some physicians). The problem of ototoxic side effectsis reported to be more critical in developing countries, where highly effectiveand low-cost drugs are more easily prescribed without adequatemonitoring.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT53">53</xref>] It is possible that such a situation may exist in some parts of Africa, particularly with the high numbers of patients on treatment for HIV / AIDS. An additional concern in the management of HIV / AIDS patients, who may be on potentially ototoxic medication without being audiologically monitored, is that noise exposure following treatment with ototoxic drugs can act synergistically with the drugs that have not been fully cleared from the inner ear.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT54">54</xref>] Increased susceptibility to hearing loss can continue for several months after completion of treatment or therapy. Due to this likelihood, it is imperative to implement hearing conservation in the form of advising patients to avoid excessive noise exposure for at least six months. In addition, patients who use amplification in the form of hearing aids may need to be counseled and warned to closely monitor and control the hearing aid maximum output during this critical time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT55">55</xref>] Given this scenario, it seems more pressing than ever to endeavor to prevent or ameliorate the possible ototoxic hearing loss in this population, by ensuring ototoxicity monitoring as part of the routine clinical management; particularly as the treatment regimen is varied and the WHO ART guidelines continue to be modified, as some drugs get phased out, such as the recent suggestion by WHO ART to phase out d4T.</p><p>When life-threatening illness necessitates treatment with ototoxic drugs, preserving the quality of the patients&#x02019; remaining life is customarily a treatment goal. Early detection of ototoxic hearing loss provides physicians with critical information and the opportunity necessary to minimize further impairment, and in some cases, prevent hearing loss from progressing to the point where permanent damage occurs. Although hearing loss is not regarded as a life-threatening condition, it does become a severe threat to the essential quality of life indicators unless intervention occurs early during treatment. The adverse effects of hearing loss on cognitive-linguistic skills and psychosocial behavior are well documented, as also the serious vocational, social, and interpersonal consequences for the patient.</p><p>Findings of the current study, although important, should be interpreted after taking the identified methodological limitations into account. The main limitations of the current study included, first, the nature of the HIV / AIDS disease and the population being studied precluded complete control over the confounding variables, which could have had an influence on the results such as interactions of ARVs with other therapies; especially traditional medicine in the form of &#x02018;<italic>ubhejane</italic>,&#x02019; which has been reported to be in widespread use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT32">32</xref>] Second, the sample size for the comparison group was small, thereby preventing randomized matching of participants in the comparison group with those in the experimental group. The small sample size of the comparison group was due to factors such as attrition, due to patients commencing treatment during the study, as well as loss to follow-up. Third, ultra-high frequency audiometry did not form part of the test battery and this may have influenced the type of results found, in that, clinical changes in the ultra-high frequencies depicted on the audiogram could have been missed. Finally, the length of time for which audiological monitoring occurred (six months) may have been too short to allow the clinical hearing loss, possibly caused by ART, to manifest, and therefore, be detected on the audiogram. Nevertheless, findings do justify an intense pursuit of the answer to the question: Does HAART <italic>sound toxic?</italic></p><p>The known effects of HIV / AIDS on the auditory system that have been reported in the literature are mainly based on cross-sectional studies and case reports conducted internationally in industrialized countries, with very limited information coming from third world countries where the presentation of the virus and its treatments may be different. Furthermore, because this evidence may not be viewed to be contextually relevant to the developing world, its incorporation into routine clinical assessment and management lags behind significantly. Hence, the need for categorizing the ototoxic effects of HIV / AIDS treatment, in an effort to ensure that ototoxicity monitoring protocols are established and implemented as part of the routine clinical management among infected patients. Research in ototoxicity in HIV / AIDS needs to be locally relevant, should include large sample sizes and longitudinal follow-up of cases, and should also utilize sensitive audiological test measures to improve the validity and reliability of the findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
