with infrequent attacks are currently
not treated with migrainespecific
medication such as triptans.
The response of these
patients to triptans is unknown.
The objective of this study was to
investigate the efficacy and tolerability
of sumatriptan 50 mg vs.
placebo in migraine patents with
infrequent migraine attacks when
medication is taken during the
mild phase of an attack. The study
design was double-blind, placebocontrolled,
parallel-group and randomised.
Migraine patients were
recruited by general practitioners
and referred to one of 4 study centres.
Additional patients were
recruited by advertising. The
patients were eligible for the
study if they had between 6 and
12 migraine attacks with or without
aura per year. The patients
were instructed to take the medication
during the mild phase of a
single attack. The primary efficacy
measure was the percentage of
patients pain-free after 2 h. Fortysix
percent of treated attacks were
moderate or severe. In the intention-to-treat analysis, sumatriptan
was superior (20/51 patients were
pain-free) to placebo (8/47
patients pain-free) (<italic>p</italic>=0.03).
Adverse events (AEs) occurred
more frequently after sumatriptan
(40%) than after placebo (13%)
(<italic>p</italic>=0.003) and most AEs were
mild or moderate. In this migraine
population with infrequent
attacks, sumatriptan was superior
to placebo and was generally well
tolerated.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Sumatriptan</kwd><kwd>Mild phase</kwd><kwd>Controlled clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Italia 2006</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
