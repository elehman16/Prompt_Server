Insulin resistance is associated with higher breast cancer (BC) penetrance in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), an insulin resistance syndrome, can be reversed by adhering to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). In a dietary intervention trial on <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers, we evaluated adherence to the MedDiet, and the association with the MetS, by analyzing data from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). <italic>Methods. BRCA</italic> mutation carriers, with or without BC, aged 18 to 70 years, were eligible for the trial. After the baseline examinations, women were randomized to a dietary intervention or to a control group. Both groups completed the MEDAS at baseline and at the end of the dietary intervention. <italic>Results</italic>. A total of 163 women completed the 6 months of dietary intervention. Compared with controls, the women in the intervention group significantly reduced their consumption of red meat (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) and commercial sweets (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) and their MEDAS score rose significantly (+1.3 vs +0.55, <italic>P</italic> = .02). The number of MetS parameters decreased with increasing points of adherence to the MEDAS score (<italic>P</italic> = .01). In the intervention group, there was a significant association with the greater reduction of MetS. <italic>Conclusion. BRCA</italic> mutation carriers in the intervention group experienced greater improvement in their MedDiet and MetS parameters.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>metabolic syndrome</kwd><kwd>Mediterranean diet</kwd><kwd><italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers</kwd><kwd>dietary intervention trial</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1534735417721015"><funding-source id="funding1-1534735417721015"><institution-wrap><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1534735417721015">GR-2010-2310116</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award2-1534735417721015"><funding-source id="funding2-1534735417721015"><institution-wrap><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding2-1534735417721015">IG-2015-17151</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735417721015"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lifestyle factors linked to insulin resistance such as high serum levels of insulin and IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor&#x02013;I), abdominal adiposity, high energy intake, milk consumption, and low levels of physical activity have been associated with higher penetrance of breast cancer (BC) in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The metabolic syndrome (MetS), an insulin resistance syndrome, is defined as a clustering of risk factors of metabolic origin, such as abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and high fasting glycemia.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The etiology of MetS is considered to involve a complex interaction between genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> MetS increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr9-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and several cancers, including BC.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Postmenopausal status is associated with a 60% increase in the risk of MetS.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Antihormonal treatments for BC and/or risk-reducing surgery (prophylactic adnexectomy) may affect the risk of MetS in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers.

We therefore designed a demonstration project to examine whether a dietary intervention, emphasizing the Mediterranean diet, leads to a reduction of IGF-I and other markers of insulin resistance (randomized trial) and to investigate whether the intervention leads to a reduction of BC incidence and BC mortality in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (prospective cohort study).</p><p>The preliminary findings from the MEDAS questionnaires suggest that women in the intervention group showed substantial improvement in most of the indicators of the MedDiet and significantly raised their MEDAS score, by 1.3.

The control group also showed some improvement in the indicators of the MedDiet. The public awareness and the easy access to information about the benefits of the MedDiet led to the control group making some adjustments just to be on the safe side (the drop-in effect). Furthermore, this &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d; was expected by design, because at baseline all women received the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR0 recommendations for cancer prevention<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and the central recommendation of the WCRF/AICR is also the basic characteristic of the MedDiet (&#x0201c;Eat mostly food of plant origin, with a variety of non-starchy vegetables and of fruit every day and with unprocessed cereals and/or pulses within every meal&#x0201d;). These recommendations and the participants&#x02019; vigorous motivation probably resulted in changes in the dietary habits of control women too and reduced the potential overall result.</p><p>MetS is an insulin resistance syndrome. A recent study showed that <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers with BC more frequently develop type-2 diabetes.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> This is an interesting point because it suggests that the prediabetic condition, when insulin is typically very high, facilitates the development of mammary tumors in carriers of the <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation. MetS can be reversed by adhering to the MedDiet, with a reduction in its prevalence of up to 69% after 2 years of diet.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr18-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Our diet and androgen (DIANA) randomized controlled trials showed that an insulin-lowering diet based on traditional Mediterranean and macrobiotic recipes significantly reduced the main factors defining the MetS, body weight, and the bioavailability of sex hormones and IGF-I, in healthy postmenopausal<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and in women with BC.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>This is the first dietary intervention trial based on the MedDiet and macrobiotic recipes in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers. We previously showed that women in the intervention group had significantly lower serum levels of IGF-I and a better IGF-I/IGFBP3 ratio (unpublished data). These results also suggest an inverse relation between the MetS parameters and adherence to the MedDiet. Compared with women whose MEDAS score did not change or got worse, women whose score improved achieved a greater reduction of the MetS factors. This reduction slightly increased on increasing the points of adherence to the MEDAS score. In our population, the prevalence of MetS at baseline was fairly low (12%) and, as expected, the metabolic disorders were more prevalent in women in menopause. However, the reduction of the number of MetS factors was not influenced by menopausal status but was significantly related to the randomization group (dietary intervention) and to improvement of the MEDAS score.</p><p>These findings, though encouraging, are still based on small numbers. Another prospective randomized controlled trial in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers is currently running, to demonstrate improvements in nutritional behavior (adherence to the Mediterranean diet), BMI, and physical fitness in the mutation carriers in the intervention group.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Both studies will assess the role of a lifestyle intervention program in a cohort of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers. A recent prospective study evaluated the impact of adherence to the prevention recommendations of the American Cancer Society on overall mortality in a high genetic risk population. Adherence to all 3 prevention recommendations (do at least 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous exercise/week, do not drink or drink at most one glass of alcoholic drink/day, keep your body mass index lower than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was associated with a 44% reduction of mortality in high-risk healthy women and 53% in women already suffering from BC.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1534735417721015" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Therefore, although one cannot overstate the importance of surgery and/or chemoprevention, along with surveillance for BRCA mutation carriers, we think that there is a need to be able to offer recommendations to women regarding lifestyle choices. It is conceivable that interventions to control body weight and insulin resistance or increase physical activity may help decrease cancer risk particularly among women who are not opting to undergo prophylactic surgery or who are delaying surgery. This is particularly relevant in the context of genetic counselling, where the counsellor has the potential to significantly affect women&#x02019;s prevention options, specifically among those who opt to not undergo surgery or chemoprevention.</p><p>With structured exercise and dietary adaptations, mutation carriers will be able to play an independent role in cancer prevention, which will help reinforce their self-management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section9-1534735417721015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first dietary intervention trial based on the MedDiet and macrobiotic recipes in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers.
