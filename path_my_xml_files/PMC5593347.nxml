Bronchial thermoplasty is a nonpharmacological, endoscopic treatment for subjects aged &#x02265;18&#x02005;years with severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting &#x003b2;-agonists (LABAs). During the bronchial thermoplasty procedure, radiofrequency energy is used to heat the airway walls in a controlled manner. The mechanism of action is, in part, a lasting reduction in airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass due to the heat produced during the procedure [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This effect was demonstrated in dogs in the 1980s [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in humans more recently in four clinical reports that demonstrated this reduction in ASM in biopsy samples taken from small numbers of subjects with asthma who underwent bronchial thermoplasty [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One of these studies reported that the reduction in ASM was still apparent in all nine subjects who consented to a second bronchoscopy and biopsy at least 24&#x02005;months after bronchial thermoplasty [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The reduction in ASM is associated with clinical improvements seen in subjects undergoing bronchial thermoplasty [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Histopathological changes other than ASM reduction have also been demonstrated (<italic>e.g.</italic> a decrease in the thickness of the reticular basement membrane due to reduced collagen type I deposition has also been shown in these clinical studies). Additional mechanisms of action may also contribute to symptom reduction, including structural effects on neuroendocrine epithelial cells and bronchial nerve endings [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Future studies may help to further define these mechanisms [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Several randomised controlled clinical trials of bronchial thermoplasty, such as the AIR2 (Asthma Intervention Research 2) trial and others, have shown significantly improved clinical outcomes and relative safety in subjects who underwent bronchial thermoplasty [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to these randomised controlled trials, open-label studies including the PAS2 (Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating Bronchial Thermoplasty in Severe Persistent Asthma) study are ongoing to confirm the safety and efficacy of bronchial thermoplasty when performed in clinical practice [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The pivotal AIR2 trial was a randomised sham-controlled trial of the Alair system in subjects with severe persistent asthma. This trial demonstrated that over a 12-month follow-up period after bronchial thermoplasty treatment, bronchial thermoplasty-treated subjects experienced clinically relevant improvements. Specifically, subjects in this study reported improved Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores and reductions in the number of severe asthma exacerbations they experienced after bronchial thermoplasty. These improvements persisted through 5&#x02005;years of follow-up. The detailed methods and results from the AIR2 trial are described by W<sc>echsler</sc>

Subsequently, the PAS2 study was initiated in fulfilment of FDA requirements for pre-market approval. Here, we describe an interim analysis of accumulating data for the first 190 subjects enrolled in the PAS2 study and compare the 3-year follow-up data with the results obtained in subjects from the pivotal AIR2 trial at the same time-point.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The PAS2 study was designed to demonstrate the short- and long-term treatment effectiveness and the safety profile of the Alair system in clinical practice.

Subjects were also contacted by phone every 3&#x02005;months between annual office visits. During each phone call and at each office visit, information from each subject about adverse events experienced, maintenance asthma medications, severe exacerbations, emergency department visits for asthma symptoms and hospitalisations for asthma symptoms was solicited using a standardised, structured interview questionnaire.

Alternative management strategies for these subjects are required in order to improve their quality of life. Bronchial thermoplasty represents a nonpharmacological strategy that may assist in the management of these subjects, but while the data from several large clinical trials of bronchial thermoplasty (including the AIR, AIR2 and RISA (Research in Severe Asthma) trials [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) indicate that the procedure is safe and effective, subjects enrolled in clinical trials are not representative of the most severe asthma cases seen in &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; clinical practice due to strict study eligibility criteria. Thus, available information on the safety and efficacy of bronchial thermoplasty in these most severe asthmatic subjects is limited. A few recent publications have reported on a limited number of severe asthmatic subjects and have indicated clinical improvement after bronchial thermoplasty in these subjects as well as acceptable rates of adverse events [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, B<sc>urn</sc>
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. [<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported on subjects undergoing bronchial thermoplasty between 2011 and 2015 in the UK that were included in the Difficult Asthma Registry and the Hospital Episode Statistics database in order to obtain data on true &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; bronchial thermoplasty cases. They concluded that these subjects were on average older with worse baseline lung function and quality of life, and that after bronchial thermoplasty, more of these subjects experienced adverse events compared with previous clinical trials but that more data was required.</p><p>The AIR2 trial and PAS2 study described here are two of the largest studies to date of the Alair system for bronchial thermoplasty. Both studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of bronchial thermoplasty as well as durability of treatment and procedural safety in subjects with poorly controlled asthma who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the current standard of care. The eligibility criteria for the PAS2 study were largely the same as those used for the AIR2 trial as reported by C<sc>astro</sc>
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], with a few important exceptions. Subjects in the AIR2 trial were required to be using LABAs at higher dosages than PAS2 subjects. Moreover, in the AIR2 trial, subjects were required to have a provocative concentration reducing FEV<sub>1</sub> by 20% from baseline &#x0003c;8&#x02005;mg&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per methacholine inhalation test, whereas no methacholine inhalation test was required for PAS2 subjects. AIR2 subjects could not be enrolled in the study if they had known systemic hypersensitivity or contraindication to methacholine chloride or other parasympathomimetic agents. Additionally, subjects with more comorbidities were allowed to enter the PAS2 study. These comorbidities included insulin-dependent diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiac dysfunction, interstitial lung disease, chronic sinus disease, uncontrolled gastro-oesophageal reflux, epilepsy and known coagulopathy. These study entry criteria make the PAS2 study particularly important, because it is the first large-scale, prospective study performed in a post-market setting to validate previous clinical trial results in a population of subjects with severe asthma that are being managed in clinical practice. We acknowledge that the study entry criteria for PAS2 have some restrictions and thus the most severe asthma subjects seen in clinical practice were not included in the PAS2 study. However, recent studies have reported on subjects that were even more severe than those enrolled in PAS2, suggesting that bronchial thermoplasty improves asthma control across the spectrum of severe uncontrolled asthmatic subjects [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The PAS2 study data presented a unique opportunity to gain insight into the safety and effectiveness of bronchial thermoplasty in subjects that may have had poorer asthma control at baseline than those included in previous clinical trials, such as AIR2. Therefore, we performed an analysis on the first 190 enrolled PAS2 subjects when a comparable number of them (n=168) reached the 3-year follow-up visit, so that a comparison between these PAS2 subjects and the subjects from the AIR2 randomised controlled trial, in which 190 subjects were enrolled and 165 reached a 3-year follow-up visit, could be made. Indeed, the PAS2 results presented here confirm the findings from the AIR2 trial [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Specifically, the PAS2 study validates the AIR2 trial results showing that bronchial thermoplasty is a safe procedure, and that it significantly reduces steroid exacerbations, emergency department visits and hospitalisations in severe asthmatic subjects compared with the 12&#x02005;months before bronchial thermoplasty treatment. For example, 76.5% of the PAS2 study subjects who had at least one severe exacerbation during the 12&#x02005;months preceding their bronchial thermoplasty treatment experienced a decrease of at least one severe exacerbation per year by year&#x02005;3 after bronchial thermoplasty. This was similar to the reduction in severe exacerbation rates reported in AIR2.</p><p>The PAS2 study data also contain some important differences from the AIR2 trial. Differences in baseline demographics and clinical correlates in the 12&#x02005;months prior to bronchial thermoplasty indicate that the PAS2 subjects may have more severe asthma than the bronchial thermoplasty subjects enrolled in the AIR2 trial. They also have more comorbidities associated with higher BMI and older age, particularly cardiovascular disease. The PAS2 subjects also have a higher incidence of chronic sinus disease. However, more AIR2 subjects than PAS2 subjects had dermatological comorbidities (supplementary table S10). Despite this, the PAS2 subjects may indeed resemble &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; bronchial thermoplasty patients more closely. The PAS2 study data contribute to the body of literature that supports the safety and efficacy of bronchial thermoplasty in &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; populations. In terms of adverse events, the PAS2 study did show increases in both severe exacerbations and emergency department visits during the treatment period compared with the AIR2 trial. This could be due to a higher risk for more severe events in this population or because these subjects with more comorbidities have a lower threshold for healthcare utilisation.</p><p>Importantly, the PAS2 data suggest that the treatment effect of bronchial thermoplasty is both consistent and durable even in this population of subjects with poorly controlled asthma who may have associated comorbidities and more severe asthma. There was a continual improvement in asthma control during the first 3&#x02005;years after bronchial thermoplasty treatment. Despite the improvements in these clinical correlates, there appears to be no difference in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> over the 3&#x02005;years of follow-up in the PAS2 study. This observation is consistent with that seen in the AIR2 trial, as well as with other reports on the use of bronchial thermoplasty in severe asthmatic subjects [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This is a reassuring observation and adds to the data indicating that over the long-term, bronchial thermoplasty does not adversely affect lung function.</p><p>Even though the PAS2 study may have included subjects that likely had more severe asthma compared with those included in AIR2, study subjects receiving bronchial thermoplasty have reduced their medication usage in the 3&#x02005;years following treatment. There was a durable reduction in ICS usage at the 3-year follow-up. Moreover, even in PAS2 subjects with poorer asthma control, the percentage of subjects on daily maintenance OCSs significantly decreased after bronchial thermoplasty. OCS dosage for those subjects who remained on maintenance OCSs did not decrease, however, possibly due to the low initial dosage (OCS &#x02264;10&#x02005;mg&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) mandated at inclusion. This apparent reduction in the percentage of subjects taking daily maintenance OCSs is encouraging, because daily OCS use is associated with significant side-effects, including the development of obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis. Thus, identification of a treatment such as bronchial thermoplasty that allows a decrease in steroid exposure in severe asthmatic subjects will result in improved patient experiences and outcomes.</p><p>This work does have several important limitations. First, geographical differences in the locations of the investigational sites varied between the PAS2 study, which included subjects from North America only, and the AIR2 trial, which was more global and included patients from North America, Europe, Brazil and Australia. These geographic differences might have had an impact on the subject characteristics and comorbidities seen in each study. Second, as the PAS2 subjects are being followed for 5&#x02005;years after bronchial thermoplasty, this article contains data on only a subgroup of subjects included in the study who have completed 3&#x02005;years of follow-up. Additional analysis of the entire cohort at 3 and 5&#x02005;years may further validate our observations, thus far consistent with the results of the AIR2 randomised controlled trial. The analysis is further limited by differences between the PAS2 study and AIR2 trial. Due to its follow-up schedule, the PAS2 study collected AQLQ data only at baseline and not at the post-procedure follow-up visits due to concerns over the ability of this tool to reliably capture asthma-related quality of life when only collected once annually. Therefore, we were unable to include this measure in our analysis. Also, the PAS2 study and AIR2 trial used slightly different definitions of severe asthma exacerbations, although a <italic>post hoc</italic> evaluation for these definition differences showed a difference of only one severe exacerbation. Moreover, the indirect comparison between the randomised AIR2 trial and the single-arm PAS2 study may be limited by cross-trial differences we failed to identify in our analysis. Finally, further subgroup analysis is needed help identify which asthma subjects are most likely to benefit from the bronchial thermoplasty procedure in the &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d;. This would benefit asthma subjects currently not well managed with optimised pharmacological therapeutic treatment options.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PAS2 study subjects described in this article appear to be slightly sicker than the subjects in the AIR2 trial based on baseline characteristics. The PAS2 study shows, similar to the AIR2 trial, that bronchial thermoplasty is safe and that subjects have markedly lower rates of steroid exacerbations, hospitalisations and emergency department visits at 3&#x02005;years after bronchial thermoplasty compared with the 12&#x02005;months prior to bronchial thermoplasty treatment, and that the treatment effect is consistent and durable. The study subjects also sustainably reduced their asthma medication, including complete discontinuation of maintenance OCSs for a significant number of subjects. Notably, the PAS2 study is a prospective nonrandomised clinical study, and comparing its results to a randomised controlled trial is challenging due to potential for exogenous bias and confounding factors outside those baseline demographics and clinical characteristics measured. Notwithstanding these caveats, this study offers useful results to clinicians convinced of the efficacy of bronchial thermoplasty within the confines of a randomised controlled trial, but who questioned its &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; clinical benefits. Although the prospectively enrolled PAS2 study population in this article is described as &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d;, the study eligibility criteria mean that the most severe subjects often seen in clinical practice were not included. Nevertheless, the 3-year results from this subset of subjects in the PAS2 study inspire confidence, because they suggest that the &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; results obtained after bronchial thermoplasty in the PAS2 study echo those observed in the AIR2 randomised controlled trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supplementary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/13993003.00017-2017.Supp1</object-id><p><bold>Please note:</bold> supplementary material is not edited by the Editorial Office, and is uploaded as it has been supplied by the author.</p><p>Supplementary material <inline-supplementary-material id="SS1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ERJ-00017-2017_Supplement.pdf" content-type="local-data">ERJ-00017-2017_Supplement</inline-supplementary-material></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Disclosures</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="disclosures"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/13993003.00017-2017.Supp2</object-id><p>S.
