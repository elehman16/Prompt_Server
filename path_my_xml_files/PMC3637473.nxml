An educational exercise in dose calculation was therefore undertaken.</p><p>Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is defined as a continuous or recurrent convulsive seizure with loss of consciousness lasting 30&#x02009;minutes or more, or a cluster of repeated convulsions during which consciousness is not regained, lasting 30&#x02009;minutes or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CSE in childhood constitutes a medical emergency as it is a life threatening condition with serious risk of neurological squelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, the longer the duration of the episode, the more difficult it is to terminate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Data from epidemiological studies suggest that four to eight children per 1000 may be expected to experience an episode of CSE before the age of 15&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and in children with first seizures, 12% present with CSE as their first unprovoked seizure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. CSE in children has a mortality of approximately 4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The 2000 guideline by the &#x02018;Status Epilepticus Working Party&#x02019; for treating and preventing status epilepticus by treating prolonged convulsive seizures (lasting more that 5 or 10&#x02009;minutes) in children in the UK, advised infusion of 18&#x02009;mg/kg of Phenytoin by slow intravenous (<italic>iv</italic>) infusion over 20&#x02009;minutes as a third line treatment if other treatments (generally benzodiazepines) had failed to control the seizure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, there is little agreement between hospital protocols when treating CSE in children globally, and it is well known that many hospitals in the UK and in North America use 20&#x02009;mg/kg dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to test medical students, trainees and consultant doctors as part of an educational exercise in dose calculation, and see if it is easier and less prone to error to calculate a dose of 20&#x02009;mg/kg rather than 18&#x02009;mg/kg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A standard question paper was prepared, comprising five clinical scenarios with children of varying ages and estimated body weights.

It is estimated that the true incidence of paediatric dosing errors could be approximately 500,000 per year in England. There is, therefore, an urgent need to minimise such errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Published literature confirms that some healthcare professionals have difficulty calculating correct doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Phenytoin is one of the most effective drugs for treating acute convulsive seizures, whether primarily or secondarily generalised, and status epilepticus. The main advantage of Phenytoin is the relative lack of sedating effect. However, it is considered one of the medicines most commonly responsible for dosing errors in childhood by the Royal College Paediatrics and Child Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Historically, doses quoted for <italic>iv</italic> Phenytoin and Phenobarbitone range from 15&#x02013;20&#x02009;mg/kg. The guidelines already recommend 20&#x02009;mg/kg as the dose for <italic>iv</italic> Phenobarbitone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The difference between 20&#x02009;mg/kg and 18&#x02009;mg/kg, 2&#x02009;mg/kg is 11.1% of 18&#x02009;mg/kg. This is relatively small. The 18&#x02009;mg/kg dose was first published to our knowledge in the paper by David M. Treiman <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This report does not justify their choice of 18&#x02009;mg/kg over 20&#x02009;mg/kg. We feel it implausible that such a small increase in the dose would have an overall pharmacological effect in this population, especially as the child&#x02019;s weight is often estimated rather than measured as it is a medical emergency and they are convulsing, which makes weighing them impractical. We feel that a randomised controlled trial would be too costly and cumbersome for such a minor difference in dose, but that routine surveillance (clinical audit) would be useful to compare 18&#x02009;mg/kg and 20&#x02009;mg/kg as used in different units. At least major adverse events would be recorded this way.</p><p>We contacted Pfizer pharmaceutical company which now owns Parke-Davis who initially marketed EPANUTIN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (phenytoin sodium). According to Pfizer the dose of 18&#x02009;mg/kg quoted was derived from numerous clinical pharmacology studies (dose response studies) along with safety data from their phase 3 clinical programme.</p><p>Intravenous Phenytoin infusion can sometimes cause adverse cardiovascular effects, including bradycardia or hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; hence in children the infusion rate should not exceed 1&#x02009;mg/kg/min and should be administered with cardiac monitoring.</p><p>It is well known that many hospitals&#x02019; local guidelines advocate 20&#x02009;mg/kg for <italic>iv</italic> Phenytoin for the management of children with prolonged seizures. To the best of our knowledge there have been no reports suggesting an increased risk of adverse effects with the 20&#x02009;mg/kg dose compared with 18&#x02009;mg/kg dose.</p><p>For this educational exercise, only calculation errors greater than 10% different from the correct dose were counted as significant errors.</p><p>The significant error rate was considerably lower and the speed much quicker for calculating 20&#x02009;mg/kg dose when compared with the current recommended dose 18&#x02009;mg/kg dose, without a calculator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The exercise demonstrated that doctors and medical students will make errors in simple dose calculations in at best 0.3-1% of calculations even with a calculator. These errors may be higher in the real life scenarios as managing status epilepticus is a medical emergency which can be stressful, making us more prone for errors. This underlines the importance of checking all dose calculations. The longer time taken to calculate 18&#x02009;mg/kg than 20&#x02009;mg/kg reflects the increased difficulty of the calculation without an electronic calculator, and while many doctors and nurses in emergency health care settings have their personal calculators to hand, when a calculator is not immediately to hand, trying to find one will add to delays and stress. Furthermore, it is good practice when using a calculator to mentally check the result to see if it is &#x0201c;ball-park&#x0201d; correct, in case of a typing error, such as a misplaced decimal point that could lead to a ten-fold dosing error.</p><p>We propose that new status epilepticus guidelines should make an attempt to minimise <italic>iv</italic> Phenytoin dose calculation difficulties and minimise the risk of errors and therefore recommend 20&#x02009;mg/kg.</p><p>In the latest edition of &#x02018;Advanced Paediatric Life Support&#x02019;, the status epilepticus algorithm now advises 20&#x02009;mg/kg <italic>iv</italic> Phenytoin, replacing the previously recommended dose of 18&#x02009;mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Medication errors are common and children are at particular risk. We recommend <italic>iv</italic> Phenytoin at 20&#x02009;mg/kg rather than 18&#x02009;mg/kg. This will make the calculation easier and reduce the risk of significant errors. Ease of dose calculation without an electronic calculator should be taken into account when making recommendations for drug doses in children, especially those to be used in emergency situations.
