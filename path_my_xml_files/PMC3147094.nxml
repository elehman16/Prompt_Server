They are intended to be dissolved or dispersed in water before use. It generally contains, in addition to active ingredients, a mixture of acids / acid salts (citric acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid or any other suitable acid or acid anhydride), and carbonate and hydrogen carbonates (sodium, potassium or any other suitable alkali metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate), which release CO<sub>2</sub> when mixed with water. The advantage of the effervescent tablets as a dosage form is that it provides a means of extemporaneously preparing a solution containing an accurate drug dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Aspirin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] is a new generation non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, which is widely used as an analgesic. As its major adverse drug reactions are peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and its biological half-life is equal to 30 minutes,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] effervescent tablets could be preferred over the conventional tablets of aspirin because conventional tablets have many side effects. Therefore, aspirin is considered for effervescent drug release. The aim of the present study is to prepare and compare the bioavailability of citric acid based effervescent tablet with the malonic-acid based effervescent tablet.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Aspirin, the internal standard was generously donated by Ranbaxy Pvt.

Dissolution studies were carried out on the formulation containing citric acid as an effervescent excipient and compared with malonic acid as an effervescent excipient, in 900 ml dissolution medium (pH 7.2 phosphate buffer). The dissolution media was maintained at 37&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0; and stirred at 50 rpm. Drug releases from the formulations were determined by withdrawing 5 ml of sample using a guarded pipette. Samples were taken at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes and replaced by fresh medium. Release studieswere carried out in triplicate. The drug release from Products A and B was calculated using the standard drug release equations, and then compared with each other.</p><p>The effect of aging on drug release studies were carried out on Products A and B, which were stored in a dessicator at 25&#x000b0; and 11% relative humidity, for a period of eight weeks.

Ten healthy adult rabbits were included in this study. The age of the rabbits was in the range of five to six years and their body weight ranged between 1.8-2.0 kg. Based on medical history, examination, and laboratory investigation, none of the subjects had any medical abnormality.

Test medication Products A and B were administered to the subjects with 100 ml of water.

However, the difference in the C <sub>max</sub> values recorded for both products was statistically insignificant. Comparison of the mean concentration time curve of Product A with that of Product B, indicated that Product B was associated with a significantly lower peak plasma concentration than that of Product A. The time taken to reach peak plasma concentration T<sub>max</sub> was 2.5 and 3 hours for Products A and B, respectively. The T<sub>max</sub> of Aspirin was a little higher in case of Product B, but no statistical significant difference was found between the two products. The mean Ka for Products A and B were found to be 0.3698 &#x000b1; 0.003 h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.3812 &#x000b1; 0.002 h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and the difference between the two products was insignificant.</p><p>However, a small difference between both products is related to C <sub>max</sub>, T <sub>max</sub>, and reduced fluctuations (peak to trough ratios) of the plasma concentrations. All these effects may probably be due to the dissolution rate limited drug release and hence absorption. From the present study it can be observed that reduced fluctuations combined with elevated mean plasma concentration in both the products, offers the advantage of protecting patients against morning stiffness.</p><p>Mean residence time (MRT) of Products A and B was found to be 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.10 h and 4.76 &#x000b1; 0.10 h, respectively. The difference in mean values of MRT in both the formulations was statistically insignificant.</p><p>The mean AUC<sub>0-24</sub> values for Products A and B were 9623 &#x000b1; 112.87 ng h/ml and 9637 &#x000b1; 129.22 ng h/ml. The results of the statistical analysis indicated that Product B exhibited a smaller and non-significant reduction in the AUC values. It was observed that the slow release of IM from Products A and B could be responsible for the decreased AUC values when compared to the reported conventional dosage forms. The observed mean AUC <sub>o-oo</sub> values for Products A and B were 9870 &#x000b1; 129.22 ng h/ml and 8617 &#x000b1; 46.88 ng h/ml, which did not show any significant statistical difference between the products. The individual and mean AUC <sub>0-24</sub> ratios (B/A), reflected the relative extent of absorption of Product B to that of Product A, which is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The average values of the individual and mean AUC <sub>0-24</sub> ratios at 95% confidence limit were within acceptable limits for bioequivalent products.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Relative bioavailability (AUC ratio) of product A and product B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-2-118-g004"/></table-wrap><p>On the basis of the FDA recommendation, the two Products A and B can be considered bioequivalent. No untoward effects were observed by any of the subjects after the administration of either product.
