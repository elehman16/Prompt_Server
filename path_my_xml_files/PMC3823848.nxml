An estimated 3.3 billion people were at risk of malaria in 2010 and regions of highest risk concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Eighty-one percent of cases and 91% of deaths were estimated to have occurred in the World Health Organization African region, predominantly among children under five years of age and pregnant women[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant vectors increasingly pose challenges for malaria control programs. Failure of current control measures calls for an accelerated development of malaria vaccine as a potentially effective additional tool in the arsenal against malaria. No vaccine has been licensed to protect against malaria. In recent years, the effort to develop an effective malaria vaccine has resulted in a number of malaria vaccine candidates reaching the stage of testing in malaria-exposed populations. </p><p>Malaria parasites have a life cycle consisting of several developmental stages. Each of these stages is able to induce specific immune responses against the corresponding stage-specific antigens. A number of vaccines have been tested that target molecules expressed at different stages of the parasite&#x02019;s life cycle. In this clinical trial, a pre-erythrocyte malaria vaccine that expresses the CS protein using a replication deficient Ad35 as a viral vector was studied. Ad35.CS.01 is a malaria vaccine for which a codon optimized nucleotide sequence representing the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> circumsporozoite (CS) surface antigen is inserted in a replication deficient Adenovirus 35 backbone. </p><p>The CS protein is the major surface protein of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoite. CS is a 350 residue protein and is thought to have multiple important functions. One function of the CS protein is to mediate sporozoite attachment to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the liver of the mammalian host[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other proposed functions involve sporozoite binding to mosquito salivary gland [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], sporozoite gliding motility [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], a form of substrate dependant cell locomotion characteristic of <italic>Apicomplexa</italic>, as well as inhibition of host intracellular protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes in hepatocytes[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. </p><p>Given the important function mediated by CS protein during the malaria parasite cycle, the CS protein has become one of the ideal targets for vaccine design. CS-based vaccines have been shown to induce antibody and T cell responses that both block and neutralize sporozoites from invading liver cells and/or destroy sporozoite-infected liver cells[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hence, large-scale deployment of an effective vaccine against the pre-erythrocytic stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> could potentially prevent millions of cases of malaria disease. Clinical trials of various CS-based vaccines have been conducted in human volunteers and have been shown to elicit antigen- specific immune responses [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The positive results obtained in clinical trials with CS-based vaccines have encouraged efforts to enhance potential efficacy through a variety of methods to improve vaccine delivery and immunogenicity of these vaccines. </p><p>Recombinant adenovirus vectors have been widely evaluated as vectors for therapeutic gene transfer, oncolytic viral vectors and vaccine vectors. Because of the extensive knowledge of its genome, interactions, and safety profile, a replication-deficient adenovirus was selected as the vector system to deliver the above mentioned codon optimized CS- protein. Ad35 was selected in preference to Ad5 for the CS-based vaccine construction because of its low seroprevalence worldwide. In a sero-epidemiologic study, neutralizing antibody titers to Ad35 were much lower than Ad5 titers, most notably in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that a vaccine based on Ad35 vector might not be subject to the problem of limited effectiveness of Ad5- vectored vaccines due to anti-vector neutralizing pre-existing antibody activity[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. </p><p>In the genome structure of the attenuated replication deficient Ad35.CS.01, the E1 region is replaced with the CS gene. Due to the deletion of the E1 gene, which codes for a protein required for trans- activation of viral gene, the Ad35 vaccine vector is unable to complete viral gene transcription process after infecting host cells; thus, no viral proteins are synthesized, no viral particles are produced and therefore, Ad35.CS.01 is replication deficient. The inserted CS gene is driven by a CMV promoter and is expressed constitutively. </p><p>It is believed that Ad35.CS.01 will stimulate the immune system to induce CS-specific humoral or cell mediated immunity by infecting host cells, including professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], macrophages or B cells. The encoded CS protein of interest is then synthesized by the host cell&#x02019;s protein expression machinery. The CS protein may potentially be processed further via MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway and presented in the context of MHC class I molecules. By recognizing cell surface MHC class I/peptide complex, CD8 T cells are activated, proliferate and further mature into effectors that exert either cytolytic function or cytokine secretion. Vaccines based on these non-replicating adeno-vectors are capable of inducing antigen specific CD4 and CD8 positive T cells in humans [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] . Vaccines inducing CS antigen specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were shown to be protective in mouse malaria models in the late 1980s [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and recently CD8 T cells were implicated in destroying parasite infected liver cells and thereby preventing disease after infection [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, these adenovectored vaccines are capable of inducing antibody responses in humans against their inserted transgenes[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] . It is anticipated that the antibody response will be primarily responsible for binding to the CS protein on the surface of sporozoites that enter the host&#x02019;s liver cells. The combined action of both antibody and T cell responses is expected to ultimately prevent the parasite from producing clinical disease. </p><p>The Ad35.CS.01 Phase 1a study in the U.S. found the vaccine safe in malaria na&#x000ef;ve adults. This clinical trial evaluated the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of different doses of Ad35.CS.01 in healthy semi immune adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078679.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078679.s002">Protocol S1</xref>. </p><sec id="s2.1"><title>Trial site and population</title><p>The study was carried out by the Centre National de Recherche et de Formation sur le Paludisme (CNRFP) in the malaria vaccine clinical trials center located in the village of Balonghin, in the Sapon&#x000e9; health district in the Baz&#x000e8;ga province from April 2010 to December 2011. The clinical trial center is equipped and staffed to undertake clinical trial phases 1b through 2b in compliance with national and international standards and requirements. An ambulance was available in Balonghin 24 h per day throughout the 1 year follow-up period.

In this area, malaria transmission is markedly seasonal and intense during the rainy season from June to October. The entomological inoculation rate is above 40 infective bites/person/night during the intense transmission season and drops to 0 during the low season (dry season).

Trial participants were recruited among healthy male and female adults living in Balonghin and neighbour villages. The primary objective was to assess the safety and reactogenicity of four ascending dosages of the Ad35.CS.01 malaria candidate vaccine among healthy, semi-immune, subjects given in 3 doses at 0, 1 and 3 months by intramuscular injection. Ten subjects received vaccine at each of the following ascending dosage levels: 10<sup>9</sup> viral particles (vp)/mL, 10<sup>10</sup> vp/mL, 5 x 10<sup>10</sup> vp/mL and 10<sup>11</sup>vp/mL.

Dosage escalation preceded only after review of the 14-day safety data of the prior dosage level by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Screening and enrolment</title><p>Initially, an educational process was instituted to represent several levels of authority starting from the civil authorities to the local village leadership and down to small groups and ultimately the individual. From the up to date database of the Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) of the population in the study area, a list of all adults 18-45 years old from the village of Balonghin and neighbour villages has been drawn. Subjects were visited at home by field workers who explained the study to them. They were then invited to the vaccinology unit based at Balonghin village to receive more information about the study. Those who provided signed informed consent were screened for study eligibility. Individuals were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they were found to be healthy at a general medical examination, indicated their intention to reside in the village for the duration of the trial (12 months) and gave written informed consent. </p><p>Exclusion criteria included: (i) abnormal screening laboratory values; (ii) positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); (iii) concurrent participation in other investigational protocols or receipt of an investigational product within the previous 30 days or planned receipt of an investigational product within 28 days following the last immunization dose.

Following each vaccination, subjects were observed in the clinic for a minimum of 30 minutes to record any immediate local or systemic adverse reactions. Field workers then visited the subjects at home to collect the 14 days solicited or unsolicited local and systemic reactions. After the 14 days follow-up following the third vaccination, participants were followed up on or around 112, 140, 252 and 365 days after the first vaccine dose was given.</p><p>Solicited local adverse events at the injection site included pain, tenderness, erythema, induration and ecchymosis. The severity of pain was assessed based on duration and intensity. Grade 1 pain was defined as mild pain, does not interfere with activity; grade 2 pain was moderate, interferes with activity; grade 3 pain was severe, prevents daily activity.</p><p>Other local reactions, erythema, induration and ecchymosis were assessed by their size and the duration. Severity was graded based on the measurement of the greatest surface diameter in cm. Grading was as follows: 1= &#x0003e;0 - 5 cm and does not interfere with activity, 2= 5.1 - 10 cm or interferes with activity, 3= &#x0003e;10 cm or prevents daily activity. </p><p>Solicited systemic reactions included fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, chills, nausea and vomiting. An axillary temperature of 37.5&#x000b0;C and over is considered fever in adults. Axillary temperature was measured using a digital thermometer and fever evaluated according to the grading scale: 1= 37.8 - 38.4&#x000b0;C, 2= 38.5 - 38.9&#x000b0;C and 3= &#x0003e;38.9&#x000b0;C.The severity of systemic reactions was assessed based on duration and intensity. The grade 1 (mild) is when a symptom doesn&#x02019;t interfere with activity; grade 2 (moderate) when a symptom interferes with activity, grade 3 (severe) prevents daily activity. Any other symptoms not included in the targeted symptoms list above were recorded as non-solicited symptoms by the investigators. </p><p>Solicited and unsolicited systemic reactions/events were monitored at each contact from day 0 to day 112. The occurrence of serious adverse events was monitored throughout the entire study period. A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event meeting one of the following conditions: death, life threatening, requiring hospitalization, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other important medical event.</p><p>Blood and urine samples were obtained at screening and on days 7, 35 and 91 to monitor biological safety of the vaccine. Biological safety tests included hematology [hemoglobin (Hgb), white blood cell count (WBC) with machine differential, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and platelet count], blood biochemistry [glucose, electrolytes (sodium, potassium), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatinine] and urinalysis testing included a dipstick for blood and proteins. HIV serology was assessed at the screening and the close out visit. </p><p>A thick and thin film was prepared and a rapid diagnosis test for malaria was performed if a trial subject presented with an axillary temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C or history of fever within the prior 24 hours. The rapid diagnostic test results were used to guide prompt treatment while awaiting the results of the slide examination. Subjects diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria were treated with 6 equal doses of Coartem&#x000ae; at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hours according to the national guidelines for care in Burkina Faso. All adverse events were followed up to resolution or stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2.8"><title>Assessment of study outcomes: immunogenicity</title><p>To assess both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the vaccine, 50 mL of blood was drawn from subjects on the following study days: 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140 days. From the 50 mL blood for immunological responses, 10mL was used for serum isolation and subsequent humoral assays, and 40 mL blood was used for cellular assays: 30mls for PBMC isolation and 10 ml for whole blood stimulation followed by cytokine ELISA. Samples for cellular assays were collected in sodium heparin anticoagulant vacutainers. Responses were analyzed as continuous (geometric mean or median) and categorical (positive response or 4-fold increase from baseline), as traditionally reported and defined by Crucell prior to analysis. </p><sec id="s2.8.1"><title>Antibody titers against the malaria circumsporozoite antigen</title><p>Antibody titers against the malaria circumsporozoite antigen were assessed at days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112 and 140. ELISA was used to determine IgG antibody concentrations to CS protein using a (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide as capture antigen at Crucell as previously described[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, the peptide was obtained from Pepscan (Lelystad, Netherlands) at a purity of 90%. The peptide was coated at a concentration of 2 ug/ml in 0.05M carbonate buffer at 2-8&#x000b0;C overnight or for a maximum of 3 days. Reference sera, serum samples, and internal controls were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 2% gelatin, and 1% human serum (dilution buffer) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Caprine anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, o-phenylenediamine (OPD; Sigma Aldrich) was added for the colorimetric reaction, which was stopped after 10 min using 5.3% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> stop solution. Subsequently, the optical density (OD) was measured at 492 nm, using a Bio-Tek microplate spectrophotometer PowerWave 340. The limit of detection for the anti-CS assay was 18 EU/mL. Values below this threshold were set at 50% of the limit of detection.</p></sec><sec id="s2.8.2"><title>Neutralizing antibody titers against Adenovirus type 35</title><p>The neutralizing antibody titers against Adenovirus type 35 were measured using Adenovirus Neutralization Assay at days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112 and 140. Ad35-specific neutralizing antibody titers were assessed by luciferase-based virus neutralization assays as described previously[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The adenovirus neutralization assay has been optimized and validated for human serum. In short, serum was heat inactivated and serially diluted by 2-fold (starting dilution is 1:16). Ad35.Luc solution (10<sup>8</sup> vp/ml) was added to each well at 500 virus particles per cell. A549 cells were added at 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well and plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C/10% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 to 26 hours. After incubation, medium was discarded, PBS was added, and plates ere stored frozen overnight. Plates were allowed to thaw at room temperature, Luciferase Steady-Lite substrate as added and the lysate was transferred into black/white isoplates. Luminescence counts were recorded on a 1450 MicroBeta Trilux. Titers were determined by validated software ANAM (Adenovirus Neutralization Assay Macro). The limit of detection for the Ad35 neutralizing antibody assay was 16 IC<sub>90</sub>. Values below this threshold were set at 50% of the limit of detection.</p></sec><sec id="s2.8.3"><title>T cell responses against the malaria circumsporozoite antigen</title><p>T cell responses against the malaria circumsporozoite antigen were measured by Elispot at days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112 and 140. Thawed and rested PBMC samples were stimulated with a single pool of 59 CS peptides (2&#x003bc;g/ml/peptide), consisting of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids, representing the CS protein. For mock stimulated wells, DMSO was used (0.24%). </p><p>For ELISpot, pre-coated human &#x003b1;-IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot plates (MabTech, Sweden) were blocked and PBMCs were added to the blocked plates at a concentration of 2x10<sup>5</sup> viable cells/well for peptide and mock stimulated wells. After overnight incubation the plates were washed and the detection antibody 7-B6-1-ALP (MabTech, Sweden) was added. After washing, the spots were visualized with BCIP/NBT (MabTech, Sweden) and counted using a digital imager and automated spot counting (AID ELISpot reader, AutoImmun-Diagnostika). In each assay an internal control was included to determine whether the assay was valid.</p><p>For Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS), one million cells per well were stimulated with either CMV or CS peptide pool diluted in medium. Golgi Plug (BD Bioscience, Mountain View, USA) was included during the 6-hour incubation together with peptide stimulation. For live/dead staining, aqua fluorescent Dye A (Invitrogen, the Netherlands) was used for 30 minutes at RT. Staining for 20 minutes at RT to indentify T-cells was performed using APC H7-&#x003b1;-CD3, Horizon V450-&#x003b1;-CD4 and PerCP-Cy5.5-&#x003b1;-CD8 (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, USA) Cells were permeabilized and fixed by Cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and thereafter stained for intracellular cytokines using APC-&#x003b1;-IFN&#x003b3;, FITC-&#x003b1;-TNF&#x003b1; and PE-&#x003b1;-IL-2 (BD Biosciences). Data was acquired and analyzed by FACSCanto II flowcytometer and FACSDiva 6.1.2 software (BD Biosciences). In each assay an internal control was included to determine if the assay was valid. Prior to analyzing samples with FACS Canto II, set-up tracking beads (BD set-up beads, BD Bioscience) and compensation beads (Compbeads, BD Bioscience) were run. Prequalified gating was used throughout the sample analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2.9"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size of ten per group was proposed to receive the Ad35.CS.01 vaccine to obtain preliminary safety information on a small cohort of subjects before proceeding to subsequent larger trials.

An ascending dosage design was selected because this vaccine had not previously been administered in a malaria- experienced population. The four dosages of Ad35.CS.01 vaccine were safe and modestly immunogenic. </p><p>No subjects experienced a grade 3 solicited reaction. Frequency of systemic reactions was similar among vaccine and placebo groups and did not appear dose-dependent. The most common local symptoms were mild or moderate pain or induration. All symptoms at the site of injection resolved spontaneously within 14 days of vaccination. </p><p> Frequency of non-serious events was similar among study groups and most commonly consisted of headache and vomiting (solicited adverse events) and mild or moderate gastrointestinal disorders or infections/infestations (unsolicited adverse events). Associated events were most frequently classified as mild abnormal laboratory values occurring within 7 days post-vaccination and included hematuria, proteinuria and leucocytopenia. </p><p>There were similar incidences and intensity of general and unsolicited symptoms among subjects receiving Ad35.CS.01 and those receiving the placebo. The number of volunteers who had biological values outside the normal ranges for the measured parameters was similar in the Ad35.CS.01 and placebo groups. It should be noted that abnormal values were defined according to international normal ranges which may not be appropriate to our population. Thrombocytopenia and proteinuria events that resulted in discontinuation of vaccination of two subjects were found resolved at final follow up. </p><p>Effective immune protection against clinical malaria involves the acquisition of cellular and humoral immunity, which may naturally occur after repeated exposure to malaria or develop upon anti-malarial vaccination. Antibodies to the circumsporozoite protein have been reported to play a key role in protection against malaria in a number of epidemiological studies[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this trial, the Ad35.CS.01 vaccine induced increased levels of malaria humoral immune responses among vaccine groups. The effect did not substantially vary among vaccine dosage groups. Prevalence and level of neutralizing antibodies against Ad35 also increased post immunization, although the geometric mean response remained low among all study groups (IC90 range 10 to 68). These data are consistent with reports that neutralizing antibodies against Ad35 are rare in humans worldwide or present in low titers [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Previous studies have also described the ability of Ad35 vectors to deliver Plasmodium antigens and elicit immunogenicity as well as protect laboratory animals from sporozoite challenge with <italic>P yoelii</italic>[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Results of the current study build on the more recently demonstrated induction of antibody response by a prime-boost regimen including Ad35.CS in rhesus macaques[<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; this vaccination approach is hypothesized to elicit a more complex and advantageous immune response relative to homologous boosting.</p><p>Adenoviral vectors offer the potential to safely induce CD4 and CD8 T-Cells in animals[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and humans[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] . IFN&#x003b3; producing CD8 and CD4 T-cells may be required for clearance of parasite-infected hepacytes[<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the current study immunization with Ad35.CS.01 induced sustained responses of IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; producing CD8 T cells. A similar response was not seen with CS specific CD4 T cells. Induction of IFN&#x003b3; producing CD8 T-cells by adenovirus vectors has previously been described in both mice and macaques[<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our results are consistent with the acceptable safety of the Ad35.CS.01 vaccine demonstrated in malaria na&#x000ef;ve adults living in the US (manuscript submitted). The similar results profile in the current semi-immune population is expected to generalize to adults living in malaria endemic areas. It has recently been shown that Ad35 vectors expressing TB antigens also expressed in BCG induce more robust responses in adults previously primed with BCG then in BCG na&#x000ef;ve individuals suggesting that Ad35 vectors may be more potent in humans as boosters then as priming vaccines [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Despite exposure to malaria sporozoites in this malaria experienced population, priming for cellular immune responses may not occur as suggested by the low baseline Elispot responses in most individuals. It would therefore be useful to explore this Ad35 vectored CS vaccine in prime boost regimens with other adjuvants to enhance both antibody and cellular responses.</p><p>The acceptable safety and tolerability and modest immunogenicity of Ad35.CS.01 in the malaria semi-immune adult population described here, positions this vaccine for future evaluation of CS specific antibody and cellular response induction. Alternative strategies that may be considered are homologous or heterologous prime boost regimens with varied CS protein formulations. Success of such regimens may demonstrate a value for future efficacy studies in human challenge models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0078679.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
