After NOGA-guided transendocardial injection, we quantified engraftment of escalating doses of allogeneic cardiospheres or cardiosphere-derived cells in minipigs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) post-MI. Next, a dose-ranging, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled (&#x0201c;dose optimization&#x0201d;) study of transendocardial injection of the better-engrafting product was performed in infarcted minipigs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16). Finally, the superior product and dose (150 million cardiospheres) were tested in a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled (&#x0201c;pivotal&#x0201d;) study (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22). Contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI revealed that all cardiosphere doses preserved systolic function and attenuated remodeling. The maximum feasible dose (150 million cells) was most effective in reducing scar size, increasing viable myocardium and improving ejection fraction. In the pivotal study, eight weeks post-injection, histopathology demonstrated no excess inflammation, and no myocyte hypertrophy, in treated minipigs versus controls. No alloreactive donor-specific antibodies developed over time. MRI showed reduced scar size, increased viable mass, and attenuation of cardiac dilatation with no effect on ejection fraction in the treated group compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dose-optimized injection of allogeneic cardiospheres is safe, decreases scar size, increases viable myocardium, and attenuates cardiac dilatation in porcine chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.

While traditional therapies aim at attenuating disease progression, regenerative cell therapy seeks to reverse heart failure by regrowing healthy working myocardium. To that end, numerous cell types and delivery methods have been studied <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Dauwe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

While intracoronary delivery is safe and convenient, cell retention is low <xref rid="pone.0113805-Hou1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Since increased cellular retention has been associated with greater long-term benefits on cardiac function both in animal models <xref rid="pone.0113805-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Terrovitis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and in humans <xref rid="pone.0113805-Vrtovec1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Vrtovec2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, there is good reason to believe that development of delivery methods with better engraftment might enhance the efficacy of cell therapy, especially in the setting of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, where local homing signals are reduced <xref rid="pone.0113805-Perin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that intramyocardial (IM) cell delivery leads to greater cardiac engraftment compared to intracoronary delivery <xref rid="pone.0113805-Vrtovec2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Makela1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-George1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Perin2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Kanazawa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, although agreement on this point is not universal <xref rid="pone.0113805-Jeevanantham1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-vanderSpoel1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Intramyocardial injection also enables the use of cardiospheres (CSps, three-dimensional spherical clusters of heart-derived cells), which are more efficacious than CDCs when both human products are delivered IM in immunodeficient mice with acute MI <xref rid="pone.0113805-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In pigs, open-chest epicardial injection of CDCs and CSps is safe and effective post-MI <xref rid="pone.0113805-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, clinically-translatable transendocardial injection of heart-derived cell products has never been reported.</p><p>We initially sought to optimize dosing and delivery protocols for transendocardial injection of heart-derived cell products, and then to test the optimized process in chronic porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy. First, we compared 24-hour engraftment of allogeneic CSps and CDCs using NOGA-guided transendocardial injection. Second, we performed a dose-ranging study of the better-engrafting cell product. Finally, we performed a pivotal, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study to investigate if dose-optimized transendocardial injection of heart-derived cells is safe and effective in a porcine model of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.

These explants were plated onto fibronectin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)-coated dishes with cardiac explant medium (IMDM [Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA], 20% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and expanded at 37&#x000b0;C for two weeks. The outgrowth of adherent cells was harvested and re-plated into poly-D-lysine (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ)-coated wells. Within three days, the majority of the cells gave rise to three-dimensional, free-floating clusters of cells termed primary CSps. Free-floating primary CSps were collected and plated onto fibronectin-coated dishes.

On day 0, animals were premedicated with ketamine 20 mg/kg IM, atropine 0.05 mg/kg IM, and acepromazine 0.25 mg/kg IM. They were induced with propofol 2&#x02013;4 mg/kg IV to effect, intubated, and maintained on isoflurane 2&#x02013;3%. Amiodarone (10 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 0.5 mg/kg IV PRN) and lidocaine (0.03 &#x000b5;g/kg/min CRI) were given to prevent/treat ventricular arrhythmias. Heparin 100 IU/kg IV was given for anticoagulation. A coronary dilation catheter (Trek OTW 2&#x02013;3 mm, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) was inflated in the mid-LAD (immediately after the 1<sup>st</sup> diagonal branch), providing 100% occlusion for 2.5 hours. Post-operative oxymorphone 0.15 mg/kg IM BID PRN and carprofen 4 mg/kg PO q24h PRN were administered for analgesia.</p><p>On day 28, animals were re-anesthetized using the same protocol and drug regimen. Pigs were randomized to receive luciferase-labeled cells: a) high-dose CSps (10 million ICEs); b) low-dose CSps (5 million ICEs); c) high-dose CDCs (10 million CDCs); d) low-dose CDCs (5 million CDCs); and e) maximum feasible dose CSps (100&#x02013;200 million ICEs). Randomization for all arms of the study was performed by the cell manufacturing laboratory staff, with the remaining staff blinded throughout experimentation and primary data analysis. An electroanatomical map of the left ventricle (LV) was created using the NOGA XP Cardiac Navigation System (Biosense Webster, Inc., Diamond Bar, CA).

This method is advantageous because only viable cells can generate a signal since the reaction requires transcription, translation, and ATP, though possible false decreases in signal can occur due to gene silencing <xref rid="pone.0113805-Terrovitis2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Cells were transduced with an adenoviral vector carrying the firefly luciferase gene three days prior to injection. For each animal, a separate standard curve was constructed. Specifically, once the cell dose was allocated for injection, an aliquot of cells (from the same batch of adenovirally-transduced cells used for that specific pig) was cultured for an additional 24 hours to create the animal-specific standard curve. Twenty four hours after cell delivery, the injected regions of the LV were homogenized and analyzed for luminescence. We chose to analyze the totality of the injected tissue (rather than isolated myocardial samples) to minimize sampling error and accurately measure cardiac engraftment; however, this approach prevented us from investigating the localization of the retained cells (within the injected region) by immunohistochemistry. Animal-specific standard curves were prepared by measuring the luminescence from known numbers of transduced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113805.s001">Supporting Image S1B</xref>), with conversion to a cell number by reference to the respective standard curve. Thus, transduction efficiency is equal in the standard curve and in the cell products delivered, so that results for each particular animal are not confounded. Twenty-four hour engraftment was expressed as a percentage of cells originally injected. Off-target engraftment of cells in lung, spleen, liver, and kidney was similarly quantified.

Importantly, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was similar in CSp-treated minipigs and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113805-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), excluding hypertrophy as a contributor to the increase in viable myocardium observed after cell therapy.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have tested, systematically, the feasibility, safety and efficacy of percutaneous intramyocardial delivery of heart-derived cells. We first optimized dosing and delivery protocols for catheter-guided transendocardial injections. We then tested the safety and efficacy of allogeneic CSps in a clinically-relevant large animal model of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. The salient findings are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Catheter-guided delivery of heart-derived cell products produces robust cardiac engraftment, with minimal off-target engraftment.

The chronic setting is likely more difficult to treat with cell therapy because adverse cardiac remodeling has already progressed, and local homing signals are reduced <xref rid="pone.0113805-Perin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These attenuating factors might, in principle, be counteracted by more effective and targeted delivery of cells. To that end, intramyocardial delivery has been shown to result in higher cardiac retention compared to intracoronary or systemic approaches, while implementation of electromechanical mapping enables targeted delivery of cells to viable myocardium in the border zone of chronic scars. In addition, in the vast majority of preclinical and clinical studies of transendocardial delivery of cell types grown from other organs, dosing has not been systematic; instead, it has been guided by feasibility and accessibility rather than purposeful optimization.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that percutaneous transendocardial delivery of heart-derived cell products in the infarct border zone results in robust cardiac engraftment of up to 20%, higher than with any other previously-reported delivery method <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. CSps outperform other stem cell types, where 24 hour engraftment is generally &#x0003c;10%, regardless of delivery route <xref rid="pone.0113805-Terrovitis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Injection of CSps results in more robust short-term engraftment compared to CDCs. The latter may be attributable to the larger size of CSps (allowing for greater passive entrapment of CSps within the myocardium), as well as to upregulation of adhesion molecules on the CSp surface <xref rid="pone.0113805-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>CSps are self-organized spherical clusters of heart-derived cells, characterized by increased stemness <xref rid="pone.0113805-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Due to their larger size of 40&#x02013;150 &#x000b5;m, CSps may not be safe to administer intracoronarily, as they would likely embolize in the microvasculature. In previous reports, we showed that IM delivery of CSps disproportionately boosts cardiac function in small and large animal models of ischemic cardiomyopathy compared with monolayer-cultured CDCs <xref rid="pone.0113805-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>We have also shown that injection of allogeneic CDCs and CSps in a stringent rat model of allotransplantation post-MI is safe, inducing a transient local immune response <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras4" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Tseliou1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Allogeneic cell therapy is desirable because it circumvents the logistic, economic, and timing constraints associated with autologous cell therapy. It also enables a highly-standardized off-the-shelf product to be generated from a universal donor pool. Here we show that transendocardial injection of allogeneic CSps in a large-animal model of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy induces a mild local immune response with no signs of systemic immunogenicity or toxicity. No circulating anti-donor antibodies were detected in any of the treated pigs, giving reason for optimism with regard to the immunogenicity of allogeneic CSps in humans. The latter is important since patients with advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy may also be candidates for solid organ transplantation, such that highly-immunogenic agents are best avoided.</p><p>By design, the dose optimization study preceded the pivotal study. Because the two studies were not performed contemporaneously, direct comparison of the outcome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, the beneficial effects of cardiospheres appear to be blunted in the pivotal study in comparison to the dose optimization study. The benefits may genuinely be more pronounced with treatment 4 weeks post-MI than 8 weeks post-MI: intervention in the early phases of remodeling and infarct healing may be more effective compared to intervention after healing is complete, but this possibility remains conjectural. EF drops in the first weeks post-MI and remains relatively stable thereafter <xref rid="pone.0113805-Raake1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. There is a minimal, albeit detectable, decline in EF that occurs between 4 and 12 weeks post-MI, where increased myocardial fibrosis is present <xref rid="pone.0113805-Crisostomo1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This may blunt the effects of cell therapy, though intervention up to 8 weeks post-MI may still be beneficial in myocardial regeneration, as evidenced by the present study. Xiong et al <xref rid="pone.0113805-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> recently studied human induced pluripotent stem cells in an acute infarct model with a 4 week followup period. Even though the Xiong model is different, our outcomes appear to be at least as effective, and sometimes even better, in improving infarct size. Interestingly, the LVEF in Xiong et al increased by approximately +6% in both the placebo and cell-treated arms between 1 and 4 weeks post-MI, while in our study, the LVEF <italic>fell</italic> in the placebo arm of both the dose optimization and pivotal studies (approximately &#x02212;5% and &#x02212;2%, respectively), while increasing or staying the same in the 150M dose treated arms (approximately +1% and +0%, respectively). Moreover, the animal model used by Xiong et al used juvenile Yorkshire swine whose cardiac physiology may differ from those of older minipigs <xref rid="pone.0113805-Lehrke1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Schuleri1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Lastly, the animals in the paper by Xiong et al were immunosuppressed, unlike those in our study.</p><p>Finally, we show that dose-optimized percutaneous transendocardial injection of allogeneic CSps, tested in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled manner, attenuates remodeling, decreases scar size and increases viable myocardium. CSps are rich in matrix metalloproteinases <xref rid="pone.0113805-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which could contribute to dissolution of scar tissue. The increase in viable myocardium did not result from myocyte hypertrophy, and likely occurs through stimulation of endogenous protective (anti-apoptotic), and regenerative mechanisms (upregulation of cardiomyocyte cycling, increased recruitment of endogenous stem cells <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras4" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras5" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Xiong2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Weil1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>). The decreases in scar size, mirrored by increases in viable myocardium, resemble the changes seen in human subjects treated with CDCs <xref rid="pone.0113805-Makkar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and are indicative of therapeutic regeneration. It should be noted that we observed greater benefits, especially with regard to EF, in the dose optimization study when CSps were injected 3&#x02013;4 weeks post-MI, compared to the pivotal study where CSps were injected 8 weeks post-MI. Whether this means that cell therapy is more effective in the setting of convalescent MI compared to chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy remains to be further investigated.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations. First, we only quantified 24 hour cardiac retention but not long-term engraftment. However, long-term engraftment is vanishingly low regardless of delivery method <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; early cardiac cell retention appears to be a better predictor of long-term functional benefit <xref rid="pone.0113805-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113805-Terrovitis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Second, while we measured total 24 hour cardiac engraftment, we did not investigate the distribution of the transplanted cells within the host myocardium. While luciferase might conceivably be measured from nonviable cells, this is unlikely given the short 3 hour half-life of luciferase and the requirement for ATP <xref rid="pone.0113805-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Third, our study does not provide any mechanistic insight into the regenerative effects of CSps. Fourth, we have not thoroughly validated the use of MRI to assess therapeutic regeneration after CSp IM injection, as we have done with CDC intracoronary delivery <xref rid="pone.0113805-Malliaras3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, the similarity between the two cell products with regard to mechanism of action <xref rid="pone.0113805-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> gives some reassurance that MRIs will be similarly interpretable in the current protocols. Fifth, as with all animal studies, there is the potential that the increase in LV mass in each of the chronic MI groups could be confounded by growth of the animal; however, if this were the case then all parameters should be similarly and linearly changed. Finally, the normal range of porcine-ANP has not been established, nor did we measure porcine-ANP in normal minipigs. Therefore, we are only able to assay relative changes within the two groups (CSp vs placebo) from baseline to endpoint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Transendocardial injection of heart-derived cell products results in robust short-term cardiac engraftment (better with CSps than CDCs).
