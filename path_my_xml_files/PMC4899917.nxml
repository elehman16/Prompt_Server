However, the benefits of concomitant GCS use for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and receiving anticoagulation remain unknown. In this study, the efficacy of GCS plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone was evaluated among patients undergoing TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a post hoc analysis of a previously reported phase 3 trial involving patients undergoing TKA. In the primary study, which permitted the use of GCS for mechanical prophylaxis, patients were randomized to receive edoxaban 30&#x000a0;mg once daily or enoxaparin 20&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 11 to 14&#x000a0;days following TKA. The primary endpoint was the incidence of VTE, a composite of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), and asymptomatic DVT. Treatment comparisons were performed using the chi-square test, and the 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among patients receiving edoxaban, the incidence of VTE was 3.8 and 5.8&#x000a0;% for patients with and without GCS, respectively. For patients receiving enoxaparin, VTE incidence was 8.4 and 20.8&#x000a0;% among those with and without GCS, respectively. Overall, VTE incidence was 6.0 and 13.0&#x000a0;% for anticoagulated patients with and without GCS mechanical prophylaxis, respectively. No deaths or symptomatic PE were reported during this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the incidence of VTE was &#x0003e;2-fold lower among patients receiving anticoagulation plus GCS compared with those receiving anticoagulation alone, statistical significance was not achieved. Further studies are required to confirm the findings of this preliminary analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01181102">NCT01181102</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Venous thromboembolism</kwd><kwd>Deep vein thrombosis</kwd><kwd>Intermittent pneumatic compression</kwd><kwd>Graduated compression stockings</kwd><kwd>Edoxaban</kwd><kwd>Enoxaparin</kwd><kwd>Total knee arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Orthopedic surgery</kwd><kwd>VTE</kwd><kwd>DVT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This study was sponsored by Daiichi Sankyo, Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Major lower limb orthopedic surgery&#x02014;such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty (THA), and hip fracture surgery (HFS)&#x02014;is a significant risk factor for postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, several pharmacological and mechanical therapies are available for the prevention of VTE, including graduated compression stockings (GCS), which are a convenient and inexpensive mechanical prophylaxis measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of action of GCS remains unclear, they are believed to reduce the total cross-sectional area of the leg veins, thereby increasing venous blood flow velocity and preventing venous stasis in the lower limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Guidelines from the Japanese Circulation Society recommend the use of GCS for prophylaxis among patients at an intermediate risk for VTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Anticoagulation or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is recommended for patients at a high risk for VTE, such as those undergoing major orthopedic surgery, while anticoagulation plus IPC or GCS is recommended for patients at the highest risk for VTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the efficacy of the combined treatment of anticoagulation with GCS relative to anticoagulation alone for VTE prevention among patients undergoing major lower limb orthopedic surgery has not been evaluated. In this study, an exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of GCS combined with enoxaparin or edoxaban, a direct, oral, factor Xa inhibitor, using data from a phase 3 clinical study that assessed the efficacy and safety of edoxaban (vs enoxaparin) for the prevention of postoperative VTE in patients undergoing TKA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study selection</title><p>Three phase 3 studies involving patients undergoing TKA (TKA P3; STARS E-3 trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], THA (THA P3; STARS J-5 trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], or HFS (HFS P3; STARS J-4 trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] were considered for inclusion in this analysis.

These 3 studies were conducted between October 2008 and January 2010. In all 3 studies, the concomitant use of any method of mechanical prophylaxis, including GCS and IPC, was permitted. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the number of patients available for efficacy analysis stratified by the method of mechanical prophylaxis. Since there were few patients without mechanical prophylaxis in the THA P3 (1 patient) and HFS P3 (9 patients) studies, these 2 studies were excluded from the present analysis.

Thus, the remaining 422 patients from 53 sites were considered for inclusion in the present analysis. To avoid the influence of other mechanical methods (eg, IPC), patients who had also used IPC were excluded as well.

The mean age, body weight, and creatinine clearance were not different among patients regardless of anticoagulant and/or mechanical prophylaxis use. Tourniquet use was lower, whereas the use of epidural and lumbar anesthesia was higher among patients receiving GCS relative to those without any mechanical prophylaxis. This difference was due to facility-specific practices; facilities employing GCS for prophylaxis had lower rates of tourniquet or general anesthesia use. Mean GCS use was 9.5 and 9.6&#x000a0;days for the edoxaban and enoxaparin groups, respectively. The mean (standard deviation) time interval between surgery and the start of postoperative anticoagulant therapy was 20&#x000a0;h and 7&#x000a0;min (2&#x000a0;h and 50&#x000a0;min) for the edoxaban group and 28&#x000a0;h and 54&#x000a0;min (3&#x000a0;h and 29&#x000a0;min) for the enoxaparin group.

Thus, 2 independent elements of Virchow&#x02019;s thrombogenic triad (&#x0201c;hypercoagulability&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;venous stasis&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] are targeted when prophylaxis with anticoagulant therapy and GCS is combined. This is thought to be the mechanism by which combined therapy achieves a greater reduction in the incidence of VTE after major lower limb orthopedic surgery. Few studies have examined the efficacy of combined anticoagulant and GCS therapy relative to anticoagulation alone for VTE prevention among patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A study involving patients undergoing THA in the UK revealed that the incidence of DVT or PE was not significantly different between patients receiving enoxaparin plus GCS compared to those receiving enoxaparin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this study was limited by its small sample size, with 32 patients randomized to each treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Among Swedish patients undergoing THA, combined treatment with dextran (infused at anesthesia and for 2&#x000a0;days following surgery) and GCS was more effective for postoperative DVT prevention than treatment with dextran alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although Japanese guidelines recommend the use of GCS with anticoagulation for prophylaxis among patients at the highest risk for VTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the efficacy of this combined treatment relative to anticoagulation alone for Japanese patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery has previously not been reported. The findings from the present study suggest that concomitant treatment with anticoagulation and GCS resulted in a &#x0003e;2-fold reduction in VTE incidence relative to anticoagulation alone among Japanese patients undergoing TKA, although this difference was not statistically significant. Addition of GCS therapy led to a numerically greater reduction in VTE incidence primarily among patients receiving enoxaparin, while this reduction was less pronounced among those receiving edoxaban. This difference may have arisen partly because edoxaban was started earlier in the postoperative period; as a result, there was a smaller margin for further reduction of VTE occurrence with the addition of GCS among patients treated with edoxaban. Given the limited number of patients in this analysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;201), and the delay in the initiation of anticoagulation with enoxaparin relative to edoxaban, these exploratory results need to be confirmed in larger, prospective, randomized trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To evaluate the efficacy of GCS for prevention of VTE, an exploratory analysis was performed by using data from a phase 3 clinical study of postoperative prophylaxis with edoxaban vs enoxaparin in patients undergoing TKA. The results of the analysis suggested that the occurrence of VTE was numerically lower among patients receiving anticoagulant plus GCS therapy relative to those receiving anticoagulation alone, although this difference was not statistically significant. Further studies are required to confirm the findings of this preliminary analysis. Additionally, due to the limitations of this analysis, further studies need to be performed to evaluate the relative prophylactic efficacy of combined anticoagulant and GCS therapy compared with anticoagulation alone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Medical writing and editorial support was provided by Sameera Kongara, PhD, of AlphaBioCom, LLC (King of Prussia, PA), which was sponsored by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors were involved in the design of the study and performed the research.
