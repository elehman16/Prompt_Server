Falling once doubles one&#x02019;s chances of falling again, making fall prediction an important aspect of preventative strategies. In this study, 22 older adults aged between 65 and 85 years were trained in the use of a smartphone-based fall prediction system. The system is designed to continuously assess fall risk by measuring various gait and balance parameters using a smart insole and smartphone, and is also designed to detect falls. The use case of the fall prediction system in question required the users to interact with the smartphone via an app for device syncing, data uploads, and checking system status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this study was to observe the effect that basic smartphone training could have on the user experience of a group that is not technically proficient with smartphones when using a new connected health system.

Owing to their interactive features, large storage capacity, communication capabilities, and ability to access large knowledge databases, smartphones can present a novel means to deliver health care to individuals in the home. Consequently, smartphones are being used to deliver an increasingly wide range of personal health care solutions [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although older adults have traditionally adopted new technology at lower rate than other age cohorts, the Pew Internet Research Center reports that the use of Internet technology by older adults is steadily increasing, with 2012 being the first year where more than half of people in the United States aged 65 years and older were using the Internet [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that older adults have a rich technology profile in terms of home appliances, TVs, PCs, and mobile phone apps and only differ from other technology using age groups in terms of Internet-based technology [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although today&#x02019;s older adults have better uptake of mobile technologies than previous older adult groups [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], contemporary mobile devices such as smartphones still present a substantial challenge for older adults [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These challenges can be a result of numerous factors such as unfamiliarity or fear of technology, lack of perceived usefulness (PU), lack of perceived ease of use (PEoU), diminished interactive capabilities, and poor usability characteristics of the devices in question [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Methodological steps can be taken during the design process for these devices to ensure that the demands of the device do not exceed the capabilities of the older adult user (ref). For example, steps can be taken to ensure that interface elements such as buttons and text are usable, the device navigation can be designed to ensure that basic tasks only require a small number of steps, and the supporting documentation can be presented in an intuitive and simple manner [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, these design aspects may not mitigate a new user&#x02019;s unfamiliarity with the device, and therefore, the potential for technology rejection may remain quite high [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This could have adverse effects when attempting to introduce smartphones to older adult users for the delivery of health care using an mHealth, telemedicine, or connected health infrastructure. In a previous study, a smartphone-based fall detection and prevention system was tested on a group of 39 older adult users over a 10-day period. Despite the system having undergone a full human-centered design process and the participants receiving adequate training on how to use the system, the system scored 70 of 100 on the System Usability Scale (SUS), indicating only average usability [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We suspected that unfamiliarity with smartphones and the specific demands of interaction with a smartphone, particularly the unique touch screen interactions required, may have led to poor usability outcomes. From this experience, we concluded that the outcomes of many trials and studies that involve the use of home health app design to run on smartphones could be compromised because of a lack of familiarity with the basic functioning of the device.</p><p>A period of pretrial introductory smartphone training in conjunction with concurrent recall-based learning tasks could present a potential solution to this problem. Effective training could provide a complete novice with a better chance of adopting the technology, thereby increasing the potential effectiveness of smartphone-based mHealth and connected health interventions for that person. In a study of a group of older adults who were being introduced to an mHealth pain management smartphone app, 61% of the participants cited &#x0201c;provide training on device use&#x0201d; as the main requirement if their potential use of the technology was to be enhanced and ultimately sustained, followed by 30% who cited &#x0201c;tailoring the device to the user&#x02019;s functional needs (ie, usability)&#x0201d; as the secondary requirement [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, we can conclude that twice as many participants felt that adequate introductory training was more important than enhancements to the design of the app in terms of usability. With this important finding in mind, this paper will provide an enumerative and detailed methodology to achieve this introductory training as efficiently as possible and therefore potentially mitigate any potential usability problems the technology may have.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>In this study, we trained 22 participants to use the same smartphone-based fall detection and prevention system, as described in the study by Stara et al [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], over a period of 5 days. This system is the Wireless Insole for Independent and Safe Elderly Living (WIISEL) system [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The system is designed to continuously assess fall risk by measuring various gait and balance parameters and is also designed to detect falls. The system is targeted at older adults who are at high risk of falling [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The system consists of a pair of instrumented insoles and a smartphone, which are worn by the user during daily activity. Data collected by embedded sensors in the insoles are sent to the smartphone and then uploaded via an Internet connection to a server in a clinic for processing and analysis. The data are presented in various ways to a specialist via a Web app and desktop-based gait analysis tool. The architecture of the system is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Wireless Insole for Independent and Safe Elderly Living (WIISEL) System.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="humanfactors_v5i2e18_fig1"/></fig><p>The 22 participants were instructed to carry out a number of specific tasks with the WIISEL smartphone app (see the Methods section for details of these tasks). Half of the participants were provided with additional concurrent training in the general use of the smartphone, which began 2 days before the trial and continued. Our hypothesis was that the group that received the additional smartphone training would have a better user experience with the system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the Galway city area. Twenty-two participants were recruited 74&#x000b1;5.5 years providing informed consent under ethical approval provided by University College Hospital Galway. Participants were split into 2 groups as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Whether a participant belongs to Group 1 (No extra training) or Group 2 (Extra training) was decided at random with 50% of participants belonging to each group.</p><p>All training was carried out in the participant&#x02019;s home by the lead researcher who followed the same protocol for each participant. The researcher visited the participants&#x02019; home each day to teach them new tasks and to observe them carrying out previously learned tasks. A systematic cuing hierarchy approach and a &#x0201c;think aloud&#x0201d; protocol [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were used by the lead researcher for the training procedure. These will be outlined in greater detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Technology Acceptance Indicators</title><p>To indicate how participants would fare with the introduction of the new technology, their current mobile technology capability was assessed. Participants were split into subgroups based on their previous experience with mobile technology to allow for further analysis. When it comes to classifying users based on their expertise or previous experience with mobile technology, there is no set classification system. Most so-called &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; users are simply users who have gained hands-on experience of using the technology and may not have used a user manual for their device [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, using an understanding of users&#x02019; prior technical knowledge to predict their future adoption of technology is well supported [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We classified the participants into 3 separate categories based on their observed performance in carrying of a series of simple functional tasks with their mobile device. The functional tasks were chosen as representing real-world use requirements of the mobile device and were sufficiently challenging to highlight differences in skill level among user groups [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The 3 categories are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>In this context, &#x0201c;feature phone&#x0201d; is a retronym used to describe low-end mobile phones which are limited in capabilities in contrast to smartphones, that is, they are phones that have basic call and short message service functionality but do not have extensive media or Internet capabilities<bold>.</bold></p><p>This procedure for practically dividing participants into technology experience groups is illustrated in the flowchart in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness</title><p>PEoU and PU are the 2 key usability indicators pertaining to technology design. The influence of PEoU and PU on behavioral intent, and hence technology adoption, has been supported for the use of technology by older adults and specifically for the use of communication technology [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To measure whether there was any correlation between either PU or PEoU and the eventual usability outcomes, we measured the participant&#x02019;s PEoU and PU of smartphone technology before the trial started. We used a 7-point Likert scale using items from the technology acceptance model [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to establish PU and PEoU.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participants were split into 2 groups based on what kind of training they would receive.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="1000" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="100" span="1"/><col width="150" span="1"/><col width="750" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Label</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No extra training</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Only receive smartphone training which is necessary to operate the WIISEL<sup>a</sup> app. This group used the WIISEL system in their home for 5 days.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Extra training</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">This group also used the WIISEL system in the home for 5 days, but received extra smartphone training which began 2 days before starting the WIISEL trial and continued for the first three days of the WIISEL trial.

The results show that overall Group 2 (Extra Training) had a more positive user experience with the WIISEL system according to the statistically significant difference observed in the SUS (and its subscales) scores between the two groups at the end of the 5-day use period. We observed that in the first 3 days of WIISEL use, Group 2 outperformed Group 1 (No extra training) in key usability categories such as errors committed, cues required, and ASQ scores. No significant difference was observed in task times between each group. It was observed that by the fourth day of use, both groups were recording similar performance metrics, implying that there was a ceiling effect, above which no extra smartphone training could have any significant influence on WIISEL use performance. On the basis of the evidence presented in the Results section, we can conclude that providing the users with extra systematic training on the device had a highly positive effect on user experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Observed Problems</title><p>We observed a number of recurring problems encountered by the older adult users in each group. These problems occurred with more frequency in Group 1, which resulted in poorer usability metric outcomes. We grouped these problems into 3 categories&#x02014;touch sensitivity, touch quality or accuracy, and user interface feedback. Within the first category, the users encountered problems when they held buttons for too long which would either deactivate the button press or initiate a secondary undesired function of the button. For example, holding a keypad letter for too long would input a number or symbols instead of letters. A related problem was observed when users were scrolling through a menu, such as in the settings page. Heavy touches while scrolling resulted in the user unintentionally entering an option (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Multimedia Appendix 4</xref>). The user would then quickly become lost as they would not recognize the screen they were now presented with.</p><p>Users unfamiliar with touch screens had a tendency to leave their touch finger hovering near the screen when they were not interacting with the screen, causing unintentional and sometimes unnoticed screen presses. Unintentional touches also occurred if the user gripped the phone incorrectly. Problems within the second category, touch quality or accuracy, included inaccurate button striking and poor quality striking. For example, there was tendency to aim too low when attempting to strike a button, usually owing to the angle at which the user held the screen (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Multimedia Appendix 5</xref>). This, at times, led to excessive tapping, where the user would rapidly tap the screen in the hope of hitting the button correctly, leading them to unintentionally press a button in close proximity or to inadvertently press a button on the next screen. Finally, inadequate or unrecognized feedback on screen caused problems for some users. For example, many touch screen elements do not look like traditional buttons with clearly marked borders. This caused problems with striking accuracy. Sometimes users did not recognize the subtle changes in color or form that indicated a button had been successfully pressed. Other buttons had strange shapes which the user did not recognize (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Multimedia Appendix 5</xref>), such as a triangle or an arrow for a send button, which led to hesitation and confusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Comments on Usability Metrics</title><p>The regression analysis performed on the usability metrics and how they affected the overall usability outcome from the SUS show that increased errors made and cues required were related to lower overall SUS scores. Increased ASQ scores (indicating greater task satisfaction) were related to higher SUS scores. Task completion times showed a weak to moderate relationship with SUS scores. This could be explained by the fact that many of the required tasks were not time intensive and had a very linear path toward the desired goal. Participants could not really &#x0201c;get lost&#x0201d; within a task or deviate too much from the optimum task path. Most participants who took longer to complete tasks did so because they were simply progressing at that pace. Therefore, task completion time may be a good indicator of overall usability and may depend on the context of the interaction and tasks involved.</p><p>With regard to the relationship between technology adoption predictors such as age, technology experience, and PU/PEoU on usability outcomes, we found no strong link for age and technology experience category although there was a moderate link for PU and PEoU.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and Recommendations Going Forward</title><p>Our methodology meant that the smartphone-specific training was maintained in parallel with the first 3 days of WIISEL training for Group 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). There is a concern that this concurrent exposure, rather than implementing a cut-off where the smartphone-specific training ceased before Group 2 began using the WIISEL app, affected the outcome of the WIISEL usability data for Group 2 owing to the group having more total smartphone exposure time during the WIISEL app exposure. However, this approach was chosen such that the participant could achieve the benefit of the training they received on days &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;1, by recalling what they had learned from day 0 onward and receiving the appropriate guidance to optimize the training [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is in this context that the participant achieves the benefit of the extra training, thereby improving their user experience and increasing their PEoU with the WIISEL system. We understand that for this training approach to be further operationalized, it may need to be streamlined or indeed undergo some structural changes. However, given the context of the study, we felt that our approach worked for the groups in question and allowed us to properly observe and measure their progress with the smartphone and the WIISEL app.</p><p>Regarding the specific problems we observed, we can make some instructional recommendations based on our training experience. These are presented in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Textbox 1</xref> and are presented within the categories of problems we identified in section Observed Problems.</p><p>Further to the specific recommendations for training older adults outlined in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Textbox 1</xref>, we can make some more general recommendations. First, when approaching the older adult population, it is important to consider any cultural resistance and concerns that could act as hindrance for the uptake of technology-enabled health care. In particular, security, intrusiveness, lack of control, confidentiality, and usability issues can lead to a lack of trust in such technologies. We can assume that some cases of technology rejection are because of a lack of proper, scaffolded (scaffolded learning of technology is the use of progressive steps to allow the learner to gain independence in their use of the technology), and systematic introduction to the new technology [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This planned exposure, which should come in the form of appropriate training, must achieve the desired positive impact within a short window in order for technology acceptance rather than technology rejection to occur. The training must not only overcome apprehensions about how difficult the technology is to use but must also overcome any misconceptions about how useful the technology is. Older adults, as with many other user groups, overwhelmingly reject technology when there is unclear evidence of personal benefit or improvement in quality of life [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A key strategy of the training is to build and increase the user&#x02019;s perception of and trust in the technology. Although instructional activities can take the form of written materials, computer-based programs, or face-to-face communications, our experience in this study shows the benefit of short, yet intensive, periods of task-based learning with direct corrective feedback. This approach may have applications in other domains such as mobile learning in education [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><caption><title>Recommendations for introducing smartphones to older adults.</title></caption><p>Category and Solution or Recommendation</p><p><bold>Touch sensitivity</bold></p><p>Instruct the user to</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Touch and not press the screen.

Our findings show the importance of properly introducing&#x02014;in a scaffolded and systematic fashion&#x02014;older adults to technology to improve their technology acceptance and enhance their user experience. Through our research in this specific context, we feel that it is possible to build or increase trust in connected, mobile, and wearable health technology through the design and deployment of meaningful instructional activities. Although there currently does not exist a structured training methodology for mHealth with older users, the methods and lessons learned in this paper can be used to conceptualize, design, and implement appropriate, bespoke training strategies. We understand that effort and time will not always be available to carry out training on a prolonged basis; however, scaffolded and structured intervention is necessary to ensure successful adoption of useful mHealth technology by elderly users. In addition to informing our future work, we hope the development of the WIISEL system and the guidelines and geragogical (geragogy is a theory which argues that older adults are sufficiently different that they warrant a separate educational theory) activities enumerated here will be widely used for those designing and developing connected health devices and infrastructure for older adults. More importantly, the involvement of end users is a key strategy for recognizing and removing barriers and mitigating design limitations, but our research has shown that this must be carefully planned to influence, drive, and refine systematically the iterative development of connected, mobile, and wearable health care technologies. We think this paper provides a useful enumerative approach to plan and conduct usability evaluations of smartphone apps and to gather user experience validation data, particularly in the domain of education and learning.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was partly funded by the EU FP7 project WIISEL (Wireless Insole for Independent and Safe Elderly Living; project number FP7-ICT-2011-288878).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>Authors' Contributions: The experiment was conceived by RH, GOL, and LRQ.
