Therefore, the current study focused on the cardiac remodelling from hypertrophy to fibrosis in old-aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and explored the therapeutic effects of Rosuvastatin and its possible mechanism(s) of action. Spontaneously hypertensive rats at age 52 weeks were randomly divided into three groups, the first two to receive Rosuvastatin at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the third to receive placebo, which was to be compared with Wistar-Kyoto as controls. After 2-month treatment, SBP, heart to body weight ratio (HW/BW%) and echocardiographic features were evaluated, followed by haematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining in conjunction with qPCR of foetal gene expressions. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay and immunofluorescent labelling for active caspase-3 were used to detect the apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Signaling pathways involved were examined by using western blot. Old-aged SHR developed end-stage hypertensive heart disease characterized by significant enhancement of HW/BW%, LVAWd and LVPWd, and decreased LVEF and LVFS, accompanied by cardiomyocytes enlargement and fibrosis along with activation of foetal gene programme. Cardiac apoptosis increased significantly during the transition process.

These pathological changes might be the consequence of activation of AT<sub>1</sub> Receptor-PKC&#x003b2;2/&#x003b1;-ERK-c-fos and AKT-FOXO1/Bcl-2/survivin/Caspase3 signaling. Rosuvastatin effectively attenuated the structural changes by reversing the signaling transductions involved.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>old-aged spontaneously hypertensive rats</kwd><kwd>cardiac remodelling</kwd><kwd>hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Rosuvastatin</kwd><kwd>3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Arterial hypertension, a major health problem for its high frequency and concomitant risks of the cardiovascular system, has been identified as the leading risk factor for cardiac mortality, ranked third as a cause of disability-adjusted life years [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cardiac remodelling including ventricular hypertrophy and the subsequent congestive heart failure are the common outcome of human essential hypertension [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The consequent cardiac malfunction leads to poor clinical prognosis and ultimately cardiovascular-related death. During the pathophysiological progress, cardiac apoptosis has been reported as one of the reasons for reduced myocardial mass [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the exact role of apoptosis in cardiac remodelling during the end-stage hypertensive heart disease has remained unknown.</p><p>The HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most commonly prescribed agents for hyperlipidemia. In addition to their lipid-lowering action, statins exert important effects on the cardiovascular system [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as indicated by the heart function restoration in the hypertensive patients with or without coronary diseases observed by clinical trials [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These effects are independent of lipid-lowering effect [<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms of these beneficial effects are not completely clear. Furthermore, JUPITER trial suggested that Rosuvastatin could effectively decrease C-reactive protein level, thereby reducing cardiovascular event rates [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which has provoked furthermore studies on the potential effects of Rosuvastatin.</p><p>The present study was divided into three parts: Firstly, we observed the transition of myocardium from hypertrophy to fibrosis in old-aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs); next, we sought to determine the possible mechanisms and underlying signaling pathways involved in the cardiac remodelling during the end stage of hypertension in SHRs; finally, we examined our hypothesis that Rosuvastatin could reverse the impairments in the end-stage hypertensive heart disease by investigating the candidate signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Twenty-one adult male SHRs at age 52 weeks, weighing approximately 300 g and seven Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were obtained from and bred on standard chow at Animal Administration Center of Fudan University.

Cardiac apoptosis has been reported as one of the reasons for reduced myocardial mass. However, the exact role of apoptosis in cardiac remodelling from hypertrophy to fibrosis during the end-stage hypertensive heart disease remained unknown. The present study provided functional, structural and molecular evidence for the cardiac remodelling, from hypertrophy to fibrosis and ultimately heart failure, during the end-stage hypertensive heart disease in SHRs. Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were significantly reversed in SHR + LD and SHR + HD, as indicated by echocardiography, haematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson Trichrome staining and the altered expressions of ANP and SAA. The consistent SBP among the three SHR groups indicated that Rosuvastatin acted on the myocardium without changing it significantly. Its anti-hypertrophic effects were accompanied by the decreased expression of AT<sub>1</sub> receptor on cardiac myocytes, and the suppression of PKC&#x003b2;2 and PKC&#x003b1; activation, ERK phosphorylation and c-fos expression. These findings indicated that Rosuvastatin may favourably modify the development of cardiac remodelling by affecting the outside-in signaling of the local rennin-angiotensin system on the cardiac cells. Furthermore, we revealed the crucial role of cardiac apoptosis in cardiac remodelling during the end-stage hypertensive heart disease by TUNEL staining and active caspase-3 immunofluorescent labelling, and found the anti-apoptotic effects of Rosuvastatin, which involved the attenuation of the three anti-apoptotic pathways: AKT-FOXO1, Bcl Family and survivin signaling, which contributed together to the final down-regulation of caspase-3. These findings indicated that Rosuvastatin might prevent the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure <italic>via</italic> its anti-apoptotic effect.</p><p>High blood pressure stimulates both fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes to express cytokines such as angiotensin II and results in hypertrophy and fibrosis [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Reduction in SBP could attenuate these pathological changes and improve the prognosis of patients with cardiac malfunction, which has been supported by numerous randomized studies, such as ACCOMPLISH, ADVANCE, HYVET and PRoFESS [<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Statins have been reported to reverse cardiac remodelling; however, there have been controversies on their anti-hypertensive effects. Loch and Saka reported that statin treatment failed to alter blood pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive rats [<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, Susic <italic>et al</italic>. proved that statin reduced total peripheral vascular resistance in both SHR and WKY/L-NAME rats [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and resulted in a reduction in blood pressure. In the current study, no significant changes in SBP were observed in the three SHR groups. It could be that 52-week-old SHRs had developed severe perivascular fibrosis, arterial stiffness and endothelial compromise. In this case, Rosuvastatin, possessing weak anti-hypertensive effect, could not alter significantly the peripheral resistance and the resultant SBP. Prandin MG also pointed out that the confounding factors, such as age and baseline SBP, might influence the blood pressure of each individual [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, differences in animal models, statins and experimental protocols might account for these divergent findings. In the current study, nevertheless, the consistent SBP demonstrated that Rosuvastatin was capable of attenuating cardiac hypertrophy without changing SBP levels. In addition, different loading conditions would interfere with LVEF and LVFS. The consistent SBP indicated the LV function was significantly reversed by Rosuvastatin without interference of the after-load difference.</p><p>In the present study, SHR + LD and SHR + HD developed a reduction of cardiac remodelling to a certain degree. The correlation observed between the doses of Rosuvastatin and the levels of regression further supported the therapeutic effect of Rosuvastatin, even without statistical significance in some cases, providing more evidence for Rosuvastatin as a modulator of the pathological changes in myocardium. However, previous studies concerning the effects of Rosuvastatin on cardiac remodelling have been controversial. Luo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that statins could reduce cardiac mass and ventricular collagen concentration in rats [<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and exerted its antioxidant effects by Rac1 inhibition [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Conversely, Frohlich <italic>et al</italic>. noted no effect of Rosuvastatin on cardiovascular mass and collagen deposition in 20-week-old SHR with Rosuvastatin treatment [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, Chang <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that Rosuvastatin could have limited therapeutic value when used to prevent progression from LV hypertrophy (LVH) to heart failure in Dahl-Iwai salt-sensitive hypertensive hearts [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is noteworthy that differences in animal models and experimental protocols might lead to different conclusions. In Chang's study, Dahl-Iwai salt-sensitive rats used as a model of hypertensive cardiomyopathy, with salt-induced hypertension [<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], might respond to Rosuvastatin by means other than AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Comparatively, SHR, in which RAS activity was characteristically altered [<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], might respond to Rosuvastatin <italic>via</italic> AT<sub>1</sub> receptor and its downstream signaling pathways, as indicated in our study. This might explain the different results and further supported the possible mechanisms of Rosuvastatin <italic>via</italic> AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. It can also be that the severity of cardiac remodelling and different degrees of pathological changes in SHRs may be responsible for these divergent findings. These outcome suggest that the time of statins administration might be crucial to the management of hypertensive heart disease.</p><p>Clinically, the therapeutic effects of statins on cardiac remodelling have also been controversial. Many nonrandomized studies have suggested that the use of statins is associated with preserved LV function, reduced adverse cardiovascular events and better outcome in patients with LV dysfunction [<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated the veterans who were treated with statin at any time after the diagnosis of heart failure were much less likely to suffer all-cause mortality with mean follow-up of 2.66 years [<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Conversely, in John Kjekshus' trial, even Rosuvastatin could reduce the total number of hospitalizations for heart failure, but produced no effect on heart failure mortality [<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The UNIVERSE trials also failed to demonstrate an therapeutic effect of statin on LV remodelling in patients with chronic heart failure [<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. One of the reasons might be that those enrolled had been well treated for heart failure with a standard therapy other than Rosuvastatin, which reduced significantly the population with potentially fatal heart failure enrolled in the trial. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, the commonly prescribed anti-heart failure medications, which could also affect the local RAS, might interfere with the observation of the therapeutic effects of Rosuvastatin. It can also be that the patients' follow-up was not long enough to see a beneficial effect of treatment. In addition, the patients in these trials, with heart failure of ischaemic or non-ischaemic aetiology, were not differentially enrolled, and those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure were excluded, Thus, different inclusion and exclusion criteria can cause different pathophysiological and etiological changes in heart failure, confusing the consistence of the results in the cohort, and study durations and different methods might be responsible for these divergent conclusions.</p><p>The tissue renin-angiotensin system has been demonstrated by several studies as an independent risk factor for cardiac remodelling and congestive heart failure during the development of essential hypertension. Fabris and Kossmehl suggested that angiotensin II stimulation of AT<sub>1</sub> receptors in the heart <italic>in vivo</italic> can be associated with an increased rate of apoptosis, suggesting RAS activation might lead to cardiac apoptosis [<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nickening <italic>et al</italic>. reported that statins exert protective effects on hypertensive patients, such as effectively retrieving heart function, the mechanisms of which might involve RAS suppression [<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, we postulated that Rosuvastatin could exert a beneficial effect on cardiac remodelling by interfering with apoptosis <italic>via</italic> tissue AT<sub>1</sub> receptor expressed on the myocardial cells of hypertensive patients. We observed lower percentages of TUNEL-positive and active caspase 3-positive cells in myocardium, accompanied by an elevated expression of Akt-FOXO1, Bcl-2 family and survivin signaling upon treatment. We also found that AT<sub>1</sub> receptors on myocaridac cells were suppressed. Therefore, we provided convincible evidence proving that Rosuvastatin can reverse cardiac apoptosis during cardiac remodelling, and slower the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure [<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] <italic>via</italic> local RAS depression and apoptotic signaling regulation.</p><p>Our study is not devoid of limitations. The doses of Rosuvastatin were much higher in SHRs than those in clinical patients. However, the physiological relevance of the findings cannot be belittled even though higher doses are generally administered in animal studies for better therapeutic effects in a short period. As SBP was not changed by treatment in the current study, it seems unlikely that changes in SBP are central to the attenuation of cardiac remodelling in SHR by Rosuvastatin, but clinically, SBP lowering is taken into consideration at first. In addition, Rosuvastatin was exclusively applied to the animal model; therefore, its potential therapeutic effect on the end-stage hypertensive heart disease may not apply to the patients who have undergone standard treatments.</p><p>Conclusively, statins have many pleiotropic effects beyond lipid lowering, including decreasing oxygen radicals production [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], inhibition of inflammatory responses [<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], stimulating stem cells [<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and even attenuation of myocardial fibrosis <italic>via</italic> microRNAs [<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It can be concluded from the present study that anti-apoptosis <italic>via</italic> AT<sub>1</sub> receptors and the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, and the subsequent prevention of the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to fibrosis, and ultimately to heart failure we discovered can be one of the pleiotropic effects, which can make statins of potential benefit to patients with LVH and even with heart failure of both iscahemic and nonischaemic aetiologies of which hypertension is the main risk factor [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Outstanding Youth Grant from National Natural Science Foundation of China (30725036).
