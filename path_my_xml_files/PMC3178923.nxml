The study included 72 cases in the age group of 17-66 years, comprising 39 males and 33 females. The patients were randomized into two groups of 36 patients each.

Acute, severe abdominal pain indicates rupture, biliary complications, or secondary bacterial infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Ultrasonography is the best diagnostic tool as it can detect cysts as small as 1 cm in diameter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] On the basis of ultrasonographic findings, Gharby <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] have classified hydatid cysts of liver into five types. Type 1- pure fluid collection with well-defined borders, Type 11- pure fluid collection with a split wall, Type 111- fluid collection with multiple septa (honeycomb appearance), Type 1V- heterogenous appearance, and Type V- cyst with reflecting thick walls (calcified cyst). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen has a sensitivity of 100% in detecting liver cyst and helps in accurate anatomic localization of cysts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Various serological tests have been used for diagnosis of hydatid disease, including complement fixation test, immunoelectrophoresis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among these tests, ELISA is the most widely used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Hydatid cyst of the liver can be managed either by nonoperative or operative methods. Operative methods may be conservative or radical. Nonoperative methods include chemotherapy and percutaneous treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Chemotherapy can be used as an adjuvant to surgical treatment preoperatively or postoperatively, or both. A preoperative course of chemotherapy sterilizes the cysts and reduces their tension, making surgery easier. A short course of chemotherapy after surgery reduces the risk of recurrence. Bekhti <italic>et al</italic>. were the first to report successful results of chemotherapy of hydatid disease by using mebendazole.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Albendazole is another benzimidazole carbamate with better absorption properties. It has been noted that its metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, is active against protoscoleces of echinococcus granulosus in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, and can penetrate the hydatid cysts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] When the therapeutic results of the two drugs are compared, albendazole has been found to be better than mebendazole.</p><p>The aim of our study was to assess the effect of preoperative albendazole therapy on the viability of protoscoleces at the time of surgery and the effect of preoperative and postoperative use of albendazole on the recurrence rate of hydatid disease of the liver. The confirmation was made by demonstrating hydatid material&#x02014;sand, hooklets, protoscoleces, or daughter cysts&#x02014;at the time of surgery.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in the Department of General Surgery at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Kashmir, on the patients admitted with diagnosis of hydatid liver from January 2002 to December 2003, with further follow-up for another 5 years. Patients were included in the study after a proper informed written consent was taken. The infected cysts, ruptured cysts, densely calcified cysts (type V cyst), liver cyst with associated extrahepatic cysts, patients with multiple cysts, and female patients who were pregnant or intended to conceive during the study period were excluded from the study.</p><p>A total of 72 patients were studied. These patients were randomized into two groups of 36 patients each by systematic random sampling. In group A (<italic>n</italic>=36), the patients were directly taken for surgery, while in group B (<italic>n</italic>=36), patients were put on preoperative albendazole therapy for 12 weeks with subsequent surgery, followed by postoperative course of albendazole for another 12 weeks.</p><p>All patients were subjected to detailed history taking, physical, and systemic examination. All patients underwent various investigations such as hemogram, kidney function test, liver function test, coagulogram, electrocardiography, and X-ray of chest. Ultrasonography was the major tool for diagnosis. All patients were subjected to ELISA for hydatidosis. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen was performed in cases in which results of ultrasonography were equivocal. Patients were administered albendazole at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day in divided doses. All patients put on chemotherapy were initially monitored weekly, and thereafter monthly by liver function test, kidney function tests, white cell and platelet counts, and urine analysis.</p><p>A right subcostal approach was used in all patients for surgical intervention. The principles of operative management include adequate exposure of the cyst, safe decompression and prevention of intraoperative contamination by use of active scolicidal agents. We used 1% povidone iodine as the scolicidal agent. Cyst contents were collected in all cases for cytological and bacteriological examination. The cyst fluid was centrifuged and examined for the fragments of laminated membrane, hooklets, and scolices. Viability assessment of the cysts was performed by observing the motility of the scolices and their ability to exclude 5% eosin, under immediate microscopy. Scolices that were motile and did not stain with eosin were considered live [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], while scolices that were immotile and stained with 5% eosin were considered dead [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

During ultrasonographic examination, other abdominal organs were examined to exclude recurrent cyst formation. In case of any doubt, CT abdomen was done. Radiograph of chest was done at 6-month intervals to look for any hydatid disease in the lung. Hydatid serology IgG and IgM by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was done every 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Stastistical analysis</title><p>In addition to descriptive statistics, standard statistical methods were used for data analysis.

Both these drugs belong to benzimidazole carbamate group of antibiotics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Albendazole given preoperatively in a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 1 month kills most of the protoscoleces within the hepatic hydatid cyst.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] However, better results have been reported after 3 months of uninterrupted treatment with albendazole.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The usual dosage scheme for albendazole, suggested by Horton (1989) and endorsed by World Health Organization (WHO) is, three 28-day courses of 10 mg/kg/day in divided doses seperated by 2-week intervals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] These benzimidazole carbamate groups of drugs act by blocking glucose uptake in the parasite and depletion of its glycogen stores.</p><p>Praziquantel is another drug used against hydatid cyst liver disease in the dose of 40-60 mg/kg/day in divided doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] It is the most active and rapid scolicidal agent. It is highly effective against protoscolices.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Praziquantel is probably an ideal agent for prophylaxis in the preoperative and postoperative setting to prevent implantation of protoscoleces and subsequent recurrence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] It is unlikely to be as effective as albendazole in treating whole cyst, as it is less active against germinal layer of the hydatid cyst.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Chemotherapy is effective in small cysts with diameter less than 4 cm, those with thin walls; this is also effective in younger patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] It is indicated in patients who are at high risk for surgery, in patients with multiple peritoneal cysts, cysts in multiple organs, bone cysts, cyst in brain, to prevent secondary echinococcosis after spillage during surgery and as a concomitant therapy with percutaneous drainage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Recently, percutaneous drainage of hydatid cysts, popularly known as the puncture, aspiration, installation of scolicidal agent and reaspiration (PAIR) technique, has been used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>A prospective study was carried out to determine the role of albendazole in the management of hydatid disease of the liver. Albendazole used in the dose of 10 mg/kg/day in divided doses as an adjuvant therapy to surgical treatment significantly improved the results in our patients. Cyst viability at the time of surgery was significantly decreased in patients in whom albendazole was used preoperatively, as was demonstrated by the motility of the scolices and their ability to exclude 5% eosin under immediate microscopy. Of the patients who received preoperative albendazole for 3 months, only 2 (5.55%) patients had viable cysts at the time of surgery as compared to 94.55% of patients who did not receive any preoperative alblendazole therapy. This decrease in cyst viability was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and indicates that 3 months of preoperative course of albendazole kills most of protoscoleces within hydatid cysts.</p><p>In our study, only two patients had viable cysts and in both patients, cysts contained multiple daughter cysts. Protoscoleces in the main cyst were dead, while in daughter cysts, these were viable. It is because preoperative albendazole while being successful in killing the parasites within the mother cyst is not fully effective in eradicating the scolices in the daughter cysts. This may be due to poor penetration of the drug into the daughter cysts enclosed within the mother cyst.</p><p>Our results and observations are in agreement with several previous studies. Sajad Hussain Arif <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] conducted a study involving 64 patients. Of these, 32 patients were directly taken for surgery, while another 32 patients were put on preoperative albendazole for 8 weeks at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Of those patients who received preoperative albendazole, only 9.37% patients had viable cysts at the time of surgery as compared to 96.87% patients who did not receive any preoperative albendazole. In patients who did not receive any albendazole therapy, the recurrence rate was 16.66%, while no recurrence was seen in patients who received albendazole therapy. Morris[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] managed 16 patients with preoperative albendazole at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day for a variable period of 1 week to 1 month. Of the 14 patients who received albendazole for 1 month or more before operation, only one had viable protoscoleces. In contrast, each of the two remaining patients who received therapy for only one and three weeks had liver disease at the time of operation. Horton[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] treated 500 patients with 800 mg of albendazole daily in cycles of 28 days with a drug-free interval of 2 weeks between the cycles for a mean duration of 2.5 cycles. A recurrence rate of 18.75% was noticed over a follow-up period of 5-6 months in patients who did not receive any albendazole, while preoperative use of albendazole was found to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence to 4.16%.</p><p>During a follow-up period of 5 years, there was no recurrence in any of our patients treated with albendazole therapy. This is in agreement with observations made by Evangelos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] who treated 67 patients having liver hydatidosis with preoperative mebendazole at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day (18 patients) or albendazole at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day in 49 patients for 5 days before surgery. This was followed by a 1-month course of the same benzimidazole in patients with viable protoscloleces at the time of surgery. None of these patients had any recurrence of disease after a follow-up of 15-67 months (average, 41 months).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Mottaghlan and Saidi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] observed a recurrence of 11.3% over a period of 6 months to 3 years in a study comprising 106 patients. Little <italic>et al</italic>. observed a recurrence rate of 22% in his study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Morris in 1989 observed no recurrence in patients treated with preoperative albendazole for 1 month, with a median postoperative follow-up of 28 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Preoperative and postoperative use of albendazole decreases the viability of cysts at the time of surgery and significantly reduces the chances of cyst recurrence.
