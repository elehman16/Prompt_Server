vertical-vibration training on the balance and gait of patients with stroke. [Subjects and
Methods] A sample population of 20 subjects was randomly divided into 2 groups: the
horizontal-vibration group and the vertical-vibration group. We evaluated the Berg Balance
Scale (BBS) score, Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test results, and 10-meter Walk Test (10MWT)
results at 3 times points: before the training, 3 weeks after the training, and 6 weeks
after the training. [Results] The BBS score, TUG test result, and 10MWT result differed
significantly among the subjects in the vertical-vibration group. However, only the BBS
score differed significantly among the subjects in the horizontal-vibration group.
[Conclusion] The vibration training used in this study heightened the activity of the
trunk muscles and improved balance ability of the patients. In particular, we recommend
the vertical-vibration training because dynamic movements such as gait improved the
balance ability through activation of the trunk stabilizer muscles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Vibration</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>General problems after a stroke include weakening of the muscles strength and loss of
abdominal muscle elasticity and sensation. Such problems can restrict daily activities such
as maintenance of balance and gait<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, balance abnormalities trigger social problems, such as falls and difficulty in the
maintenance of independence.</p><p>The ultimate goal of stroke rehabilitation is to reduce the dependence on others for daily
activities, and balance ability is important for the attainment of this goal<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Akuthota and Nadler<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that the core muscles act as a unit, similar to muscle
corsets and stabilize the body, particularly the spine, regardless of the movement of the 4
extremities. These muscles also maintain postural alignment and dynamic posture equilibrium
during functional activities.</p><p>Exercises using a Blade (Mad Dogg Athletics, USA) enables type I and type II muscle
strengthening exercises. Such strengthening exercises enable the body to move against
gravity and stabilize the deep muscles of the body, and thereby support the body and prepare
it for rigorous movements. In addition, exercises using a Blade enables continuous working
of the muscles, improving muscle endurance, and thereby enables long-distance movement at a
high speed through improvement of the muscle strength, balance, and coordination
ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many researchers have shown that the combination of vibration training and other treatments
is effective for balance ability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and have applied repetitive sensation
stimuli and vibration training during rehabilitation of patients with cerebral palsy and
scoliosis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, research on the
application of vibration training for the rehabilitation of patients with stroke is lacking.
Therefore, this study examined the effects of vibration training on the balance and gait
ability of patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty patients with hemiplegia who had been diagnosed with a stroke &#x02265;6 months before the
study on the basis of the results of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were
enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: ability to understand and
follow the researcher&#x02019;s directions and a Mini-Mental State Examination-Korea score of &#x02265;24
points. The purpose of the study was explained to the subjects, and their consent for
participation was obtained. The subjects signed an informed consent form. This study was
approved by the institutional review board of Daegu University.</p><p>The subjects, comprising 5 men and 15 women, were randomly and equally assigned to a
horizontal-vibration group and a vertical-vibration group. Their average &#x000b1; standard
deviation age was 73.46 &#x000b1; 3.94&#x02005;years. Nine subjects showed left-sided paresis, whereas
11subjects showed right-sided paresis. Their average duration since they first sustained a
stroke was 18.11 &#x000b1; 13.04 months. The subjects&#x02019; average height was 163.9 &#x000b1; 6.11&#x02005;cm, and their
average weight was 57.93 &#x000b1; 7.83&#x02005;kg. The 2 groups did not differ significantly in terms of
their general characteristics (p &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Both the groups received basic exercise treatment 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Each
training treatment comprised vibration for 10&#x02005;s repeated 10 times per set for 10 sets, in
total.</p><p>The Blade was used as the training tool. The Blade is frequently used to stabilize the core
and may be applied for multiple types of motions. It is used to increase muscle strength,
improve body stabilization, and increase muscle endurance.</p><p>The subjects in the vertical-vibration group held the Blade vertically with 1 hand and
moved it to the right and left side, whereas those in the horizontal-vibration group held
the Blade horizontally with 1 hand and moved it upward and downward.</p><p>For the measurement of balance, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score, Timed Up-and-Go test
(TUG) results, and 10-meter Walk Test (10MWT) results were obtained. Each measurement was
recorded at 3 times points: before the training, 3 weeks after the training, and 6 weeks
after the training.</p><p>The BBS objectively evaluates the static balance ability and dynamic balance ability and
may be divided into 3 areas: sitting, standing, and postural changes. It is a highly valid
tool for patients with stroke. The TUG test measures functional mobility and movement
ability. For this test, each subject was seated on a chair. The time taken for the subjects
to stand up once signaled to do so, turn at the 3-m turning point in front of them and then
sit down on the chair again, was measured. The 10MWT measures gait speed during a 10-m walk
in a straight line. The 10MWT result can be used as a measure of mobility in patients with
stroke, and its validity and reliability have been verified.</p><p>For the statistical analyses, PASW Statistics 18.0 for Windows was used. For within- group
comparisons, repeated analysis of variance was used. An independent t-test was employed to
compare the differences between the groups. The statistical significance level was set at p
= 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The BBS measurement significantly differed among the subjects in each group (p &#x0003c; 0.05).
The TUG test and 10MWT results significantly differed among the subjects in the
vertical-vibration training (p &#x0003c; 0.05). At each time points, the BBS score, TUG test
result, and 10MWT result did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (p &#x0003e; 0.05)

patients 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Marigold et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that patients with hemiplegia experience a loss of sense of
balance and encounter problems with postural sway, which is potentially debilitating because
trunk stability plays an important role in the maintenance of balance.</p><p>Many studies have concluded that activation of the trunk muscles improves balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and in the present study, the BBS score of the subjects in both our study groups increased.
Moreside et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the activities
of multiple trunk muscles by using electromyography while the subjects performed
horizontal-vibration exercises with both the hands and vertical-vibration exercises with 1
hand. The results showed that the activities of the internal oblique abdominal muscle and
external oblique abdominal muscle were the highest when the subjects performed the
vertical-vibration exercises with 1 hand. In addition, a study by Daniel et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> in which the muscle activity was measured
when the subjects performed horizontal and vertical exercises using the Blade while seated,
found that the differences in the muscle activity according to posture were unremarkable,
but the differences in the muscle activity according to the vibration direction were
remarkable. During vertical-vibration exercises, the activities of the internal oblique
abdominal muscle and external oblique abdominal muscle were the highest, whereas during
horizontal-vibration exercises, the activity of the erector spinae muscle, latissimus dorsi
muscle, and rectus abdominis muscle were the highest. These results suggest that vibration
training heightens the activity of the trunk muscles and improves balance ability.</p><p>Ress et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that vibration
training was effective for the improvement of muscle strength and functional movement of the
lower extremities, and Pollock<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> observed
that vibration training for 8 weeks was effective for gait improvement. In the present
study, a change in the TUG test and 10MWT results was observed in the vertical- vibration
group. Vertical vibration affects the adductor muscle, and the muscle of the chest, back,
shoulder and hip joints, and the entire upper and lower extremities, and creates muscle
stability during rotation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sung<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that trunk stability was achieved
by anticipatory movements through pelvic movement and trunk adjustment ability. Stevens et
al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that the external
oblique abdominal muscle maintains spinal neutrality against gravity during movement. In the
present study, a significant difference in all of the 3 measurements was observed in only
the vertical- vibration group, and the reason for this difference may be that dynamic
movement such as gait improved balance ability through activation of the trunk stabilizer
muscles. The results of the present study verified that training using the Blade positively
affected the subjects&#x02019; balance and gait, and thus, it can be considered an efficient
treatment method to improve balance ability of patients with stroke. Further studies in a
larger sample size are necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of motor imagery training on gait ability of
