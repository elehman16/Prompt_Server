Participants were randomized (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to begin glargine or NPH, on background of metformin with glimepiride. Weekly insulin titration aimed to achieve median prebreakfast and nocturnal plasma glucose levels &#x02264;5.5&#x02009;mmol/l, while limiting values &#x02264;4.4&#x02009;mmol/l.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The efficacy population (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;701) had a mean age of 57 years, a mean body mass index of 29.8&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a mean duration of diabetes of 9.2&#x02009;years and a mean HbA1c level of 8.2% (66&#x02009;mmol/mol). At treatment end, HbA1c values and the proportion of participants with HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0 % (&#x0003c;53&#x02009;mmol/mol) were not significantly different for glargine [7.1 % (54&#x02009;mmol/mol) and 50.3%] versus NPH [7.2 % (55&#x02009;mmol/mol) and 44.3%]. The rate of symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia, confirmed by plasma glucose &#x02264;3.9 or &#x02264;3.1&#x02009;mmol/l, was 29 and 48% less with glargine than with NPH insulin.

If insulin dosage is limited by observed or anticipated hypoglycaemia, this practice could lead to earlier cessation of titration of NPH insulin and hence higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.

A meta-regression analysis of combined HbA1c and hypoglycaemia outcomes confirms this approach <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>; however, no clinical trial has attempted to show whether basal insulin analogues are superior to NPH for HbA1c when the hypoglycaemia rate with NPH is reduced to the same level as with insulin glargine.</p><p>In the present paper, we report the results of the LAntus versus NPH: Comparison in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve people not adequately controlled with at Least One Oral Antidiabetic Drug Treatment (LANCELOT) Study. This study attempted to show the superiority of insulin glargine over NPH insulin on the change in HbA1c from baseline after 36 weeks, by applying a new concept for titrating basal insulin based on nocturnal as well as fasting glucose values, with specific focus on the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycaemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Participants</title><p>Eligible candidates for this study were insulin-na&#x000ef;ve men and women with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for &#x0003e;1&#x02009;year, aged 30&#x02013;70 years, with a body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;40.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and an HbA1c level &#x02265;7.0&#x02013;10.5% (&#x0003e;54&#x02013;90&#x02009;mmol/mol). Oral glucose-lowering drug doses [metformin (&#x02265;1000&#x02009;mg/day), sulfonylurea, glinide or &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitor] had to be stable for &#x02265;3&#x02009;months.

This 36-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study was conducted at 74 sites in 16 countries in Europe (nine), Asia (three), the Middle East (two) and South America (two) between July 2009 and July 2012. A 2-week run-in period was followed by a 36-week treatment period, with randomization using an interactive voice-response/interactive web response system. Safety data were collected for a further week. Three study visits were required after baseline in the first 8 weeks, then four more up to 36 weeks. These were supplemented by nine (or more, as required) further telephone contacts. At the start of the run-in period, all people not on glimepiride were started on it; other oral glucose-lowering drugs except metformin were discontinued. The glimepiride dose was 2&#x02009;mg once daily, or less if this was not tolerated. There were no protocol-specified changes to metformin dosage.</p></sec><sec><title>Insulins and Dose Titration</title><p>Randomization was in equal numbers to either insulin glargine or NPH insulin, to be given once daily in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00&#x02009;hours. Insulin glargine was injected using a Lantus SoloSTAR insulin pen (Sanofi, Paris, France), NPH insulin with a prefilled Insuman Basal Optiset pen (Sanofi). The recommended starting insulin dose was 0.2 U/kg.</p><p>Self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) assessment was performed daily with a sponsor-supplied meter and reagent strips (AccuChek&#x000ae;; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Nocturnal tests taken &#x002dc;5&#x02013;6&#x02009;h after insulin administration were recommended before each titration.</p><p>A systematic dose-titration regimen was advised based on both prebreakfast [fasting plasma glucose (FPG)] and nocturnal SMPG levels (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>), with a goal of 4.4&#x02013;5.5&#x02009;mmol/l at both times. The insulin dose was to be adjusted weekly during weeks 1&#x02013;4, twice weekly during weeks 5&#x02013;12, and then weekly up to week 36. The median of the last three prebreakfast glucose measurements (unless one value was &#x02264;4.4&#x02009;mmol/l) was used for dose titration, together with the last nocturnal glucose measurement. A measurement &#x0003c;4.4&#x02009;mmol/l at either time called for reduction of insulin by two units. Additionally if prebreakfast glucose was &#x0003c;2.8&#x02009;mmol/l the dose was to be decreased by 2 U and remain at the lower dose for 1, 2 or 3 weeks, depending if this was the first, second or third such occurrence. In the event of severe hypoglycaemia or HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6.0% (42&#x02009;mmol/mol) no insulin dose increase was allowed for the remainder of the study. An international dose-titration committee reviewed SMPG values and insulin doses on an ongoing basis via a website and the study investigators were contacted by e-mail if titration was inadequate.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Insulin dose-titration algorithm used for both insulins throughout the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Fasting plasma glucose<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02264;4.4&#x02009;mmol/l or symptomatic hypoglycaemia</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;4.4 to &#x02264;5.5&#x02009;mmol/l</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;5.5 to &#x02264;7.8&#x02009;mmol/l</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;7.8 mmol/l</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nocturnal plasma glucose</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02264;4.4&#x02009;mmol/l or symptomatic hypoglycaemia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2 U</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;4.4 to &#x02264;5.5&#x02009;mmol/l</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;5.5 to &#x02264;7.8&#x02009;mmol/l</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+2 U</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;7.8&#x02009;mmol/l</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+2 U</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+4 U</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="n1"><p>All data are dose change per injection.

The main secondary objectives were to compare the following between treatment groups: time profile of HbA1c, FPG, nocturnal SMPG, and eight-point SMPG profiles, percentage of participants achieving HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0 or &#x0003c;6.5% (&#x0003c;53 or &#x0003c;47&#x02009;mmol/mol), daily dose of insulin, prandial insulin use at 6 months as rescue medication, change in body weight from baseline, incidence and rate of hypoglycaemia (symptomatic diurnal and nocturnal, asymptomatic and severe), overall safety and treatment satisfaction. The last was measured using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, maximum score 36 points <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>It was estimated that at least 568 evaluable participants (670 were randomized with 15% not assessable) needed to be randomized to detect a difference in change of HbA1c of 0.3% (3.3&#x02009;mmol/mol) at the 5% significance level with 90% power. This assumes a standard deviation (s.d.) of change of HbA1c of 1.1% (12&#x02009;mmol/mol).</p><p>Efficacy analyses (which did not include hypoglycaemia) were assessed in the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population; namely, all randomized participants who received study medication and had at least one postbaseline assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy variable. Additional efficacy analyses were performed for the per protocol population, a subset of the modified ITT population that excluded those with a major protocol violation. Other analyses, including hypoglycaemia, were performed for the safety population, comprising all randomized and treated individuals. Missing efficacy and safety values were imputed with the last observation carried forward method for the end of treatment value, defined as the last postbaseline value available during the on-treatment period.</p><p>Change from baseline in HbA1c, FPG, eight-point plasma glucose profiles, mean daily plasma glucose level and body weight was accessed using analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova)</sc>, with treatment as a fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate. For those with incomplete data at 36 weeks, the last study observation was used. The proportion of participants having at least one episode of hypoglycaemia was compared between treatments using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. The event rate for each type of hypoglycaemia was analysed using a generalized linear model based on Poisson or negative binomial distributions.</p><p>Univariate and multivariate analyses (stepwise regression model) were performed to identify potential factors that predict a successful primary outcome. The candidate explanatory variables were gender, country, age, BMI and number of glucose-lowering medications at screening, and diabetes duration and HbA1c at baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participant Flow and Characteristics</title><p>Of 1102 people screened, 708 were randomized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Table S1</xref>), four of whom did not receive study treatment, while three others did not have a further measurement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Figure S1</xref>), yielding 352 on insulin glargine and 349 on NPH insulin in the modified ITT population.

Various algorithms for dose titration have been used and published, and indeed recently reviewed <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Our approach in the present paper used some of the common and less common approaches espoused by these algorithms, with the intention of emphasizing the effect of hypoglycaemia and low nocturnal values in limiting dose titration, as against more aggressive titration to FPG targets; thus, the protocol requested nocturnal measurements before titration, which was performed at weekly intervals, with lower values resulting both in dose reduction and suspension of further dose increases, for longer intervals if recurrent. Severe hypoglycaemia and HbA1c &#x02264;6.0% (42&#x02009;mmol/mol) also led to dose increment suspension for the remainder of the study, but are unlikely to have a significant effect on the study population as a whole.</p><p>Despite this dose-titration algorithm intended to be sensitive to low plasma glucose testing (including at night) and the occurrence of hypoglycaemic events, the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia remained notably higher with NPH insulin than with glargine. This is in the context of relatively modest final insulin doses compared with some studies, but with FPG, HbA1c and HbA1c-to-target results similar or only marginally worse than the &#x02018;best&#x02019; studies <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Accordingly, it remains unanswered whether treatment to an individually tolerated rate of hypoglycaemia would lead to a greater reduction in HbA1c levels with insulin glargine in routine clinical practice. Meanwhile the results are consistent with treat-to-target studies with insulins glargine and detemir, where HbA1c levels were similar but nocturnal hypoglycaemia was lower than with NPH insulin <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>The question is clinically important, as relevant differences in HbA1c levels would be expected to drive differences in vascular complications in the longer term, and thus the cost-effectiveness of the basal insulin analogues. The binomial regression relationships between hypoglycaemia and HbA1c, for insulins glargine and detemir, do suggest the opportunity for hypoglycaemia to modulate HbA1c to advantage compared with NPH in insulin starters <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>There are several possible reasons for the persistence of an excess of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with NPH. In the present study, &#x0003e;90% of the participants were taking sulfonylureas and it is possible that participants on NPH retained a greater risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia in this setting. Other reasons include limitations of the algorithm itself, the unpredictable variability of the effect of NPH leading to unpredictable glucose patterns at night or lower than anticipated power for hypoglycaemia to modulate basal insulin dose adequately, given that as many as 36% of people still reported confirmed nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The 36-week study duration might be a factor for the last three possibilities, suggesting that a longer study may be needed to provide a definitive answer. This is of course relevant to the development of further new basal insulin analogues.</p><p>The HbA1c levels achieved in the present study were very similar with the two insulins, but it appeared that FPG was beginning to separate by 36 weeks (completer population), although the difference was small. This too suggests that duration of such a treat-to-hypoglycaemia study needs to be longer. Numerically the HbA1c levels achieved were a little above those in the original treat-to-glucose-target studies <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, so it is also possible that tighter glucose control is necessary to show differences between insulin types in the short term. The argument, however, is limited by FPG being numerically lower in the present study than in the earlier studies, suggesting that although the final insulin dose was not high (31&#x02013;32 U/day), it was not inappropriate in this study population, and that the algorithm and monitoring by the titration committed were successful. One useful result of this study is verification that the findings of the original treat-to-target studies can be reproduced globally; that is, the reduction in nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin glargine appears independent of geographic region and cultural influences. Determination of efficacy and safety across global populations is relevant to the development of future insulin products.</p><p>Our predictor analysis confirmed previous evidence that baseline HbA1c is the major determinant of achievement of HbA1c targets, while country as an influence independent of that is likely to reflect differences in medical attitudes and resources. Less obvious is why number of previous oral agents might predict achievement of target, independent of these in particular, as combination metformin&#x02009;+&#x02009;sulfonylurea therapy was continued in &#x0003e;90% of participants from randomization (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). One possibility is that use of more oral agents reflected more active glucose management, and this continued in respect of insulin dose adjustment during the study. The fact that hypoglycaemia should be predicted by duration of diabetes might reflect less stable glucose control as endogenous insulin secretion wanes with time, an effect presumably overcome for prediction of HbA1c to target by the application of the dose-titration algorithm. In clinical practice it is generally observed that people with a higher BMI have less susceptibility to hypoglycaemia when on insulin, as is confirmed in the present study, although the reasons are unknown.</p><p>In conclusion, superiority of insulin glargine over NPH insulin in the reduction of HbA1c after 36 weeks of treatment was not observed; however, the study confirmed that insulin glargine and NPH insulin were similar in this regard and showed, in a diverse, globally distributed population, that safe and effective titration of glargine resulted in lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycaemia despite an algorithm designed to reduce the rate with the comparator insulin. Further treat-to-hypoglycaemia studies might be of longer duration, and perhaps limited to the subpopulation experiencing hypoglycaemia in the first months after starting insulin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the investigators and people with diabetes who took part in this study.
