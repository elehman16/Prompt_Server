Type 2 diabetes causes a twofold excess risk for cardiovascular disease, partly independent from other risk factors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Ideally, pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes not only lowers blood glucose levels but also has glucose-independent beneficial cardiovascular effects.</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction is considered an early marker of vascular complications, also in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Endothelial dysfunction comprises a number of functional alternations in the vascular endothelium, such as impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, impaired barrier function, inflammatory activation, and stimulated coagulation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, which is impaired in endothelial dysfunction, can be assessed by measuring responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators such as acetylcholine (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Recently, incretin-based therapy has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Incretins are a group of gastrointestinal hormones, predominantly glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), that are secreted in response to food ingestion and stimulate insulin secretion (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) rapidly degrades the incretin hormones to inactive metabolites (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition to incretins, DPP-4 also inactivates chemokines, cytokines, and neuropeptides (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In type 2 diabetes DPP-4 inhibitors reduce the breakdown of GLP-1 and improve metabolic control by increasing insulin secretion, improving &#x003b2;-cell function, and decreasing glucagon secretion (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Apart from glycemic actions, GLP-1 has beneficial cardiovascular effects. GLP-1 has vasodilatory actions, which are believed to be mediated through a specific GLP-1 receptor in the vascular endothelium, and improves endothelial function in animals and humans (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, GLP-1 may have GLP-1 receptor-independent cardiovascular effects, which appear to be mediated by metabolites of GLP-1 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It is not known whether a pharmacological approach of increasing GLP-1 levels by inhibiting DPP-4, which changes the ratio between GLP-1 and its degradation product, exhibits the same vascular profile.</p><p>DPP-4 inhibition affects not only GLP-1 levels, but also GIP breakdown, and perhaps also other substrates, such as chemokines and cytokines. Whether intervening in the breakdown of these other potential substrates affects endothelial function is unknown. Indirect evidence for a potential beneficial effect on endothelial function comes from a study demonstrating that the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin increases endothelial progenitor cells in type 2 diabetes by inhibiting degradation of the chemokine stromal-derived factor 1-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The fact is that meta-analyses summarizing the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on major cardiovascular events in phase 2 and 3 studies all suggest a lower relative risk compared with placebo or other medication (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These observations need to be confirmed in large cardiovascular outcome studies. The current study therefore aims to determine whether the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin can improve endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study population</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

This conclusion is based on the observation that vildagliptin augments the vasodilator response in the forearm vascular bed to acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, whereas the vascular response to sodium nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent vasodilator, remains unaffected. Baseline blood flow tended to be higher during vildagliptin, accompanied by slightly lower blood pressure values, but these changes did not attain statistical significance.</p><p>A number of mechanisms may underlie these results. Given that GLP-1 is a physiological substrate of DPP-4, DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin may be expected to increase circulating levels of GLP-1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Several studies have reported beneficial effects of GLP-1 on the cardiovascular system. In humans, Nikolaidis et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) have shown that 72-h infusion of GLP-1 improved left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction and systolic dysfunction after successful reperfusion therapy, an effect that was observed in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. They discussed that this observation might be explained by the insulinotropic and insulinomimetic properties of GLP-1, but alternatively GLP-1 might also improve endothelial function. Studies have shown that GLP-1 improves endothelium-dependent vascular responses in the brachial artery while leaving endothelium-independent responses unaffected in healthy humans and patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The cardiovascular actions of GLP-1 may occur either directly through the GLP-1 receptor or alternatively by a GLP-1 receptor-independent effect of the degradation product of GLP-1, GLP-1(9&#x02013;36) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Apart from GLP-1, DPP-4 also degrades GIP, and perhaps cytokines and certain chemokines (including stromal-derived factor 1-&#x003b1;), thus other substrates of DPP-4 may be responsible for the improvement in endothelial function. Alternatively, vildagliptin might improve endothelial function by influencing insulin levels and glucose level. Insulin causes vasodilatation by increasing endothelial production of NO (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, we did not find changes in fasting insulin levels when treated with vildagliptin. This is in correspondence with literature, in which DPP-4 inhibitors do not influence fasting insulin levels (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Although we aimed for similar glucose levels during both treatments, this was not completely accomplished since the fasting glucose levels were slightly higher in the acarbose group (6.62 &#x000b1; 0.27 for vildagliptin vs. 7.59 &#x000b1; 0.28 mmol/L for acarbose). It seems unlikely that this small difference of 1.0 mmol/L causes the observed difference in vascular response. This is supported by the absence of any correlation between change in glucose and change in increase in FBF from baseline in response to acetylcholine (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.05, data not shown).</p><p>Finally, vildagliptin might have a direct pharmacological, yet unidentified, effect on the endothelium.</p><p>The improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in the forearm observed after 4-week treatment with vildagliptin might translate into a decrease in cardiovascular events. Endothelial dysfunction is a marker of cardiovascular complications, and a close relation exists between endothelial function in the human coronary circulation and peripheral circulation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This possibility is supported by a recent meta-analysis showing that treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg b.i.d. may decrease the relative risk (RR) of cardio-cerebrovascular events (RR 0.84, CI 0.62&#x02013;1.14) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Of course these findings need to be confirmed by a long-term cardiovascular outcome study.</p><p>As secondary findings, we found slightly lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure with a slightly higher heart rate after vildagliptin treatment. Furthermore, baseline measurement of FBF was also higher after vildagliptin than after acarbose treatment (3.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 vs. 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.2 mL &#x022c5; dL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x022c5; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the experimental arm and 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 vs. 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.3 mL &#x022c5; dL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x022c5; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the nonexperimental arm). Basal vascular tone can be affected by the NO pathway as well as by the sympathetic nervous system (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The lower blood pressure and increased basal FBF might implicate that vildagliptin is a systemic vasodilator. This observation can be a result of an enhanced availability of NO as a result of improved endothelial function or alteration in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. However, 26-week treatment with DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin did not cause clinical meaningful changes in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Our study has limitations. First of all, the duration of treatment with vildagliptin was relatively short. This 4-week period was enough to show improved endothelial function but larger outcome trials are needed to evaluate a potential beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcome. Second, although this study was double-blinded, more subjects experienced flatulence during acarbose (15 vs. 4), which might compromise this. However, the investigator analyzed the FBF results of plethysmography of each treatment period separately and the flow measurements are objective. Third, the forearm vasodilator response to acetylcholine is only one of the methods to study endothelial function. Nevertheless, these functional measurements are one of the most representative indexes of endothelial function. Fourth, acarbose in an &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitor might increase GLP-1 levels. The reason for using an active comparator drug in our study was to aim for equal glucose levels. Our study design does not allow us to conclude that the effect of vildagliptin on endothelial function is GLP-1 dependent. But if this were true, the observed difference in FBF would have been diminished by acarbose and larger differences would have been found using placebo. However, when using placebo our results might have been confounded by a larger change in fasting glucose. Furthermore, acarbose is the optimal active comparator drug in this trial, since it is not absorbed into the circulation and thus cannot influence endothelial function directly.</p><p>The study has also strengths; the effects of vildagliptin were studied in a relevant population&#x02014;metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes&#x02014;and is thus applicable to clinical practice. In addition, an appropriate control treatment arm was used to avoid major differences in glycemic control. In conclusion, 4 weeks&#x02019; treatment with vildagliptin improves endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. These findings may be relevant in the context of future cardiovascular complications and provide a basis for further cardiovascular outcome studies.</p></sec>
