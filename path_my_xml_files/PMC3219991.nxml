We hypothesized that the underlying mechanism could be an increase in the expression and/or functionality of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key receptors sensing infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether glutamine supplementation alters the expression and functionality of TLR2 and TLR4 in circulating monocytes of trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We designed a prospective, randomized and single-blind study. Twenty-three patients received parenteral nutrition (TPN) with a daily glutamine supplement of 0.35 g/kg. The control group (20 patients) received an isocaloric-isonitrogenated TPN. Blood samples were extracted before treatment, at 6 and 14 days. Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was determined by flow cytometry. Monocytes were stimulated with TLR specific agonists and cytokines were measured in cell culture supernatants. Phagocytic ability of monocytes was also determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Basal characteristics were similar in both groups. Monocytes from patients treated with glutamine expressed the same TLR2 levels as controls before treatment (4.9 &#x000b1; 3.5 rmfi vs. 4.3 &#x000b1; 1.9 rmfi, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.9), at Day 6 (3.8 &#x000b1; 2.3 rmfi vs. 4.0 &#x000b1; 1.7 rmfi, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.7) and at Day 14 (4.1 &#x000b1; 2.1 rfim vs. 4.6 &#x000b1; 1.9 rmfi, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.08). TLR4 levels were not significantly different between the groups before treatment: (1.1 &#x000b1; 1 rmfi vs 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.1 rmfi respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.9), at Day 6 (1.1 &#x000b1; 1 rmfi vs. 0.7 &#x000b1; 0.4 rmfi respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.1) and at Day 14 (1.4 &#x000b1; 1.9 rmfi vs. 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.6 rmfi respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.8). No differences in cell responses to TLR agonists were found between groups. TLR functionality studied by phagocytosis did not vary between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In trauma patients in the intensive care unit, TPN supplemented with glutamine does not improve the expression or the functionality of TLRs in peripheral blood monocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01250080.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Glutamine is the most abundant nonessential amino acid in the human body. Besides its role as a constituent of proteins and its importance in amino acid transamination, glutamine may modulate immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Thus, glutamine deprivation reduces proliferation of lymphocytes, influences expression of surface activation markers of lymphocytes and monocytes, affects the production of cytokines, and stimulates apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, glutamine influences a variety of different molecular pathways. For example, glutamine stimulates the formation of heat shock protein 70 in monocytes by enhancing the stability of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], influences the redox potential of the cell by enhancing the formation of glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], induces cellular anaerobic effects by increasing the cell volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], activates mitogen-activated protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and interacts with particular aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases in specific glutamine-sensing metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The innate immune system is the first line of host defence against pathogens and targets structurally conserved molecules, the so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Innate responses are in most cases sufficient to eliminate invading microbes. Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLR) comprise a family of germ line-encoded trans-membrane receptors which recognize PAMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Activation of TLRs leads to the induction of inflammatory responses, phagocytosis but also to the development of antigen specific adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Among this family of receptors, TLR2 and TLR4 have received great attention. TLR4 is essential for the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas TLR2 recognizes a large number of ligands including bacterial lipoteichoid acid and lipoproteins.</p><p>We and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have shown that trauma patients present a dysregulation of the innate immune system, namely reduced expression of TLRs and blunted response to specific agonists markedly to LPS. Moreover, we have also shown that monocytes from trauma patients phagocytosized less efficiently than monocytes from control subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, clinical studies have shown that glutamine, as a dietary supplement for patients in critical condition, decreases the incidence of infection, primarily pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has been postulated, though not formally proven yet, that glutamine's beneficial effect could be due to a positive effect on the innate immune system. Given the importance of TLRs and TLRs-dependent signalling in host defence against infections we hypothesized that glutamine may increase the expression and/or functionality of TLRs, which in turn may have beneficial effects to clear infections. In a pilot report, in a general population of critical care patients, glutamine used as a dietary supplement did not increase the expression of TLR2 or TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this second report we have evaluated whether glutamine dietary supplement may affect not only the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 but also their functionality in circulating monocytes from peripheral blood in a specific group of trauma patients admitted to the ICU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This prospective and comparative study took place at Son Dureta University Hospital (Palma de Mallorca, Spain), and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Balearic Islands on 31 January 2007.</p><p>In all cases, informed consent for inclusion in the study was sought from the patient or the closest family member if the patient was unconscious.</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We designed a randomized, single blind, prospective study, with comparative therapeutic intervention with two groups: trauma patients treated with TPN supplemented with glutamine and those receiving TPN without glutamine.</p><p>Random selection was based on a computer-generated list that assigned patients to groups consecutively. Those who processed samples in the research unit did not know whether the patient had received glutamine or not.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and interventions</title><p>Trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a university third level hospital between 18 and 75 years (inclusive) with moderate to severe trauma, as defined by an Injury Severity Score (ISS) &#x0003e; 12 points were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were: patients who were under 17 and over 76 years of age, patients whose life expectancy was less than five days, who were allergic to glutamine, whose basic pathology included any serious immune system condition (diabetes, HIV, lupus, and so on) or who, in their long-term treatment prior to admission to ICU, received corticoids or any other immunosuppressant medication. A negative pregnancy test was required before women of childbearing age could be included in the study.</p><p>All patients received standardized advanced trauma life support (ATLS)-adapted emergency department treatment and standardized intensive care unit therapy.</p><p>All patients who were admitted to the ICU and received TPN as part of their treatment were selected for inclusion in the study. Indications for TPN treatment were based on the guidelines of the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The indications for TPN were: contraindication for enteral nutrition (mainly abdominal surgery or abdominal trauma) or failure in achieve nutritional goals with enteral nutrition.</p><p>Of 43 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23 were randomly assigned to receive a daily glutamine supplement of 0.35 g/kg weight as N2-L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine (0.5 g/kg/d - Dipeptiven Fresenius Kabi Espa&#x000f1;a) during five days. The treatment period of five days was chosen according to other clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Basic TPN support for both groups was identical: StructoKabiven (Fresenius Kabi Espa&#x000f1;a), with a caloric intake of 28 kcal kg<sup>-1 </sup>d<sup>-1 </sup>and the following distribution of macronutrients: 0.28 g kg<sup>-1 </sup>d<sup>-1 </sup>of nitrogen, 3.5 g kg<sup>-1 </sup>d<sup>-1 </sup>of glucose and 1.08 g kg<sup>-1 </sup>d<sup>-1 </sup>of lipids, in addition to standard vitamins and trace elements. The control group (<italic>n </italic>= 20 patients) received a supplemental volume of the basic TPN solution to achieve an isocaloric and isonitrogenated formula with the study group. The total duration of the TPN, once the supplement with glutamine was finished after the fifth day, was based on clinical data and was decided by the clinician responsible for the patient.</p><p>Besides our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] screening the literature, we found no previous studies identifying a correlation between TLR and glutamine in humans. Therefore, it was determined that a sample size of 40 patients would be sufficient for this study.</p><p>In both groups, the peripheral blood samples for the study of TLRs in monocytes were extracted before beginning treatment (basal sample), at the end of the glutamine supplement (Day 6), and at 14 days &#x000b1; 24 hours after initiating treatment.</p><p>These time points were chosen because the median length of stay of the trauma patients in our ICU is 10 days, which is in accordance with the data obtained from the ENVIN-HELICS study in Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Because of the small volume of blood collected we could not perform all the analysis for each patient and, therefore, the phagocytosis assays were performed only for a small group of them. However, patients were not selected and were included consecutively as the different parts of the study were performed. The patients enrolled in the different sets of assays were homogenous in terms of severity and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Epidemiological data were collected, including date and time of sample extraction, description of the event that motivated ICU admission (diagnosis and severity scores), comorbidities of each patient and the appearance of any complications during ICU stay including total days of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay.</p><p>Among the data collected there were all the treatments that patients received during their ICU stay, especially all pharmacological treatments with known anti-inflammatory properties that could affect the study results. All members of both of the two patient groups were handled and treated equivalently.</p><p>With respect to infections, samples were analyzed whenever there was a clinical suspicion of possible infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The definition of nosocomial infection used in this study is that proposed by the CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and it was mainly based on microbiological findings. Blood and other cultures were done at our institution following standard microbiological procedures, including incubation in anaerobic atmosphere when applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in peripheral blood monocytes was determined by flow cytometry. Blood samples (one sample per patient) were collected in a K2-anticoagulation medium. It is known that this medium does not affect the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A total of 100 &#x003bc;L was incubated with a combination of anti-CD14 fluorescein conjugated (clone My4, 10 &#x003bc;g/mL; Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA) and anti-TLR2 (clone TL2.1, 10 &#x003bc;g/mL; ebioscience, San Diego, California, USA) or anti-TLR4 (clone HTA125, 10 &#x003bc;g/mL; ebioscience, San Diego, California, USA) phycoerythrin conjugated in the presence of 25 &#x003bc;L of fetal calf serum during 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. A total of 2 ml of FACS lysing solution (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) was added to the samples which were incubated 10 minutes at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged in a clinical centrifuge (530 <italic>&#x000d7; g</italic>, 5 minutes, 25&#x000b0;C) and the cellular pellet was washed once with 1% BSA-0.1% sodium azide in PBS. Finally cells were resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;l IsoFlowTM Sheath Fluid (Beckman Coulter). The analyses were carried out in an Epics XL flow cytometer using the Expo32 software (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Monocytes were identified by gating on a side versus CD14 dot plot. The levels of TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed as relative mean fluorescence intensity (r<italic>mfi</italic>). The non-specific binding was corrected by subtraction of <italic>mfi </italic>values corresponding to isotype matched antibodies. A total of 10,000 monocytes were analysed in every experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Monocyte isolation and stimulation</title><p>Blood samples collected in 3.8% sodium citrate tubes, were diluted 1:5 in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated Fetal Calf Serum (FCS), glutamine (2 mM), HEPES (200 mM) and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin) and monocytes were obtained using a commercial isolation kit exactly as recommended by the manufacturer (Dynal monocyte negative isolation kit, Oxoid, Cambridge, United Kingdom). This collection method does not affect TLR-ligand induced cytokine response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Lymphocytes represent less than 5% of the cells after this procedure. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion and was &#x0003e; 95%. Cells were finally resuspended at a cell density of 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS, glutamine (2 mM), HEPES (200 mM) and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin). Cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a cell density of 10<sup>5 </sup>per well. Cells were stimulated with different amounts of purified LPS from <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>O111:B4 (Sigma Chemicals, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA), Pam3CSK4 (PAM; Invivogen, San Diego, California, USA) or zymosan (Invivogen). LPS was repurified exactly as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This procedure results in LPS preparations that utilize TLR4, and not TLR2, for signalling. After 16 hours cell culture supernatants were collected, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and samples were frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until assayed.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokine analysis</title><p>We determined the concentration of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-10 in cell culture supernatants using a bead array ELISA according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CBA Kit, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). The assay sensitivity for each cytokine was 7.2 pg/mL for IL-1&#x003b2;, 2.5 pg/mL for IL-6, 3.7 pg/mL for TNF&#x003b1; and 3.3 pg/mL for IL-10.</p></sec><sec><title>Phagocytosis</title><p>To determine the phagocytic capability of monocytes, the assay described by Blander <italic>et al</italic>. was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Briefly, live <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>expressing green fluorescent protein was added to 100 &#x003bc;L of whole blood collected in K2-anticoagulation medium tubes. Bacteria were added at a ratio of 100 bacteria per monocyte. After 30-minutes incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, samples were centrifuged in a clinical centrifuge (530 <italic>&#x000d7; g</italic>, 5 minutes, 25&#x000b0;C) and the cellular pellet was washed once with 1% BSA-0.1% sodium azide in PBS. Finally cells were resuspended in 1 mL IsoFlowTM Sheath Fluid (Beckman Coulter). The analyses were carried out in an Epics XL flow cytometer using the Expo32 software. Monocytes were identified by gating on a side versus CD14 dot plot and GFP fluorescence recorded. Results were expressed as relative mean fluorescence intensity (r<italic>mfi</italic>) measured in arbitrary units after substraction of <italic>mfi </italic>values corresponding to monocytes labeled with CD14 antibody. A total of 10,000 monocytes were analysed in every experiment. Phagocytosis was performed in serum-free media to eliminate contributions of Fc and/or complement receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The quantitative variables are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD) or as the median and interquartiles.

In addition recent ESPEN guidelines recommend the use of glutamine when TPN is indicated in ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In our study, the treatment group also presented a reduced incidence of infections and a reduced hospital length of stay, although neither finding achieved statistical significance. In any case, our study was not designed to test the clinical efficacy of glutamine for a significant reduction of the number of infections and/or hospital length of stay, so this limitation precludes any conclusion about efficacy.</p><p>The possible beneficial effects of glutamine on the functionality of the innate immune system are poorly characterized although these effects might be the underlying explanation of glutamine clinical effect on reducing infectious complications. Taking into account that TLRs play a central role in the activation of the innate system, hence leading to the activation of different intracellular signalling cascades involved in the activation of host defence mechanisms, in this study we focused on the effect of glutamine on the expression and functionality of TLR2 and TLR4. A wealth of evidence indicates that these TLRs recognize a plethora of pathogens. In fact, a recent experimental study, treatment with enteral glutamine was associated with down-regulation of TLR-4, MyD88 and TRAF6 expression and concomitant decrease in intestinal mucosal injury caused by LPS endotoxaemia in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These authors conclude that the positive effect of glutamine on intestinal structure after LPS endotoxaemia may be considered as a mechanism via which immunonutrition helps in the recovery of critically ill patients.</p><p>As a population studied, we chose trauma patients admitted to the ICU for various reasons. First, in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] we did demonstrate that the TLR expression and functionality are altered in monocytes from traumatic patients, and that this alteration persists during the first 14 days after hospital admission. Second, several studies have demonstrated that a decrease or even total lack of TLR expression correlate with greater susceptibility to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Altogether, trauma patients make a good case study to test whether glutamine dietary supplement may improve TLR-dependent host defence mechanisms. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to think that if we could improve TLR-dependent host defence mechanisms by using a pharmaconutrient such as glutamine the molecular mechanisms to detect microorganisms might improve, resulting in a reduced incidence of infectious complications. However, the results of this study show that the TPN supplemented with glutamine does not change the expressions of TLR2 or TLR4, the secretion of cytokines upon stimulation with TLR agonists and the phagocytic capability. Nevertheless critical care patients are heterogeneous and it is possible that a hyperinflammatory response coexists with a dysfunction in the immune system. As it has been previously pointed out, TLR-4 expression is lower in trauma patients than in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] whereas in septic patients TLR expression increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In general it is assumed that the levels of TLRs correlate with the cellular response upon stimulation with specific agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For example, macrophages overexpressing TLRs, release higher amounts of inflammatory mediators upon TLR engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It is also known that cells from trauma patients secrete significantly less inflammatory cytokines than cells from control subjects when LPS, a TLR4 agonist, is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, our data show that cells from trauma patients treated with glutamine secreted similar amounts of cytokines than cells from control subjects upon stimulation with TLR2 and TLR4 agonists.</p><p>It is also known that phagocytosis is impaired in monocytes from trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Phagocytosis is an ancient form of host defence which is dependent on several signalling pathways including TLR-dependent signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, it has been shown that activation of the TLR signalling by bacteria regulates phagocytosis at multiple steps, including internalization and phagosome maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, our findings, likewise previous ones in paediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], show that glutamine supplementation dose not increase the phagocytic capacity.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>It must be commented that there is controversy over the surface expression of TLR2 and TLR4 by leukocytes from traumatic patients. In our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we showed a reduced expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 in monocytes from those trauma patients who developed any infection. On the other hand, Adib-Conquy <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported a reduced expression of TLR4 in severely injured patients early after trauma, whereas TLR2 remained unchanged. In contrast, another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed a down-regulation of the expression of both TLR2 and TLR4, whereas Lendemans <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] observed a decrease of only TLR2 expression. Differences in the patients analyzed may account for these conflicting results and we can not rigorously rule out that technical issues such as the commercial source of the antibodies used or the way the cells were fixed for the flow cytometry experiments may also be responsible for these conflicting results.</p><p>It also should be pointed out that an <italic>in vivo </italic>scenario is quite complex and the final outcome of an infectious process depends on the concerted action of several cells, including epithelial, endothelial, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, and therefore, we cannot rule out that glutamine may exert a positive effect on other cell types or even at the level of cross-talk between cells of the innate immune system. Studies are on going to test these hypotheses.</p><p>In this study, we have analyzed different phenotypes of circulating cells over time. It should be taken into consideration that initial phenotypes may be compensated after three to five days owing to the influx of new and immature monocytes. In fact, this might be the explanation underlying the increased response to different agonists after six days. In any case, our data suggest that glutamine dietary supplement may not affect cell turnover since the increased response was found in both groups and, furthermore, no significant differences were found between them.</p><p>Another limitation of the study is that we did not measure plasma levels of free glutamine. Nevertheless it must be said that previous studies have documented low levels of glutamine in previously fit trauma patients, and that the dose of glutamine employed in our study and the length of treatment was enough to correct any deficiency. It also should be noted that for the reported analysis of TLR expression and phagocytic ability, whole blood samples, without subculturing cells, were used. However, for the stimulation experiments using different TLR agonists purified monocytes were challenged with stimuli in tissue culture medium containing glutamine which is commonly used to culture cells and perhaps this glutamine present in the medium may mask differences between experimental groups. Nevertheless, the impaired LPS response displayed by monocytes from trauma patients reported by us and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] was still found in both groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study in trauma ICU patients show that TPN supplemented with glutamine does neither improve the expression of TLR-2 or TLR-4 in circulating monocytes from peripheral blood, nor the functionality of TLR-2 and TLR-4 studied by analyzing the cytokine production after monocyte isolation and stimulation or by studying the phagocytic capability.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; The use of glutamine as a dietary supplement is associated with a reduced risk of infection.
