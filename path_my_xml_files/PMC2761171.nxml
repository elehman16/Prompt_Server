The subjects were administered a single 600 mg dose of valproic acid in one of two formulations.

Sustained-release formulations of antiepileptic drugs can be very helpful in achieving treatment objectives. Stable serum levels without marked peak-to-trough fluctuations, reduced frequency of dosing, and the possibility of dosing flexibility may all improve compliance, patient satisfaction and, ultimately, quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-2-139">Bialer 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dddt-2-139">Cramer et al 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-2-139">Pellock et al 2004</xref>).</p><p>Valproic acid has been widely used in the last decade and is now considered a relatively safe and effective anticonvulsant agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-2-139">Perucca 2002</xref>). Recently, several investigations have proposed its use in the treatment of anxiety, alcoholism, and mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-2-139">Bowden and Singh 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-2-139">Nasrallah et al 2006</xref>). Valproic acid is characterized by dose-limited absorption, nonlinear plasma protein binding, and multiple metabolic pathways of elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-2-139">Gugler and von Unruh 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-2-139">Zaccara et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-2-139">Perucca 2002</xref>). Once absorbed, valproic acid is largely bound to plasma proteins and has a relatively small volume of distribution. Its concentration in cerebral spinal fluid is approximately one-tenth that in plasma and is directly correlated with the concentration found in tears. At therapeutic doses, valproic acid&#x02019;s half-life varies from 10 to 20 hours in adults, while it is significantly shorter (6 to 9 hours) in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-2-139">Zaccara et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-2-139">Perucca 2002</xref>). Valproic acid undergoes extensive liver metabolism. Numerous metabolites have been positively identified and there is reasonable evidence that several of them contribute to its pharmacological actions or toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-2-139">Zaccra et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-2-139">Eadie 1991</xref>).</p><p>Valproic acid is available in different dosage forms for parenteral and oral use. All available oral formulations are almost completely bioavailable, but they differ in dissolution characteristics and absorption rates. The sustained-release formulation (Depakene R) can therefore be given once or twice daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-2-139">Doughty et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-2-139">Genton 2005</xref>). The tablet core consists of a matrix structure that is covered with the sustained-released membrane. The elution of valproic acid is controlled as the substance passes through the core of the matrix structure and, further, through the sustained-released membrane.</p><p>Recently another sustained-release formulation containing 200 mg valproic acid (Selenica R) has been developed and is available in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dddt-2-139">Fujisaki et al 2006</xref>). Selenica R has a double-coating system that provides a mechanism that is different from the conventional sustained-release formulation. Preclinical studies with healthy volunteers showed there are different pharmacokinetic properties between this new formulation and the conventional formulation (Pers comm.; Nikken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). However, there is no information available on absorption profiles of these two formulations when directly compared. We therefore compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two valproic acid formulations in healthy subjects. A comparative study of the dissolution profiles between the two tablets was also carried out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> dissolution test</title><p>A dissolution test was performed according to the procedure described in the JP Dissolution Test (paddle and beads method) (The Japanese Pharmacopeia 15th Edition, Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/bukyoku/iyaku/yakkyoku/dl/060407-1.pdf">http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/bukyoku/iyaku/yakkyoku/dl/060407-1.pdf</ext-link>). The paddle rotation speed was maintained at 50 rpm at 37 &#x000b0;C. Release test was carried out in 900 ml of pH 6.8 phosphate buffer (0.05 mol/L) using a dissolution tester. Samples of 10 ml were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and replaced with the same volume of fresh buffer. Each sample solution was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the dissolution rate of valproic acid as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dddt-2-139">Fujisaki and colleagues (2006)</xref>. An AUV absorption spectrometer was used as the HPLC detector at a detection wavelength of 210 nm. The HPLC column was an Inertsil ODS stainless steel column with an inside diameter of 4.0 bmm and a length of 25 cm (GL Science, Ins., Tokyo, Japan). The analysis was performed at 40 &#x000b0;C.

It was a randomized, two-treatment, two-period, crossover investigation with a washout phase of 4 weeks between the two study periods. The treatments consisted of a single oral 600 mg dose with 200 ml water. 600 mg of different sustained-release valproic acid formulations (three 200 mg tablets of Depakene R or Selenica R) were administered in a randomized crossover fashion with a washout period of at least 4-weeks. Six volunteers within each group were allocated to either of 2 different drug sequences: Depakene R-Selenica R and Selenica R-Depakene R. No meal was allowed until 4 hours after the dosing (1 pm). Fluid intake was also standard, and no alcohol, tea, coffee, and cola were allowed during the periods of confinement. Study participants were asked to refrain from the use of all drugs, including over-the-counter medications, for at least 2 weeks before the first administration, as well as during the entire study. Blood samples (5 ml each) for determination of valproic acid were collected into heparinized tubes just before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours after the administration of valproic acid. Samples collected in the heparinized tubes were gently inverted several times. At the same time as blood sampling, blood pressure, heart rate, and self-reported adverse effects were monitored. Group assignment and the drug administration schedule were kept sealed until the blood samples were analyzed.</p><sec><title>Bioanalytical method</title><p>Serum concentrations of valproic acid were quantified with enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

All the Depakene R tablets were detectable after 3 hours, while it took 7 hours to detect all of the Selenica R tablets. Two-way ANOVA showed significant difference in dissolution curves between the two formulations (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Dissolved valproic acid concentrations for Depakene R were significantly greater than those for Selenica R from 7 to 24 hours.</p><p>These findings suggested the different mechanisms of sustained release between Depakene R and Selenica R, ie, the elution of valproic acid from Depakene R is controlled in such a way that the substance passes through the core matrix structure and further passes through the sustained-release membrane, while Selenica R elutes through a mixed membrane composed of ethylcellulose and methacrylate copolymer-L (Fijisaki et al 2006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-2-139">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> bioequivalence study</title><p>Serum concentration-time curves of valproic acid after a single oral dose of Depakene R tablets and Selenica R tablets are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-2-139">Figure 3</xref>, and their pharmacokinetic parameters including direct (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-2-139">Table 1</xref>) and simulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-2-139">Table 2</xref>) single oral dose data are summarized. There were no severe adverse events during the study. Two subjects had mild sleepiness from 6 hours to 12 hours for both phases. No difference in blood pressure or heart rate was observed between the two formulations.</p><p>There were no differences in C<sub>max</sub> or total AUC between the new formulation (Selenica R) and conventional formulation (Depakene R). Bioequivalence analyses showed that 90% confidence interval of log-transformed C<sub>max</sub> and total AUC between the two formulations were 92%&#x02013;106% and 101%&#x02013;111%, respectively.</p><p>Lag time and t<sub>max</sub> of Selenica R were significantly delayed in comparison with those of Depakene R (7.1 &#x000b1; 0.8 versus 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.6 hours, p &#x0003c; 0.001 for lag time, 17.6 &#x000b1; 1.8 versus 10.8 &#x000b1; 1.7 hours, p &#x0003c;0.001 for t<sub>max</sub>). However, no difference was found in Ka. Other parameters, such as Vd/F, Ke, and CL, did not differ between the two formulations. Css<sub>max</sub> and Css<sub>min</sub> simulated by single-oral pharmacokinetic parameters were 63.5 &#x000b1; 17.7 and 35.1 &#x000b1; 10.4 &#x003bc;g/ml for Depakene R and 64.3 &#x000b1; 16.0 and 40.8 &#x000b1; 13.1 &#x003bc;g/ml for Selenica R. Css<sub>min</sub> of Selenica R was significantly higher than that of Depakene R ( p &#x0003c; 0.05), but the difference in fluctuating drug concentration (Css<sub>max</sub>&#x02212;Css<sub>min</sub>) did not differ between Selenica R and Depakene R. There were no sequence effects on the pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p>The results of this study showed no differences in C<sub>max</sub> or AUC of valproic acid between new and conventional formulations. The 90% confidence interval of log-transformed C<sub>max</sub> and total AUC between the two formulations fell within 80%&#x02013;125%, suggesting that Selenica R is bioequivalent to Depakene R according to US Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/CDER/guidance/3616fnl.htm">http://www.fda.gov/CDER/guidance/3616fnl.htm</ext-link>). Therefore, it appears that blood concentrations that cause side effect are comparable between the two formulations.</p><p>However, absorption speed, such as lag time and hence t<sub>max</sub>, were very different between the two formulations in the single oral dose study. This is supported by the <italic>in vitro</italic> dissolution study which demonstrated that Depakene R dissolved earlier than Selenica R. These findings suggest that valproic acid dissolved from Depakene R appears earlier in the blood and brain than that from Selenica R.</p><p>On the other hand, no changes in physiological and mental status in our subjects were observed between Selenica R treatment and Depakene R treatment in this study. This is explained by similar exposure (AUC) and/or C<sub>max</sub> in the two formulations. Because therapeutic antiepileptic effects or mood-stabilizing effects are associated with exposure to valproic acid, when a sustained-release preparation is switched to another formulation, inconsistencies in pharmacokinetic parameters, such as lag time and t<sub>max</sub>, do not necessarily mean alteration in clinical response. This was confirmed by our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-2-139">Yasui-Furukori et al 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that the bioavailability of valproic acid in two formulations was similar but absorption time was different because of the different dissolution profiles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>None of the authors and their institutes have any conflicts of interest.
