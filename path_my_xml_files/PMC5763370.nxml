After oral administration of a single dose analgesia is achieved rapidly and maintained for up to 8&#x000a0;h. Its well&#x02010;proven efficacy and the beneficial safety profile &#x02013; especially for the short&#x02010;term treatment of acute pain &#x02013; make ibuprofen one of the most popular analgesics.</p><p>At single doses exceeding 400&#x000a0;mg, ibuprofen has pronounced anti&#x02010;inflammatory effects, which are used for, e.g. long&#x02010;term treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases (like rheumatism; Rainsford, <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). However, clinical studies have shown that analgesic efficacy for the treatment of acute pain is not increased by the administration of higher doses than 400&#x000a0;mg. This &#x02018;ceiling&#x02010;effect&#x02019; of ibuprofen has been observed in studies investigating postsurgical, as well as migraine pain (Laska et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>; Seymour et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Kellstein et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>).</p><p>Since decades analgesic compounds have been combined with caffeine as adjuvans, and recent meta&#x02010;analyses have proven that the addition of 100&#x02013;130&#x000a0;mg caffeine to a standard dose of an analgesic induce a clinically relevant increase in the number of patients who benefit from treatment (Derry et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). This adjuvant effect has been shown for single agents (like the NSAIDs aspirin or ibuprofen, or paracetamol), as well as for the combination of aspirin and paracetamol with caffeine. Caffeine is an antagonist at adenosine receptors, which are assumed to be relevant for pain signal processing und transmission (Sawynok, <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).</p><p>Up to now it has not been clinically investigated whether the addition of 100&#x000a0;mg caffeine to the maximum effective dose of ibuprofen for treating an acute pain event (i.e. 400&#x000a0;mg) increases efficacy, compared to ibuprofen alone.</p><p>This double&#x02010;blind clinical study was conducted to assess the acute effect of the combination of ibuprofen (acid) 400&#x000a0;mg and caffeine 100&#x000a0;mg in patients with post&#x02010;surgical dental pain. The primary objective was to demonstrate superior efficacy of a single dose of ibuprofen/caffeine versus either ingredient alone as well as placebo. The dental impaction pain model is validated, reproducible and widely recognized and utilized as acute pain model for testing efficacy of analgesic treatments in clinical trials (Cooper and Desjardins, <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Singla et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ejp1068-sec-0007"><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="ejp1068-sec-0008"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>This was a Phase III randomized, active&#x02010; and placebo&#x02010;controlled, double&#x02010;blind, single&#x02010;centre, two&#x02010;stage, 6&#x02010;arm, parallel&#x02010;group study, comparing the effect of the fixed&#x02010;dose combination (FDC) of ibuprofen (acid) 400&#x000a0;mg and caffeine 100&#x000a0;mg versus ibuprofen (acid) 400&#x000a0;mg, caffeine 100&#x000a0;mg, and placebo in patients aged between 18 and 55 with postoperative dental pain. The study was conducted and reported in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH&#x02010;GCP guidelines, local regulations and Boehringer Ingelheim standard operating procedures (SOP)s, and in compliance with the clinical trial protocol. The study received prior ethics&#x02010;committee approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the participating centre (Chesapeake IRB, Columbia, MD, USA).</p><p>Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) were used for all patients. All clinical data were captured using the Oracle Clinical&#x02122; remote data capture (RDC) system, a web&#x02010;based tool. Data entered in the eCRFs had to be consistent with the source documents which were filed at the investigator's site. The investigator was responsible for retaining all records pertaining to the trial. Concomitant diagnoses and AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory.</p><p>Activities (MedDRA) version 17.0 and concomitant medications were coded according to the World Health Organisation Drug Dictionary version 14.MAR.</p><p>A physical examination, ECG and laboratory tests were conducted at the screening visit to evaluate whether the patients were in good general health and thus suitable for study participation. Laboratory analyses were performed by Quest Diagnostics Clinical Trials, Valencia, California, USA. The investigator assessed the clinical significance of screening safety laboratory results to determine if the patient was healthy enough for study participation. Parameters included clinical chemistry, complete blood cell count, drug abuse test (urine dipstick), urinalysis and urine dipstick&#x02010;pregnancy test.</p></sec><sec id="ejp1068-sec-0009"><label>2.2</label><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Before the start of the study, the clinical trial protocol (CTP), the patient information leaflet, the informed consent form and other locally required documents were reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the participating centre. The IRB (Chesapeake IRB, Columbia, MD, USA) of the principal investigator of the trial (Derek D. Muse, MD, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) granted approval of the study on 02 Aug 2013. The IRB met the requirements of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), local legislation, and the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120. There was one global amendment to the CTP which required approval of the IRB.</p></sec><sec id="ejp1068-sec-0010"><label>2.3</label><title>Patients and treatment</title><p>This trial was performed in male or female outpatients who were eligible for participation in the study if they were between 18 and 55&#x000a0;years of age and scheduled to undergo surgical extraction of 3&#x02013;4 impacted third molars, with a minimum of two mandibular extractions, were in good general health, with a body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;30, had no contraindications to any of the study medications or anaesthetic drugs, and gave written informed consent before any pre&#x02010;screening, screening or study&#x02010;specific procedures were performed.</p><p>Patients qualified for the study if after the dental surgical procedure they presented a baseline pain severity assessment of either &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; or &#x02018;severe&#x02019; pain on a 4&#x02010;point verbal rating scale (VRS) which was based on a written selection of options of &#x02018;no pain&#x02019;, &#x02018;slight pain&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate pain&#x02019;, or &#x02018;severe pain&#x02019; and a baseline score of &#x02265;5 on the 0&#x02013;10 numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) ranging from 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02018;no pain&#x02019; to 10&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02018;worst possible pain&#x02019;. Patients were periodically asked to verbally rate their pain using the NPRS, beginning about 30&#x000a0;min following completion of the surgical procedure, until the patient qualified with a NPRS pain intensity (PI) score of &#x02265;5 or until 5&#x000a0;h had elapsed. The first dose of trial medication was administered no later than 5&#x000a0;min after the qualifying pain score assessment. Patients with &#x02018;no pain&#x02019; or &#x02018;slight pain&#x02019; on the VRS or with a score of &#x0003c;5 on the NPRS were not eligible for randomization. If the&#x000a0;patient failed to qualify by 5&#x000a0;h post&#x02010;surgery, the patient was not randomized and considered a screening failure.</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study if they met any exclusion criteria, i.e. had a history of hypersensitivity to the study medications, any significant disease or gastrointestinal disorder, impaired liver function, clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening, in case of alcohol or substance abuse, habituation to and abuse of other analgesic or psychotropic drugs, or ingested any caffeine&#x02010;containing beverages, chocolate, or alcohol 6&#x000a0;h or less before surgery. Women were excluded if pregnancy or breastfeeding could not be ruled out.</p><p>Trial medication (i.e. ibuprofen 400&#x000a0;mg/caffeine 100&#x000a0;mg, ibuprofen 400&#x000a0;mg, caffeine 100&#x000a0;mg, or placebo) was supplied as identically appearing film&#x02010;coated tablets.

The batch release of trial kits was performed by the Department of Pharmaceutical R&#x00026;D, Clinical Trial Supplies Unit, BI Pharma GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Biberach, Germany.</p><p>The randomization list was generated using a validated system, which involved a pseudo&#x02010;random number generator so that the resulting treatment was both reproducible and non&#x02010;predictable. Patients were randomized in blocks to ensure that equal numbers of patients were allocated to each treatment sequence. A block size of 16 was used. Patients and investigators remained blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after database lock. Access to the codes was controlled and documented.</p><p>At the time of randomization, to stratify the randomization regarding the baseline pain intensity, eligible patients having reported &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; were assigned the lowest available medication number, whereas patients having recorded &#x02018;severe&#x02019; were assigned the highest available medication number. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system was not utilized. After a screening evaluation (Visit 1), eligible patients underwent dental surgery at Visit 2 and were randomized to one of the six treatment sequences of the double&#x02010;blind treatment phase consisting of two study stages in a 6:6:1:1:1:1 ratio (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejp1068-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="ejp1068-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Randomization of patients to Study Stage 1 and 2</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study Stage 1</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study Stage 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen/caffeine</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen/caffeine</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Caffeine</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen/caffeine</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Caffeine</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen/caffeine</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ibuprofen</td></tr></tbody></table><permissions><copyright-holder>John Wiley &#x00026; Sons, Ltd</copyright-holder></permissions></table-wrap><p>In Stage 1 of this study, patients received either one single dose of ibuprofen/caffeine, ibuprofen, caffeine or placebo and in Stage 2 patients received multiple doses of either ibuprofen/caffeine or ibuprofen according to the randomization scheme above.</p><p>The disposition of patients is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejp1068-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="ejp1068-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Disposition of patients by treatment sequence.

The responder analysis for SPRID0&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h confirmed the&#x000a0;results of the primary endpoint analysis and the observation that more patients responded to treatment with ibuprofen/caffeine than to ibuprofen. Less than one quarter of patients in the placebo (17.3%) and caffeine (24.6%) arms achieved 50% of the maximum achievable SPRID0&#x02013;8, whereas the 50% responder rates for ibuprofen and the FDC were 49.7% and 67.8%, respectively.

The results confirm recent meta&#x02010;analyses which have shown that 100&#x02013;130&#x000a0;mg caffeine used as analgesic adjuvant for decades increases the responder rate of WHO stage I analgesics (Derry et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the primary efficacy endpoint the FDC ibuprofen/caffeine provided approximately 30% higher pain reduction/pain relief than ibuprofen alone on average over 8&#x000a0;h. The achieved SMDs for SPRID0&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h were 1.4 and 1.2 for the comparisons FDC versus placebo and caffeine, respectively, and 0.4 for the comparison FDC versus ibuprofen alone, i.e. they exceeded the minimum clinically relevant effects sizes used for the sample size calculation, so that the results of the chosen primary endpoint are clinically relevant and statistically significant. PID over time showed that up to 4&#x000a0;h after intake, as well as at the time point 8&#x000a0;h there was a relevant supplemental effect of caffeine in combination with ibuprofen when compared to ibuprofen alone. Clinical trials investigating various doses of ibuprofen for the treatment of acute pain showed that at 400&#x000a0;mg single dose a ceiling effect is reached, i.e. a higher ibuprofen dose does not induce more pronounced pain reduction, although higher peak plasma levels can be achieved (Laska et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>; Seymour et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Kellstein et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>).</p><p>Within the 8&#x000a0;h observation period in Study Stage 1, duration of pain relief (as assessed by the time until intake of rescue medication or the second dose of test medication) was slightly longer for the FDC compared to ibuprofen. It can be speculated that this might have been induced by the relative fast recovery of the patients (as seen in the placebo and caffeine arm), which in this trial was faster compared to other published data (see e.g. Seymour et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Mehlisch et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of various endpoints showed that the FDC provided faster pain reduction than ibuprofen alone: Pain relief was significantly different from ibuprofen as early as 15&#x000a0;min after intake (Supporting Information Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejp1068-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), and the same was the case for PID after 30&#x000a0;min (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejp1068-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Median time to meaningful pain relief was 0.65&#x000a0;h (39&#x000a0;min) earlier for patients taking the FDC, compared to those taking ibuprofen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejp1068-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejp1068-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>). Moore and colleagues performed a meta&#x02010;analysis comparing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between standard oral formulations of ibuprofen and fast release forms (like ibuprofen formulated as arginate, lysinate or sodium salt; [Moore et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>]): the investigated studies reported differences of 4&#x000a0;min (400&#x000a0;mg ibuprofen as sodium salt vs. ibuprofen acid; [Norholt et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>]) to 27&#x000a0;min (400&#x000a0;mg ibuprofen as arginate vs. ibuprofen acid; [Mehlisch et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>]). Comparing to these literature data on very fast releasing salts, meaningful pain relief was even achieved faster by the FDC ibuprofen/caffeine in this study compared to ibuprofen acid.</p><p>In accordance with the study protocol, PI and PAR data were set missing after a patient had taken rescue/second study medication, and the LOCF procedure was used for summary endpoints (SPRID, SPID, TOTPAR), following previously published clinical studies using such endpoints and their analyses. In acute pain, baseline observation carried forward was described to be more conservative than last observation carried forward, which was considered relevant for trials longer than 8&#x000a0;h (Moore et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). However, in this study with data cut&#x02010;off at 8 and 6&#x000a0;h, sensitivity analysis using the observed PI data, regardless of additional analgesics taken, as well as an analysis using placebo&#x02010;multiple&#x02010;imputation for data at time points following intake of additional analgesics revealed statistically significant superiority of the FDC versus the other treatment groups. Moreover, it should be taken into account that the remedication rate was lowest for the FDC, and therefore baseline observation carried forward would have been less conservative than LOCF.</p><p>In their meta&#x02010;analysis on standard and very fast release forms of ibuprofen, Moore and colleagues showed that the latter provided more benefits to the patients reflected by higher responder rates (defined as percentage of patients with &#x02265;50% total pain relief over 0&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h) and a lower proportion of patients who took an additional dose of analgesic within the observation period (Moore et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In their analysis, for standard release ibuprofen (400&#x000a0;mg), 53% of patients in the dental pain model experienced &#x02265;50% total pain relief over 0&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h, compared to 66% for fast release formulations. In our study, the figures were 52.5% for standard ibuprofen, and 70.6% for the FDC (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejp1068-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap">5</xref>). Thus, the outcomes for standard ibuprofen were comparable to published data while for the FDC these outcomes were even more favourable than those published for very fast release formulations.</p><p>Results well comparable to published data were also obtained for the remedication rate: Moore and colleagues reported that 43% of patients on standard ibuprofen versus 32% of patients taking fast release ibuprofen remedicated within 6&#x000a0;h in the dental model. According to the results obtained in our study 32.5% of patients in the ibuprofen arm remedicated compared to 16.0% in the FDC arm. The data obtained in this study are consistent as well with those reported for other pain models in the literature, e.g. for the treatment of tension type headache with 400&#x000a0;mg ibuprofen/200&#x000a0;mg caffeine (in comparison to ibuprofen, caffeine and placebo; [Diamond et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>]) showed that the adjuvant effect of caffeine is not restricted to ibuprofen's analgesic properties on dental extraction pain.</p><p>The FDC also compares well to other medicinal products that have been investigated in the dental extraction model: total pain relief over 0&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h was achieved in 70.6% of patients after FDC. Only high doses of etoricoxib (&#x02265;120&#x000a0;mg) and ketoprofen 100&#x000a0;mg provided total pain relief over 0&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h in 71&#x02013;79% of patients (etoricoxib) and &#x0003e;72% (ketoprofen) (Moore et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ejp1068-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the number of patients with adverse events was low in this study, and the FDC ibuprofen/caffeine was shown to be well tolerated and safe even over a period of 5&#x000a0;days. The majority of these events were of mild or moderate intensity with the most frequently reported AEs being nausea and vomiting. The most frequent (drug&#x02010;related) AEs nausea, vomiting, insomnia and dizziness were expected and are known side effects of ibuprofen or caffeine. Also insomnia is a common side effect of caffeine intake and alveolar osteitis is a common sequel after third molar extraction. The patients rating of overall tolerability was similar under treatment with ibuprofen and ibuprofen/caffeine slightly favouring the FDC, however, in both groups about 70% of the patients rated the tolerability as &#x02018;very good&#x02019; or &#x02018;excellent&#x02019;.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated that the FDC 400&#x000a0;mg ibuprofen/100&#x000a0;mg caffeine is an effective treatment for acute pain and is well tolerated and safe when administered over a period of five consecutive days, with superior efficacy compared to 400&#x000a0;mg ibuprofen alone.</p></sec><sec id="ejp1068-sec-0024"><title>Author contributions</title><p>T.W., E.R., A.H., D.D.M. and R.L. substantially contributed to study concept, design and results interpretation.
