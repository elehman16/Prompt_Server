However, many dentists in Japan are hesitant to acknowledge denture adhesives in daily practice because of the stereotype that dentures should be inherently stable, without the aid of adhesives. The aim of this study is to verify the efficacy of denture adhesives to establish guidelines for Japanese users. The null hypothesis is that the application of denture adhesives, including the cream and powder types, or a control (isotonic sodium chloride solution) would not produce different outcomes nor would they differentially improve the set outcomes between baseline and day 4 post-application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This ten-center, randomized controlled trial with parallel groups is ongoing. Three hundred edentulous patients with complete dentures will be allocated to three groups (cream-type adhesive, powder-type adhesive, and control groups). The participants will wear their dentures with the denture adhesive for 4&#x000a0;days, including during eight meals (three breakfasts, two lunches, and three dinners). The baseline measurements and final measurements for the denture adhesives will be performed on the first day and after breakfast on the fourth day. The primary outcome is a general satisfaction rating for the denture. The secondary outcomes are denture satisfaction ratings for various denture functions, occlusal bite force, resistance to dislodgement, masticatory performance, perceived chewing ability, and oral health-related quality of life. Between-subjects comparisons among the three groups and within-subjects comparisons of the pre- and post-intervention measurements will be performed. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis will be performed. The main analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. A sample size of 100 subjects per group, including an assumed dropout rate of 10&#x000a0;%, will be required to achieve 80&#x000a0;% power with a 5&#x000a0;% alpha level.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized clinical trial will provide information about denture adhesives to complete denture wearers, prosthodontic educators, and dentists in Japan.

Hence, historically, denture adhesives have already been on the market for over 100&#x000a0;years. Denture adhesives, characterized as medical products in 1935 by the American Dental Association Council on Dental Materials, Instruments, and Equipment, have been considered useful adjuncts for improving denture retention and stability. However, most dentists in Japan do not acknowledge denture adhesives for several reasons. First, they believe that dentures should be stable inherently, without the aid of products such as denture adhesives. Second, famous reports have claimed that denture adhesives ruin dentures, cause shrinkage, and are harmful for denture wearers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], although the quality of these studies is limited (graded as level 4 on the Oxford Levels of Evidence: does not permit clinicians to engage in evidence-based clinical decision-making) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Finally, Japan has no guidelines for using denture adhesives. Consequently, Japanese dentists tend to prohibit denture wearers from using denture adhesives even though these individuals suffer from unstable dentures; moreover, many of these individuals are unable to visit a dental clinic owing to physical disabilities. Furthermore, Japanese researchers are hesitant to conduct clinical trials with denture wearers given the negative attitudes regarding denture adhesives. Thus, patients may use dental adhesives at home without understanding their effects, while dentists will not acknowledge denture adhesives without knowing their effects.</p><p>In our aging society, the number of older individuals who are unable to attend dental clinics to receive professional care is increasing. Thus, they cannot receive treatment to adjust their existing dentures or to obtain new dentures with good retention and stability, which is achieved by fitting the denture&#x02019;s tissue surface to the alveolar mucosa and by sealing the peripheral border [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Loose complete dentures can become dislodged when talking or eating, and this may induce anxiety in denture wearers, compelling them to withdraw from social activities, thus decreasing their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Such patients use denture adhesives even though there are other available treatments, such as existing denture adjustment or new denture fabrication. The continuing marked increase in denture adhesive sales, which reached 12 billion yen in Japan in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], suggests that patients use denture adhesives as an acceptable alternative to dentist-applied denture treatments. However, the use of denture adhesive remains controversial in Japan.</p><p>We reviewed the literature on denture adhesive use in patients with complete dentures when drafting the trial protocol presented herein. The effectiveness of denture adhesives has been investigated in terms of prosthesis retention, stability, masticatory function, and oral health-related quality of life (OHR-QoL). Several studies demonstrated that the retention and stability improvements were more obvious in old or ill-fitting dentures when compared to new prostheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, Grasso et al. did not report any differences in adhesive-related retention and stability improvement between well-fitting and ill-fitting maxillary dentures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A study by Figueiral et al., which employed vertical tensile tests and intraoral resistance transducers, showed that denture adhesives did improve maxillary complete denture retention; however, the fit of the prostheses was not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Kapur reported that despite showing initial improvements in retention, mandibular denture wearers demonstrated significant loss of retention when asked to chew test foods and drink taste solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Regarding bite force, several studies indicated that denture adhesives significantly improve the denture-related bite force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Using a multichannel magnetometer tracking system, Rendell et al. evaluated the effects of denture adhesives on the chewing rates in complete denture patients and found that the mean chewing rates increased immediately after the adhesive was applied and were still increased at 2 and 4&#x000a0;h after application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Kulak et al. examined whether adhesives improve chewing ability, comfort, retention, and patient confidence using subjective measures and found positive correlations concerning the improvements after adhesive use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nicolas et al. reported that after 3&#x000a0;months of wearing new complete dentures, adhesives improved the subjects&#x02019; abilities to manage conventional dentures and enhanced their oral quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite the variety of studies on the use of denture adhesives, whether adhesives are beneficial to denture wearers remains controversial.</p><p>After reviewing articles selected from the National Library of Medicine&#x02019;s PubMed database, Cochrane Collaboration Library, ADA Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry website, and EMBASE database, the American College of Prosthodontists published guidelines on denture adhesives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The guidelines stated the following regarding the advantages of denture adhesives: (1) denture adhesives, when properly used, can improve the retention and stability of dentures and help keep food particles from accumulating beneath the dentures, even in well-fitting dentures, and (2) in a quality-of-life study, patient ratings showed that denture adhesives may improve the denture wearer&#x02019;s perceptions of retention, stability, and quality of life. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for denture adhesives, which can provide evidence in support of the efficacy of denture adhesives and aid in the development of denture adhesive guidelines, are rare, suggesting that even the published guidelines require further development.</p><p>While a few clinical trials have been published in Japan, they were not RCTs. Moreover, the results derived from Japanese denture wearers might be different from those mentioned in previous studies performed in other countries since patients&#x02019; attitudes toward dental materials reflect food culture and socioeconomic differences among the countries. Therefore, guidelines or official statements concerning the use of denture adhesives in clinical practice in Japan cannot be developed at this time. Performing RCTs and collecting data that can be used to develop clinical practice guidelines to standardize the usage, raise the quality of care, and reduce the risk for older Japanese individuals is essential, since there are many older individuals in Japan who cannot receive denture treatment in a dental clinic owing to their physical conditions, meaning they may turn to dental adhesives instead. Thus, we plan to perform an RCT at the following ten centers: Iwate Medical University, Tohoku University, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo, Tsurumi University, Kanagawa Dental College, Osaka Dental University, Tokushima University, Nagasaki University, and Kagoshima University. This ten-center RCT, which will be performed throughout Japan, has external validity. This trial is referred to as the Denture Adhesive Guideline (DAG) project. The aim of the DAG trial is to verify the efficacy of denture adhesives in order to establish guidelines for using denture adhesives in clinical practice in Japan. The null hypothesis of this study is that the application of two types of denture adhesives (cream and powder) and a control would not produce differences in the set outcomes and would not result in differences in the improvement of the set outcomes between baseline and day 4 following application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Organization of the Denture Adhesive Guideline trial</title><p>The Japan Denture Care Society organized the trial. The chief investigator, YK, drafted the trial protocol, which is being used at ten centers. The chief coordinators, SK and AG, maintain close contact with the coordinators at each center.

The evaluators measure the outcomes of the trials and record the data after undergoing training on how to perform the measurements.

Interim analyses of the trial will be performed when 100 and 200 participants have completed the trial. The trial will be stopped under the following conditions: (1) excess harm is observed, (2) statistically significant benefits are observed, (3) little additional useful information or negligible chance of demonstrating efficacy will be yielded if fully completed. These early stopping rules will help minimize harm and maximize the benefits for the patients enrolled in the RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization, allocation concealment, and sequence generation</title><p>A randomized, controlled parallel clinical trial will be conducted at the abovementioned ten centers. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups and will be instructed to apply either a denture adhesive or a control solution to both their maxillary and mandibular dentures: cream-type denture adhesive group, powder-type denture adhesive group, and control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Balanced allocation of participants to each group will be achieved using the following method: 300 random allocation numbers with no overlap and no underlap will be generated by the &#x0201c;RAND&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;RANK&#x0201d; functions in Excel (Microsoft Japan Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The first to 300<sup>th</sup> numbers will be ordered randomly. Then, the first to 100<sup>th</sup>, 101<sup>st</sup> to 200<sup>th</sup>, and 201<sup>st</sup> to 300<sup>th</sup> randomly ordered numbers will be assigned to the cream-type denture adhesive group, powder-type denture adhesive group, and control group, respectively. As per the assignment, 300 envelopes containing a card stamped with the group name will be prepared. The 300 envelopes will be divided 30 by 30 for ten centers in sequence, which means that each of the ten centers will receive 30 envelopes. Then, the coordinator at each center will open one envelope and allocate a qualifying participant to the indicated group after the patient agrees to participate in the study and provides informed consent. This method enables us to allocate the 300 numbers to the three groups equally and randomly. Once the 300 participants have been completely allocated, the number of participants in each of the three groups will be equal. Blinding the participants to the intervention is not feasible, since the participants will be able to determine the type of denture adhesive they are using during application. Evaluators are blinded to the allocation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1612_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The coordinator will interview the participants and explain the trial to them. Then, written informed consent will be obtained from each candidate. Once the candidate provides informed consent to the coordinator, an evaluator will perform an eligibility screening to check whether the participant meets any of the exclusion criteria. Next, the coordinator will randomly allocate the qualified candidate to one of the three trial groups using the abovementioned envelope.

The coordinator will describe how to use the denture adhesive to the participant. The participants will be instructed to apply the denture adhesive before eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and to remove the remaining denture adhesive immediately before applying new denture adhesive or sleeping at night. The participants will begin applying the denture adhesive before dinner on day 1, and then eat dinner with the denture adhesive applied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Days 2 and 3</title><p>The participants will not visit the hospital on these days.

The procedures for applying the powder-type denture adhesive are as follows: (1) before applying the powder, dentures should be cleaned, rinsed, and left wet; (2) gently squeeze or tap the bottle to dispense the powder onto the entire denture surface; and (3) shake off any excess powder, press the dentures into place, and hold briefly. The instructions for applying the cream-type denture adhesive are as follows: (1) before applying the cream, dentures should be cleaned, rinsed, and dried; (2) gently squeeze the tube and place the cream in small strips or a series of dots on the denture surface; and (3) press dentures firmly in place and hold briefly. Finally, the procedures for applying the control (distributed as eight bottles, with one bottle to be used per application) are as follows: (1) before applying the solution, dentures should be cleaned, rinsed, and left wet; (2) gently squeeze the bottle to dispense the liquid onto the entire denture surface; (3) press the dentures into place, and hold briefly. Compliance with the intervention with regard to using the denture adhesives and control will be checked by weighing the remaining denture adhesives and counting the remaining number of saline solution bottles, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>Experts and members of the Japan Denture Care Society selected the outcomes for the current trial after reviewing previously published articles on denture adhesives. The primary outcome is a general satisfaction rating obtained with a 100-mm VAS. The satisfaction ratings will be determined using valid questionnaires with eight evaluation items: general satisfaction, ability to speak, ease of cleaning, stability, retention, comfort, and esthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The participants will be asked to assess their current existing complete dentures and to record their satisfaction rating for each item on the questionnaire by drawing a vertical line on a 100-mm VAS. Each vertical line in the questionnaire represents &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; (100) at the extreme right and &#x0201c;very dissatisfied&#x0201d; (0) at the extreme left. Data will be recorded as continuous variables at 1-mm intervals using calipers, beginning at the extreme left. The general satisfaction will be measured twice: at baseline and day 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>The secondary outcomes will be measured twice: at baseline and day 4.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Occlusal bite force</title><p>The occlusal bite force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] will be measured bilaterally at the first molar region using a force transducer occlusal force meter (GM10; Nagano Keiki, Tokyo, Japan) consisting of a digital hydraulic pressure gauge and a vinyl biting element covered with a plastic sheath. A pressure gauge displays the bite force values in Newtons on a digital screen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Resistance to dislodgement</title><p>The resistance to dislodgement, which is defined as the maximum occlusal force exerted during a bite before the denture dislocates, will be measured by placing the abovementioned occlusal force meter at the incisor and canine regions. Moreover, the resistance to dislodgement quantitatively assesses the bite force needed to dislodge maxillary and/or mandibular dentures. It also demonstrates the benefits of using denture adhesive to improve the retention and stability of the tested dentures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Masticatory performance</title><p>The masticatory performance, or mixing ability, will be evaluated using color-changeable chewing gum (Masticatory Performance Evaluating Gum; XYLITOL Lotte Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and a colorimeter (CR-13; Konica-Minolta Sensing, Tokyo, Japan). As per previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the measurements will be performed as follows: (1) participants will be instructed to chew the gum depending on their preferred side, without any instructions as to the chewing side, for 60 chewing cycles at a rhythm of once per second, which will be set with a metronome; (2) the chewed gum will be extracted immediately after chewing, flattened to a thickness of 1.5&#x000a0;mm by compressing the gum between two glass plates, and then placed on polyethylene films; and (3) the color will be measured through the polyethylene films using a colorimeter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Oral health-related quality of life</title><p>The OHR-QoL will be measured with the Japanese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous patients (OHIP-EDENT-J). The OHIP-EDENT-J is composed of 19 items distributed among the following seven subscales: functional limitations, pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, and handicap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Participants will be asked to rate the frequency with which they believe they encountered these items on a 5-point Likert scale, as follows: never (score 0), hardly ever (score 1), occasionally (score 2), fairly often (score 3), and very often (score 4). The sum of the ratings for all 19 items will be used as a score of OHR-QoL impairment, with the lowest score being 0 and the highest score being 76. The more the score increases, the more the OHR-QoL decreases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Perceived chewing abilities</title><p>The trial will utilize two types of questionnaires to measure the patients&#x02019; self-reported chewing abilities. One of the questionnaires will measure the participants&#x02019; general perception of their chewing abilities during the mastication of each food (see list below), defined as the perceived chewing ability. The other questionnaire will measure chewing perception by asking how well the participants believe they chewed their food immediately before swallowing, defined as the perceived chewing ability at swallowing. Using the 100-mm VAS, participants will evaluate their perceived chewing ability and perceived chewing ability at swallowing when consuming the following foods: soybean curd, fish sausage, soybean sprout, cubic rice cracker, and dry squid. Each vertical line on the VAS for chewing represents &#x0201c;very easy to chew&#x0201d; (100) at the extreme right and &#x0201c;very difficult to chew&#x0201d; (0) at the extreme left, while the lines on the VAS for perceived chewing ability at swallowing represent &#x0201c;swallowed without chewing&#x0201d; at the extreme right (100) and &#x0201c;swallowed with chewing&#x0201d; (0) at the extreme left. Data will be recorded as continuous variables by measuring the distance at 1-mm intervals using calipers, beginning at the extreme left.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Adverse events</title><p>The adverse events reported by participants are recorded on an as-needed basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Covariates</title><p>The following covariates will be evaluated to determine their effects on the outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Participant characteristics will be evaluated using a questionnaire authorized by the Japan Prosthodontic Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Denture adhesives could help some of these patients. However, Japanese dentists hesitate to recommend or apply denture adhesives to their patients, as no Japanese guidelines for denture adhesives exist. This RCT will provide evidence of the effects of denture adhesives to complete denture wearers, caretakers at nursing homes, prosthodontic educators, and dentists in Japan. Moreover, the evidence generated by this trial in Japan will help to establish evidenced-based denture adhesive guidelines in Japan. These guidelines will release Japanese dentists from the dogma that denture adhesives do more harm than good. Furthermore, we believe the new evidence concerning the use of denture adhesives from Japan will aid dentists in their daily practice even in other countries.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is currently ongoing.
