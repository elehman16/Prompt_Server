between a lumbar stability group and a lumbar instability group of patients with chronic
low-back pain. [Subjects] Sixty-nine patients with chronic low-back pain were divided into
two groups: a lumbar stability group (n=39) and a lumbar instability group (n=30).
[Methods] The patients were assessed using a goniometer to evaluate the hip range of
motion at pre-test. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0 software for Windows. The
experimental data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, repeated one-way ANOVA, and the
t-test, and a significance level of 0.05. [Results] The limitation of hip range of motion
of the lumbar instability group was significantly greater than that of the lumbar
stability group. [Conclusion] The chronic low-back pain patients showed greater limitation
of hip range of motion than healthy persons, and among them, those who had lumbar
instability showed greater limitation than those with lumbar stability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hip range of motion</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Lumbar instability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 23&#x02013;69% of chronic low-back pain cases are related to lumbar segment
instability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and researchers have
reported that melosalgia frequently occurs during walking, standing, and sitting by such
patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is reported to be due to
an imbalance in the motor system at the level of the spine. For example the occurrence of
excessive rotation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> in the lumbopelvic
region during external rotation of the hip joint<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, compared to healthy persons, indicates that trunk flexion of
low-back pain patients occurs excessively the sagittal plane due to limited internal
rotation of the hip joint. Neumann advised that the hip joint tends to rotate internally due
to hypofunction of the gluteus medius muscle and shortening of the iliotibial tract. He also
stated that hypofunction of the gluteus medius muscle is a cause of instability in the
lumbopelvic region<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chronic low-back pain leads to pelvic hypofunction and tension in the muscles surrounding
the hip joint<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Movements in the
lumbopelvic region occur abnormally early during voluntary movement of the limbs and these
repeated movements can cause instability in the lumbopelvic region along with microdamage to
the same region, which may result in low-back pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although lumbar vertebrae instability has recently been diagnosed
based on lateral flexion-extension of the lumbar vertebrae in radiological images, many
studies using clinical measuring methods have been also reported. Abbott et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed and reported the reliability of
passive accessory intervertebral motion tests and passive physiological intervertebral
motion tests in diagnoses of spinal displacement due to lumbar instability. Tidstrand and
Horneij<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested sitting subjects on a
large gymnastic ball and having them perform unilateral pelvic lift tests as a tool that can
be conveniently used in clinics.</p><p>Many recent studies have investigated the correlations between low-back pain and limitation
of hip-joint functions<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
assessment of the hip joint in relation to low-back pain is perceived as playing an
important role in selecting the direction of treatment. However, no study has been conducted
in Korea on hypofunction of the hip joint in relation to chronic low-back pain or limitation
of hip-joint function resulting from lumbar instability.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to divide chronic low-back pain patients into a
lumbar segment stability group and an instability group using tests described in previous
studies, and to compare differences in the hip range of motion between the two groups in
order to evaluate the level of lumbar instability of the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were selected from among those who had been treated for at least three months
for low-back pain. The exclusion criteria were a history of orthopedic or neurosurgical
operation or current treatment for other neurological problems and inability to perform the
experimental tasks due to acute pain. A total of 69 study subjects selected from among the
applicants were enrolled in this experiment. The means and standard deviations of the
subjects&#x02019; ages, heights, and weights were 56.31 &#x000b1; 13.11&#x02005;years, 160.87 &#x000b1; 7.26&#x02005;cm, and 60.36 &#x000b1;
9.62&#x02005;kg, respectively. This study was approved by D Hospital, and all the participants
provided their written informed consent.</p><p>Single-limb stance tests were conducted to evaluate lumbar instability. Each subject stood
on the left or right leg in a random order while standing with the spine in the neutral
position. The subjects who could maintain a spinal upright posture for 20 seconds while
maintaining the iliac crest on the level with no compensatory motion of the lower limb or
upper limb on the contralateral side were regarded as exhibiting lumbar stability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects whose initial upright
posture was twisted, or showed displacement of the iliac crest or compensatory motion of the
lower limb or upper limb on the contralateral side were considered to exhibit lumbar
instability.</p><p>For the ball test, the patients sat on a large gymnastic ball with their arms folded across
the chest. Then, they lifted the soles of the feet approximately 5&#x02005;cm from the ground while
ensuring that the calf region did not come into contact with the ball. They were asked to
maintain this posture for 20 seconds. The diameter and air pressure of the ball was adjusted
to ensure the hip joint and the knee joint could be maintained at 90&#x000b0; flexion. In this test,
subjects were considered to have lumbar stability if they maintained a spinal upright
posture for 20 seconds and could maintain the iliac crest on the level with no compensatory
motion of the lower limb on the contralateral side.</p><p>In the passive accessory intervertebra motion (PAIVM) test, the tester touched and pressed
the spinous process of the lumbar vertebral body of each patient perpendicularly with the
tester&#x02019;s hand while the patient was in a prone position. Patient were judged to have lumbar
instability if excessive movements of the vertebral body were felt or if the vertebral body
moved in an abnormal way. This test is considered highly valid with high specificity
(81&#x02013;89%) and low sensitivity (29&#x02013;46%)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the passive lumbar extension (PLE) test, with the patients in a prone position, the
tester gently pulled both of the patient&#x02019;s lower limbs to a height of 30&#x02005;cm from the surface
of the bed while keeping the patient&#x02019;s knees extended<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hypermobility of the lumbar region is induced by the passive
lumbar extension performed in this test, which will cause pain in the low back of patients
with lumbar instability. Patients were considered to have lumbar instability if pain,
accompanied by a very heavy feeling, occurred in the lower lumbar region. This test&#x02019;s
positive likelihood ratio is high at 8.84.</p><p>In the prone instability (PI) test, the tester pressed the lumbar spinous processes of the
patients when they were in the prone position with the hip joint placed at the corner of a
board. The patients were considered to have lumbar instability if pain was felt while the
lumbar spinous process was pressed and the pain disappeared when the hip joint was extended
with both knee joints in an extended position. The reliability of this test is r=0.89<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the five test described above, 0
points were awarded for lumbar instability as defined by each test and 1 point was awarded
for lumbar stability, and when appropriate scores were awarded for both the left and right
sides. The score of each subject was summed possible range of 0&#x02013;7 points, and the average
score of all subjects was calculated. Those with scores higher than the average were
assigned to a lumbar stability group, and those with scores lower than the average were
assigned to a lumbar instability group.</p><p>Each patient&#x02019;s hip range of motion was evaluated using a goniometer. Both sides were
measured in a random order. The measurements were repeated three times and the average value
was calculated. The measurement reliability of the goniometer for hip range of motion is
reported to be very high with Cronbach &#x003b1; values of at least 0.90<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The experimental data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, repeated one-way ANOVA, and the
t-test. The data were statistically processed using SPSS WIN ver. 18.0 and a significance
level of &#x003b1; =0.05</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The inter-rater reliabilities of the five lumbar instability tests ranged from 0.87&#x02013;0.96
for the single-limb stance test, 0.72&#x02013;0.84 for the ball test, 0.62&#x02013;0.82 for the PLE test,
0.78&#x02013;0.92 for the PAIVM test, and 0.83&#x02013;0.99 for the PI test. The inter-rater reliability for
division determination of lumbar instability across the five tests ranged from 0.74&#x02013;0.89.
The average and standard deviation of the scores of the subjects in the five tests were 3.6
and 0.38, respectively. The subjects with scores equal to or lower than 3, were assigned to
the lumbar instability group (n=30) and those with scores higher than 4 points were assigned
to the lumbar stability group (n=39). In this study, the inter-rater reliability of the
goniometer for the measurement of hip range of motion was a Cronbach &#x003b1; value of 0.83. The
hip ranges of motion of the lumbar stability group and the lumbar instability group were
compared. The lumbar instability group showed significantly greater limitation of the hip
range of motion than the lumbar stability group (p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the levels of the hip range of motion between the lumbar stability

lumbar instability analyzed, and they were found to be similar to those of previous studies.
The inter-rater reliability was also found to be high. The ratios of lumbar instability were
reported as ranging from 23 to 69% in a study of radiological images<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ratio of the present study falls within that
range.</p><p>In this study, the inter-rater reliability for the measurement of the hip range of motion
by goniometer was a Cronbach &#x003b1; value of 0.83. Compared to the hip range of motion of healthy
Koreans reported by a previous study<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
hip range of motion of the chronic low-back pain patients in this study was significantly
different. This is consistent with Van Dillen et al. <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that the range of joint motion in hip-joint extension
by subjects with low-back pain was significantly different from that of healthy persons.</p><p>Mellin<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the limitation of
the hip range of motion would increase with increasing intensity of low-back pain, and that
hip-joint flexion, extension, and internal rotation, decreases in the flexibility of the
hamstring muscle of males, and hip-joint flexion and extension in females were significantly
affected by low-back pain. However, in the present study, the level of limitation appeared
not to be influenced by intensity, and the levels of limitation were shown to be high in
hip-joint extension and internal rotation. The limitation of hip-joint extension is
attributable to the retroversion of the pelvis, due to the weakening and shortening of the
psoas muscle. High levels of limitation in hip-joint internal rotation is thought to be
caused by retroversion of the pelvis, which is related to the shortening of the muscles in
hip-joint external rotation resting from habitual sitting on the floor, a feature of Korean
daily life. The lumbar instability group showed higher levels of limitation than the lumbar
stability group (p&#x0003c;0.01), which indicates that the level of lumbar instability is related
to the level of limitation of hip range of motion. This would be explained by the lack of a
stabilizing function in the lumbar region, pelvic region, and hip joint, due to the
weakening or tension of the hip-joint muscles caused by hypofunctioning of lumbar segments
in chronic low-back pain patients.</p><p>Given these results, if limited hip-joint functions could be improved, the functions of the
hip-joint muscles that contribute to the stabilization of the lumbopelvic region would
recover, which would help with the recovery of lumbar stability. This would be helpful for
reducing the intensity of low-back pain. In addition, chronic low-back pain patients showed
greater limitation in hip range of motion than healthy persons, and those who had lumbar
instability showed higher levels of limitation than those with lumbar stability. Therefore,
the evaluation of the hip joint and therapeutic interventions should be considered major
elements of treatments for chronic low-back pain patients with lumbar instability, and
further research should be conducted on this topic.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Siebenga</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Leferink</surname><given-names>VJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Segers</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A prospective cohort study comparing the VAS spine score
