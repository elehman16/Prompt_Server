Sixty subjects with very thin to moderately thick lips (Lip Fullness Grading Scale [LFGS]<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> scores 0&#x02013;2) were randomized 1:1 to treatment with HA-RK or HA-JV. Randomization was stratified by baseline LFGS score. The study was approved by independent ethics committees in accordance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki (and later revisions) and conducted in compliance with good clinical practice. All subjects gave written informed consent to participate. Key exclusion criteria included: previous surgery/tattoo to the lips, presence of any abnormal lip structure, active skin disease, history of angioedema, permanent lip implant, and lip enhancement or laser therapy performed within the preceding 12 months.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Treatments</title><p>Subjects were treated on Day 0 with either HA-RK (20 mg/mL HA, Galderma SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) or HA-JV (15 mg/mL HA, Allergan, Pringy, France). Both are biodegradable, HA gels of nonanimal origin, cross-linked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether but manufactured using different technologies. The study required injection of each subject with a sufficient amount of product to reach &#x02265;1 grade increase in LFGS score in both lips. Touch-up treatment could be administered after 2 weeks. Study product was slowly administered by submucosal injection in the lips, using an injection technique chosen by the treating investigator (the same predominant injection technique was used for all subjects at each site). Up to 3 mL (1.5 mL in each lip) could be injected at the initial and touch-up treatment combined. Both study products contained lidocaine hydrochloride (3 mg/mL), but additional local anesthesia could be used. The injection technique, volumes injected, and ease of injection and molding were documented for each lip. Optional retreatment was offered at 12 months, and a maximum total volume of 3 mL was allowed.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Effect Assessments</title><p>Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) score was assessed by treating investigators and subjects, and by blinded evaluators after study end, using photographs taken with standardized settings.</p><p>Lip Fullness Grading Scale score (0 = very thin; 1 = thin; 2 = moderately thick; 3 = thick; 4 = full) was assessed by the treating investigator and by blinded evaluators (using photographs).

A subject satisfaction questionnaire was completed.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Intensity of local tolerability symptoms (bruising, redness, pain, tenderness, itching, and swelling) was recorded by subjects in a 14-day diary after initial treatment.

However, this cannot explain the difference in filler volume required, as smaller volumes were injected to achieve &#x02265;1 grade improvement also in the lower lips of the HA-RK group, which had similar lip fullness at baseline as the HA-JV group.</p><p>Despite the smaller volume injected in the HA-RK group, the duration of lip fullness and aesthetic improvement over 12 months were comparable in the 2 groups. At 6 months after treatment, approximately 60% of subjects in both groups had lip fullness improvement, and &#x02265;80% of subjects were improved according to GAIS. At 12 months after treatment, approximately 25% of subjects in both groups still had lip fullness improvement, and &#x02265;39% of subjects were improved according to GAIS.
