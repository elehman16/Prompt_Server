First is an active (or acute) phase, characterized by inflammation and progressive deformity of the erect penis. During the acute disease phase, patients may experience painful erections and curvature deformity of the erect penis. However, not all patients have the experience penile pain or discomfort. The early phase generally lasts from 6 to 16 months, and after this phase, the majority of patients experience plaque's stabilization or disease progression.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The transition to the chronic phase is marked by resolution of pain and inflammation. The plaque size and the penis curvature become relatively stable with extensive fibrosis.</p><p>No reliable and effective nonsurgical therapy has emerged, in part because of the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology disorders.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker and therefore an intralesional verapamil injection (IVI) therapy inhibits calcium-dependent extracellular collagen transport and up-grade regulates collagenase activity at the plaque site.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Reports on the efficacy of IVI are varying. <italic>In vitro</italic> data demonstrate that the transport of extracellular matrix molecules, including collagen and fibronectin, is a calcium-dependent process. Therefore, a modification of the inflammatory response in the early phase of the disorder inhibits fibroblast proliferation in the plaques.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the only randomized placebo-controlled study, no statistical significant differences were reported in plaque size, penile curvature and pain during erection.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) have long been used in the treatment of ED. In PD, these agents are proposed to inhibit tissue remodeling after acute injuries by decreasing oxidative stress responsible for inflammation and fibrosis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The hypothesis of this study is that the combination of the mechanical effects of penile therapy with IVI and oral medications whit PDE5 (tadalafil) may have a synergistic effect on the tunica albuginea and plaque for men with PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this prospective, randomized study between April 2010 and May 2013, 59 consecutive patients diagnosed with PD, were treated as it follows: Group A (GA) consisted of 23 patients treated with verapamil 10 mg, 1 injection/week for a period of 12 weeks in the plaque ensuring uniformity of the injected drug; Group B (GB) counted 19 patients treated with oral medication: Tadalafil 5 mg once a day for a period of 3 months; Group C (GC) involved 17 patients treated with the association of two therapeutic agents (verapamil 10 mg and tadalafil 5 mg) for a period of 3 months. The group of patients underwent a comprehensive diagnostic protocol that included medical history, clinical examination, self-photography, penile Doppler ultrasound in patients associated ED. Patients with the following characteristics were included into the study protocol: disease not &#x0003e;12 months, a single penile plaque demonstrated by dynamic sonography, plaque's maximum size of 3.75 cm<sup>2</sup> and penis recurvatum &#x0003c;30&#x000b0;. Patients receiving prior intralesional or surgical therapy for PD were excluded.</p><p>All patients gave their informed written consent. Subjects receive randomly IVI therapy or tadalafil 5 mg once daily or IVI plus tadalafil 5 mg for 3 months.</p><p>Erectile function, presence and severity of painful erections, penile plaque's size and penile curvature degree were assessed at baseline and follow-up evaluations by the same operator. ED was evaluated through the shortened version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Severity of painful erection was assessed by means of VAS score ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being severe pain. Plaque position was evaluated by palpation and plaque size was assessed by ultrasonography during an artificial erection induced by a standard injection of alprostadil (8 mcg). Plaque's size was measured as the product of length and width in square centimeters. The degree of penile curvature was determined with a goniometer during full artificial erection.</p><p>Statistical analysis of the mean values of continuous variables was performed using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and analysis of the significance of the categorical variables was performed using the Chi-square and Fisher tests. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Patient's characteristics at inclusion are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Not statistically significant differences emerged between the three groups at baseline. One patient of GB abandoned the study after 1-month of therapy because of drug intolerance (headache and flushing). There were no clinically hematomas requiring intervention reported after IVI. No patients reported new ED or changes in penile sensation. Four patients of GA (17%) and two of GB (2%) had a superficial hematoma at injection site, but there were no permanent adverse sequelae. However, adverse treatment effects are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. 3 months after the therapy in GA pain resolved completely or partially in 57% (13/23) of the patients, whereas in 61% (11/18) and 76% (13/17) cases of GB and GC, respectively.

This leads to efforts using more sophisticated intralesional injection to suppress the fibrosis plaque. Other options for treatment include the use of pentoxyphyline, tamoxifen and Vitamin E as antiinflammatory reagents.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Several products that are delivered as injections into the penile plaque have been tested as PD treatments. Treatment with injectable agents is typically performed by a specialist. Verapamil, a calcium anatagonist, has been used to treat PD based on its ability to alter fibroblast production of extracellular matrix macromolecules and collagenases.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Reports on the efficacy of IVI are varying. In 1994, Levine <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] published a small nonrandomized study of escalating IVI that demonstrated the drug's safety and the efficacy in reducing plaque volumes and penile curvature. A subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed a decrease in plaque volume and a trend towards improved curvature (nonstatistically significant) when compared to saline IVI alone.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>An uncontrolled trial in 2007 showed statistically significant improvement in penile rigidity in 94 patients,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] while a 2009 randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 80 patients showed no statistical significance with Verapamil treatment in any of the primary outcomes (plaque size, degree of curvature, and erectile function).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Since then, IVI has been used in a great number of trials both alone[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and in combination with other treatment modalities (dexamethasone administered via trans-dermal electromotive administration,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] testosterone supplementation in low-testosterone patients with PD,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and pentoxifylline and L-arginine given orally with or without penile traction.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] PDE5i have long been used in the ED treatment. PDE5i enhances smooth muscle relaxation of the corpus cavernosum, thereby promoting blood flow to the penis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>A current research of PDE5i use in regulating penile erectile response has revealed an alternative role for PDE5i in decreasing oxidative stress-associated inflammatory change by reducing the collagen/smooth muscle and collagen. Long-term use of PDE5i as an antifibrotic agent by maintaining or increasing the NO and cGMP levels in the target tissues has been promising and provides a much needed armamentarium in the PD medical therapy. The apoptotic effect on penile myofibroblast with PDE5i has been shown in sildenafil,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] vardenafil,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and tadalafil.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Ferrini <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have reported that long-term oral treatment with vardenafil slows down and reverses the early stages of an experimental PD-like plaque in rats and potentially might play a role to ameliorate a more advanced plaque. A retrospective chart review of 65 PD patients showed a statistically significant improvement in the IIEF score in patients taking a low dose of tadalafil daily for 6 months when compared with those who did not take tadalafil.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Finally, Palmieri <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] published that tadalafil therapy in combination with ESWT was superior then ESWT alone in both IIEF and quality of life scores.</p><p>There are no studies in the literature that have compared the therapeutic efficacy of Verapamil and PDE5i association of in PD treatment.</p><p>In our study, curvature degree decreased in all groups without statistically differences from baseline values, while a further decrease of plaque size was evident in the group treated with the association of the two therapeutic agents (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). This lower rate of deterioration in penile curvature could be explained by the short-term follow-up. However, tadalafil may play a role in stabilizing plaque's fibrosis of and penis curvature, as amply demonstrated in the literature. The increase in IIEF-5 scores in the tadalafil groups is to be expected. Certainly the limit of our study, in addition to a nonhigh number of patients treated in draw each group, was to have had a short period of follow-up. This prevents information on the natural course of the plaque or the possible long-term efficacy of tadalafil. Another limit of the present study is the low incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities (hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease) of significant severity, which likely reflects the excellent health status of the patients and then a rapid recovery of sexual function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study demonstrates an interesting therapeutic signal in which tadalafil used daily has a role on antifibrotic activity in PD and its treatment.</p><p>This action is valid when combined strategically to the synergistic action of verapamil injected directly into the plaque. Moreover, IVI was not able to improve alone plaque size and curvature degree in our subset of patients. However, larger studies with a longer follow-up are needed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed therapeutic strategy in PD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
