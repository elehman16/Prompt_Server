Recently a combinatorial product with toltrazuril plus iron has been developed for parenteral application.

The Baycox&#x000ae; and the Control group received 200 mg of iron dextran/piglet on SD 2. All piglets were infected with 1000 sporulated <italic>C. suis</italic> oocysts on SD 3. Faecal samples were taken daily from SD 7 to SD 20 to determine faecal consistency, oocyst shedding and other diarrhoeal pathogens. Body weight was recorded on SD 1 and then weekly until SD 29.

Excretion peaked on SD 9 (max. 48,618 oocysts per gram of faeces). Treatment with Forceris&#x000ae; completely suppressed oocyst excretion. In the Baycox&#x000ae; group, low levels of excretion could be detected. Diarrhoea was reduced to single piglets in the treated groups. Body weight development was reduced in the Control group compared to the treated groups. Enteropathogenic bacteria (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>) could be detected.

Both, Forceris&#x000ae; and Baycox&#x000ae; had a comparable effect on oocyst shedding, faecal consistency and body weight development.</p><p id="Par29">Oocyst shedding was significantly suppressed in both treated groups compared to the Control group. Despite the intra-litter randomisation which entailed a high environmental contamination in all litters due to the presence of untreated control animals, no piglets of the Forceris&#x000ae; group excreted oocysts during the trial. This indicates that the treatment was highly effective and the level of false-positive samples due to coprophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in such an experimental setting is likely to be low. In the Baycox&#x000ae; group three samples were positive with one oocyst in McMaster counting each, resulting in OpG values of 333. It is difficult to unequivocally conclude that these findings are derived from true infections for the reason stated above; however, one of the two animals that excreted countable oocysts did so on two consecutive days indicating that at least this individual shed oocysts due to infection and not due to coprophagy, but data on the extent of false positive samples due to this in experimentally infected mixed litters are not available. Low levels of oocyst shedding can occur despite treatment with Baycox&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] while in other experimentally induced infections suppression of oocyst development was complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite low levels of oocyst shedding the reduction of environmental recontamination by disruption of the parasite&#x02019;s life-cycle was highly effective.</p><p>Diarrhoea is a hallmark of porcine cystoisosporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; it can be induced by parasite infection in the absence of other enteropathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] but exacerbated by rotavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or <italic>Cl. perfringens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and probably by other enteropathogens as well. Early studies on the use of toltrazuril in pigs indicated that <italic>C. suis</italic> has a forerunner role for bacterial infections as anticoccidial treatment reduced diarrhoea and simultaneously the amount of antibiotics required to control bacterial infections on affected farms, but a low level of diarrhoea was still seen after toltrazuril application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the light of these findings, it is conceivable that the <italic>E. coli</italic> and clostridia that were circulating in the litters (and also detected in the animals with diarrhoea after treatment) contributed to the clinical outcome in some individuals despite successful treatment of cystoisosporosis.</p><p id="Par30">Body weight development and diarrhoea are inversely related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and consequently body weight gain was increased in treated animals (which showed less diarrhoea), with the result of higher weights around weaning on SD 29 compared to the Control group. Improved weight gain has also been shown upon treatment in <italic>C. suis</italic>-positive herds with no apparent clinical signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], indicating that the presence of the parasite may influence performance of piglets even at low infection levels.</p><p id="Par31">Parasite shedding, diarrhoea and body weight development showed no significant differences between the two toltrazuril formulations; both were highly efficacious. Forceris&#x000ae; can be used to simultaneously treat metaphylactically against <italic>C. suis</italic> infection and supply the iron required to support the rapid growth and increase in blood volume during the first days of life of the piglets, thus reducing the required handling of the piglets. Time needed for oral treatment of one piglet was estimated at 10 seconds with a labour cost estimation of &#x020ac; 18/hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], significantly contributing to the costs of coccidiosis control. Forceris&#x000ae; can be applied from the first day of life (Baycox&#x000ae;: third to fifth day of life) and may thus also be more useful in cases where <italic>C. suis</italic> infections occur very early after birth and are often seriously exacerbated by bacterial infections, such as with <italic>Cl. perfringens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Accurate dosing of piglets by injection may also be of advantage when vomiting occurs for a variety of reasons, including infection with <italic>C. suis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">Oocyst shedding was reduced to a minimum in the Baycox&#x000ae; group and suppressed completely in the Forceris&#x000ae; group. Diarrhoea was also reduced significantly in both treatment groups, resulting in significantly better weight gain. The latter was depressed during the acute stage of infection (in the second week of life) in animals that were clinically affected by pasty to watery diarrhoea. Both applications were safe to use and effective in a single application. Early (metaphylactic) treatment of piglet coccidiosis during the prepatent phase of infection can control infection and significantly improve piglet health when <italic>C. suis</italic> is present on a farm. Treatment with toltrazuril together with iron by injection was safe and effective. Handling of animals for medication was reduced by the combination product without interfering with the efficacy of toltrazuril treatment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AF</term><def><p id="Par521">Autofluorescence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par5">Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FS</term><def><p id="Par6">Faecal score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OpG</term><def><p id="Par7">Oocysts per gram of faeces</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par8">Study day</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors sincerely thank the staff of the Institute of Parasitology, Vetmeduni Vienna, for competent sampling and sample processing.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par33">This study was funded by Ceva, France.
