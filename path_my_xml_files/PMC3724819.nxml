Dysfunction of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43), an established miR-1 target, during cardiac hypertrophy leads to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). However, it is still unknown whether miR-1 and Cx43 are interconnected in the pro-arrhythmic context of hypertrophy. Thus, in this study we investigated whether a reduction in the extent of cardiac hypertrophy could limit the pathological electrical remodeling of Cx43 and the onset of VT by modulating miR-1 levels. Wistar male rats underwent mechanical constriction of the ascending aorta to induce pathologic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and afterwards were randomly assigned to receive 10mg/kg valsartan, VAL (LVH+VAL) delivered in the drinking water or placebo (LVH) for 12 weeks. Sham surgery was performed for control groups. Programmed ventricular stimulation reproducibly induced VT in LVH compared to LVH+VAL group. When compared to sham controls, rats from LVH group showed a significant decrease of miR-1 and an increase of Cx43 expression and its ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation, which displaces Cx43 from the gap junction. Interestingly, VAL administration to rats with aortic banding significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy and prevented miR-1 down-regulation and Cx43 up-regulation and phosphorylation. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) <italic>in vitro</italic> confirmed that Cx43 is a direct target of miR-1. Accordingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> angiotensin II stimulation reduced miR-1 levels and increased Cx43 expression and phosphorylation compared to un-stimulated NCMs. Finally, <italic>in vivo</italic> miR-1 cardiac overexpression by an adenoviral vector intra-myocardial injection reduced Cx43 expression and phosphorylation in mice with isoproterenol-induced LVH. In conclusion, miR-1 regulates Cx43 expression and activity in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Treatment of pressure overload-induced myocyte hypertrophy reduces the risk of life-threatening VT by normalizing miR-1 expression levels with the consequent stabilization of Cx43 expression and activity within the gap junction.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported, in part, by Grants for Scientific Research from the Ministry of the Education, University and Research of Italy (PRIN2003065977_002, RBAU018WWP_001).

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT), including ventricular fibrillation, are major determinants of sudden death in patients with cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These arrhythmias, in fact, are triggered by the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate that is typical of hearts with pathological hypertrophy [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several electrophysiological abnormalities have been ascribed to cardiac hypertrophy, including increased duration of action potential, reduced resting membrane potential and delayed conduction velocity (due to interstitial fibrosis). The latter results in depolarization and recovery of heterogeneous areas with increased refractory period [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Signaling pathways that promote deterioration of cardiac electrophysiological performance are currently an area of intense research, since their inhibition through fine tuning of the action potential can be considered a new therapeutic approach in arrhythmias [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The renin-angiotensin system is up-regulated in response to the stress conditions imposed on the heart [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The effects of angiotensin II (AngII) are mainly due to its interaction with the AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R), which belongs to a superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domain coupled to G-proteins and whose direct inhibition has been postulated to normalize the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes, probably through the stabilization of their electrical plasmatic membrane. Accordingly, it has been recently shown that AT1R activation could exert arrhythmogenic effect through c-Src tyrosine kinase-mediated connexin 43 (Cx43) displacement from the gap junctions [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cx43 is the highest expressed protein in the myocardium devoted to regulate intercellular connections in mammalian hearts. In normally functioning cardiac ventricles Cx43 is localized at the intercalated disks, where it supports longitudinal and transverse spread of the action potential [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias that occur during hypertrophy depend, in addition to a metabolic imbalance, mainly on excitability and electrical coupling. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Cx43 mediated by different protein kinases, affect the processes of trafficking, assembly, degradation, expression, and distribution hence altering the number of functional channels, the so-called "open probability", and conductance properties [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is not completely understood how Cx43 dysregulation increases arrhythmic risk.</p><p>Recent works from our and other laboratories have characterized the role of several microRNAs (miRs) in cardiovascular biology and diseases [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. MiRs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, about 22 nucleotides long, which can base-pair sequences partially complementary to the 3'-UTR located in regions of mRNA targets, arresting the process of translation [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Selected miRs&#x02019; dysregulation alters the cellular responses of cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes to specific signaling upon the pathological hemodynamic overload, leading to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, miRs play an essential role in controlling cardiac excitability since, by acting at post-transcriptional level, such molecules regulate the expression of gap-junctions and ion channels [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Among the highly expressed miRs in the myocardium, miR-1 has an essential regulatory role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and it controls cardiac electrophysiology for its ability to modulate the expression levels of molecular targets that adjust the electrical coupling of the cardiac fiber cells [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In particular, Cx43 is a direct target of miR-1 gene-silencing activity [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, it is still unknown whether miR-1 and Cx43 are interconnected in the pro-arrhythmic context of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and whether miR-1 expression and activity can be regulated by an anti-hypertrophic treatment, such as AT1R antagonization.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine: (i) whether miR-1 and Cx43 dysfunctions underlie the onset of VT associated to cardiac hypertrophy in a rat model of pressure overload; (ii) whether miR-1 directly modulates Cx43 expression and activity in hypertrophic myocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>; (iii) to assess whether the treatment of pathologic LVH by AT1R blockade could normalize miR-1 levels, limit the adverse electrical remodeling of Cx43 and reduce the induction of life-threatening VT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>In vivo experimental protocols</title><p>Male Wistar rats (90-120g, 7 weeks of age, N=22) were used for an aortic banding protocol conformed to Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Magna Graecia University. Briefly, rats were anesthetized as previously reported [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and after confirmation of pain reflex absence, were intubated and ventilated by dedicated apparatus while placing a tantalum clip on the ascending aorta through a left lateral mini-thoracotomy; in further twenty rats a <italic>sham</italic> surgery was performed. After allowing recovery, animals were randomized to receive either placebo (LVH, n=12; SHAM, n=10) or valsartan at the dosage of 10 mg/kg/day added to the drinking water (LVH+VAL, n=10; SHAM+VAL, n=10) for 12 weeks.</p><p>In an additional set of experiments to assess the direct role of miR-1 on Cx43 expression and activity, myocyte hypertrophy was induced in 8-12 weeks old C57BL/6 mice by Isoproterenol daily injection (Iso, 50mg/kg body weight i.p.) for 14 days [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, in a group of mice (n=7) an Adenoviral vector (10<sup>11</sup> pfu/mL) carrying a miR-1 construct under the ubiquitous CMV promoter (Ad-miR-1) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] was intra-myocardially released by 5 direct epicardial injections of 3&#x000b5;L each in the anterior LV and apical region, followed by delivering of 30&#x000b5;L of adenoviral construct dissolved in 30% pluronic F127 gel (Sigma), in order to cover the entire LV wall. An Adeno-Empty vector was equally injected in additional mice (n=7). Levels of miR-1 are significantly up-regulated in cardiac muscle already at 48-72 hours (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Thus, 72 hours later, 8 adenovirus-transfected mice were administered Iso as above described (n=4, Ad-Empty+Iso and n=4, Ad-miR-1+Iso) while 6 mice were administered only saline solution (n=3 Ad-Empty+Saline and n=3 Ad-miR-1+Saline). Mice were accordingly sacrificed 14 days later [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>At the end of the study protocol, each rat or mouse was sacrificed by lethal anaesthesia and morphometric parameters were analyzed.

The ventricular effective refractory period (VERP), de&#x0fb01;ned as the longest coupling interval of the premature stimulus that failed to activate the entire heart, was determined at the time of electrophysiological studies. Signals were band-pass filtered (low cutoff, 0.16Hz; high cutoff, 1kHz) and digitized with 16bit resolution and a sampling frequency of 1kHz. The selected gain for balancing input noise of the system was 4&#x000b5;V (peak-peak). Every twentieth stimulus was followed by 1 premature stimulus. Starting at basal cycle length of 150ms, the coupling interval of the premature stimulus was reduced in steps of 5ms until VERP [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD90) was evaluated at endocardial level. Signals were amplified, band-pass filtered, and digitized by a dual bioamplifier (ADInstruments) before extraction and analysis. Recordings were accepted if they had a stable baseline, a rapid upstroke phase with consistent amplitude, a smooth repolarization phase, and a stable duration. MAPD90 was defined as the monophasic action potential interval from the onset of zero-phase depolarization to the 90% repolarization level.

The latter appears to be one of the molecular mechanisms modulated by AT1R blockade to reduce the life-threatening hypertrophic-dependent VT.</p><p>Cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for the development of arrhythmias, diastolic dysfunction, congestive heart failure and death, as assessed in experimental models and in humans [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The occurrence of malignant VT is determined by increased automaticity, enhanced heterogeneity of conduction, neuro-humoral changes, structural remodeling and alterations in expression and distribution of gap-junctions and ion channels [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the mammalian heart, a connexin composed of 342 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 43000 (Cx43) is the most abundant connexin. Hypertrophied rats have changes in quantity and subcellular localization of Cx43 [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In particular, the cell-to-cell electrical uncoupling of cardiomyocytes plays an important role in determining ventricular arrhythmogenesis during hypertrophy [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study we have shown that cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by an aberrant increased expression of Cx43, whose increased levels have been already reported in different experimental models in association with an abnormal subcellular localization. In fact, Cx43 is located in physiological conditions at the intercalated disks and lateralizes aberrantly toward the Z lines, or it is internalized in endosomes inside the cytoplasm in different pathologic conditions. Phosphorylation of Cx43 has been implicated in the regulation of gap junction communication at several stages of the connexin 'life cycle', including hemichannel oligomerization, export of the protein to the plasma membrane, hemichannel activity, gap junction assembly, gap junction channel gating and connexin degradation [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Cx43 phosphorylation is dynamic and changes in response to activation of many different kinases, including PKA (protein kinase A), PKC (protein kinase C), p34cdc2 (p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase), protein kinase CK1, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and Src (pp60Src kinase) [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Treatment of cells with different growth factors is accompanied by increased Cx43 phosphorylation of serine residues with the net effect typically being a reduction in gap junction communication [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In particular, extracellular mitogen stimulation can also lead to increased phosphorylation of Ser255 and Ser279/Ser282, sites known to be MAPK family substrates [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Phosphorylation of Ser279/Ser282 is important in curtailment of gap junction communication, as these events are able to decrease gap junction channel &#x02018;open time&#x02019; [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, the Src tyrosine kinase, an upstream regulator of MAPK activity, can also phosphorylate Cx43, and it negatively affects Cx43 activity by multiple mechanisms [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The renin-angiotensin system has been classically shown to be a major regulator of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, Angiotensin II (AngII) is rapidly released from myocardial cells in response to cardiac damage and stretch; after binding to the AT1R, through Src, Ras, Gq and PKC mediation, it activates the maladaptive extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) generating pathological cellular growth [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Valsartan, a classic non-competitive antagonist of the AT1R, has been widely used in the clinical setting for the treatment of patients with systemic hypertension and concentric cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, its role in preventing VT that predispose to the risk of sudden cardiac death still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, valsartan administration significantly reduced the magnitude of cardiac hypertrophy and the incidence of arrhythmias, both as isolated ventricular ectopic beats in basal conditions and in the form of organized VT elicited after invasive provocative study, in rats after 12 weeks of pressure overload. In particular, AT1R blockade was able to reduce both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and ensuing Cx43 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, resulting in normalization of gap junction communications. Thus, these data lend support to a phenomenon whereby pressure overload-dependent release of mitogen stimuli like AngII activates ERK 1/2 that phosphorylates Cx43 reducing gap junction communication. This detrimental signaling mediates pathologic cardiac growth with the consequence of increasing malignant arrhythmias development.</p><p>Cx43 has been already established as a target of miR-1 [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The latter is dramatically reduced in cardiac hypertrophy, and contributes significantly to the overexpression of Cx43, hence determining part of the arrhythmogenic substrate of cardiac hypertrophy, whereas other receptors might be involved in maintaining other abnormal electrophysiological substrates [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, cardiac miR-1 levels have been found reduced in pathological conditions such as acromegaly [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Here we confirm these data and provide the first evidence that AT1R blockade prevents miR-1 down-regulation in hypertrophic stressed cardiomyocytes. Intriguingly, MAPKs are known regulators of miR-1/miR-133 biogenesis [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and we have recently shown in vascular smooth muscle cell that ERK1/2 activation suppresses miR-133 expression [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the miR-1 cognate bicistronic gene. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that ERK1/2 dependent signaling stimulated by cardiac stretch and AngII release mediates miR-1 down-regulation and Cx43 increased expression. The latter, as shown in the present study, is then hyper-phosphorylated by ERK1/2, decreasing gap junction communications, which may explain the increased risk of malignant VT in cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, miR-1 overexpression inhibits MAPK-ERK1/2 phosphorylation in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The latter molecular adaptation provides a potential explanation of our findings showing that miR-1 regulates not only Cx43 expression through the expected gene silencing mechanism but it also indirectly modulates Cx43 activity. Indeed, we speculate that miR-1 overexpression leads to inhibition of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the latter in turn prevents Cx43 phosphorylation and displacement from the gap junction. Nevertheless, further studies are still needed to prove this hypothesis.</p><p>Finally, in the present study we show that Valsartan-dependent reduction of cardiac hypertrophy induced by aortic constriction is associated with increased activated Akt levels (with a parallel reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation) when compared to rats with the sole aortic banding. While the latter is surprising considering the known role of Akt in cardiomyocyte growth [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], this finding generates the hypothesis that Akt activation in absence of concurrent ERK1/2 activation leads to an attenuated and beneficial adaptive cardiac response to pressure overload that improves cardiac function. Incidentally, Akt activation is indeed responsible for physiological cardiac growth by exercise training that is followed by an improved performance [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This beneficial adaptive activation of Akt in physiological hypertrophy as opposed to the detrimental signaling pathways (including the MAPKs) underlying pathological cardiac growth is the basis for these two different types of cardiac hypertrophy. It is also intriguing to speculate that Akt activation in absence of MAPK activity triggers a pro-endothelial secretory response in myocytes that increases capillarization during cardiac growth [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Nevertheless, it remains unanswered whether Akt has a role in modulating VT.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides in vivo and in vitro evidences that the selective AT1R inhibition reduces total and phosphorylated levels of Cx43 through miR-1 expression normalization and ERK1/2 inhibition in hypertrophic stressed cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, the development of LVH, occurrence of hyperkinetic VT and reduction in cardiac function after pressure overload in an experimental rat model of ascending aortic banding are prevented by AT1R which is associated with the attenuation of miR-1 down-regulation and the consequent stabilization of Cx43 activity within the gap junction. These data increase knowledge on the signaling pathways responsible for LVH and the related mechanisms of VT, opening new avenues to the modulation of microRNAs as potential therapeutic targets in this clinical setting.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
