The use of these visual display units (VDU) is often accompanied by physical complaints of the neck, shoulder, forearm and hand, with incidence and prevalence rates ranging from 21 to 36% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Many VDU workers not only experience musculoskeletal complaints, but also eye discomfort and vision problems when working with the computer for a long period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This phenomenon is called Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and may be caused by poor lighting, glare on a digital screen, poor seating posture, uncorrected vision problems, improper viewing distances, or a combination of these factors.</p><p id="Par7">Few studies have investigated the impact of inappropriate vision on neck pain in VDU workers. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a condition in which objects on a far distance appear blurred. This condition generally starts during childhood and progresses until the age of 20. Hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism are two other conditions that frequently contribute to the development of visual symptoms when using a computer or digital screen device. All these conditions can co-occur with presbyopia, the normal age-related loss of near focusing ability.</p><p id="Par8">Today, a large variety of lenses exists to correct several kinds of vision problems. Single-vision lenses are prescribed if one of the above mentioned conditions occur solitarily. When two or more conditions are present at the same time, bifocals or progressive lenses can be prescribed. However, most of these lenses are not suitable for computer work as their intermediate zone is not large enough to enable VDU work comfortable. As these lenses are not perfect for computer work, VDU workers might compensate their blurred vision by leaning forward, or by tipping their head to look through the bottom portion of their lenses, which can result in neck complaints.</p><p id="Par9">With the increase of computer use, lenses designed specifically for computer use have been developed. These lenses provide a clear vision of the intermediate zone at a distance of approximately 70&#x000a0;cm, which allows a clear view of the computer screen. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> gives a clear overview of the main differences between progressive lenses and office lenses.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the difference in function between progressive lenses and office lenses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Progressive lens</th><th>ZEISS Officelens</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Depth of field</td><td>Unlimited depth of field, clear vision at every viewing distance</td><td>Clear vision at near and intermediate viewing distance</td></tr><tr><td>Intermediate and near zone</td><td>Small intermediate and near zone to offer large distance zone for uninterrupted far vision and dynamic vision</td><td>Large near and intermediate zones</td></tr><tr><td>Gaze stabilisation</td><td>Gaze stabilization may take longer due to difficulties finding the areas of optimal focus</td><td>Superior balance of optics because lens design has a larger available lens area - no distance zone necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Viewing distance</td><td>Unlimited maximum viewing distance&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;m</td><td>Limited viewing distance to 1&#x000a0;m, 2&#x000a0;m or 4&#x000a0;m</td></tr><tr><td>Addition power</td><td>Full change in addition power needed</td><td>No full change in addition power needed</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par10">Only a few studies have evaluated the impact of wearing single- or progressive lenses on body posture, muscle overload and pain during VDU work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Becker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] compared progressive lenses with single-vision lenses and found that wearing progressive lenses leads to greater degrees of change in forward head posture and occipital extension. In an observational study of Jaschinski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a significantly larger head inclination was found while wearing progressive lenses, compared to wearing single-vision lenses for far or near vision. In another study of Jaschinski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], a significantly lower head inclination and better vision of the computer screen was found while wearing VDU lenses, compared to progressive lenses. Horgen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] compared 3 types of progressive VDU lenses and single-vision lenses during a VDU task and found no significant differences in muscle load between the different lenses by using electromyography. Later, Horgen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] set up a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and compared the effect of wearing different lenses for 1&#x000a0;year: 3 types of progressive VDU lenses and single-vision lenses were compared. A significant reduction of neck pain was found with one type of the VDU lenses as well as high rates of satisfaction with two types of the VDU lenses and the single-vision lenses. However, the above mentioned studies have some limitations, including limited follow-up and lack of more objective measurements. In order to fulfill the need for more objective measurements and larger follow-up periods, an RCT was set up with the following research questions.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par11">What is the impact of wearing progressive VDU lenses, compared to progressive lenses, on self-reported neck pain and disability, and visual fatigue?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">What is the impact of wearing progressive VDU lenses compared to progressive lenses, during a VDU task, on head inclination and pressure pain thresholds?</p></list-item></list>

Eligible subjects were asked to fill out a questionnaire concerning visual complaints (visual fatigue questionnaire - VFQ) and self-perceived pain (numeric rating scale - NRS) and disability (neck disability index - NDI). First, subjects were tested with their current (old) lenses in a landscape office while performing a <bold>20-minute VDU task</bold> (task 1). A <bold>2D video analysis</bold> was performed during the task to measure the Forward Head Angle (FHA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The <bold>PPT</bold> of the trapezius, levator scapulae and infraspinatus muscles was measured after the VDU task. After these first investigations, subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group using a block randomization in order to obtain an equal size and sex distribution in each group. The treatment group was given progressive VDU lenses (ZEISS Officelens Plus), specially designed for VDU work, whereas the control group was given progressive lenses (ZEISS Precision Plus). Spectacle frames of Silhouette&#x000ae; were used and an eye examination was performed by an experienced optician optometrist.</p><p id="Par16">Within 1&#x000a0;month after the first test moment, the participants received their new lenses and were asked to wear these for 6&#x000a0;months during VDU work.

Self-perceived disability was enquired after 6&#x000a0;months wearing the new lenses (post3). At 6&#x000a0;months follow up, the test procedure was repeated while wearing the new lenses (task 2). A short questionnaire concerning the satisfaction about the study lenses was completed at the end of the study.

Glare was reduced by the use of sun blinds and sufficient light was provided. Computer screen, chair and table height were adjusted individually with the top of the screen at or just below eye level and 90&#x000b0; of flexion in the elbows, hips and knees. The subjects performed a typing task during 20&#x000a0;min. This task consisted of copying a predefined, unknown text that was given on the left side of the screen.

</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par37">The aim of this RCT was to investigate the influence of wearing progressive VDU lenses, compared to progressive lenses on self-reported pain, disability and visual fatigue and to investigate the impact of these lenses on pain sensitivity and head inclination during a VDU task. It can be concluded that both lenses have a significant impact on different outcome measures but that there is little difference in visual and musculoskeletal comfort between wearing progressive and VDU lenses.</p><p id="Par38">In both groups there was a significant decrease in self-reported <bold>visual fatigue and neck pain</bold> at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months follow up compared to baseline (for visual fatigue only) and 1&#x000a0;week after wearing the new lenses (for both outcome measures).</p><p id="Par39">
<bold>Visual fatigue</bold> has been assessed in previous studies using mainly one dimensional measurements, but none of these studies have used the VFQ, as this is a rather new measurement tool. Similar to the results of the general neck pain, the VFQ at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months follow up showed only small, but significant changes in both groups.</p><p id="Par40">The <bold>baseline NRS value</bold> for neck <bold>pain intensity</bold> and the decrease in intensity is similar to a previous study of Horgen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] who followed VDU-workers during a 12-month period wearing different types of lenses. Despite this significant difference, the decrease in NRS was lower than the MCID of 1.5 points, which is required to obtain a small detectable patient-perceived change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These small changes could amongst others be attributed to the fact that the general level of pain was relatively low at baseline.</p><p id="Par41">Neither of the groups&#x02019; results showed significant changes in <bold>self-reported neck disability</bold>. All participants had a mild limitation (NDI scores between 5 and 14) at the start of the experiment which may explain why no significant changes in NDI scores were found. On the other hand, NDI scores indicating mild limitation are rather common in patients with work related neck pain.</p><p id="Par42">There were no changes in <bold>FHA</bold> during the VDU tasks. Past research included only one study that compared VDU lenses with progressive lenses. Jaschinski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] found a significantly lower head inclination when wearing VDU lenses which is conflicting with the results of this study.</p><p id="Par43">All <bold>PPTs</bold> were higher during the second VDU task, independent of the type of lenses. This increase in PPT could be attributed to the decrease in general neck pain and visual fatigue</p><p id="Par44">The VDU group reported a significantly higher <bold>suitability</bold> of the lenses for VDU work while the P group reported a significantly higher suitability of the lenses for far vision. According to Jaschinski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], vision of the computer screen was judged significantly better with VDU lenses and far vision was judged better with progressive lenses which is comparable with the results of this study.</p><p id="Par45">Besides the quantitative analyses, some subjects in the VDU lenses group reported that the lenses were not suitable for far vision and that social contact with colleagues in the same working area was strongly reduced. Others reported that the lenses were not suitable to walk with in the working area because of dizziness and reduced depth perception. In the VDU lenses group there was still a need to use progressive lenses for other tasks then VDU work. Some subjects reported that it was difficult to switch between both types of lenses during the day.</p><p id="Par46">In the progressive lenses group several subjects reported that the lenses were not suitable for VDU work and that the computer screen had to be placed in another position or that the head had to be positioned in an unnatural posture.</p><p id="Par47">The present results should be viewed within the limitations of the study. There was no blinding possible for the intervention because of the nature of the study. VDU lenses can only be used during VDU work, whereas progressive lenses can be used all day long, so the participants couldn&#x02019;t be blinded.</p><p id="Par48">Another limitation of this RCT was that the kind of lenses that participants used at the beginning of the study was not taken into account into the analysis. When entering the study, sixteen participants used progressive lenses, 13 used reading lenses, 2 used lenses for far vision and 4 didn&#x02019;t use any lenses at all during VDU work. In the two groups a comparable number of subjects already used similar kinds of lenses at the beginning of the study.</p><p id="Par49">In future studies, a more in depth qualitative analysis of comparing different lenses is needed. Bigger sample sizes, in order to meet a high dropout rate, is needed. In addition, the kind of lenses that are used at the beginning of the study should be taken into account as well in order to have a more homogeneous population.</p><p id="Par50">It can be concluded that there is little difference in effect of the different lenses on visual and musculoskeletal comfort. Lenses should be adjusted to the task-specific needs and habits of the participant.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar13"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="Par51">BC participated in the design of the study and coordination, KDM and LS carried out the study and performed the data analysis, LD participated in the design of the study, LV carried ou the medical screening, BCa participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis.
