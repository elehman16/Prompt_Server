Forty-two patients, &#x02265;18 years, diagnosed with active refractory lichen planopilaris were assessed for eligibility to participate in the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The diagnosis was made based on clinical evaluation and was established by histopathological confirmation. Refractory lichen planopilaris defined as no response to treatment with topical agents/systematic medications in the past 6 months. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Four patients refused to participate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Complete physical examination including ophthalmologic examination and the following laboratory evaluations were carried out for all consented patients: complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, viral markers, and baseline activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase measurement. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breastfeeding, gastrointestinal disorders, vision problems/retinopathy, porphyria, psoriasis, anemia (Hb &#x0003c;9 mg/dl), leukopenia (white blood cells &#x0003c;4000/dl), thrombocytopenia (platelets &#x0003c;100,000/dl), increased liver enzymes more than three times of the upper normal limit, significant liver disease, positive viral hepatic markers, history of convulsion, and excessive alcohol intake. Nine patients were excluded after application of exclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The following withdrawal criteria were applied: not showing up for follow-up visits, not taking the medication according to the study protocol, receiving other topical or immunosuppressive agents during the study, and nontolerable side effects.

Considerable improvements were recorded in frequency and severity of follicular keratosis, pruritus, perifollicular erythema, spreading, and erythema in patients received methotrexate whereas only erythema improved significantly in patients who received hydroxychloroquine. When disease remission occurred, probably, follicular keratosis was the last sign which was improved significantly only in methotrexate group. The significant improvements in symptoms and signs plus more than 70% drop in LPPAI in methotrexate group at the end of study versus &#x0003c;45% drop in final LPPAI in hydroxychloroquine group were the most remarkable findings of the study. In other words, the mean LPPAI at the end of the study was less than one-third of the baseline in patients received methotrexate and more than half of the baseline in patients received hydroxychloroquine. The trend of change was sharp and significant in methotrexate group at all time points during the study whereas it was not significant after month four in hydroxychloroquine group. These findings were observed in both per-protocol and ITT analyses. When ITT analysis was applied, the mean LPPAI difference was increased in both groups at all time points after baseline.
