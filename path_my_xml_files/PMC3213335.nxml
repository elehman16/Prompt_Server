Contemporary research in other fields (e.g., sport) has revealed that gaze training interventions may support the development of robust movement skills. This current study was designed to examine the utility of gaze training for technical laparoscopic skills and to test performance under multitasking conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty medical trainees with no laparoscopic experience were divided randomly into one of three treatment groups: gaze trained (GAZE), movement trained (MOVE), and discovery learning/control (DISCOVERY). Participants were fitted with a Mobile Eye gaze registration system, which measures eye-line of gaze at 25&#x000a0;Hz. Training consisted of ten repetitions of the &#x0201c;eye-hand coordination&#x0201d; task from the LAP Mentor VR laparoscopic surgical simulator while receiving instruction and video feedback (specific to each treatment condition). After training, all participants completed a control test (designed to assess learning) and a multitasking transfer test, in which they completed the procedure while performing a concurrent tone counting task.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Not only did the GAZE group learn more quickly than the MOVE and DISCOVERY groups (faster completion times in the control test), but the performance difference was even more pronounced when multitasking. Differences in gaze control (target locking fixations), rather than tool movement measures (tool path length), underpinned this performance advantage for GAZE training.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that although the GAZE intervention focused on training gaze behavior only, there were indirect benefits for movement behaviors and performance efficiency.

Disruptions (e.g., pagers, irrelevant conversations) may occur as frequently as three times every minute in the operating room [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], so the ability to focus on the task at hand, avoiding the effects of noise and distractions, is an important skill for surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, recent research suggests that errors leading to surgical complications most often are caused by mistakes in technique or lapses of attention to detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Because the attention control of novices appears to be particularly disrupted by auditory distractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], helping trainees to minimize such cognitive overloading should be considered an important aspect of surgical training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>One recent approach to assessing the impact of distractions on surgeons&#x02019; attention is by examining alterations in their gaze strategy. The impact of gaze disruptions on surgical intraoperative performance is not well known, although anecdotal evidence suggests that it is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Sutton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] used extracorporeal video footage to assess how frequently the surgeon&#x02019;s gaze was diverted from the operation&#x02019;s video display. They found that on average, 40 diversions occurred every 15 min, providing ample opportunity for errors in attention to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the full impact of attention disruptions on detection errors is likely to be underestimated using this approach, because it fails to account for instances in which a surgeon may be looking at the &#x0201c;wrong&#x0201d; location on the video display itself.</p><p>Advances in eye-tracking technology have made more fine-grained analyses of operator attention possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, Wilson and colleagues recently demonstrated that in virtual reality (VR) simulations, experienced operators use more effective gaze strategies than novices; fixating on the most relevant locations and adopting more optimal psychomotor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The authors related these findings to those from cognitive neuroscience, which suggest that skilled psychomotor behavior involves the ability to predict the consequences of one&#x02019;s actions and implement mapping rules that relate motor and sensory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In laparoscopic surgery, experts primarily fixate the target to be grasped and seldom need to check the location of the tools (<italic>target locking</italic> strategy), whereas novices, still developing the mapping rules, switch between tracking the tool as it moves toward the target and fixating the target itself (<italic>switching</italic> strategy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The investigation of such expert&#x02013;novice comparisons is an important precursor for surgical education research, because only by understanding more about the psychomotor processes underpinning expertise can proficiency-related training interventions be developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The transition from novice to expert motor performance is characterized by increases in biomechanical, metabolic, and neural efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In particular, a gradual reduction of attention demands during motor learning is thought to reflect progression from an initial verbal&#x02013;analytical stage of performance, in which knowledge is easily accessed by consciousness (explicit, declarative knowledge), to an autonomous stage of performance, in which knowledge is unconscious (implicit, procedural knowledge) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Although this is not in doubt, a growing body of evidence suggests that it may be possible, even advantageous, to avoid the initial verbal&#x02013;analytical stage of performance by learning implicitly. In numerous studies, Masters and colleagues have shown that implicit motor learning promotes primarily the accretion of procedural knowledge, which is not readily available to conscious introspection by the performer and makes few demands on attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. By generating movement control that makes few demands on the already taxed cognitive resources of the surgeon, implicit motor learning results in stable motor performance under psychological stress, fatigue, multitasking, distractions, or over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Contemporary research in sport has attempted to apply the implicit motor learning framework in the context of <italic>gaze</italic> control by training novice performers to adopt the efficient gaze strategies of experts from the outset of learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this way, novices do not pass through the typical sensory&#x02013;motor mapping stages of learning (from reacting to movement outcomes to focusing on the desired end point of a movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). Gaze training appears to expedite the learning of psychomotor skills compared with traditional, movement-focused training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and, as with implicit motor learning, the benefits are more pronounced under stress; novices taught to focus on the key visual cues in the environment are better able to deal with the attentional demands associated with stress than novices taught via a traditional, explicit motor learning approach. Modelling expert gaze strategies may help to reduce the attention demands of complex movement, increasing psychomotor efficiency and freeing resources to be applied to concurrent tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>For surgical technical training to be clinically effective, it must transfer from simulator and bench models to the demanding environment of the operating room. For example, the basic technical performance of proficiency-trained learners has been shown to break down under the typical multitasking demands experienced in the operating room [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The current study was designed to model these multitasking demands in a laboratory setting and is the first to examine the utility of gaze-training in a surgical environment. Three training interventions are compared: one focusing on training expert gaze control, one focusing on training expert motor/movement control, and one where no specific guidance is provided (discovery learning). We generated three hypotheses related to the expected benefits of gaze training for <italic>learning</italic> basic technical skills and for their <italic>robustness</italic> under multitasking demands:</p><p><bold>Hypothesis 1 (Baseline)</bold> There will be no differences in completion time between gaze-trained, movement-trained, and discovery-learning participants in the baseline condition. All participants will display &#x0201c;novice-like&#x0201d; gaze (switching) and tool control (inefficient path lengths) strategies.</p><p><bold>Hypothesis 2 (Control)</bold> Gaze-trained participants will display superior performance (faster completion times) after training (control condition) than movement-trained or discovery-learning participants. An expert-like gaze and tool control strategy will underpin the performance advantage of the gaze trained participants.</p><p><bold>Hypothesis 3 (Multitask transfer)</bold> Gaze-trained participants will display stable performance when multitasking compared with movement-trained or discovery-learning participants.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 30 novice participants volunteered to take part in the study (11 males, 19 females; mean age, 25.16&#x000a0;years; range 8&#x000a0;years). Participants were both left- and right-hand dominant (24 right, 6 left) and consisted of novice medics (final-year medical students or foundation-year medical trainees) who had not received any laparoscopic training. They were divided randomly (using a Latin squares design) into three treatment groups as discussed below (see <italic>Training groups</italic>)<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Apparatus and task</title><p>Testing took place on a LAP Mentor (Simbionix USA Corp., Cleveland, OH) VR laparoscopic surgical simulator, based at the Centre for Innovation and Training in Elective Care, Torbay Hospital, UK. The &#x0201c;eye-hand coordination&#x0201d; task from the basic skills training module was used for this study, because previous research has demonstrated that the task validly differentiates expert and novice surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To complete the task, ten flashing balls set at different heights and depths must be touched by using one of two instruments (one held in each hand). One of the instruments is blue and the other is red, and they become visible on the screen as soon as they are inserted into the trocars. During the task, flashing balls of each color must be touched using the tip of the same color instrument within a set time period.</p><p>Participants were fitted with an Applied Science Laboratories Mobile Eye gaze registration system (ASL; Bedford, MA), which measures point of gaze using dark pupil tracking (see Wilson et al. 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for a detailed description of this equipment). The system incorporates a pair of lightweight glasses fitted with eye and scene cameras and a set of three LEDs that project harmless, invisible near infrared (IR) light onto the eye. By teaching the system how the angles calculated by the eye camera relate to the image from the second camera that is viewing the environment (the scene camera), the eye tracker can compute what the eye is pointed at. A circular cursor, representing 1&#x000b0; of visual angle with a 4.5-mm lens, indicating the location of gaze in a video image of the scene (spatial accuracy of &#x000b1;0.5&#x000b0; visual angle; 0.1&#x000b0; precision), is viewed in real time and recorded at 25&#x000a0;Hz for subsequent offline analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Training groups</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of three training treatment groups: gaze training, movement training, or discovery learning, following a baseline attempt at the eye-hand coordination task. The gaze-trained group was shown a video, derived from the eye tracker, of an expert&#x02019;s visual control whilst performing the eye-hand coordination task (completed in 30 s). Participants were made aware of the target-focused gaze strategy (lengthy and stable fixations on each of the target balls), and the manner in which the gaze shifted from one target to another in a fast, smooth fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They were then advised to try to mimic the gaze strategy of the expert on subsequent attempts. After completion of a second attempt, participants were shown their own video data, as captured by the eye tracker. Participants were asked to comment on differences between their own video and the expert prototype they had previously seen. This feedback process was replicated for a third attempt. Participants were then asked to complete another seven attempts, with verbal feedback of their gaze behavior provided by the experimenter after each trial.</p><p>The movement-trained group was shown the same expert video but without the gaze cursor present. Instead, participants were made aware of the manner in which the tool moved smoothly toward the target following a straight and direct path. Participants were then advised to try to mimic the smooth tool movements of the expert. The training protocol then followed the same structure as for the gaze-trained group; participants watched videos of their own performance (without the gaze cursor) after their second and third attempts and compared these to the expert prototype. Only verbal feedback about movement control was provided for the subsequent seven attempts.</p><p>The discovery-learning group was given no video feedback or training instructions but was allowed to examine their performance and movement scores from the LAP Mentor after every trial. A sample size of ten trainees in each group was based on (1) the numbers typically used in laparoscopic surgery technical skills training studies (for example, see Arora et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], in which 10 participants were used in each training group), and (2) a power analysis performed using data from a relevant gaze training study also adopting ten trainees in each group. Vine and Wilson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] compared the differential effects of gaze training and explicit motor training on motor performance and reported very large effect sizes in both a control condition (<italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.82) and in a stressful/transfer condition (<italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.92) (Note <italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.8 is considered to be a large effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary task (tone counting)</title><p>A soundtrack developed with Labview software (National Instruments Inc.) played four distinguishable sounds from the Microsoft sound library (buzzer, ping, tone, and bell ring) in a randomized order (one sound every second) to the participant via speakers attached to a Dell PC.

Furthermore, distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant auditory stimuli may be important in the operating room environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Participants were instructed to listen for the target sound (bell ring), count the number of times it was played, and ignore the other three &#x0201c;distracting&#x0201d; sounds. Participants were played a 30-second example of the soundtrack for familiarization purposes, before a baseline trial (see <italic>Procedure</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants arrived at the Training Centre individually at prearranged times. They read an information sheet, which describes the goals of the study, before completing a demographic questionnaire and providing written, informed consent. Participants were fitted with the eye tracker, which was calibrated using six visual landmarks on the LAP Mentor display screen. Calibration was checked after every trial to ensure that the eye tracker had not moved. Recalibration was only required on two occasions throughout the whole testing period.</p><p>Training consisted of ten trials of the eye-hand coordination task, because previous research has demonstrated that six to ten trials are sufficient for a plateau in performance to occur for this basic task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The first attempt acted as a baseline measure of gaze control and performance, following which participants completed nine further attempts with instructions relevant to their specific training intervention (see <italic>Training</italic><italic>groups</italic> section). A control test was then performed with no additional guidance provided to assess learning. After a brief rest, participants performed a baseline trial of the tone counting task (60 s), followed by two attempts to perform the eye-hand coordination task and the tone counting task concurrently (multitasking). At the end of testing, participants were thanked for their time and debriefed about the purpose of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Performance</title><p>Performance in this procedural task was assessed in terms of task completion time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Process measures</title><p>The total path length (TPL) travelled by each tool was selected from the LAP Mentor parameter options to reflect efficient <italic>tool</italic> control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For an indication of efficient <italic>gaze</italic> control, a measure of &#x0201c;target locking&#x0201d; was computed by subtracting the percentage of time spent fixating the tool from the time spent fixating the target ball (throughout a trial). Therefore, a more positive score reflects more time spent target locking, whereas a score of &#x02018;0&#x02019; reflects equal time spent fixating the tools and targets (switching strategy). A negative score reflects more time spent fixating the tools than the targets. A fixation was defined as duration of gaze to a single location (within 1&#x000b0; visual angle) for at least 120&#x000a0;ms (&#x02265;3 frames of video) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

For each ball-touch attempt, areas of interest (Lookzones) were created and maintained around the target ball and the relevant instrument as the video progressed.

Instead, James recommends controlling the direction of gaze to the target and allowing the motor system to self-organize completion of the task. Support for James&#x02019; historic claim comes from research that examined the differences between the visuomotor control of experts and novices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the theory of reinvestment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which suggests that attempts to consciously monitor and control movements can disrupt their performance (see also Wulf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of training technical laparoscopic skills using a gaze-focused, rather than a movement-focused, intervention. Three specific hypotheses were tested, as discussed below.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Hypothesis 1 (baseline)</title><p>We predicted that all participants would start from a similar novice level and display relatively slow completion times and poor gaze and tool control. The results supported this hypothesis, because all groups were equally slow (~60 s; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), adopted a switching gaze strategy (equal fixations to targets and tools; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and used inefficient tool control strategies (tool paths of ~155&#x000a0;cm; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results are important, because they corroborate findings for other novices performing this task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and, more importantly, demonstrate that there were no differences between the groups at the outset of the study. Any subsequent differences must be considered in terms of the specific interventions experienced by each treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Hypothesis 2 (control)</title><p>We predicted that gaze-trained participants group would display faster completion times after training than movement-trained or discovery-learning participants and that expert-like gaze and tool control strategies would underpin the performance advantage of the gaze-trained participants. After only ten trials of learning, the gaze-trained group revealed a performance advantage over the other two groups. They more than halved their completion times from the baseline condition (55% reduction compared with 32% reduction for the movement group and 39% reduction for the discovery group; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Their performance was underpinned by a more expert-like gaze strategy consisting of more time spent fixating the targets and less time focusing on the tools (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In comparison, the movement and discovery groups continued to predominantly adopt a switching strategy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results suggest that the gaze-trained group were further along the performance curve for this task.</p><p>Surprisingly, this divergence in gaze strategy did not transfer to the hypothesized differences in tool control (as indexed by total path length<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>). Indeed, all three groups reduced their path length by approximately 33% between baseline and control conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It appears that the tool control algorithms used by the LapMentor software are not as sensitive as the measure of gaze control (target locking) in discriminating between significantly different completion times. We originally postulated that training accurate gaze control might enable an efficient neural network for specialized motor planning that integrates visual information with motor commands, in effect allowing the motor system to self-organize in a more implicit manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. More research is required to determine the specific tool control mechanisms through which expert-like gaze behavior exerts its performance advantage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Hypothesis 3: multitasking</title><p>We predicted that gaze-trained participants would display stable performance when multitasking compared with movement-trained or discovery-learning participants, due to the reduced demands on attentional processing inherent in this form of training (i.e., implicit motor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). The transfer of technical skill learning from simple to more demanding conditions reflective of those experienced in the operating room (e.g., multi-tasking) is critical if training programs are to have clinical utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The results revealed that the performance advantage found for the gaze-trained group after learning (control condition) was even more pronounced when multitasking. Although the gaze-trained group maintained completion times at control condition levels, the discovery learning group was 8% slower and the movement trained group was 22% slower under multitasking as opposed to control conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>The tone counting performance results also are important, because they reveal that the gaze-trained group achieved this technical skill performance advantage while maintaining secondary task performance. Indeed, although the results were not significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.068), the gaze-trained group made three times fewer errors than the movement trained group and half of the errors of the discovery-learning group when performing the tone counting task concurrently with the eye-hand coordination task (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Taken together, the primary and secondary task performance data support hypothesis 3 and suggest that the gaze-trained group had more &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; attentional resources to divide between tasks than the other two groups. As in the control condition, the percentage of time spent using target locking fixations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), rather than changes in tool control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), seems to underpin this performance difference.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>General comments</title><p>It has been suggested that the neural mechanisms regulating goal-directed movements profit from the accurate and timely spatial information of the foveated target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The current data add to previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] that suggests that this contention applies to laparoscopic tasks; faster completion times are underpinned by a target-locking strategy. Furthermore, the current research reveals that novices can be taught to model the gaze strategies of experts and do not have to follow typical visuomotor learning phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this way, a gaze-training protocol has many similarities with implicit motor learning protocols. Implicit motor control demands fewer attention resources than conscious or explicit control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and is a key marker of automaticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Recently, Zhu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] showed that implicit motor learning resulted in reduced nonessential coactivation between the verbal&#x02013;analytic and motor planning regions of the brain during performance of a laparoscopic task (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]). However, whether a gaze focused approach can be considered to be an implicit motor learning paradigm remains to be confirmed by future research. For example, Masters and colleagues have consistently shown that people who learn their movements implicitly can consciously report very little about the mechanics of the movements (see Masters et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] for a review related to surgery). Our study provides no evidence with respect to conscious reports.</p><p>There are a number of other limitations of the current study, which future research should address. The chosen task was relatively simple, as evidenced by the fact that the novices in the current study performed quicker after only a few practice trials than experienced surgeons in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The utility of gaze training therefore needs to be assessed on more complex, technical tasks, and perhaps even on tasks that require perceptual&#x02013;cognitive expertise (clinical judgments and decision making), as well as visuomotor expertise. Additionally, the training period was much briefer than that adopted in validated training curricula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and there was no attempt to test the longer-term retention (durability) of this learning after a period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>To conclude, the findings suggest that gaze-training interventions have potential utility in surgical, as well as sporting, environments. Not only did gaze-training expedite learning, but there is evidence that the gaze-trained participants had more attentional spare resources to complete the eye-hand coordination task under multitasking pressure. It appears that by adopting the visuomotor control demonstrated by expert surgeons, novices can &#x0201c;fast-track&#x0201d; some of their experience, thus climbing the performance curve to technical competency in less time and performing better when faced with challenging multitasking demands. The results support James&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] contention that not only is there potentially a cost in attempting to control movements, but that there is a benefit of focusing on controlling gaze accurately.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a bilateral research grant from the Economic and Social Research Council, UK and the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong (RES-000-22-3016) awarded to the first and fourth authors.
