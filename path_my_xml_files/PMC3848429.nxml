Approximately 30 to 45% of patients have haemoglobin concentrations below population norms on admission, and around 10% are severely anaemic. Anaemia on admission, and in the postoperative period, is associated with poor outcomes with regard to mobility, postoperative mortality and readmission. There is currently no clear consensus on the optimal method of managing perioperative anaemia in this group of frail patients with frequent comorbidity. Liberal red cell transfusion in the postoperative period does not appear to improve outcome, whereas tranexamic acid appears to reduce transfusion rate at the expense of increased cardiovascular morbidity. There are encouraging results from one centre with the use of agents to stimulate red cell production, including intravenous iron and erythropoietin. UK practice differs significantly from these patients and these studies, and it is not clear whether these promising results will translate to the UK population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a single-centre randomized controlled parallel group trial, in a British university hospital.Randomization is achieved using a website and computer-generated concealed tables. Participants are 80 patients 70 years or over with acute hip fracture undergoing operative repair. The intervention group receive three daily infusions of 200 mg iron sucrose, starting within 24 hours of admission. The control group receive standard hospital care at the discretion of the clinical team. Red cell transfusions for each group are given in accordance with standard clinical triggers. The primary outcome is an increase in mean reticulocyte count in the intervention group at day 7. Secondary outcome measures include haemoglobin concentrations, early and late transfusion rates, infectious and cardiovascular complications, mobility and 30-day mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is a pilot study to demonstrate haematopoietic efficacy of intravenous iron in this setting. Hence, we have chosen to measure change in reticulocyte count rather than the more clinically relevant differences in haemoglobin concentration or transfusion rate. If our results are positive, the study will provide the necessary information for development of a full-scale trial of intravenous iron.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN76424792/moppett">ISRCTN76424792</ext-link>; UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (EuDRACT: 2011-003233-34).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aged 70 and over</kwd><kwd>Anaemia: iron deficiency</kwd><kwd>Anaemia: therapy</kwd><kwd>Ferric compounds: administration and dosage</kwd><kwd>Ferric compounds: therapeutic use</kwd><kwd>Hip fractures: surgery</kwd><kwd>Human beings</kwd><kwd>Perioperative period</kwd><kwd>Postoperative complications: drug therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Anaemia following hip fracture is common. Approximately 30 to 45% of patients have haemoglobin concentrations ([Hb]) below population norms on admission and around 10% are severely anaemic. The average fall in [Hb] between admission and postoperative nadir is around 2 g/dl. Various authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] have found [Hb] on admission to be an independent risk factor for early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and late [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] postoperative mortality. Foss and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] found postoperative [Hb] &#x0003c; 10 g/dl to be an independent risk factor for poor mobility in previously mobile patients, whilst Lawrence and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] found that walking distance was strongly correlated with [Hb] &#x0003e; 10 g/dl. In healthy older people, mobility is better in individuals with [Hb] &#x0003e; 12 g/dl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Health outcomes in the general older population are worse in the presence of anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Anaemia in the older hip fracture population is multifactorial. Ageing per se does not appear to cause anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but ageing may be associated with reduced haematopoietic reserve, making anaemia more likely in the face of nutrient deficiency or blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the community, 20% of women aged 80 to 85 are anaemic, with anaemia of chronic disease being the most common cause. These patients represent a major proportion of the hip fracture population. However, 30 to 45% of hip fracture patients are anaemic on admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which may reflect frailer patients having poorer nutrition, being more likely to sustain hip fractures and subsequently having their [Hb] fall further, owing to acute fracture-related blood loss.</p><p>Pre-existing anaemia on admission is further exacerbated by the effects of intravenous rehydration, and small but significant intra-operative blood loss results in between one-third and two-thirds of patients receiving blood transfusions within the first few days following operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The likelihood of transfusion is related to fracture type: subtrochanteric and trochanteric fractures have the highest transfusion rates in both anaemic and nonanaemic subjects. Poor nutrition in the postoperative period is also unlikely to replenish iron stores. Surgery itself may further induce a functional iron deficiency due to humoral suppression of erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Functional iron deficiency does not respond well to oral iron, as iron stores may be normal, and this suppresses intestinal absorption of iron. Indeed, postoperative oral iron has been shown to be of no benefit and also has a high incidence of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Whereas blood transfusion improves [Hb], some authors have found an association between transfusion and improved mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; others have not found this association, but found that transfusion might reduce readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Infection rates may also be increased with the use of blood transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and there are significant financial constraints with the current cost of a unit of blood in the UK around &#x000a3;200. A recently reported North American trial assessed the effects of liberal versus restrictive postoperative transfusion strategies following hip fracture in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. That study found no differences in self-reported mobility or death at 60 days, though there was an increase in cardiovascular complications in the restrictive group. It would seem therefore, at this time that anaemia is a poor prognostic factor but that red cell transfusion does not necessarily alter outcome.</p><p>Alternatives to blood transfusion include reduction in blood loss in the perioperative period; stimulation of erythropoiesis with erythropoietin; and oral or intravenous iron.</p><p>Pharmacological reduction of blood loss with tranexamic acid has been assessed recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although there was a trend to reduced transfusion requirements and reduced postoperative infections, there was also a trend towards increased thrombotic events in the tranexamic acid group and it is therefore not a recommended therapy in this group, despite being advocated for patients with multiple traumas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Erythropoietin has been used in older people to stimulate erythropoiesis. However, the side effects of erythropoietin (hypertension, risks of thrombotic events) make it unattractive in the hip fracture population and the cost of erythropoietin used in these studies is high, over &#x000a3;200 per patient.</p><p>Intravenous iron is an attractive therapy in this population. Intravenous iron bypasses the intestinal barrier to absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] that may be seen in functional iron deficiency and stimulates erythropoiesis. The effects of i.v. iron are believed to last for around 7 days, which covers the at-risk period for patients with hip fracture. In post-partum women, who commonly have moderate blood loss during delivery, i.v. iron has been shown to have a faster effect on [Hb] than oral iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Intravenous iron is believed to be much less likely to cause adverse reactions than in the past, following changes in its pharmaceutical preparation. Iron sucrose is associated with the lowest rate of life-threatening adverse events of all the i.v. iron preparations and these are considerably lower than transfusion-related severe side effects (0.11/million versus 10/million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Four studies from a Spanish group have reported the effects of i.v. iron on transfusion requirements, mortality and outcome compared with historical controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Cuenca and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported a nonsignificant reduction in transfusion rate in patients with trochanteric fractures (55% vs. 44%). A prespecified subgroup of patients with [Hb] &#x0003e;12 demonstrated a significant reduction in transfusion rate (41% vs. 26%). In another retrospective study, transfusion rates were halved (37% vs. 15%) as were the number of units transfused, length of acute hospital stay and 30 day mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In a parallel group study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], transfusion rates were also more than halved (70% vs. 24%) as were the number of units transfused and postoperative infection rates. Recently, the same group have reported on a randomized controlled trial of intravenous iron therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. No difference was found in transfusion rates for the trial as a whole, but prespecified subgroup analysis demonstrated a reduction in transfusion requirements for patients with subcapital fractures and those admitted with [Hb] &#x0003e; 12 g/dl. Overall there is a reduction in both red cell transfusion and postoperative infection of around 40%; 30-day mortality and length of stay do not appear to be altered. Laboratory data support the positive effects of i.v. iron on erythropoiesis with statistically and clinically significant increases in reticulocyte counts and iron indices. These data used non-randomized comparison groups, except for the final study. Furthermore, clinical management is different from current UK practice and guidelines, with an average time to theatre of over 4 days, compared with a UK median time of around 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recent changes to UK tariffs strongly encourage operation within 36 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Intravenous iron therapy is relatively inexpensive; 200 mg of iron sucrose costs around &#x000a3;15. Administration costs for i.v. iron are likely to be similar to blood transfusion, in terms of consumables and nursing time. Even if the only benefit of intravenous iron is to reduce transfusion rates, the potential cost savings are considerable. Potential benefits, such as a reduction in infectious complications, which are suggested by the current literature, would result in significant cost savings to the healthcare economy, as well as improved quality of care. The direct consumable costs are probably slightly in favour of i.v. iron. With an estimated i.v. iron cost of &#x000a3;43 and blood unit cost of &#x000a3;200, assuming that an average of two units are transfused when given, if i.v. iron reduces transfusion rates from 38% to 25%, the direct cost saving in transfusion-related costs is around &#x000a3;10 per patient. Unlike cost savings from length of stay, these are direct savings to the healthcare system that can be realised, as well as releasing a scarce resource for use elsewhere.</p><p>The current literature supports the hypothesis that i.v. iron might be an effective and safe treatment, reducing the need for blood transfusion following hip fracture. Given the differences between UK and Spanish hip fracture management, particularly regarding time to operation, it is unclear whether the promising results from the Spanish experience will be applicable to the UK hip fracture population. It is unknown at present whether i.v. iron would have sufficient erythropoietic effect in hip fracture patients to reduce transfusion rates in the early postoperative period.</p><p>A large randomized controlled trial of preoperative i.v. iron for patients with hip fracture may be appropriate. To inform appropriate design of such a trial, a pilot study evaluating the haematological effect of i.v. iron in this population is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study objectives</title><sec><title><bold><italic>Primary aims</italic></bold></title><p>To investigate whether intravenous iron given as three 200 mg doses over three days in patients with hip fracture causes an increase in reticulocyte count in the early postoperative period;</p></sec><sec><title><bold><italic>Secondary aims</italic></bold></title><p>To discover whether intravenous iron has beneficial effects on other measures of haematopoiesis, transfusion requirements and patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title><bold><italic>Haematological measures</italic></bold></title><p>As haematopoietic indices, full blood count and serum transferrin receptor concentrations will be measured.

The investigator informs the participant or the participant&#x02019;s nominated representative (other individual or other body with appropriate jurisdiction), of all aspects pertaining to participation in the study. Active participation in the study is for the first seven days of hospital admission. The study intervention is complete after the third day (administration of i.v. iron) with daily blood tests until day 7. The medical notes are reviewed following hospital discharge for in-hospital complications and medication use.</p><p>Participants are informed that entry into the trial is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at any time without effect on subsequent care. Data on time to discharge and postoperative mortality are collected routinely and separately from this study.

Blood loss at the time of injury is not amenable to intervention, so therapeutic choices include minimizing further blood loss through surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological techniques, encouraging haematopoiesis or replacing blood by transfusion. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been shown to be beneficial in elective orthopaedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and in major trauma. In hip fracture patients, however, it appears to reduce blood loss at the cost of increased cardiovascular morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The impact of blood transfusion on outcomes remains controversial. Some studies support a risk of infective complications from transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] whereas others have found benefit from transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The recently reported FOCUS study found no overall benefit from liberal vs. restrictive transfusion policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. One explanation for these results may be that the risks of blood transfusion broadly balance out the benefits. An alternative approach is therefore to encourage haematopoiesis thereby improving [Hb] without the attendant risks and costs of transfusion. Although the results from the Spanish group are very encouraging, they are not, in themselves, sufficient to recommend routine use of intravenous iron or erythropoietin in this group of patients. The subgroups showing benefit in each of the studies are different, as is the drug protocol. The time to surgery is significantly longer than UK or Scandinavian practice, which may, potentially, have significant impact on perioperative transfusion requirements. We have explicitly defined our subgroups a priori<italic>.</italic> This study is not powered to detect differences in these subgroups, but these subgroups are broadly in line with those where differences in efficacy of i.v. iron have previously been reported. A-priori subgroup analysis may provide suggestive evidence for planning future studies. As with all clinical studies, we have tried to balance pragmatism, generalizability and scientific &#x02018;purity&#x02019; in the protocol. We have excluded patients under 70 years of age to reduce the risks of studying a population that is younger and fitter than the &#x02018;average&#x02019; hip fracture patient. Our transfusion triggers are a codification of current clinical practice, which broadly reflect UK clinical practice. Inevitably, they will not precisely match practice across the UK or worldwide, but we believe they are similar enough to be applicable elsewhere. On the \basis of current evidence, we do not feel that there is sufficient evidence to either proscribe or demand the use of tranexamic acid. Our local practice is not to delay surgery for patients on clopidogrel or ticlopidine, but they are at increased risk of bleeding in the intra-operative and perioperative period; such patients are therefore excluded from the study. Standard care is similar to most units in the UK, and the randomization process should account for any potential bias due to differences in local practice.</p><p>It is unlikely that intravenous iron, as a single intervention, will alter major outcomes, such as length of stay, mortality or readmission rates to a clinically significant degree, but it is plausible for it to have a beneficial effect on transfusion rates. However, this is only likely to happen if a significant effect on erythropoiesis occurs; hence, our choice of the absolute difference in reticulocyte count as the primary outcome of this study. We have chosen day seven as the primary time point for measuring difference in reticulocyte count. Although an effect may be seen at later times, we believe, consistent with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], that if a clinically significant effect is present, it will be observed within one week. Prolonging the observation time also risks losing participants due to discharge.</p><p>If the results of this study are positive, it will provide the necessary information for development of a full-scale trial of intravenous iron. There is an increasing awareness of the benefit of bundles of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] as opposed to single &#x02018;magic bullet&#x02019; interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] to improve outcomes following surgery. A full-scale trial would help to define the potential cost, resource requirement (blood products) or direct patient benefit of using intravenous iron as part of such a bundle of care. If there is a cost benefit to using intravenous iron, this could be significant: around 80,000 patients have operative fixation of hip fracture in the UK each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Conversely, if there is no benefit in the UK setting, then healthcare resources could usefully be directed elsewhere.</p><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Approvals were obtained from the Nottingham Research Ethics Committee on 23 November 2011 (reference number 11/EM/0310), the Nottingham University Hospitals Research and Development department on 2 August 2011 (reference number 68213) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority on 19 January 2012, (EuDRACT: 2011-003233-34). The study was also registered with the National Institute for Health Research Portfolio and ISRCTN:76424792 (10 September 2012). The study is ongoing. The first participant was randomized on 19 July 2012; it is hoped that the study will be completed with the last visit of the last patient before 12 March 2014.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Hb: Haemoglobin; [Hb]: Concentration of haemoglobin; i.v: Intravenous.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study is funded by the National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.
