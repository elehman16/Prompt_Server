It is now well established that tobacco use is one of the most important, preventable risk factor in the incidence and progression of periodontal diseases. In addition, tobacco use has a negative adverse effect on the full spectrum of periodontal treatment approaches such as mechanical debridement, local and systemic antimicrobial therapy, periodontal surgery, regenerative therapy, and implants.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the past 30&#x02013;40 years, groups of investigators have developed several schematic explanations for the complex interplay of the factors that play a role in the progression of periodontal diseases.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Although effects of cigarette smoking on the periodontium have been extensively examined, most studies compared the risk of different smoking status; that is, current smokers, and nonsmokers, on the severity or progression of periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>This study aims at examining the difference in the periodontal status of current smokers, former smokers, and nonsmokers among the adults of Kothamangalam, Kerala.

A mouth mirror, No. 23 explorer, Williams graduated periodontal probe were the instruments used. Clinical evaluation was done on subjects of all three groups. A detailed medical and dental history was obtained by interview.</p><p>All teeth in four quadrants were examined except third molars. Periodontal examinations included oral hygiene status, gingival bleeding, probing pocket depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL). Probing PD and clinical attachment level were measured on four sites per tooth. Probing PD was assessed as the distance from the marginal gingiva to the base of the pocket. Loss of attachment was measured as the distance in millimeter from the cemento-enamel junction to the bottom of the gingival sulcus. Oral hygiene status was measured using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (Greene and Vermillion). The gingival index (Loe and Silness) was used to assess the severity of gingivitis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Smoking Status Assessment</title><p>Smoking status was assessed by a self-reported questionnaire. Participants were asked to estimate the number of cigarettes consumed per day and the number of years they smoked. Smokers were defined as persons who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Current smokers were those smoked at the time of examination. Former smokers were persons who had quit smoking at the time of examination. Subjects who quit smoking 1-year or before from the time of examination were included in the study. Smoking exposure was expressed in term of pack-years, which was calculated by the multiplication of the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the number of years smoked.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In the current pilot study, subjects were categorized according to their smoking status as current smokers (Group I), former smokers (Group II), nonsmokers (Group III).

It causes increased prevalence and severity of periodontal destruction, increased PD, attachment loss, and bone loss leading to tooth loss.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The increased prevalence and severity of periodontal destruction associated with smoking suggests that the host bacterial interactions normally seen in chronic periodontitis are altered, resulting in aggressive periodontal breakdown.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It is caused due to changes in the composition of sub-gingival plaque with an increase in the numbers and virulence of pathogenic organisms, host response to the bacterial challenge or both. Smoking causes increased colonization of shallow periodontal pockets by periodontal pathogens. In the immunological level, it causes altered neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis. There is increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in gingival crevicular fluid, increased neutrophil collagenase, and elastase.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nicotine increases the secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> by monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide and also it can create a defect in the chemotaxis of neutrophils causing &#x0201c;chemotactic paralysis.&#x0201d; In the physiological point of view, there is decreased gingival blood vessels with increased inflammation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The current pilot study assessed the difference in the loss of attachment, gingival conditions, and probing PD among the current smokers, former, and nonsmokers.
