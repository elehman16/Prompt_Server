Selective avoidance of atazanavir initiation among individuals with T/T genotypes would markedly reduce the likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir while allowing atazanavir to be prescribed to the majority of individuals. This genetic association will also affect atazanavir/cobicistat.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>atazanavir</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>pharmacogenomics</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd><italic>UGT1A1</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI068634</award-id><award-id>UM1 AI068636</award-id><award-id>UM1 AI106701</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source>the AIDS Clinical Trials Group</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-4"><funding-source>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</named-content></funding-source><award-id>AI-068636</award-id><award-id>AI-068608</award-id><award-id>AI-038858</award-id><award-id>AI-068634</award-id><award-id>AI-038855</award-id><award-id>AI-069439</award-id><award-id>TR-000445</award-id><award-id>AI-077505</award-id><award-id>A5128</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-5"><funding-source>NIAID</funding-source><award-id>AI-069477</award-id><award-id>AI-027675</award-id><award-id>AI-073961</award-id><award-id>AI-069474</award-id><award-id>AI-069432</award-id><award-id>AI-069513</award-id><award-id>AI-069423</award-id><award-id>AI-050410</award-id><award-id>AI-069452</award-id><award-id>AI-69450</award-id><award-id>AI-054907</award-id><award-id>AI-069428</award-id><award-id>AI-069439</award-id><award-id>AI-069467</award-id><award-id>AI-045008</award-id><award-id>AI-069495</award-id><award-id>AI-069415</award-id><award-id>AI-069556</award-id><award-id>AI-069484</award-id><award-id>AI-069424</award-id><award-id>AI-069532</award-id><award-id>AI-069419</award-id><award-id>AI-069471</award-id><award-id>AI-025859</award-id><award-id>AI-069418</award-id><award-id>AI-050409</award-id><award-id>AI-069423</award-id><award-id>AI-069501</award-id><award-id>AI-069502</award-id><award-id>AI-069511</award-id><award-id>AI-069434</award-id><award-id>AI-069465</award-id><award-id>AI-069471</award-id><award-id>AI-069494</award-id><award-id>AI-069424</award-id><award-id>AI-069472</award-id><award-id>AI-069501</award-id><award-id>AI-069470</award-id><award-id>AI-046376</award-id><award-id>AI-069511</award-id><award-id>AI-072626</award-id><award-id>AI-069472</award-id><award-id>AI-038858</award-id><award-id>AI-069472</award-id><award-id>AI-069472</award-id><award-id>AI-069471</award-id><award-id>AI-027661</award-id><award-id>AI-027661</award-id><award-id>AI-034853</award-id><award-id>AI-069472</award-id><award-id>AI-069447</award-id><award-id>AI-032782</award-id><award-id>AI-027658</award-id><award-id>AI-27666</award-id><award-id>AI-027661</award-id><award-id>AI-058740</award-id><award-id>AI-046370</award-id><award-id>AI-069423</award-id><award-id>AI-069470</award-id><award-id>AI-069511</award-id><award-id>AI-069470</award-id><award-id>AI-069494</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-6"><funding-source>National Center for Research Resources <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</named-content></funding-source><award-id>RR-00051</award-id><award-id>RR-00046</award-id><award-id>RR-025747</award-id><award-id>RR-025777</award-id><award-id>RR-024160</award-id><award-id>RR-024996</award-id><award-id>RR-024156</award-id><award-id>RR024160</award-id><award-id>RR-024160</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-7"><funding-source>Janssen Therapeutics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Gilead Sciences, and Merck, Inc</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>Summer 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The once-daily human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease inhibitor atazanavir with low-dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (atazanavir/r) is generally safe and effective as a first-line regimen for HIV-1 infection [<xref rid="OFV085C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV085C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

In brief, A5257 participants enrolled from 2009 to 2011 at research sites in the United States and Puerto Rico were randomized to open-label atazanavir (300 mg) plus ritonavir (100 mg), darunavir (800 mg) plus ritonavir (100 mg), or raltegravir (400 mg), all with concomitant TDF/emtricitabine (300 mg/200 mg).

Study evaluations were performed before entry, at entry, at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24, 36, and 48, and every 16 weeks thereafter until the last enrolled subject was followed for 96 weeks. Bilirubin and hemoglobin were assayed individually as per standard procedures at each clinical research site.

Primary endpoints for the analysis were time to bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir/r by 96 weeks. Attribution of reasons for discontinuation of randomized treatment, including details of toxicity or adverse events and participant-initiated discontinuations that were due to low-grade adverse events, was based on site report. Bilirubin-related events were defined a priori as those reported as being due to jaundice, elevated bilirubin, or hyperpigmentation. Inconsistent or unclear information was reconciled by site query.</p><p>Cumulative incidence of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir/r was estimated using a competing risks framework and compared across <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotypes using Gray's test. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative hazards of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir/r by <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype with and without adjusting for baseline indirect bilirubin and baseline hemoglobin. Mirroring the primary A5257 analyses, the cumulative incidence of tolerability failure over 96 weeks was estimated by <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype with pairwise differences compared between randomized atazanavir/r, darunavir/r, and raltegravir via 97.5% confidence intervals (CIs) [<xref rid="OFV085C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Discriminatory properties (positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value [NPV]) of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T genotype for predicting bilirubin-related atazanavir/r discontinuation through 96 weeks after antiretroviral initiation (binary outcome) were estimated with exact 95% CIs. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 without adjusting for multiple comparisons.</p><p>All analyses were done separately by self-identified race or ethnicity. To minimize potential errors due to race or ethnicity misclassification, sensitivity analyses were performed based on inferred ancestry using genome-wide data with exclusion of samples that did not cluster with African American, European, or Hispanic populations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Among 605 participants randomized to the atazanavir/r-containing arm in A5257, 600 initiated the regimen and had available treatment discontinuation data.

Other frequently reported reasons of atazanavir/r discontinuation were nonadherence (n = 35) and gastrointestinal toxicity (n = 21).</p><p>The <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype was associated with time to bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir/r in Black (<italic>P</italic> = 3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), White (<italic>P</italic> = 1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>), and Hispanic (<italic>P</italic> = 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) participants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV085F2">2</xref>).

These findings indicate that avoidance of atazanavir prescribing to individuals with <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T genotypes would have reduced by approximately one-half the likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir, regardless of race or ethnicity. This approach would have still allowed atazanavir/r to be prescribed to the large percentage of individuals (81% of Black participants, 92% of White participants, and 84% of Hispanic participants) who are at low risk for bilirubin-related discontinuation.</p><p>We also examined the ability of baseline indirect bilirubin to predict bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir among 438 participants who initiated atazanavir/r and had available baseline indirect bilirubin, regardless of genotype. Selective avoidance of atazanavir/r in individuals with baseline indirect bilirubin &#x0003e;0.4 mg/dL would have also reduced by approximately one half the likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir, regardless of race or ethnicity, but would have allowed atazanavir/r to be prescribed to only 70% of Black participants, 55% of White participants, and 65% of Hispanic participants.</p><p>Finally, we examined the predictive utility of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype and baseline indirect bilirubin in combination. With both <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T genotype and baseline indirect bilirubin &#x0003e;0.4 mg/dL, the likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir/r was modestly higher compared with considering baseline indirect bilirubin or <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype alone. Prescribing atazanavir/r only to individuals who both lacked <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T and had baseline indirect bilirubin &#x02264;0.4 mg/dL would have also reduced by approximately one half the likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir, regardless of race or ethnicity, but would have allowed atazanavir/r prescribing to only 62% of Black participants, 53% of White participants, and 57% of Hispanic participants.</p><p>Overall, the reductions in bilirubin-related discontinuation were similar in all race and ethnic groups whether by screening for low risk based on baseline indirect bilirubin &#x0003c; 0.4, based on non-TT <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype, or considering both. However, considering just <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype would allow atazanavir/r prescribing a substantially greater percentage of participants. In particular, among White participants, 92% could be prescribed to atazanavir/r if screened using <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype compared with only 55% if screened using baseline indirect bilirubin.</p><p>With <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T homozygosity, the likelihood of bilirubin-related atazanavir/r discontinuation was least in Black participants, intermediate in Hispanic participants, and greatest in White participants. We speculate that the extent to which jaundice becomes visible differs depending on skin color and/or ancestry.</p><p>Two previous studies that analyzed associations between <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype used all-cause discontinuation of atazanavir/r as the outcome of interest. In an observational study involving 121 Swiss HIV Cohort Study participants (80% Caucasian) who had received atazanavir/r, carriage of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> low expresser alleles (*28/*28 or *28/*37) was associated with increased risk of atazanavir/r discontinuation, with cumulative rates of 63% among 18 participants carrying 2 alleles, 24% among 48 participants carrying one allele, and 15% among 55 participants carrying no allele [<xref rid="OFV085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. (The *<italic>28</italic> and <italic>*37</italic> low-expresser alleles and the <italic>*36</italic> high-expresser allele of UGT1A1 are all collectively identified an rs8175347.) In contrast, an analysis involving 646 participants randomized to receive atazanavir/r in ACTG protocol A5202 found no significant association between low-expressor <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype (primarily <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic>) and increased likelihood of atazanavir/r discontinuation among either White participants or Black participants, although there was an association among Hispanic participants [<xref rid="OFV085C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our use of bilirubin-related atazanavir/r discontinuation as the outcome minimized confounding by other factors unrelated to <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype (eg, nonadherence) and allowed genotype-phenotype associations to be more precisely described. The somewhat different results of these 3 studies are not due to genotyping differences (rs8175347 in prior studies, rs887829 in the present study). These polymorphisms are in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (rs887829 C with both *1 and *36; rs887829 T with both *28 and *37), and the *36 and *37 alleles of rs8175347 are infrequent in the populations studied.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for different results between the present study and prior reports. The somewhat higher atazanavir/r discontinuation rates in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (including those not homozygous for the risk allele) might have been influenced by discontinuations that were unrelated to bilirubin. The threshold to discontinue atazanavir/r for jaundice might have been lower in that observational study than in A5257, a prospective clinical trial. Likewise, in ACTG study A5202, atazanavir/r discontinuations unrelated to bilirubin might have obscured associations with <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype. Consistent with this finding, most atazanavir/r discontinuations in the present study were attributed to causes other than bilirubin. In the A5202 study, the alternative antiretroviral provided for participants who developed jaundice (ie, lopinavir/r) may have been considered less attractive than the alternatives provided by protocol A5257 (ie, darunavir/r and raltegravir), creating a greater barrier to atazanavir/r discontinuation in A5202.</p><p>The HIV-1 protease inhibitors have relatively high genetic barriers to viral drug resistance. For this reason, protease inhibitor-based regimens are sometimes prescribed to patients who are at risk for nonadherence. With atazanavir/r, absence of an increase in plasma bilirubin from baseline (regardless of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype) strongly indicates that atazanavir/r was not taken within the prior 24 hours. This biomarker of adherence, often available from chemistry panels obtained at routine clinic visits, could still be used among individuals with <italic>UGT1A1</italic> non-TT genotypes who are prescribed atazanavir/r. Prior cost-effectiveness modeling indicated that <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping to avoid atazanavir-related hyperbilirubinemia is cost effective if comparator antiretroviral therapy regimens (eg, atazanavir/r versus darunavir/r, each with TDF/emtricitabine) have identical drug costs [<xref rid="OFV085C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping for atazanavir, drug cost largely drives overall cost effectiveness. In settings where differential drug costs encourage prescribing of atazanavir/r-based regimens, patient care may benefit from <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping, with avoidance of atazanavir in the select subset of patients at greatest risk for bilirubin-related discontinuation. Many commercial laboratories in the United States offer genotype testing for <italic>UGT1A1</italic> (especially <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic>, which is in almost complete linkage disequilibrium with rs887829).</p><p>Among A5257 participants with <italic>UGT1A1</italic> C/C genotype, the cumulative incidence of all-cause tolerability failure by 96 weeks with atazanavir/r versus darunavir/r was within the equivalence boundary, and tolerability failure among participants with <italic>UGT1A1</italic> C/T genotype was almost within the equivalence boundary. The tolerability benefit of darunavir/r over atazanavir/r in A5257 was most pronounced among participants who were homozygous for <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T genotype. For atazanavir/r versus raltegravir comparisons, the cumulative incidence of all-cause tolerability failure by 96 weeks was inferior in atazanavir/r even when considering the <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype.</p><p>The present study had limitations. We focused on genotype and clinical laboratory factors that were predetermined based on previous studies [<xref rid="OFV085C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="OFV085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is possible that additional genetic or clinical factors could improve prediction of bilirubin-associated discontinuation of atazanavir/r. The smaller sample size for Hispanic participants may limit generalizability of findings in this subgroup. We did not study atazanavir with pharmacokinetic enhancement by cobicistat rather than ritonavir. However, atazanavir plasma concentration-time profiles when prescribed with cobicistat are bioequivalent to those with ritonavir [<xref rid="OFV085C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, in a double-blind clinical trial that randomly assigned 692 patients to receive atazanavir with either cobicistat or ritonavir, adverse events related to bilirubin elevations (eg, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, and scleral icterus) occurred in a similar percentage of patients in the cobicistat and ritonavir arms (40.7% and 36.2%, respectively), as did bilirubin-associated discontinuation of atazanavir (3.5% and 3.2%, respectively) [<xref rid="OFV085C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We therefore expect the associations between <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype and bilirubin-associated discontinuation of atazanavir/r reported in the present study to also occur with atazanavir/cobicistat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In summary, among participants randomized to receive atazanavir/r with concomitant TDF/emtricitabine in A5257, <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T genotype predicted an increased likelihood of bilirubin-associated discontinuation of atazanavir/r, regardless of race or ethnicity. Selective avoidance of atazanavir initiation among individuals with <italic>UGT1A1</italic> T/T genotype would markedly reduce the likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir/r for hyperbilirubinemia. On April 8, 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services' Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents were updated to move atazanavir from preferred to alternative status, explicitly based on results of A5257 [<xref rid="OFV085C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The present analyses suggest that, among individuals known to have either rs887829 C/C or C/T genotypes, atazanavir might still be considered for inclusion in preferred regimens.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the many persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection who volunteered for A5257 and A5128.
