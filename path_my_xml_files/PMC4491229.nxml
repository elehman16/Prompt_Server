The magnitude of an individual&#x02019;s cardiorespiratory fitness has been viewed as representative of overall health and studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse relationship between VO<sub>2</sub>max values and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The &#x0201c;F.I.T.T.&#x0201d; principle is an acronym for the four components for exercise prescription: frequency, intensity, time (length), and type of exercise. Exercise intensity is arguably the most critical component of the exercise prescription model. Failure to meet minimal threshold values may result in lack of a training effect, while too high of an exercise intensity could lead to over-training and negatively impact adherence to an exercise program. The traditional reference standard for prescribing exercise intensity is expressed in terms of percentages of heart rate reserve (%HRR) or oxygen uptake reserve (%VO<sub>2</sub>R). This is considered the &#x02018;<italic>relative percent method</italic>&#x02019;. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) currently recommends an exercise intensity of 40-59&#x000a0;% HRR/VO<sub>2</sub>R for improving and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the large base of Category A evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] supporting the ACSM relative percent concept recommendation for prescribing exercise intensity, there is concern that the relative percent concept approach consists of a very large range of acceptable percentages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and also fails to take into account individual metabolic responses (e.g., blood lactate) to exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, it has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] that there is considerable individual variation in the blood lactate response to exercise when intensity is anchored to relative percent concepts (e.g., %HRR, %VO<sub>2</sub>max). In turn, it has been suggested that this heterogeneous variation in the metabolic strain of each exercise session may ultimately yield individual variation in training adaptations; thus resulting in positive responders and non-responders to chronic exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, it has been suggested that a &#x02018;<italic>threshold based model</italic>&#x02019; for establishing exercise intensity might better identify the lowest effective training stimulus and elicit comparable relative metabolic strain across individuals with varying fitness levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indeed, the American Council on Exercise (ACE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] recommends a &#x02018;<italic>threshold based model</italic>&#x02019; approach to prescribing exercise intensity in its <italic>ACE three-zone training model</italic>. However, it has been acknowledged elsewhere that the experimental evidence supporting a &#x02018;<italic>threshold based model</italic>&#x02019; approach to exercise training is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, it remains to be determined if a threshold based training model will attenuate individual variation in training responses when compared to exercise training prescription anchored to relative percent methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two exercise training programs for improving cardiorespiratory fitness: a threshold based training model vs. the relative percent method (i.e., %HRR).</p><p>It was hypothesized that:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The threshold based training model would elicit greater mean changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (as measured by VO<sub>2</sub>max) when compared to the relative percent method.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants in the threshold based training model group would be more likely to have favorable VO<sub>2</sub>max responses; while comparatively, participants in the relative percent method group would be more likely to experience a VO<sub>2</sub>max nonresponse to exercise training.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-two nonsmoking men and women (18 to 54&#x000a0;years) were recruited from the student and faculty population of a local university, as well as the surrounding community, via advertisement through the university website, local community newspaper, and word-of-mouth. Participants were eligible for inclusion into the study if they were low-to-moderate risk as defined by the ACSM and sedentary. Participants were considered sedentary if they reported not participating in at least 30&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity physical activity on at least three days of the week for at least three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Participants were also eligible for inclusion into the study if they verbally agreed to continue previous dietary habits and not perform additional exercise beyond that required for the present study. Exclusionary criteria included evidence of cardiovascular pulmonary, and/or metabolic disease as determined by medical history questionnaire. This study was approved by the Human Research Committee at Western State Colorado University. Each participant signed an informed consent form prior to participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Baseline, midpoint, and post-program experimental testing procedures</title><p>Measurements of all primary and secondary outcome variables were obtained both before and after the exercise training intervention. Additionally, a measure of the primary outcome variable (maximal oxygen uptake &#x02013; VO<sub>2</sub>max) was also obtained at midpoint. Secondary outcome variables consisted of resting heart rate and blood pressure, and basic anthropometric measures including height, weight, waist circumference, and skinfolds. Fasting blood lipid and blood glucose measurements were also performed. All measurements were obtained by following standardized procedures as outlined elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Procedures for each measurement are also briefly described below. Prior to testing participants refrained from all food and drink other than water for 12&#x000a0;h. Participants were also instructed to refrain from strenuous exertion 12&#x000a0;h prior to testing. All post-program testing took place within 1 to 4&#x000a0;days of the last exercise training session.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Resting heart rate and blood pressure measurement</title><p>The procedures for assessment of resting heart rate and blood pressure outlined elsewhere were followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Briefly, participants were seated quietly for 5&#x000a0;min in a chair with a back support with feet on the floor and arm supported at heart level. Resting heart rate was obtained via manual palpation of radial artery in the left wrist and recording the number of beats for 60&#x000a0;s. The left arm brachial artery blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer in duplicate and separated by 1-min. The mean of the two measurements was reported for baseline and post-program values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>Participants were weighed to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg on a medical grade scale and measured for height to the nearest 0.5&#x000a0;cm using a stadiometer. Percent body fat was determined via skinfolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Skinfold thickness was measured to the nearest&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;mm using a Lange caliper (Cambridge Scientific Industries, Columbia, MD). All measurements were taken on the right side of the body using standardized anatomical sites (three-site) for men and women. These measurements were performed until two were within 10&#x000a0;% of each other. Waist circumference measurements were obtained using a cloth tape measure with a spring loaded-handle (Creative Health Products, Ann Arbor, MI). A horizontal measurement was taken at the narrowest point of the torso (below the xiphoid process and above the umbilicus). These measurements were taken until two were within 0.5&#x000a0;mm of each other.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fasting blood lipid and blood glucose measurement</title><p>All fasting lipid and blood glucose analyses were collected in duplicate and performed at room temperature. The mean of the two measurements was reported for baseline and post-program values. Participants&#x02019; hands were washed with soap and rinsed thoroughly with water, then cleaned with alcohol swabs and allowed to dry. Skin was punctured using lancets and a fingerstick sample was collected into heparin-coated 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l capillary tube. Blood was allowed to flow freely from the fingerstick into the capillary tube without milking of the finger. Samples were then dispensed immediately onto commercially available test cassettes for analysis in a Cholestech LDX System (Alere Inc., Waltham, MA) according to strict standardized operating procedures. The LDX Cholestech measured total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose in fingerstick blood. A daily optics check was performed on the LDX Cholestech analyzer used for the study. Independent studies have provided data to indicate that the Cholestech LDX system has excellent reproducibility with standard clinical laboratory measurement of plasma lipids and lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and meets the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP) criteria for accuracy and reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Maximal exercise testing</title><p>Participants completed a modified-Balke, pseudo-ramp graded exercise test (GXT) on a power treadmill (Powerjog GX200, Maine). Participants walked or jogged at a self-selected pace. Treadmill incline was increased by 1&#x000a0;% every minute until the participant reached volitional fatigue. Participant HR was continuously recorded during the GXT via a chest strap and radio-telemetric receiver (Polar Electro, Woodbury, NY, USA). Expired air and gas exchange data were recorded continuously during the GXT using a metabolic analyzer (Parvo Medics TrueOne 2.0, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Before each exercise test, the metabolic analyzer was calibrated with gases of known concentrations (14.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.07&#x000a0;% O<sub>2</sub>, 6.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub>) and with room air (20.93%O<sub>2</sub> and 0.03&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub>) as per the instruction manual. Volume calibration of the pneumotachometer was done via a 3-Litre calibration syringe system (Hans-Rudolph, Kansas City, MO, USA). The last 15&#x000a0;s of the GXT were averaged &#x02013; this was considered the final data point. The closest neighbouring data point was calculated by averaging the data collected 15&#x000a0;s immediately before the last 15&#x000a0;s of the test. The mean of the two processed data points represented VO<sub>2</sub>max. Maximal HR was considered to be the highest recorded HR in beats per minute (bpm) during the GXT. Participant heart rate reserve (HRR) was determined by taking the difference between maximal HR and resting HR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Determination of ventilatory thresholds</title><p>Determination of both the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) and second ventilatory threshold (VT2) were made by visual inspection of graphs of time plotted against each relevant respiratory variable (according to 15&#x000a0;s time-averaging). The criteria for VT1 was an increase in VE/VO<sub>2</sub> with no concurrent increase in VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> and departure from the linearity of VE. The criteria for VT2 was a simultaneous increase in both VE/VO<sub>2</sub> and VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All assessments were done by two experienced exercise physiologists. In the event of conflicting results, the original assessments were reevaluated and collectively a consensus was agreed upon.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization and exercise intervention</title><p>After the completion of baseline testing, participants were randomized to a non-exercise control group or one of two exercise training groups according to a computer generated sequence of random numbers that was stratified by sex (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This was a double-blind research design in that participants were unaware of the group to which they had been assigned. Likewise, the researchers specifically responsible for testing and supervision of exercise sessions were unaware of the group to which participants had been allocated. Participants randomized to the exercise training groups performed 12weeks of exercise training according to one of two exercise intensity regimens: 1) a relative percent method was used in which intensity was prescribed according to percentages of HRR (HRR group), or 2) a threshold-based method (ACE-3ZM) was used in which intensity was prescribed according to VT1 and VT2 as recommended by ACE in its three-zone model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The exercise prescription details for each training group over the course of the 12weeks training period is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of experimental procedures and exercise prescription for each of the two exercise training groups.

Overall, the exercise prescription was intended to fulfill the consensus recommendation of 150&#x000a0;min/week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The exercise prescription for exercise intensity method differed between treatment groups. The HRR group was prescribed exercise intensity according to a percentage of HRR. Conversely, the ACE-3ZM group was prescribed exercise intensity according to ventilatory threshold. In both exercise training groups a target heart rate (HR) coinciding with either the prescribed HRR or prescribed VT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was used to establish a specific exercise training intensity for each exercise session.

However, it has been demonstrated that these exercise intensity prescription methods elicit large inter-individual variation in the metabolic responses to exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. On this basis, it has been postulated that the individual variation in metabolic response will subsequently lead to differences in the overall homeostatic stress from each training session which will ultimately result in heterogeneity in the exercise training response (i.e., change in VO<sub>2</sub>max). Alternatively, it has been suggested that use of a threshold based method for establishing exercise intensity might better normalize the metabolic stimulus for individuals with varying fitness levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Results from the present study provide experimental evidence to support the merits of a threshold based method for prescription of exercise intensity. Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], this current study found considerable heterogeneity in terms of VO<sub>2</sub>max responders (41.7&#x000a0;%) and non-responders (58.3&#x000a0;%) when exercise intensity was prescribed in relative terms as a %HRR. In contrast, we demonstrated a consistent positive VO<sub>2</sub>max response to exercise training (100&#x000a0;% responders) when a threshold based exercise intensity prescription method was employed. Taken together, the results of this novel study are encouraging and provide important preliminary data for the design of individualized exercise prescriptions that will enhance training efficacy and limit training unresponsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary prevention of chronic disease perspective</title><p>In the past decade low cardiorespiratory fitness has garnered considerable attention as an independent and powerful predictor of CVD risk and premature mortality. For example, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] showed in a meta-analysis that there was a marked increase in relative risk for CVD in the lowest quartile of cardiorespiratory fitness. More recently Blair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] estimated that low cardiorespiratory fitness accounted for more overall deaths when compared to deaths which could be attributed to traditional CVD risk factors, such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Accordingly, the ACE-3ZM change in VO<sub>2</sub>max results from the current study have novel clinical and public health relevance, as a large number of adults fall into clinically-defined low cardiorespiratory fitness categories and therefore demonstrate increased CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Importantly, exercise training in the ACE-3ZM group elicited a positive improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max in 100&#x000a0;% (12/12) of the individuals. Overall, VO<sub>2</sub>max was improved on average by 1.1 METs (range +0.65 to +1.63 METs) in the ACE-3ZM group following 12weeks of exercise training. These improvements likely have important long-term prevention implications as a recent study reported a 1 MET increase in VO<sub>2</sub>max was associated with an 18&#x000a0;% reduction in deaths due to CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>There are several limitations to the present study that warrant further discussion. First, overall sample size in our study is lower than other major training studies in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, advantages of a smaller sample size were the ability to better supervise the exercise program and more closely interact with participants on a daily basis during exercise sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In particular, the adherence to the prescribed exercise intensity and program was excellent for both exercise treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Second, the present study (12weeks) was also relatively modest in duration compared to previous training investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, the significant improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max found in the present study indicate that a 12weeks exercise training period is a sufficient timeframe to demonstrate significant training effects. Future research is needed to confirm the possibility of additional improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max following an exercise training program similar in characteristics to the present study but for prolonged durations. Third, while participants were instructed to maintain their regular dietary intake during the 12weeks intervention, diet intake was not strictly controlled for in this study. Moreover, physical activity outside of the training program was not monitored and thus may have influenced the current findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is a wealth of previous research demonstrating an independent, inverse, dose&#x02013;response relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and all-cause and CVD mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Moreover, cardiorespiratory fitness has been called the ultimate marker for risk stratification and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the present study a threshold based exercise intensity prescription elicited significantly greater improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max and attenuated the individual variation in VO<sub>2</sub>max training responses when compared to relative percent exercise training. These novel findings are encouraging and provide important preliminary data for the design of individualized exercise prescriptions that will enhance training efficacy and limit training unresponsiveness.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>This investigation was supported financially by the American Council on Exercise.
