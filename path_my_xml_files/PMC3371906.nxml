In North America, most of surgeons do reamed nailing for the treatment of open or closed tibial fractures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] In developing countries because of low facilities and lack of medical instruments, the selection of each method may differ.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] Recently, external fixators like Ilizarov or AO external fixator are used extensively in developing countries but the rates of malunion and infection are relatively high.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] With AO external fixator, the efficacy of treatment in two studies were reported to be 20- 31%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of Ilizaro versus AO external fixator for treatment of tibial open fractures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This interventional study was conducted on patients with open tibial fractures admitted at the Emergency Department of Shahid Beheshti Hospital of Babol University of Medical Sciences from April 2002 to April 2010. Our department is the only orthopedics center and serves more than 1.7 million local residents in three large cities (Amol, Babol, and Babolsar) and the corresponding urban areas in the province of Mazandaran located across the Caspian Sea. Exclusion criteria were fractures involved articular surface, previous fracture of tibia, neurovascular damages, diabetic and immunocopromised patients. After admission, all cases were rehabilitated based on ATLS protocol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</p><p>After taking x ray of the involved bone, antibiotic prophylaxis including cefazolin (2 g/8 hours) plus gentamicin (3-5 mg/kg/day) were administered and continued for 5 days. For contaminated wounds, penicillin was added to the mentioned regimen. Prophylaxis against tetanus was considered for all patients. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] Observations and mechanisms for inducing of fractures were done. Physical examinations, assessment of neuro-vascular conditions in involved limb were carefully performed. Soft tissue injuries were classified based on Gustillo method. After stabilization, all cases X-rays were taken AP and lateral of total length of involved bone. After evaluation of the patients, all of them were transferred to operation room. After irrigation of the involved sites with 9 liters of normal saline and debridement, Ilizarov or AO external fixator was inserted. The Ilizarov or AO external fixator was done based on their guidelines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]</p><p>The primary end points of this study were lack of malunion and nonunion. The secondary endpoints included delayed union and infection. Malunion was defined as deformity of united bone with angulation&#x0003e; 5 degrees, shortening&#x0003e;1 cm and distal fragment rotation&#x0003e;15 degrees.13 Nonunion was defined when fractures were not developed union up to nine months after applying external fixator judged on clinically and radiologically. Delayed union was defined when fractures were not developed union up to 6 months judged on clinically and radiologically. Compliance was checked up at each visit during the course of treatment and was asked about the prescribed instruments. Efficacy (success rate) was defined as the rate of total cured cases in each arm. The sample size for each group was estimated to be 53 cases based on cure rate of 25% for AO external fixator and prediction of up to 6% for Ilizarov group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] For better accuracy, 60 cases were selected in each arm. The alpha and beta errors chosen for this calculation were 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Patients admitted during the paired days received Ilizarov and the single days received AO external fixator until the sample sizes were completed. The study was approved by the research center of Babol Medical University and its Ethics Committee. All patients gave their written informed consent. Four days after procedures when patients had no infection or discharge and necrotized tissue and pain, they were ambulated and the weight bearing was encouraged as soon as possible for a range of painless or tolerable pain loading without taking any analgesic drug. Full weight bearing was permitted when there was not any disturbing pain in walking without crutch or any other aids. Every day, the sites of pins were irrigated with betadine and all cases were educated regarding caring of their pins sites. After discharging from the hospital, they were evaluated clinically and an x ray was obtained in all cases. This assessment was done each month for one year. When within three months of intervention healing did not progress precisely, we performed compression of Ilizarov or dynamization of AO external fixator. After union of the bone, fixators were removed and patellar tendon bearing casting or functional bracing was recommended for 6 weeks. Union of fracture was defined when painless weight bearing during walking occurred and x ray in AP and lateral views showed bridging calus in the 3 cortexes.5 If after six months, improvement process did not progress, it was named as delayed union and if 9 months (adding additional 3months) after intervention, repairing was not developed, it was called a nonunion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]</p><p>Bone deformity with angulation more than 5 degree, shortening more than one centimeter and rotational deformity&#x0003e;15 degree was considered as malunion. Malunion was measured by x ray of AP and lateral view of both legs for comparison. For determining the length of tibia, distance between proximal tibial surface, to the distal arthicular surface of tibia in two legs were measured. Determination of angulation between proximal and distal fragment of fracture was obtained by drowing 2 lines parallel to fragments longitudinal axis in two plane x-ray radiograms of involved leg and comparing it with conteralateral intact leg. Rotational deformity was determined by comparing axial CTscanogram of 2 ends points of tibias. Refracture was defined as the presence of fracture in previous fracture site in which consolidation occurred before the second trauma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] Infection of the pin sites was determined based on DAHL classification.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 18, Chicago, IL, USA). The student t test was used to compare continuous variables and &#x003c7;(2) test or Fisher Exact test was used to compare categorical variables. We used relative risk with 95% confidence interval to show all outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression model (univariate and multivariate) was used to estimate the differences between these two methods of therapy after the adjustment of the baseline covariates like age, sex, Custillo classification of open fracture, pattern of fracture and kind of procedures. Differences with a p value of less than 0.05 were considered significant. All p values were 2-tailed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients in Ilizarov group was 32.35&#x000b1;11.28 (53 males, 7 females) and for AO fixator were 31.3&#x000b1;10.99 years (54 males and 6 females).

They also showed that the rates of nonunion with Gustillo II and III when compared with Gustillo I and lost fractures were higher.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] In this study, we found better efficacy of Ilizarov in comparison to AO fixator for the treatment of tibia open fractures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="s3tbl3">Table 3</xref>). We think that control of fracture fragments by Ilizarov frame was better than AO external fixator because of three dimensional manipulations of fragments possibility at the operation scene, and better achievement of compression in fracture site during post operation management.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of our study showed that the efficacies of treatment with Ilizarov was higher than AO external fixator in treatment of tibia open fractures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank to Shirkhani for helping in statistical analysis.
