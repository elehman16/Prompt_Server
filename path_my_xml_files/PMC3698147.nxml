This gives us the opportunity to develop interventions to prevent depression in a personalized way. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a new intervention, personalized and implemented by family physicians (FPs), to prevent the onset of episodes of major depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), with cluster assignment by health center and two parallel arms. Two interventions will be applied by FPs, usual care versus the new intervention predictD-CCRT. The latter has four components: a training workshop for FPs; communicating the level and profile of risk of depression; building up a tailored bio-psycho-family-social intervention by FPs to prevent depression; offering a booklet to prevent depression; and activating and empowering patients. We will recruit a systematic random sample of 3286 non-depressed adult patients (1643 in each trial arm), nested in 140 FPs and 70 health centers from 7 Spanish cities. All patients will be evaluated at baseline, 6, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months. The level and profile of risk of depression will be communicated to patients by the FPs in the intervention practices at baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Our primary outcome will be the cumulative incidence of major depression (measured by <italic>CIDI</italic> each 6&#x000a0;months) over 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be health-related quality of life (<italic>SF-12</italic> and <italic>EuroQol</italic>), and measurements of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. The inferences will be made at patient level. We shall undertake an intention-to-treat effectiveness analysis and will handle missing data using multiple imputations. We will perform multi-level logistic regressions and will adjust for the probability of the onset of major depression at 12&#x000a0;months measured at baseline as well as for unbalanced variables if appropriate. The economic evaluation will be approached from two perspectives, societal and health system.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT of universal primary prevention for depression in adults and the first to test a personalized intervention implemented by FPs.

A systematic review of 24 cost-of-illness studies of depression has reported that depression has substantial economic consequences for society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, in 2004 the total annual cost of depression in Europe was estimated to be &#x020ac;118 billion, or &#x020ac;253 per inhabitant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Major depression is projected to rank as the greatest contributor to illness burden by 2030 in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] due to its high prevalence, high impact on functioning, and early age of onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Most suicides are committed by people with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and the mortality rate of depressed patients exceeds 1.65 times that of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Despite effective treatments for depression, curative interventions can only reduce the disease burden of depression by 20%, because not all cases are recognized as such, and when recognized not all will receive appropriate treatment or adhere to the given treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. From a public health point of view, besides improving the whole process of depression care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we need comprehensive approaches to depression prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Risk strategies and primary prevention of depression</title><p>Primary prevention aims to reduce the incidence of new episodes of depression. When preventive measures are applied to the general population, regardless of their risk factors, primary prevention is called &#x0201c;<italic>universal prevention</italic>&#x0201d;. All randomized controlled trials (RCT) of universal prevention of depression have been conducted in children and/or adolescentes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. If primary prevention strategies are applied to people who have risk factors for depression, then it is called &#x0201c;<italic>selective prevention</italic>&#x0201d;. Here RCT have been undertaken in children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and in adults with specific risks for depression: stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], patients with complex medically illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], caregivers of relatives with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], or social risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], among others. A particular group of people at risk of depression are those with depressive symptoms, which do not meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression. Primary prevention in this group of 105 people who are "subclinically depressed" is referred to &#x0201c;indicated prevention&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x02018;predictD&#x02019; algorithm</title><p>In recent years, our research group has developed and validated a risk algorithm (&#x0201c;the predictD algorithm&#x0201d;) to predict the onset of episodes of major depression in primary care attendees, in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The Spanish algorithm obtained good calibration and discriminative validation [C-index&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82 (0.79-0.84)]. From 39 known risk factors of depression, 12 were included in the Spanish prediction model: six were patient characteristics or past events (sex, age, sex*age interaction, education, childhood physical abuse, and lifetime depression) and six were current status (SF-12 physical score, SF-12 mental score, dissatisfaction with unpaid work, number of serious problems in very close persons, dissatisfaction with living together at home, and taking medication for stress, anxiety or depression). The calculator of the likelihood of becoming depressed at 12&#x000a0;months is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rediapp.org/predict.php">http://www.rediapp.org/predict.php</ext-link>. The "predictD algorithm" provides, in addition to the quantification of the overall risk of depression, knowledge of those risk factors influencing a given patient and that could guide a possible preventive intervention. This could allow us, as in cardiovascular disease, to develop interventions tailored in both intensity (level of risk) and specificity (profile of risk). This type of primary prevention might be called &#x0201c;<italic>personalized prevention</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Effectiveness of primary prevention in depression</title><p>There are at least 5 systematic reviews or meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] of effectiveness of primary prevention in depression in children and/or adolescents. A systematic review on Australian school-based prevention for anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] included 24 RCT of 9 intervention programs (Friends, moodGYM, Aussie Optimism, etc.). Six were universal interventions, two indicated programs and one was a treatment program. Most were associated with short-term improvements or symptom reduction at follow-up. A meta-analysis (13&#x02013;4 RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] of school-based cognitive-behavior interventions to prevent depression (all interventions were delivered at the group level) found that they were effective for reducing depressive symptoms at 1 and 3&#x000a0;months (with statistical significance), but at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months the differences were not significant. A meta-regression of other meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] (47 RCT and 32 prevention programs) found larger effects for programs targeting high-risk individuals, samples with more females, samples with older adolescents, programs with a shorter duration and with homework assignments, and programs delivered by mental health professional interventionists versus teachers. Another systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] (42 RCT, relating to 28 individual school-based programs) also found that indicated programs were most effective, and teacher program leaders less effective. The most recent Cochrane meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] (15&#x02013;10 RCT) concluded that the risk of having a depressive disorder post-intervention was reduced at 3, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months; although there was significant heterogeneity. The persistence of the findings suggests that this is real and not a placebo effect.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis (20 RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] focusing on prevention of postpartum depression, reported a Relative Risk of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66-0.93). Promising interventions included the provision of intensive, professionally-based postpartum home visits, telephone-based peer support, and interpersonal psychotherapy. A meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] of psychosocial preventive interventions to reduce depressive symptoms in low socio-economic-status women (14 RCT) found an overall effect size of 0.31(95% CI:0.17-0.45). A meta-analysis (4 RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] identified a significant effect (Odds Ratio:0.64; 95% CI:0.42-0.98) of psychotherapy for preventing depression after stroke, but there is no evidence of efficacy of antidepressants in preventing depression (10 pharmaceuticals RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, there are 4 meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] that mixed different types of populations. The first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] evaluated 7 RCT of psychological treatments for patients with subthreshold depression. The relative risk of developing a major depressive disorder in subjects who received the intervention was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.47-1.03). The second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], combining 6 RCT that used cognitive-behavioral training called &#x0201c;coping with depression&#x0201d; to prevent depression, found an Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.43-0.91).

If the same health center has FPs in both the control and the intervention groups, the likelihood of the FPs in the control group becoming contaminated by the intervention group is high, since Spanish health centers generally work as a team. We aim to evaluate a new intervention for primary prevention of major depression, which in principle will be delivered at patient level by the FP; however, due to the nature of the intervention some components could be delivered at community level, so the contamination between patients in the control and intervention groups in the same health center is likely. Therefore we have decided on cluster randomization to avoid this possibility in patients and FPs.</p><p>The randomization of the 70 health centers to allocate them to the control or intervention groups will be done stratifying by city. Thus, we will have 35 health centers assigned to the control group and 35 to the intervention group, 5 and 5 respectively for each one of the seven cities participating in our study. The randomization will be undertaken centrally, from the coordinating center in Malaga, by an independent person outside the research group using closed and opaque envelopes.</p></sec><sec><title>Masking</title><p>In trials that evaluate psychosocial interventions it is not possible for professionals who provide the new intervention or for patients who receive it to be blind to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. However, in our trial those who assess outcomes (interviewers) will be different and independent from those who provide the intervention (FPs). Moreover, the interviewers will be not informed of the patient&#x02019;s status in the control or intervention group. Those who perform statistical analyses will also be blind to the intervention and control codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated assuming that the cumulative incidence of depression in the control group will be 12% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] while the incidence in the intervention group will be 5 points below that 12%. The Type I error of the chosen contrast was 5% and the power 80%. The sample size obtained assuming a simple random sample would be 430 people in each group. As we will undertake a cluster randomization (by health center), and decided to have 35 health centers in the control group and 35 in the intervention group (48 patients in each health center), we obtained an effect design of 3.82, with the assumption that the intraclass correlation coefficient of the health center is 0.06 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus we need a sample size of 1643 patients in each trial arm, making a global sample of 3286 patients, 140 family doctors and 70 health centers. These calculations assume that the distribution of 2 FPs per health center and 24 patients per FP will be very homogeneous (coefficients of variation of cluster sizes &#x0003c;0.15). We also expect to increase the sample of patients recruited by FPs from 24 to 26&#x02013;27, since about 10% of potential patients will have a diagnosis of major depression on CIDI at baseline and will need to be excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>All patients enrolled in the trial will be evaluated at baseline, 6, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months.

We will calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), which are calculated as incremental cost (mean cost for intervention group minus mean cost for control group) divided by incremental effectiveness (mean effect for intervention group minus mean effect for control group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) will be calculated in the same way. The only difference is that the effect will be the difference in QALYs. The incremental costs and incremental health effects will be modeled by generalized linear models (GLM). The modified Parks test will be used in order to select the appropriate family. In order to identify the correct link function we will compare model performance of all permutations of candidate link and variance function using different diagnostic tests such as the Pregibon Link test, the Hosmer-Lemoshow test and the Copas test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. We will check the intraclass correlation coefficients and the likelihood-ratio tests with health center, FP and both as we said before. If the clustering effect is relevant, we will use robust standard errors for the cluster indicated.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of uncertainty</title><p>To estimate the uncertainty around the ICER and ICUR, we will calculate 95% confidence intervals around the mean cost differences using the non-parametric confidence interval. Bootstrapping with 5000 replications will be performed on each imputed dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves</title><p>Bootstrapped cost effect pairs will then be plotted on cost effectiveness planes and used to estimate cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). In the cost-effectiveness planes the &#x02018;x&#x02019; axis represents the difference in effects and the &#x02018;y&#x02019; axis the difference in costs. CEACs show the probability that a treatment is cost effective at a specific ceiling ratio, which is the amount of money society is willing to pay to gain one extra unit of effect. Willingness to pay values will range from 0&#x020ac; to 100,000&#x020ac; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>A number of sensitivity analyses will be conducted in order to assess the robustness of the results. Among others, these analyses will include: modification of the unit cost of different values such as primary care physician visits or nurse practitioner; modification of discount rates (from 0% to 6% as NICE recommends); modification of the cost for absenteeism (using the mean salary instead of the minimum); and modification of the cost including loss of productivity by presenteeism.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The new intervention will be applied at patient level by the FPs in the intervention group. This intervention will be tailored to each patient based on his/her risk profile of depression (risk factors present) and his/her risk level (likelihood of becoming depressed at 12&#x000a0;months), and it will be built up from a total of 5 components, which may act both independently and interdependently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>]:</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Example of the mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of becoming depressed after the intervention to prevent the onset of depression by the family physician.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-244X-13-171-1"/></fig><p>1) <italic>Training workshop for family physicians in the intervention group</italic></p><p>A qualitative research study conducted prior to this RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] found that FPs were resistant to informing their patients about their risk of depression, and also raised doubts about the validity of the predictD risk algorithm. FPs said they had little training on prevention of depression, and expressed uncertainties about what they should advise their patients. They were also fearful about the possible distress that could result in patients being informed of their risk for depression and commented on the lack of time for these preventive activities. Accordingly, the FPs will receive a 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;hour training workshop during working hours in the new intervention. This will enable them: 1) to interpret and make a specific and global evaluation of the risk for depression for each patient; 2) to transmit this information to the patient in an understandable and comprehensible way, without causing alarm; 3) to undertake active listening to patients about their beliefs, expectations and impact on information transmitted; 4) to provide tailored advice for each patient depending on his/her set of modifiable risk factors for depression; 5) to be able to integrate and personalize advice to give each patient based on his/her health history, previous doctor-patient relationship and bio-psycho-family-social circumstances; 6) to support those patients excessively worried by the information given. In the workshop we will use role-playing and video comments in groups in order to discuss and practice with FPs how to deal with different situations. The educational units, that we will use, are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Annex 1. Previously, we will &#x0201c;train the trainers&#x0201d; to ensure that the training of the FPs will be performed to a minimum standard of quality and in standardized manner in each of the cities participating in the study.</p><p>2) <italic>Communicating the level and risk profile of depression</italic></p><p>How patients are informed about their risk of becoming ill (cardiovascular events, hip fractures&#x02026;) determines the outcome of prevention efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>]. In the same qualitative study as mentioned above, we found that primary care patients are pleased to be informed of their risk for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>]. Communicating with patients about their level and risk profile for depression is very new as until now there have been no validated risk algorithms to predict its onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This is also &#x0201c;<italic>the starting component</italic>&#x0201d;, which will activate the other components of the intervention. Each FP will receive (at baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months) a report with the information on risk from each of 24 patients not depressed at baseline (belonging to their usual patient list) who will be randomly selected and will provide informed consent to participate in the study. This report will include the likelihood of becoming depressed at 12&#x000a0;months and the patients&#x02019; responses to each of the risk factors included in the predictD-Spain equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. An example of a report of a patient who has 24.4% of becoming depressed at 12&#x000a0;months is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><p>If a patient has a moderate or high risk level (2nd or 3rd tertile), the FP will arrange an appointment with the patient aiming to communicate his/her risk of depression. If a patient has a low risk (1st tertile), the FP will have the option to report by telephone or face to face depending on the patient&#x02019;s preferences. If a visit is scheduled, this will last approximately 10&#x000a0;minutes. This process of transmitting risk information will be held at baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Reports will not include information about major depression diagnosis by CIDI at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months; although we will recommend that FPs screen for depression if the risk of depression was moderate or high at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. FPs will write down on the problem list (clinical chart) the label &#x0201c;<italic>predictD</italic>&#x0201d; in order to remind them on opening their clinical charts that patients are included in the program predictD to prevent depression. This will help to ensure that when patients see their FPs, regardless of the reason for the consultation, doctors will take into account the information on their risk of depression if applicable.</p><p>3) <italic>Building up a tailored bio-psycho-family-social intervention to prevent depression by family physicians</italic></p><p>Unlike psychosocial interventions developed to date to prevent depression, our intervention will be provided by FPs. With this approach we intend to draw on and integrate those usual components of primary care that could converge in the prevention of depression:</p><p>1. Previous knowledge and doctor-patient relationship: Family physician&#x02019;s commitment to the patient has no defined end point. This continuity of the relationship and attention over time helps FPs to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the health problems, illness behavior, coping style, cultural background, and family and social context of their patients. Moreover, most patients will develop trusting relationship with their FPs. Patients will feel free to expose personal aspects of their lives in order to receive help, and FPs will need less time to know and understand particular aspects of any situation.</p><p>1. Establishment of a basic psychotherapeutic relationship: Many patients already consider FPs to be their primary source of mental care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>], although many FPs are not aware of this. Patients expressed this idea when asked about who would be the most appropriate person to communicate their risk of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>]. An interview in which a FP tries to communicate adequately to the patient his/her level and risk profile of depression will encourage the patient to express his/her concerns about the circumstances and problems that, in his/her opinion, could precipitate depression. FPs will then actively listen and offer an emphatic response, gathering additional and relevant information where needed and giving any advice if appropriate. The patient and the FP could agree to schedule a new visit to continue talking about preventing depression, but the only mandatory visits that FPs will arrange are those to report the risk of depression at baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. These are not psychiatric interviews or formal psychotherapeutic interventions, but may give the opportunity for the patient to feel heard and understood from a cognitive and emotional standpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>]. It is also intended to help the patient to be activated and empowered.</p><p>1. Family-oriented practice: FPs often bring a family orientation to bear in their clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>]. It has been reported that there are up to 5 levels of family-centered medical care in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>]. We believe that the FP in our study are at the third level: FPs take an active interest in the feelings and concerns of the family in an empathic way. Family-oriented practice should be understood from the system theory, so that a change in any element of the family system could prevent depression in the patient. For example, a FP could help to improve the quality of life of a person who has the responsibility of caring for a relative with Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and this may prevent depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This is feasible because in Spain members of the same family usually share the same FP. Primary care patients think it is useful to involve the family and consider the family resources and the possibility of involving other family members in coping with the risk of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>].</p><p>1. Social prescribing and community referral by FPs: Many social and personal problems cannot be dealt with effectively by the FP and require community resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>]. The social dimension of the practice of primary care is the least accepted by FPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">105</xref>] and little is known about the effect on health of social prescribing and community referral by the FP. However, we will encourage FPs in the intervention group to become familiar with the community resources in their area. We will advise them on using centers. Moreover, we will advise them on using social prescribing in patients deemed appropriate with the aim of preventing depression. Primary care patients suggested participation in informal support groups to help them restructure their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>].</p><p>1. Management of physical problems: some physical problems are considered risk factors for depression, such as serious diseases (cancer, heart attack, stroke, &#x02026;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], disabling illness (blindness, deafness, arthritis, &#x02026;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and/or chronic health problems (diabetes, chronic pain, &#x02026;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, in our predictD studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] poor physical quality of life was an important predictor of depression, and FPs will receive this information in the patient&#x02019;s reports. Therefore, appropriate management of physical problems could also help prevent depression.</p><p>4) <italic>Offering a booklet to prevent depression</italic></p><p>At the first intervention visit, at baseline, FPs will give patients a brief booklet (a diptych) with advice for preventing depression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Annex 2).This booklet is based on the recommendations on health promotion and preventive activities of the " Spanish Family and Community Medicine Society", in its section on mental health (PAPPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>]. At the end of this booklet reference is made to three websites with information for patients and relatives about depression, anxiety and insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>].</p><p>5) <italic>Activating and empowering patients</italic></p><p>People have favorable attitudes and beliefs about prevention of depression that do not conflict with evidence-based programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>]. Activating and empowering patients to act on this knowledge might lead to an increased perception of self-efficacy, which is the gateway to changing attitudes and behavior to prevent depression. Primary care patients are in favor of receiving information about their risk for depression from their FP but seeking solutions themselves, with or without the help of the FP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>]. We will encourage FPs to invite patients to make suggestions during the interview on strategies, attitudes and behaviors they are already using to prevent depression. FPs will then positively reinforce those that in their opinion are the most appropriate to prevent depression for each patient.</p><sec><title>Explanatory model for the prevention of depression in primary care</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the theoretical model that integrates the five components of the intervention to prevent depression from primary care: There are patient&#x02019;s internal risk factors (sex, age, gene, personality, etc.) and external factors (threatening events) that can trigger an episode of major depression, depending on internal (coping style) and external (family and social support) resources that might be activated. Firstly, we introduce in the system &#x0201c;the training workshop&#x0201d; for FPs (<italic>component 1</italic>) to improve their knowledge, attitudes and skills to prevent depression with the new intervention. The FP usually has previous knowledge and a doctor-patient relationship (<italic>component 3.1</italic>) that generally predisposes toward a better intervention to prevent depression by both doctor and patient. We will give FPs risk information from patients, which they will use to communicate their level and profile of risk of depression (<italic>component 2</italic>). This is the &#x0201c;starting component&#x0201d; that will activate the rest of the components, creating a new doctor-patient interaction, whose essential element is the establishment of a basic psychotherapeutic relationship (<italic>component 3.2</italic>). The family-oriented practice (<italic>component 3.3</italic>), social prescribing and community referral (<italic>component 3.4</italic>), and management of physical problems (<italic>component 3.5</italic>) might be activated or not depending on the risk factors of depression involved in each patient, the FP&#x02019;s skills, and the patient&#x02019;s preferences. In all cases, FPs should provide the booklet to prevent depression (<italic>component 4</italic>), although the patient may or may not decide to use it. Finally, the FPs, taking into account the above components, will encourage their patients to speak about those strategies, attitudes and behavior they are already doing to prevent depression, in order to achieve their activation and empowerment (<italic>component 5</italic>). Thus, the patients can improve their perception of self-efficacy, which in turn promotes changes in attitudes and behaviors to prevent depression. There are also internal (sex, personality, psychosocial and preventive orientation, etc.) and external (work stress, team support, etc.) factors in the doctors that may influence their ability to conduct a successful intervention. The differences between interventions to prevent depression conducted so far in adults and the new intervention that we propose in primary care are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. An example of how the intervention can lead to a reduced risk for depression is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, and another example on the doctor-patient interview to prevent depression can be seen in a video (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Annex 3).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Explanatory model for the prevention of the onset of depression by family physicians.</bold> Component 1 (training of family physician) prepares the family physicians for the intervention and component 2 (communicating the level and risk profile of depression to the patient) initiates it. This leads to a new doctor-patient interaction, which triggers component 3 (building up a tailored bio-psycho-family-social intervention to prevent depression by family physicians) that activates and empowers the patient (component 5), and which increases the patient&#x02019;s perception of self-efficacy. This can also be achieved by component 4 (offering the patient the booklet) at the first doctor-patient interview.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-244X-13-171-2"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Differences between interventions to prevent the onset of depression evaluated so far in adults and the new intervention in primary care</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Characteristics</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Other interventions</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>New intervention</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Type of prevention</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Selective or indicated<sup>1</sup><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Universal</bold><sup>2</sup><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Orientation</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Psychosocial (cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal&#x02026;) or psychoeducational<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Biopsychosocial</bold> (primary care orientation) and based on level and risk profile of becoming depressed (<bold>personalized</bold>)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="center" valign="top"><bold>Type of intervention</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Formal (fixed rules)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Not formal (<bold>tailored rules</bold>)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Same number of sessions for all patients<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Minimum of three interviews but no maximum<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Same components for all patients<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Number of components involved tailored<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Who implements the intervention?</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Therapists or specialists in mental health (psychologist, psychiatric nurse&#x02026;)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Family physicians</bold><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Sample size</bold></td><td align="center">Small</td><td align="center"><bold>Large</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup> Patients with a specific risk of depression, high risk or subclinically depressed.</p><p><sup>2</sup> Patients with a low, moderate or high risk of depression.

The first one will be from a subjective focus. After each interview to inform patients about their risk of depression, the FPs will have to answer four questions: Have I written the label &#x0201c;predictD&#x0201d; in the clinical chart? (yes/no); what is my level of satisfaction with this interview to report the risk of depression? (5-Likert response options); would I change anything in this interview? (open answer); and observations (open answer). All patients will be asked about their overall satisfaction with their doctor (5-Likert response options); and only patients receiving the intervention will respond to the question &#x0201c;What is your level of satisfaction with the last interview in which your doctor informed you about your risk of depression?&#x0201d; (5-Likert-5 response options or &#x0201c;I was not informed&#x0201d;). The second is from an objective focus: we will review the clinical charts to confirm that FPs have included the label &#x0201c;predictD&#x0201d; on the problem list and we will also collect the number and content of visits related to the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Side effects of the intervention</title><p>It is possible that some patients will react with fear or worry when receiving information about their level and risk profile of depression, especially apprehensive patients or those that already have a high level of anxiety. If a patient does not want to receive this information he/she will not sign the consent and therefore will be excluded from the study. This will be valid for each evaluation point. As stated in component 5 of the intervention, we will train FPs to support those patients excessively worried by the information given. FPs are obliged to report any side effect that occurs during the intervention. We will also evaluate the impact of the predictD-CCRT intervention on anxiety symptoms through measurements of the PRIME-MD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] at each evaluation point of the follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>The intervention for the control group</title><p>Patients in the control group will receive &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d;; that is, the kind of care that FPs usually provide when they are unaware of the risk profile for depression in the patients. This means explicitly that the patients and FPs in the control groups will not be informed about the risk profile at any point. FPs in the control group will not receive the training workshop.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>FPs who do not meet exclusion criteria will be asked to sign an informed consent form before health centers are allocated to the control or intervention group. Once the health centers are randomly assigned to the control or intervention groups, selected patients who do not meet exclusion criteria in the health centers of the control group will be asked for consent to follow-up and in the intervention group to receive the intervention and to follow-up. In each health center a research assistant will ask participants to sign informed consent forms. In brief, participants in the intervention group will be informed about the purpose of the trial, the expected duration of their participation, trial procedures, foreseeable risks or inconveniences, expected benefits, whom to contact for further information, their rights as participants, and that their participation is voluntary and that they may refuse to participate or withdraw from the trial at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits. Since the identity of patients will not be known at the time when randomization of health centers is to be carried out, it will not be possible to seek their consent in advance of randomization. Nevertheless, FPs will provide consent to participate in the trial; moreover, none of them will be involved as a researcher in this study, so there should not in theory be a conflict of interest. In view of the fact that so far there is no evidence that the new intervention being evaluated in this study is effective, and given that it is generally the responsibility of FPs to put the medical interests of their patients above all other considerations, this may be an appropriate choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first RCT of universal primary prevention for depression in adults and the first to test a personalized intervention implemented by FPs. We will recruit a large sample of patients and will continue the follow-up for 18&#x000a0;months. We will use a structured interview (CIDI) to exclude patients with major depression at baseline and to assess the cumulative incidence of major depression during follow-up. However, our study also has several limitations.</p><p>The cluster randomization by health center will minimize possible contamination bias. However, some degree of contamination could happen, since health centers of both control and intervention arms are located in the same city. This bias will be against the hypothesis of the study. The cluster randomization might produce a good balance between groups (health center); however, this does not guarantee a good balance at other levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>] (FPs and patients). We will check at baseline the imbalance at the three levels and will adjust for it when appropriate. This and the adjustment at baseline for the likelihood of becoming depressed at 12&#x000a0;months will reduce our confounding bias.</p><p>As mentioned before, because we evaluate a psychosocial intervention, it is not possible for the FPs who provide it and patients that receive it to be blind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], so FPs and patients can change their behavior because they feel observed and included in the intervention group (Hawthorne bias). FPs of the control group could also change their behavior, but it is less likely in patients from this group because they will only give their informed consent for the follow-up.</p><p>If many health centers and FPs refuse to participate, we could encounter a selection bias as the FPs who choose to participate may have a different profile (psychosocial orientation, different training and work satisfaction, etc.) to those who do not. This could limit external validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>] and, from a pragmatic standpoint, the new intervention would be less effective when applied as a general program. Similar biases could occur if a large proportion of patients refuse to participate. It is not easy to obtain information from those physicians and patients who refuse to participate, so it will be difficult to ascertain the direction of this possible selection bias. As stated above, for the analyses with complete cases we will use the inverse probability weighting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>] to adjust for a possible attrition bias due to participants lost during the follow-up. We will use multiple imputations to minimize attrition bias and maintain statistical power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>].</p><p>The results obtained will be applicable to primary care attendees and cannot necessarily be generalized to other settings such as the general population. Nevertheless, primary care is an ideal setting for prevention and attendees are generally (because of health and social problems) at greater risk of depression than the general population.</p><p>If the predictD-CCRT intervention proves effective, it will be difficult to determine which of the 5 components are active or expendable, and how each interacts with the others. We will conduct a number of secondary analyses that could provide clues to the most relevant component, but more studies (quantitative and qualitative) specifically directed toward that goal will be needed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>FPs: Family physicians; FP: Family physician; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; CIDI: Composite international diagnostic interview; OR: Odds ratio; NNT: Number needed to treat; CSRI: Client Service Receipt Inventory; QUALYs: Quality adjusted life years; ICER: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; ICUR: Incremental cost-utility ratios; GLM: Generalized linear models; CEACs: Cost effectiveness acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors all declare they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JAB designed the predictD-CCRT study and the other authors collaborated in the design.
