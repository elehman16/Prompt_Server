Previous studies have demonstrated that phytoestrogens protect bone health through prevention of bone resorption, bone density augmentation, and promote fracture repair when used as bone graft material.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Due to vasodilatory effects of phytoestrogens, which are induced by nitric oxide production and also vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, they can increase the vascular ingrowth and return the blood flow to fracture gap and facilitate the fracture healing process.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] VEGF is an angiogenic factor which was evoked to the site of bone injury and stimulates angiogenesis, and thereby participates in new blood vessel formation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Chaste tree (<italic>vitex agnus castus</italic> (VAC)), known to be a good source of phytoestrogens,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] is aboriginal to central Asia and Mediterranean Europe.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It has a long history of use in traditional medicine and today there has been an increasing interest in the role of VAC in managing disorders. Recently, studies have reported that VAC prevents osteopenia and promotes fracture healing.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] But these studies were limited to animal models and, to the best of our knowledge, no data is available in humans.</p><p>On the other hand, nutritional treatment and supplementation with nutrients which incorporate in bone formation can be supportive in the fracture healing process. Magnesium (Mg), as a mineral which is involved in bone metabolism, mainly stores in bones.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Mg plays important roles in calcium and bone metabolism by regulating the release and action of parathyroid hormone and activation of vitamin D.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Moreover, it can directly affect bone mineralization.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In addition, a study has reported that serum level of Mg in elderly patients with long bone fracture is lower, compared to elderly patients without bone fracture.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Given the phytoestrogenic content of VAC, which is capable of repairing the bone defect, and the limited number of studies on the effects of Mg supplementation in fracture healing, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of VAC extract and Mg supplementation, alone and in combination, on osteogenic and angiogenic factors and callus formation in premenopausal women with long bone fracture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study subjects</title><p>In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, 64 women, 20 to 45 years old, with traumatic long bone fracture referred to Chamran or Rajaei Hospital at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were enrolled in the study from April to December 2012. According to study of Ozt&#x000fc;rk <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] the sample size was determined 16 for each group with a significant level of 0.05, power of 90%, &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> = 4 &#x000b1; 2.4, &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub> = 1.3 &#x000b1; 1.89 and also with considering a drop-out rate of 31.25%.</p><p>All of the patients were treated by surgery (open reduction internal fixation).

In order to perform a randomized study, we put 16 cards labeled different forms of A, B, C and D letters (for example ABCD, ACBD, ADBC, &#x02026;) in a box. Then randomly picked up a card and allocated 4 patients according to the A, B, C and D ranking of the card. Agnugol and magnesium tablets were obtained from Goldaru Pharmacy Company (Isfahan, Iran) and Nature Made Company (USA), respectively. Two types of placebo which were identical in shape and color of both Agnugol and magnesium tablets, contained lactose, starch and maintaining substances and were obtained from laboratory of School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The Daily Value (DV) of magnesium supplement in this study was 62.5%. Researchers monitored the compliance of the supplements biweekly by phone call and patient who did not take tablets more than six days were excluded from the study. At the beginning of the study, a questionnaire including age, fracture etiology, and the history of previous fracture as well as anatomical distribution of the fracture was completed for each patient during an interview. Participants were categorized into 3 groups according to their physical activity level; light (doing household tasks, riding in a car, light activity while sitting), moderate (walking 3-5 km/h, light sport, occasional agronomic or husbandry) and severe (severe sport, agronomic or husbandry).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Dietary intake</title><p>Nutritional intake was evaluated by a FFQ questionnaire that had been validated by the Department of Nutrition at School of Health and Nutrition, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

In this study, no relevant adverse effects were reported with patients in each group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The findings of our study showed that treatment with the combination of VAC extract and Mg supplementation enhance the serum concentration of osteogenic and angiogenic factors and increase callus formation during fracture healing. However, only the change in serum concentration of OCN was observed to be statistically significant.</p><p>The present evidences have revealed that serum markers of bone formation, including ALP and OCN, are increased after fracture and reflect osteoblast activity as well as callus integrity during bone repair.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that phytoestrogens affect both osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells. Genistein enhanced ALP activity[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and naringin, a flavonoid, induced bone cell activity and also in high concentration could enhance the ALP activity.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Although we observed a considerable increase in ALP activity in the VAC treated group, the ALP activity did not change by treatment with VAC + Mg. Previous studies have indicated various effects of phytoestrogens on serum ALP levels. A study by Ozt&#x000fc;rk <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] indicated that injection of 0.75 mg/day VAC extract for 3 weeks had no increasing effect on serum ALP activity in an experimental model of tibia fracture in rabbits. In contrast, Huh <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported a significant increase in the expression of mesenchymal progenitor including ALP after a two-week formononetin administration in rats with femur fracture. Another study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] revealed a significant induced osteoblast MG-63 cell activity as well as increased ALP activity by quercetin and kaempefrol induction. As a result of the present study and previous reports, phytoestrogens promote ALP activity but this effect may be dose dependent.</p><p>Mg is a mineral with a noticeable role in bone formation and several studies have reported that serum and bone concentration of ALP reduced in Mg deficiency.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, our results have shown that serum ALP did not change in the Mg treated group. Our result may be due in part to the dosage of Mg supplement.</p><p>In this study, the serum concentration of OCN significantly increased following an 8-week intervention with the combination of VAC extract and Mg compared to the baseline. This increase was also significantly higher than that of both VAC and placebo groups. Presumably, Mg has a substantial role in OCN improvement.</p><p>Osteocalcin, as a protein of extracellular matrix, participates in bone formation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Parallel to the expression of the OCN gene in the third stage of growth and differentiation of osteoblasts, the minerals accumulate in bone.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Therefore, we assume that OCN level and subsequently, bone mineralization are increased after Mg intake. In accordance, Aydin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have shown that short-term oral Mg supplementation caused a significant increase in OCN levels on the 10th day of the intervention in postmenopausal women when compared with the controls and stayed significantly high at the end of 30 days.</p><p>Besides, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] has shown that formononetin, a phytoestrogen isolated from <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic>, markedly increases the expression of ALP and OCN in human normal osteoblasts. Furthermore, Icariin enhanced OCN secretion in a dose-dependent manner in mesenchymal stem cells.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Although our results in the VAC group did not show a consistent change in OCN level in contrast to those of the above-mentioned studies, However, administration of VAC + Mg synergistically and significantly elevated the OCN level.</p><p>Treatment with VAC + Mg and also single VAC raised the serum level of VEGF. It has been revealed that a positive correlation between phytoestrogen and VEGF exists. Our findings were consistent with this evidence that phytoestrogens, through enhancing VEGF expression, induce vascular invasion in fracture gap and enhance angiogenesis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Angiogenesis with a main role in endochondral ossification and forming vascular osseous tissue can be crucial in repairing and regeneration of bone.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In this regard, Huh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] designed an experimental model of femur fracture, evaluated the effects of formononetin, and reported a significant increase in the number of vessels, expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGF-R2) in the early stage of chondrogenesis. In another study, Chen <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] established an ulnar bone defect model in rabbits and concluded that implanted scaffold containing Icaritin phytomolecule (an intestinal metabolite of epimedium-derived flavonoids) demonstrated new vessel ingrowth in bone defect at the second week of intervention and even more new vessels at the end of the trial.</p><p>Our study and other related work suggest that in a short-period of treatment, phytoestrogens exert an appropriate effect in vascular ingrowth and thereby promote early stage of fracture healing. In the present study, VEGF was significantly increased in the VAC group compared with the baseline. Despite the greater increase in the variation of mean VEGF in the VAC + Mg group, this elevation was not significant. This was likely due to outliers.</p><p>Our results did not show a considerable effect of Mg in serum concentration of VEGF. We also could not find any documented evidence about this effect.</p><p>Radiological appearance results showed that callus formation was 80% in the VAC + Mg group. A similar study by Ozt&#x000fc;rk <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] revealed that VAC extract significantly accelerates fracture healing on the seventh day after surgery of tibia fracture in rabbits. This observation is consistent with the results of the present study, which shows 71.4% callus formation in the VAC-treated group compared with placebo (53.8%). However, this difference was not significant.</p><p>Several studies have reported a positive correlation between dietary or supplemental Mg intake and bone mineral density. A significantly increased Mg concentration has also been reported in tibias of rats fed a diet with 10-fold increased Mg content than standard.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Another study by Janning <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] revealed that implantation of compressed cylinders of pure Mg (OH)<sub>2</sub> into rabbit femur condyles increased bone volume at the end of a 4-week intervention. In the study of Janning <italic>et al</italic>., direct presence of Mg created an alkaline environment near the bone defect and facilitated bone formation.</p><p>In the present study, single Mg treatment could not change the percentage of callus formation compared with placebo. However, Mg in combination with VAC extract had a synergistic positive effect in bone repair. In our study, the dose of the administered Mg supplement was lower than the recommended dietary allowance. Increasing the Mg dosage or continuing supplementation to late stages of healing may reveal better outcome and exhibit the absolute effect of Mg.</p><p>In this study, there were no significant differences between the four study groups in callus formation. Possibly, the statistical test could not show significant differences due to low sample size.</p><p>The limitations of our study were high number of patients lost to follow up, so unequal and small sample size in subgroups affected the power of recognition of significant differences between groups. Also, the dose of magnesium in this study was lower than RDA, so we recommend the higher dose of magnesium supplementation in other studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, administration of VAC + Mg may synergistically improve fracture healing by increased OCN and VEGF levels and callus formation. We hypothesize that even a single treatment of phytoestrogens in a short time after fracture may facilitate the process of bone repair, however, further studies need to investigate the role of single treatment of Mg in bone healing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The present article was extracted from the thesis written by Zahra Hassanzadeh Rostami and was financially supported by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences grants No. 91-6235.
