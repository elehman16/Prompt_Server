Physical activity can improve these deficits, but whether CKD attenuates the benefits is unknown. Our objective was to determine if CKD modified the effect of a physical activity intervention in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">This is an exploratory analysis of the LIFE-P study, which compared a 12-month physical activity program (PA) to a successful aging education program (SA) in older adults. CKD was defined as a baseline eGFR &#x0003c; 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. We examined the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events (SAE) and adherence to intervention frequency. Linear mixed models were adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, CKD, intervention, site, visit, baseline SPPB, and interactions of intervention and visit and of intervention, visit, and baseline CKD.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">The sample included 368 participants.

Several factors likely contribute to this phenomenon. CKD complications include anemia [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], vitamin D deficiency [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], all of which can adversely affect the musculoskeletal system. Older age is associated with sarcopenia, a condition of reduced muscle mass and quality. On a molecular level, the myostatin protein, which represses skeletal muscle growth, is upregulated in age [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and CKD [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Prior studies demonstrated that muscle atrophy increases as kidney function decreases [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Physical activity improves physical function in other populations of older adults with chronic conditions [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; prior studies of physical activity in older adults with CKD have been fairly modest in sample size [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Taking data from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P) Study, a 12-month randomized controlled trial of supervised physical activity in over 400 older adults, we performed a post-hoc analysis to examine if CKD affected potential changes in physical function. For our primary outcome, we compared changes in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores, which measures general physical function. For secondary outcomes, we examined the occurrence of serious adverse events and adherence to the intervention, as both will be key for successful implementation of physical activity interventions in individuals with CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S6"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Study design</title><p id="P7">The LIFE-P study was a single-blind multi-center randomized controlled trial (Cooper Institute, Dallas, TX; Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; and Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC), comparing the efficacy of a 12-month physical activity intervention (PA) to a successful aging health education program (SA) on the incidence of mobility disability in functionally limited older adults [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

In older adults with CKD, the improvements were no different when compared to the changes seen in older adults with normal kidney function. Notably, this was in the context of somewhat lower rates of intervention adherence among the CKD participants. During the study, there were no differences in the number of adverse events occurring in CKD and non-CKD participants.</p><p id="P22">The study showed that physical activity improved SPPB scores with CKD, an overall measure of physical function in older adults [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. SPPB scores increased by 1.27 points, a clinically meaningful change; the minimum clinical important difference for the SPPB is 0.5 points [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results complement prior research on functional performance in CKD patients. In a study of 29 men with Stage 3 to 4 CKD, 12 weeks of physical activity improved sit to stand times, compared to a control group [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, another study of 16 older adults with Stage 4 CKD demonstrated that 12 weeks of physical activity also improved performance on the &#x02018;Get Up and Go&#x02019; test [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Six months of physical activity improved performance on the 30 second &#x02018;Sit-to-Stand&#x02019; test in 47 persons with CKD [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Four studies demonstrated that a physical activity intervention of 12 or more weeks improved performance on the six meter walk test in CKD patients [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="P23">Our study adds to the literature in several ways. First, CKD is highly prevalent in older adults, but the majority of prior studies regarding physical activity in CKD have not focused on this population. Only older persons were eligible, making our study more reflective of the general patient population. Second, compared to the prior studies on physical activity in persons with CKD, our study was larger in size and had a diverse study population with over 18% African-Americans. Inclusion of African-Americans is important, as they are more likely to have severe CKD [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and are more vulnerable to losses in physical function [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Finally, the intervention was home-based during the second half of the study. The majority of previous studies utilized a physical activity intervention that was highly supervised and usually required attendance at the study site. Our results therefore suggest that less supervised forms of physical activity may still be beneficial in those with CKD.</p><p id="P24">There were no statistically significant differences in CKD status for serious adverse events. A study with 72 CKD patients testing a 12-month program of physical activity found similar findings [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, a study of CKD, dialysis, and kidney transplant patients also found that physical activity did not impact the number of adverse events [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To date, 11 trials of physical activity have been conducted in CKD patients; none have reported a notable increase in serious adverse events with the interventions groups. Coupled with our data, the evidence suggests that physical activity is likely safe for older adults with CKD.</p><p id="P25">Regarding adherence, this is one of the largest studies to focus on this aspect of physical activity. Two modest studies of center-based physical activity in CKD patients found overall attendance rates of 80 to 84% [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for a 12-month intervention, while another study of 72 patients demonstrated a mean attendance rate of 70% for eight weeks of center-based physical activity [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Preliminary data from an ongoing clinical trial of physical activity in older adults with CKD found intervention adherence was 76% [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, attendance rates were consistently lower in CKD patients and statistically significant for CKD participants in PA during the last six months of the study. This finding of lower attendance for CKD participants suggests that the reduced adherence may be linked to CKD itself. Although there has been little research comparing study adherence rates of those with and without CKD, one possible reason for the disparity may be the increased co-morbidity burden of those with CKD, translating into a higher risk of developing illness [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Poor kidney function is often associated with fatigue and reduced endurance. A qualitative study found CKD patients often experienced exhaustion [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and others have shown that scores on the vitality/ energy domain of the Short Form-36 decreased as eGFR declined [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, the difference in attendance rates was greatest during the last six months of the study when intervention transitioned to a home-based program and the in-center sessions became optional. A fatigued person is less likely to attend an optional session. Of note, attendance dropped for participants with CKD and without CKD, suggesting there are other factors not related to CKD that underlie attendance. This global decrease in attendance during the last half of the study likely impacted the 12-month follow-up SPPB scores, which were lower than the 6-month follow-up SPPB scores for both participants with CKD and without CKD.</p><p id="P26">The results from this exploratory study suggest that physical activity is likely safe and beneficial for older adults with CKD. This occurred despite lower adherence rates and potential catabolic effects of CKD on muscle, suggesting that skeletal muscle in older adults remains resilient. Clinically, older adults with CKD should be encouraged to undertake physical activity despite their greater comorbidity burden. In addition to the potential benefits on function, endurance and strength, physical activity can reduce the likelihood of mobility problems [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], disability, and even mortality. In a study of patients with end stage renal disease, each additional ten minutes of physical activity a day was associated with a 22% reduction in risk of death [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, regular physical activity is linked with quality of life; one study demonstrated that three months of physical activity improved energy levels and sleep quality as measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p id="P27">There are several strengths of this work. First, this is the largest study to date of examining the impact of physical activity in older adults with CKD. Second, the intervention was for 12 months while many other studies of physical activity in CKD patients have been for shorter duration. Third, our study specifically examined adherence and the safety of the physical activity intervention, which is needed to determine the feasibility of physical activity on a large scale for older adults with CKD.</p><p id="P28">Several limitations should be noted. The study was exploratory in nature and a post-hoc analysis; thus, this study had limited power to detect changes in our outcome of interest. Regarding the modest sample size, the LIFE-P cohort was a pilot study for a larger trial, which has now completed [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, we chose not to utilize the data of the larger trial as it was longer in duration (mean follow-up time 2.6 years versus 1.2 years for our study), likely magnifying the impact of competing risks. Most of the CKD participants had Stage 3 or moderate CKD while only a modest fraction of the sample (25.7%) had Stage 4 or severe CKD. As eGFR worsens, physical function declines [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], likely in part due to the increased degree of skeletal muscle catabolism from uremia [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, an intervention that is effective for an older person with Stage 3 may not be effective for a person with stage 5 CKD. Those with worse CKD may require a physical activity intervention that is different in amount or intensity to compensate for the uremia-related muscle loss. We lacked measurements of albuminuria and cystatin C, which improve the kidney function assessment. Cystatin C has been particularly shown to improve eGFR assessment in older adults, especially in those with low muscle mass [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, as study eligibility required participants to have some physical limitations at baseline, low muscle mass was likely in these individuals, suggesting the severity of CKD in our sample may have actually been greater than we were able to assess.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S21"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P29">Twelve months of physical activity resulted in physical function improvements compared to a successful aging educational program in older adults with CKD; the effects were no different from those observed in older adults with normal kidney function. Although our study was exploratory, the results suggest that physical activity is likely an effective and safe modality for this population, and older adults with CKD should be encouraged to undertake regular physical activity. Next steps will focus on determining whether the benefits of physical activity persist over time and confirming our results using data from the subsequent full LIFE trial. Future directions will explore ways to encourage and implement programs of regular physical activity in older adults with CKD to improve function and quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental file</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS923429-supplement-Supplemental_file.doc" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e553" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><p id="P30">We would like to thank Janet Seo for her editorial assistance in the preparation of the manuscript, and the participants of the LIFE-P study, whose time and effort made this research possible.</p><p id="P31"><bold>Funding Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="P32">The LIFE-P study was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Aging Cooperative Agreement (U01AG22376) and sponsored in part by the Intramural Research Program, National Institute for Aging, and National Institutes of Health.
