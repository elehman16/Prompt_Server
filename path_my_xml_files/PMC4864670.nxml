All patients received injection glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg, injection ondansetron 0.08 mg/kg and injection midazolam 0.02 mg/kg intravenously.</p><p>The study medication [Dexmedetomidine 200 &#x000b5;g (2 ml) in 48 ml of normal saline means 4 &#x000b5;g/ml] was prepared.

Initial bolus infusion of study medication (dexmedetomidine 1 &#x000b5;g/kg) over 10 min. Patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen with facemask.

After confirming adequacy of ventilation, injection succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg was administered and intubated with adequate size cuffed endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>O in 40:60 proportion with sevoflurane to maintain the HR and BP within 20% of the baseline value. Muscle relaxation was maintained with injection vecuronium bromide, loading dose of 0.08 mg/kg and intermittent top-ups of 0.02 mg/kg as and when required. Patients in Group A, received dexmedetomidine infusion at the dose of 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/h intraoperatively, while patients in Group B, were given normal saline at the respectively comparable rate. Patients were ventilated with an initial tidal volume of 6&#x02013;8 ml/kg and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min, which was later adjusted to keep the EtCO<sub>2</sub> within 35&#x02013;40 mm of Hg. Intraabdominal pressure was maintained below 14 mmHg. Fentanyl (0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg) top-ups were given to keep the MAP within 20% of baseline.

The studies with higher infusion rates had more incidences of adverse effects like hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Bakhamees <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] studied the effects of dexmedetomidine in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass. They gave dexmedetomidine infusion (0.4 &#x000b5;g/kg/h) in one group and normal saline infusion (0.4 &#x000b5;g/kg/h) in other group throughout the surgery and compared the hemodynamics. They found that patients who received dexmedetomidine showed significant decrease of intraoperative and postoperative mean BP and HR. The observations made in both these studies are similar to our study findings in providing perioperative hemodynamic stability.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Emergence from anesthetic effects and extubation are equally crucial as is laryngoscopy, intubation, and surgical period. Dexmedetomidine enables a smooth transition from the time of administration of reversal to the postextubation phase by suppressing the central nervous system sympathetic activity, leading to high quality of extubation with minimum hemodynamic changes, as we observed in majority of our patients in dexmedetomidine group. Similar results have also been observed in other studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, in Group A during extubation the mean HR (84.40 &#x000b1; 4.38/min), MAP (90.41 &#x000b1; 6.01 mmHg) were noted and compared with control group which were: The mean HR (101.97 &#x000b1; 4.06/min), MAP (105.82 &#x000b1; 4.06 mmHg). Above data suggest that hemodynamics were much more stable in Group A than control group during extubation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Statistically there was significant difference found when compared in both the groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Recovery from anesthesia</title><p>We also observed that the time for extubation and time to respond to oral commands were was similar in both the groups. There was no statistically significant difference in both the groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) as dexmedetomidine does not seem to have significant respiratory depression property. There was no fall in oxygen saturation parameter noticed in both the groups in our study finding.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Postextubation period</title><p>It was observed that, those patients who received dexmedetomidine infusion in the intraoperative period had HR, MAP on the lower side as compared to that of control group which received normal saline infusion in immediate postoperative period. The difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>In our study, fentanyl top-ups of 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg were given intraoperatively whenever required to keep mean BP within 20% of baseline value. Thus those patients who received dexmedetomidine infusion has lesser requirement of fentanyl and the hemodynamics were much more stable than control group.</p><p>The findings of our study are in agreement with the findings of various investigators in that dexmedetomidine infusion intraoperatively is an effective agent to reduce the hemodynamic fluctuations associated with laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>We have observed that there is more requirement of fentanyl top-ups in control group, which could have led to postoperative nausea and vomiting incidences in control group (13.3%). There was not a single patient with postoperative nausea and vomiting in Group A.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Pneumoperitoneum required for laparoscopic surgery results in multiple hemodynamic changes due to raised intraabdominal pressure. Pneumoperitoneum leads to increase in arterial pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances and a decrease in cardiac output. Both mechanical (increased intraabdominal pressure) and humoral factors contribute to these adverse cardiovascular changes.</p><p>We have used injection dexmedetomidine to evaluate its effect on hemodynamic parameters in laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients during perioperative period.</p><p>We observed that there is not significant rise in HR, mean BP.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There is no difference from emergence of anesthesia in both the groups and the incidence of nausea-vomiting in postoperative period was less in the Group A compared to Group B.</p><p>In another studies, an infusion of dexmedetomidine at the rate of 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/h 30 min before induction and 0.6 &#x000b5;g/kg/h thereafter until the end of surgery leads to better recovery of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>We conclude from this study that, dexmedetomidine IV infusion in the loading dose of 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg over 10 min. and subsequent maintenance infusion over the range of 0.4&#x02013;0.7 &#x000b5;g/kg/h provides perioperative hemodynamic stability in ASA I/II Class patients during laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of their sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, and sympatholytic properties.</p><p>It also affords added advantage of reduction in postoperative complications such as nausea-vomiting. However further study is required to evaluate its effect on hemodynamic parameters in high risk group patients with compromised cardio-respiratory function undergoing laparoscopic surgical procedures.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Dr. H.
