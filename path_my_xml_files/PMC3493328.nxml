Approval was based on results from a 24-week, randomized, double-blind study of patients who were stable on donepezil 10&#x02009;mg/day and randomized 2:1 to either increase their donepezil dose to 23&#x02009;mg/day or continue taking 10&#x02009;mg/day. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day in patients with moderate to severe AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients who completed the double-blind study and were eligible could enroll into a 12-month extension study of open-label donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day. Clinic visits took place at open-label baseline and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Safety analyses comprised examination of the incidence, severity, and timing of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs); changes in weight, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and laboratory parameters; and discontinuation due to AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>915 double-blind study completers were enrolled in the open-label extension study and 902 comprised the safety population. Mean treatment duration in this study was 10.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.5&#x02009;months. In total, 674 patients (74.7%) reported at least one AE; in 320 of these patients (47.5%) at least one AE was considered to be possibly or probably study drug related. The majority of patients reporting AEs (81.9%) had AEs of mild or moderate severity. There were 268 patients (29.7%) who discontinued early, of which 123 (13.6%) were due to AEs.</p><p>Patients increasing donepezil dose from 10&#x02009;mg/day in the double-blind study to 23&#x02009;mg/day in the extension study had slightly higher rates of AEs and SAEs than patients who were already receiving 23&#x02009;mg (78.0% and 16.9% vs 72.8% and 14.0%, respectively). The incidence of new AEs declined rapidly after the first 2&#x02009;weeks and remained low throughout the duration of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that long-term treatment with donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day is associated with no new safety signals. The elevated incidence of AEs in patients increasing the dose of donepezil from 10&#x02009;mg/day to 23&#x02009;mg/day was limited to the initial weeks of the study.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Donepezil 23&#x02009;mg</kwd><kwd>Donepezil</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Tolerability</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive impairment of cognitive and functional capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Current treatments, which provide symptomatic benefits, include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil hydrochloride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and memantine, a glutamate receptor antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Despite optimal use of these therapies, symptomatic improvement is limited in magnitude and duration, after which patients continue to decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>To address this clear medical need for more effective symptomatic therapy, a higher dose formulation of donepezil HCl (23&#x02009;mg/day) was developed. The 23-mg dose is formulated as a matrix-type tablet, which provides a more gradual systemic absorption and longer time to maximum concentration compared with immediate release formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Briefly, the study included males and females aged 45&#x02013;90&#x02009;years with a diagnosis of probable dementia of the Alzheimer&#x02019;s type based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke &#x02013; Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (code 290.00 or 290.10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; a Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) score of 0&#x02013;20 (moderate to severe impairment); a severe impairment battery (SIB) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;90 at baseline and screening; a Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;12; and who were otherwise physically healthy. Patients had previously received donepezil 10&#x02009;mg/day once daily for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x02009;weeks. Memantine&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;20&#x02009;mg/day was permitted if the dose had been stable for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3&#x02009;months. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a high-dose donepezil tablet (23&#x02009;mg once daily) or to remain on donepezil 10&#x02009;mg/day.</p><p>Patients completing the double-blind study were eligible to enter the 12-month extension study if they had a competent caregiver, provided informed consent, and were without the following exclusion criteria: ongoing serious AEs (SAEs); a history of SAEs related to the study drug during the double-blind study; and no more than 3&#x02009;days elapsed since completing the double-blind study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a 12-month open-label extension (ClinicalTrials.gov trial number NCT00566501) of the 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. During the extension, all patients received donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day irrespective of the dose received during the double-blind phase. Clinic visits took place at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x02009;months.</p><p>The protocol, all applicable amendments, and the informed consent form were approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB). All participants provided informed consent before entering the open-label extension study.

Treatment-emergent AEs (defined as events occurring after first dose of study drug in the extension study, or which began during the double-blind study and increased in severity during the extension study), serious AEs, and concomitant medication were recorded throughout the study. The investigator assessed AEs for severity (mild, moderate, severe) and possible or probable attribution to study drug. Vital signs, weight, and standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded, blood and urine samples were taken for clinical laboratory tests, and physical and neurological examinations were performed at each visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics and data analysis</title><p>Safety was analyzed for the safety population, which consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day during the extension study and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.</p><p>In addition, two patient subgroups were defined for the extension study according to whether patients had received donepezil 10&#x02009;mg/day or donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day during the double-blind phase. These groups were designated the 10&#x02013;23 subgroup and the 23&#x02013;23 subgroup, respectively.</p><p>All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 11.1. The numbers (percentages) of patients with at least one AE, at least one SAE, and at least one AE leading to discontinuation were summarized. AEs were summarized by preferred term, severity, and relationship to treatment; SAEs were summarized by preferred term and relationship to treatment. Deaths were evaluated for possible relationship to study drug.

No safety signals that had not been observed with donepezil 23&#x02009;mg in the double-blind study were observed in this extension study, and no worsening of tolerability was observed during treatment with 23&#x02009;mg for up to a further 12&#x02009;months among patients who had already taken donepezil 23&#x02009;mg for the prior 6&#x02009;months. AEs that occurred most frequently were those that may be associated with AD itself, such as weight loss, falls, or agitation, and AEs typically associated with administration of cholinesterase inhibitors, such as gastrointestinal symptoms. Over 80% of all AEs were mild to moderate in severity and the rate of SAEs was similar to that observed in the double-blind study.</p><p>Weight loss was the most commonly observed AE over the course of the extension trial. In the absence of a control group, it is not possible to attribute this to study drug based on the findings from this study. Anorexia and weight loss are important considerations in AD patients, given their association with mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The effect of donepezil on the body weight of AD patients has been studied in numerous trials and has been found to be similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (a total of 7&#x02013;9% of donepezil- and 6&#x02013;8% of placebo-treated patients experienced clinically significant weight loss [&#x02265; 7% from baseline] in representative studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The larger percentage noted in this study is likely due to the longer period of observation compared with most other studies, though it may also be related to the higher dose of donepezil and the severity of illness in this patient population. Weight loss is a concern in this population and should be monitored closely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Bradycardia and GI bleeding are potentially serious AEs that have been associated with cholinesterase inhibitors. The rates of these AEs were very low in the extension study (1.2% and 0.8%, respectively). All cases of bradycardia resolved; one patient died of GI bleeding that was attributed to study drug. There was no notable difference in incidence of GI bleeding between the group continuing on 23&#x02009;mg from the double-blind study and the group initiating 23&#x02009;mg in this open-label study (0.9% and 0.6%, respectively), nor was the incidence different than that observed in the 23&#x02009;mg group in the double-blind study (12/963 [1.1%]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, the fatality due to GI bleeding occurred in a patient who initiated 23&#x02009;mg in this open-label study. Thus, it appears that the risk of GI bleeding in patients receiving donepezil 23&#x02009;mg does not increase in incidence or severity over a longer duration of treatment with 23&#x02009;mg.</p><p>Overall mortality in this 1-year study was 2.1%, consistent with that observed in the 6-month double-blind study (0.9%) and with the expected mortality in this population of elderly patients with moderate or severe AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Over the course of the study, 13.6% of patients discontinued due to AEs, including 17.5% of patients in the 10&#x02013;23 subgroup and 11.4% of the patients in the 23&#x02013;23 subgroup. This difference in rates of discontinuation appears to be attributed primarily to the transient increase in cholinergic-related gastrointestinal AEs (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia) in the 10&#x02013;23 subgroup due to titration to the higher dose. This pattern was documented in the initial double-blind study, where 18.8% and 7.9% of patients discontinued in the donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day and 10&#x02009;mg/day subgroups, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and is consistent with other studies with a dose increase from donepezil 5&#x02009;mg/day to 10&#x02009;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An increase in cholinergic AEs has been widely observed with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors when patients are titrated from a lower to a higher dose regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. After the initial peak, the likelihood of experiencing a GI-related AE for the first time during the study was low and similar in both subgroups. Strategies to manage AEs when increasing donepezil dose to 23&#x02009;mg/day should be familiar to healthcare providers already treating patients with standard donepezil dosing regimens, and implementation of such strategies may reduce the incidence of early discontinuation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This 1-year extension study of donepezil 23&#x02009;mg/day in patients with moderate or severe AD demonstrated no new safety findings and provides evidence for the acceptable long-term tolerability of this dosage option.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AD: Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; AE: Adverse event; MMSE: Mini-Mental State Evaluation; SIB: Severe impairment battery; SAE: Serious adverse event.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Pierre Tariot has received consulting fees from Acadia, AC Immune, Allergan, Baxter Healthcare Corp., Eisai, Inc., Epix Pharmaceuticals, Forest Laboratories, Medavante, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, Schering-Plough, and Worldwide Clinical Trials; consulting fees and research support from Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Avid, Bristol Myers Squibb, Elan, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Medivation, Merck, Pfizer Inc., Toyama, and Wyeth Laboratories; research support only from Baxter Healthcare Corp., and GE, and other research support from NIA, NIMH, Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association, Arizona Department of Health Services, and the Institute for Mental Health Research.
