Chlorohexidine is cationic bis-biguanide broad spectrum antiseptic with both anti-plaque and antibacterial properties. It has side-effects like brownish discoloration of teeth and dorsum of the tongue, taste perturbation, oral mucosal ulceration, etc. To compare the antiplaque efficacy of herbal and chlorohexidine gluconate mouthwash.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A double-blinded parallel, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in the Department of Periodontics, MNR Dental College. Totally 100 preclinical dental students were randomized into three groups (0.2% chlorohexidine, Saline and herbal mouthwash). All the groups were made to refrain from their regular mechanical oral hygiene measures and were asked to rinse with given respective mouthwashes for 4 days.

The mechanical plaque control involves tooth brushing either using a manual brush,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> motorized tooth brush or with the help of pressurized water pump system involving the use of water under pressure pumped through fine blunt needle or nozzle (irrigation both sub gingival and supragingival irrigation).</p><p>The chemical control of plaque includes organic or inorganic chemicals, which inhibit the accumulation, growth and survival of microbiota and debris. The main advantage of chemicals and their action depends on increased concentration in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which improves gingival health.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A variety of products are available chemical plaque control, which are divided into first generation (e.g., phenols, quaternary ammonium compounds), second generation (e.g., bisbiguanides-chlorhexidine gluconate [CHXG]), third generation (e.g. delmopinol).<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> CHXG is widely used with concentration of as mouth rinse.

It was an examiner blind, parallel designed clinical trial conducted on students of the college with each group having 50 students. Institutional Ethical Committee clearance and informed consent was taken was taken from all the participants before commencement of the study.</p><p>Based on the analysis of plaque re-growth studies, gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) index score differences were analyzed in three samples for which 150 students were included to provide sufficient sample size for detection. Materials used were chlorhexidine mouthwash (Rexidine, Warren Group, India), herbal mouthwash (Hiora, Himalaya, India), Saline, dispensing bottles, measuring cups and disclosing agent (Alphaplacr, DPI, India), scalars and polishing cups. Indices recorded were GI<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> on all teeth except third molars with four sites per tooth-mesial, distal, facial/buccal and palatal/lingual and PI.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Systematically healthy subjects with GI&#x0003c;1, at the time of examination, presence of 20 teeth with minimum of 5 teeth were enrolled in the study. Subjects with severe mal-aligned teeth, orthodontic appliances, fixed partial denture, removable partial denture, tobacco chewers, smokers and those individuals medically compromised were excluded. Study design: At the beginning of the study the GI and PI scores were recorded in order to assess the oral hygiene status of the subjects. All the recordings were done by the same examiner, the baseline scores were brought down near to 0 by supragingival scaling and polishing and it was confirmed with the of disclosing agent (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Intra oral photographs were taken. Subjects were randomly allocated via simple random sampling technique (lottery method) to the three groups and were asked to refrain from mechanical plaque control (tooth brushing and flossing) but to rinse with mouthwashes as per prescribed therapeutic dose for 5 days. 10 ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine, 5 ml of Hiora and Saline were assigned to Group A, Group B, Group C respectively for rinsing twice daily for 1 min for 5 days. GI and PI scores were recorded by same examiner who was unaware of the mouthwashes, on the 6<sup>th</sup> day. Statistical comparison of GI and PI scores was done post rinsing for all the three groups by ANOVA and Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test using disclosing agent for PI. Side effects were evaluated from all the subjects by means of a questionnaire and clinical examination. Questionnaire included yes/no for pain, burning sensation, pruritus, dryness of mouth, taste disturbance, discoloration of teeth, feeling of bitter taste in mouth. The subjects were asked to evaluate the severity of side effects by rating them as mild, moderate or severe. With respect to taste disturbance, subjects were asked to specify which taste (salt, sour, bitter, sweet) had altered in perception.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In clinical evaluation, the severity of soft tissue irritation, rated as none, change in color, desquamation or presence of aphthae. Discolorations were recorded as absent/present and if present, further classified as mild, moderate or severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Photographs were taken of those who showed staining of teeth at the end of the study and thorough scaling and polishing was done for them.

Oral rinses with herbal composition are used in periodontal therapy to control plaque and inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 4</xref>). According to Dalirsani <italic>et al.</italic>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Anupama <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> herbal mouth wash have advantages such as decreased side-effects and more economical when compared to chlorhexidine. (Nagavalli <italic>Piper betle</italic>) shows anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial properties. Pilu (<italic>Salvadora persica</italic>) shows anti-oxidant activity, it has peppermint that contains menthol, which activates cold sensitive TRPM8 receptors in mucosa and it is also used as primary agent in toothpastes and chewing gums, peppermint in Wikipedia). Here an attempt was made to use herbal mouth wash (Hiora) and study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of herbal mouth wash containing pilu (<italic>S. persica</italic>), bibhitaka (<italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic>), Nagavalli, ela (cardamom), pipperment satva, bellenic myrobalan (vibhitaki compared to chlorhexidine digluconate). Chlorhexidine was developed in 1950, which is considered as gold standard<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> till date and most anti plaque agent. However the long-term use of chlorhexidine is limited by altered taste perception and staining of tooth with prolonged usage, as reported by Fardal and Turnbull.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> To overcome the limitation of chlorhexidine usage, herbal mouthwash was advocated to the patients and the plaque gingival diseases are measured. The results of the present study showed there was no significant difference in pre rinsing scores of 3 groups there was no significant difference in mean age of subjects in all three groups indicating homogenous distribution. Mean GI and PI scores at the post rinsing stage were least for the group A, followed by Group B and Group C. In all the three groups&#x02019; reformation of plaque was evident in all individuals within 24 h after thorough oral prophylaxis by self-evaluation patient and same reported in the questionnaire given. Because of its effervescent property could have better access into the interproximal areas and embrasures where the plaque could be thin and incompletely organized. A major drawback of chlorhexidine was staining of tongue. The antiplaque efficacy of CHXG was attributed by the retention of the compound CHXG in the oral cavity and its slow release.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Although the effect of the plaque re growth and gingival inflammation observed with CHXG was superior to herbal mouthwash, the latter did not exhibit any other side effects. The similar antiplaque activity was observed as the post rinsing PI and GI scores showed no significant difference statistically. In contrast to this study Almas <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> conducted a study antimicrobial activity of about eight mouthwashes and concluded that mouthwash containing CHXG were with maximum antibacterial activity and mouthwash with miswak extract containing CHXG were with maximum antibacterial activity and mouthwash with miswak extract (pilu) with low antibacterial activity. In accordance with our study Scherer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> compared herbal mouthwash and water and concluded that herbal mouthwash has better efficacy when compared to normal distilled water. Within limitations of the study, such as insufficient period of time to evaluate the anti-gingivitis property of herbal mouthwash as the 4 day plaque model was considered and further are directed towards anti-plaque, and gingivitis efficacy of herbal mouthwash.
