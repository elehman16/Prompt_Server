PROs included the Short Form-36, EuroQol 5-D, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGA), patient's assessment of pain, duration of morning joint stiffness (MJS) and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Rheumatoid Arthritis. Treatment comparisons were performed with logistic regression for categorical measures or analysis of covariance for continuous variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>527 patients were randomised (placebo, 176; baricitinib 2&#x02005;mg, 174; baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg, 177). Both baricitinib-treated groups showed statistically significant improvements versus placebo in most PROs. Improvements were generally more rapid and of greater magnitude for patients receiving baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg than 2&#x02005;mg and were maintained to week 24. At week 24, more baricitinib-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients reported normal physical functioning (HAQ-DI &#x0003c;0.5; p&#x02264;0.001), reductions in fatigue (FACIT-F &#x02265;3.56; p&#x02264;0.05), improvements in PtGA (p&#x02264;0.001) and pain (p&#x02264;0.001) and reductions in duration of MJS (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Baricitinib improved most PROs through 24&#x02005;weeks compared with placebo in this study of treatment-refractory patients with previously inadequate responses to bDMARDs, including at least one TNFi.

Patients were required to have received one or more TNFis and discontinued treatment due to insufficient response after &#x02265;3&#x02005;months or to intolerance and could have received other bDMARDs. Biological DMARDs must have been discontinued for &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks before randomisation (&#x02265;6&#x02005;months for rituximab). Patients must have been regularly using &#x02265;1 csDMARDs for &#x02265;12&#x02005;weeks prior to study entry at a stable dose for &#x02265;8&#x02005;weeks. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee for each centre involved.

This question was particularly important given the refractory nature and long disease duration of the patient population studied as the responsiveness of PROs decreases dramatically with increasing failure of prior therapies and disease duration.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The disease duration of about 14&#x02005;years in this trial is one of the longest of any recently published RA clinical trial. Disease durations such as these have been associated with a failure to improve physical function significantly on biological agents compared with placebo.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Prespecified secondary outcomes in the RA-BEACON trial included a number of PROs that reflect disease activity (duration of MJS and fatigue by FACIT-F), physical function (HAQ-DI, SF-36 PCS), work productivity (WPAI-RA) and HRQOL (SF-36, EQ-5D), some of which constitute patient ratings of the American College of Rheumatology core set measures (HAQ-DI, PtGA and patient's assessment of pain).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The use of all these measures allowed a thorough evaluation of the effects of baricitinib on the various aspects of patient well-being.</p><p>Baseline PROs revealed severely impaired physical function and high levels of pain and fatigue. Patients receiving baricitinib had significantly higher degrees of improvements in most PROs over 24&#x02005;weeks compared with placebo. Improvements were generally more rapid and of greater magnitude with baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg than baricitinib 2&#x02005;mg. In addition, the PRO improvements between the treatment groups and placebo were not influenced by the type (TNFi or non-TNFi) or number (&#x0003c;3 or &#x02265;3) of previous bDMARDs used. The proportion of patients with improvements in the HAQ-DI and SF-36 PCS was significant in both baricitinib groups compared with placebo, and, indeed, significantly more patients reported achieving normal physical functioning (HAQ-DI &#x0003c;0.5). Patients receiving baricitinib also reported a significant improvement in EQ-5D scores, pain, MJS duration and fatigue as well as in regular activity (WPAI-RA) compared with the placebo group. By contrast, for the SF-36 MCS measure, no significant differences were observed between patients treated with baricitinib compared with placebo, consistent with previous observations from other clinical trials.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The baseline value of the MCS was approximately 46 across the treatment groups, demonstrating only a modest impairment, in contrast to the significant physical impairment seen with the PCS (approximately 29 at baseline). Patients, therefore, did not have as much opportunity to improve their MCS scores.</p><p>Improvements in PROs associated with baricitinib in the present analysis were in the range of those reported with bDMARDs in patients with just an inadequate response to csDMARDs or to TNFis.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref> Over 6&#x02005;months, the difference in the rates of patients showing improvement that was &#x02265;MCID in the HAQ-DI and the SF-36 PCS, amounted to 23% between baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg and placebo. This difference was similar to that reported with a bDMARD (improvement of &#x0223c;40%&#x02013;65%) versus placebo (improvement of &#x0223c;25%&#x02013;35%).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, in the current trial, patients had failed to respond to &#x02265;1 bDMARDs, with approximately 60% having previously received two bDMARDs or more. Therefore, these patients with long-standing disease can be considered a refractory population, which is increasing over time and has a substantial unmet need in RA.</p><p>To our knowledge, no other randomised controlled trial has evaluated PROs and drug effects in such a refractory population. In a randomised controlled trial of tofacitinib in patients with inadequate response to TNFis (but overall much lower proportions of patients with multiple bDMARD failure), the PROs reported included pain, PtGA, HAQ-DI, FACIT-F, SF-36 and MOS Sleep Scale.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Treatment effects from that study<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> are consistent with our data showing meaningful outcomes for patients treated with JAK inhibitors.</p><p>This study has some limitations. The 24-week follow-up period is insufficient to determine the longer-term effects of baricitinib treatment. Long-term observations are required to assess the durability of the observed changes; such a study is currently ongoing. However, other extension studies have not shown major losses of response over time.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Further, a high placebo response, most notably for the FACIT-F score, was observed. This could be related to patients being seen more often than in clinical practice and/or showing better adherence to their medication, but these factors are also potentially true for most other randomised controlled trials. However, the proportion of patients who reported improvements that met or exceeded the MCID for the FACIT-F score was 62.7% and 63.8% for baricitinib 4 and 2&#x02005;mg, respectively, versus 48.3% in the placebo group. The difference in fatigue improvement between baricitinib and placebo treatment from week 4 onwards was encouraging, since it was not related to increases in haemoglobin,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but rather to the improvement in inflammatory response, pain and disability. The fact that the employment status did not improve significantly is not surprising and likely related to the short duration of the trial; patients with long-standing, disease-associated unemployment are unlikely to search for and find a new job within a period of 6&#x02005;months. Additionally, patients from 21 countries participated in the trial, and different rates of unemployment and policies related to workplace accommodations may influence a patient's employment status.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the assessment of a number of well-established PRO measures and a patient population with important unmet needs, many of whom had tried several bDMARDs and would not have been very likely to achieve disease control with currently available therapies. Importantly, both physical function and HRQOL measures improved to a relatively large extent across several assessment methods. The major reduction in duration of MJS reflects the patients' overall improvement in clinical disease activity beyond that assessed by global assessments of pain and activity.</p><p>In conclusion, in this treatment-refractory population of patients with previously inadequate responses to bDMARDs, including at least one TNFi, baseline PROs revealed severely impaired physical function and a high level of pain and fatigue. Significant improvements in PROs occurred rapidly with baricitinib and were sustained throughout 24&#x02005;weeks. Improvements were generally more rapid and of greater magnitude for patients receiving baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg compared with baricitinib 2&#x02005;mg. These data are in agreement with previously reported clinical efficacy data for baricitinib in patients with RA, suggesting that baricitinib may be an effective treatment for patients with inadequate response to bDMARDs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study and manuscript were sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company and Incyte Corporation.
