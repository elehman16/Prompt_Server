induced by a Kinesio Tape application with no or moderate tension, to the dominant and
non-dominant arms. [Subjects and Methods] This research was a quantitative study, in which
75 women participated. The subjects, aged 18&#x02013;30 years, were divided into 3 groups,
Kinesio, Kinesio without Tension, and Control, and they were assessed before the taping
intervention and after 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours of taping. [Results] The Kinesio
group subjects demonstrated an increase in handgrip strength after 30 minutes, 24 hours,
and 48 hours of tape application compared to control. A statistically significant increase
in strength was observed in the Kinesio group comparison to the Control after 24 hours and
48 hours for the right hand, and after 48 hours for the left hand. Improvement in the
Kinesio group compared to the Kinesio without Tension was observed only after 24 hours of
taping application, and only in the right hand. [Conclusion] The Kinesio Taping method
augmented the handgrip strength of healthy women, and the increase in grip strength was
maintained for 48 hours after its application; the dominant hand demonstrated the greatest
strength values.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinesio Taping</kwd><kwd>Handgrip</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The search for new therapeutic approaches capable of preventing and treating
musculoskeletal dysfunctions is progressively increasing in conjunction with current
technological innovations. In this context, taping techniques have developed as a complement
to the treatment of musculoskeletal dysfunctions, and has improved over time to provide
therapeutic effects which do not hinder the functionality of a particular body segment.</p><p>In 1973, Dr. Kenzo Kase developed an elastic tape with elastic properties similar to the
skin, and named it Kinesio Tape<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Kinesio Taping method originated from the hypothesis that an
external component could aid the functions of muscles and other tissues<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is thin and
elastic by design, and can stretch to 40% to 60% of its original length, which makes it very
elastic compared to traditional taping materials, allowing complete range of motion<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various authors have described the benefits of Kinesio Taping as being dependent on the
stretch of the tape and the form of placement on the skin, which elicits: positional
stimulus and correction of muscle function; improvement of fascial tissue alignment;
facilitation of bodily fluid circulation; repair of injured tissues; sensory stimulation
assisting or limiting movement, thereby improving proprioception; edema control by guiding
lymph toward lymph nodes; and correction of joint position<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to Kenzo Kase, the stretch applied to the tape creates tension in the skin which
improves communication with mechanoreceptors and increases the number of motor units
recruited during a muscle contraction<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Through these effects, the tape can improve muscle function by facilitating the contraction
of inactive muscles.</p><p>Therefore, the application of Kinesio Taping over the gripping musculature of the hand
could possibly be used to complement therapeutic treatment of manual dysfunction once its
influence has been assessed on healthy individuals. The human hand is clearly the most
important and complex structure of the upper extremity due to its extensive mobility and the
sensitive capabilities of its surrounding tissues, which allows gripping and feeling, its
essential functions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>Due to the increasing utilization of Kinesio Tape in clinical settings, studies are
necessary to confirm the purported benefits of the method and establish evidence-based
standards for this technique. In light of the scarcity of research regarding Kinesio Taping,
and the fundamental role of handgrip strength in activities of daily living, this study
assessed the effects of Kinesio Taping on the handgrip strength of healthy women, as
measured by handgrip dynamometry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study recruited 75 healthy women volunteers, aged between 18 and 30&#x02005;years, who were
randomly subdivided into three groups (n=25): Kinesio, Kinesio Without Tension (KWT), and
the Control groups. The Kinesio group received tape application at 25% to 35% of tension;
the KWT group received tape application with no longitudinal stretch; while the Control
group did not receive any taping techniques. Subjects from both the Kinesio and KWT groups
were unaware of the tension utilized on their respective taping techniques to avoid possible
influences on the results.</p><p>The subjects of this study were physical therapy students of the University Salgado de
Oliveira in Brazil, who were invited to participate as volunteers through advertisements
placed inside their classrooms. The inclusion criteria required a signed informed consent
form and agreement to participate during all phases of the study.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: outside of the established age range; absence from the 24-hour
or 48-hour follow-up assessment of handgrip strength; presence of limiting factors which
could have influenced the results, such as cardiopulmonary, hormonal, or osteomyoarticular
disorders; joint or bone deformities, congenital or acquired, in either of the upper
extremities; central or peripheral neurological deficits; use of anabolic substances; injury
or surgery to the upper extremities within the last six months; or consumption of alcoholic
beverages or pharmaceutical substances 24 hours prior to the start of this study.</p><p>This research was approved by the research ethics committee of the Hospital of Tropical
Diseases under protocol number 009/2011.</p><p>The instrument utilized to measure handgrip strength was a JAMAR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> dynamometer,
which has been validated as a gold standard tool for this purpose by the American Society of
Hand Therapists (ASHT)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This instrument
allows simple and quick readings of handgrip strength, which is measured in kilograms/force.
The handle was placed in the second position for the measurements<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Initially, the subjects sat on an adjustable chair which was adjusted so that subjects
backs were straight, with their knees and hips in 90&#x000b0; of flexion with their feet on the
floor. The shoulders were positioned in adduction next to the trunk with the elbows in 90&#x000b0;
of flexion, the forearm and wrist in the neutral position, and the arm unsupported, while
the examiner held the dynamometer for each reading, as recommended by the ASHT<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects performed the handgrip movement with maximum effort, only during exhalation
and after a verbal cue given by the examiner: &#x0201c;one, two, three, go&#x0201d;. Three measurements were
made for each hand, alternating the test sides, starting with the right hand a rest interval
of 60 seconds was provided between trials in order to avoid muscle fatigue during the
assessment. Subjects were instructed to maintain maximum contraction for 5 seconds in each
trial, since research has demonstrate that peak force is reached between 3 to 10 seconds of
contraction<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The average of the three
trials was calculated for each hand.</p><p>Subjects from the Kinesio and KWT groups had the skin of their forearms cleaned with a
cotton pad and 70% alcohol before the application of the respective Kinesio Taping
techniques. A single researcher certified in the Kinesio Taping Method conducted the taping,
and pink Kinesio Tex Gold tape was used.</p><p>The technique performed for the Kinesio group aims to influence muscle function by
activating the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. The tape was initially anchored with
2.5 to 5&#x02005;cm of tape at the medial epicondyle, then 25% to 35% of tension was applied as it
was wound over the target muscle toward the hand. The KWT group received the same tape
application, but no tension was added as the tape was applied (0% of stretch). The Control
group only performed the handgrip strength assessment and did not receive any taping.</p><p>The handgrip strength dynamometry was reassessed for all groups after 30 minutes, 24 hours,
and 48 hours of taping. The subjects did not exercise their gripping muscles during the 48
hours of this study.</p><p>The statistical analysis of data was performed using parametric tests. The variables were
normally distributed, and the Statistical Package for the Social Science software (version
15.0) was used. Initially, a descriptive analysis of the data was conducted in order to
obtain the mean, standard deviations, minimums, and maximums of the mesured items. The ANOVA
test (complemented by the Student&#x02019;s t-test) was used to verify and compare the effects of
Kinesio Taping on handgrip strength after 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours. A significance
level of 5% was used in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The initial sample size totaled 83 subjects, with an average age of 21.5&#x02005;years (SD &#x000b1; 2.60).
None of the subjects complained of pain or discomfort during the study. Eight subjects did
not participate in the study&#x02019;s entirety (did not return after 24 or 48 hours for
reassessment of handgrip strength, or presented limiting factors which could have interfered
with the results), and were excluded following the exclusion criteria, reducing the sample
size to 75 healthy women.</p><p>Regarding the behavior of handgrip strength values, it was observed that only the Kinesio
group presented an increase in the average values of each at the assessment times (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Average strength of the right and left hands of the different groups

showed a significant difference after 48 hours of taping. In comparison of the Kinesio and
KWT groups only the right hand showed a significant difference after 24 hours of taping
(p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In the comparison of handgrip strength between the dominant and non-dominant hands, it was
observed that the dominant hand demonstrated greater handgrip strength at all the assessment
times, when considering the average dynamometry value, especially in the Kinesio and Control
groups (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Research regarding Kinesio Taping is still scarce in the scientific literature since the
technique has only received international attention within the last ten years. Moreover, the
available studies did not have large, homogeneous samples and were conducted with
questionable methodologies. It should be noted that the present study is the first to
utilize a large sample size in order assess the effects of Kinesio Taping on muscle
strength.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to observe the influence of Kinesio Taping on
handgrip strength by comparing the average handgrip strength as measured by dynamometry
prior to tape application with its respective values after 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 48
hours of taping. The results demonstrate statistically significant differences after 24
hours and 48 hours of taping for the right hand, and at the three post-taping assessmentimes
for the left hand. The results for the right hand after 30 minutes of taping revealed a
p-value of 0.0575, which although the results was not significant, was very close to the
level of significance adopted by this study. Similar findings were not observed in the KWT
and Control groups, thus confirming the hypothesis of this study, that Kinesio Taping can
increase handgrip strength when applied with systematic standards for that purpose.</p><p>According to Kenzo Kase, the Kinesio Taping method can improve the strength of muscles
weakened by correcting muscle function with stimuli and reinforcement. Our present results
are similar to those reported by Vithoulka et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> in which Kinesio Taping increased eccentric muscle strength in
healthy adults.</p><p>In contrast to our present results, Chang et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> evaluated the influence of Kinesio Taping on the maximum handgrip
strength of 21 healthy students, all of them men and athletes. The technique employed was
specifically for medial epicondylitis, and no significant changes in strength were observed
after taping. However, a confounding factor in this study was that the tension applied to
the placebo group, which was the same as that of the Kinesio group (between 15% and 20%).
Also, with the start of taping being more distal than the insertion point, the tension zone
was the same, thus making the purpose of comparison between these two groups
questionable.</p><p>Another study investigated the immediate and delayed effects of two directions of Kinesio
taping on maximal isometric strength of the wrist and finger muscles of healthy adults.
Nineteen healthy junior college students participated in that study. Inhibition and
facilitation KT techniques were separately used to tape the dominant and non-dominant
forearms of the participants, respectively. Maximal isometric strength of wrist extension,
middle finger extension, and the grip of both hands were measured before taping, immediately
after taping, and after 24&#x02005;h of taping (with the tape in situ). Compared with the baseline,
the average maximal isometric strength of middle finger extensors increased considerably
after application of the facilitation Kinesio Tape. No significant time effect was observed
on the middle finger extension strength on the dominant side or on the wrist extension and
grip strength on either side.</p><p>Divergences are also seen in the results presented by Fu et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which Kinesio Taping was applied with 120% of
longitudinal stretch over the quadriceps and hamstring muscles of 14 healthy athletes (7 men
and 7 women), and assessed in the following manner: before tape application, immediately
after taping, and 12 hours afterward. An isokinetic dynamometer was utilized in order to
verify the muscle strength, and no significant increase was found in the muscle strength of
these athletes. Rather, a decrease in strength was actually observed. An issue with the
method of this study is that the actual tension applied to the tape was 120%, which should
only be utilized for taping procedures of a ligamentous injury. Such a high tension may
hinder muscle contraction and decrease joint mobility, which could also lead to
non-functional movement and muscle inactivation.</p><p>Some authors have reported increases in electromyographic activity induced by the use of
Kinesio Tape: e.g. Slupik et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, Chen
et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, Hsu et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Thelen, Dauben and Stoneman<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In all of these studies, an improvement in
electromyographic signals was seen.</p><p>In the above mentioned studies, there are consistency issues with the assessments of
Kinesio Taping, as witnessed by the lack of a systematic approach in data collection, which
did not permit a reliable assessment of initial benefits, the duration of benefits or the
residual effects after KT removal. Some authors have evaluated the influence of Kinesio
Taping immediately after its application<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, other have assessed it immediately
afterward and 12 hours later<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well
as 24 hours and 72 hours later<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
only after 72 hours of taping<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With regards to the stretch applied to the tape, some authors do not specify how much was
utilized in their studies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies simply do not follow the standards
recommended by the Kinesio Taping Association. An example of this is related to the tension
for muscle activation, which has been established to be between 25% and 35%. Nevertheless,
some authors have opted to utilize 15% to 20% of tension<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and even 120%<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Also a simple tape just placed without tension as performed for the Control group in this
study with no specific direction, will elicit tape stimulus and some effects should be
apparent. Kinesio tape applied to the skin without tension will exert minimal tensions
during body and skin movements. No tension is also used in the Kinesio Taping Method for
patients that are high sensitive to external stimulous. So it can&#x02019;t be called placebo, it is
just a different degree of stimulus.</p><p>When comparing the Kinesio and Control groups of the present study, the greatest handgrip
strength values were observed in the Kinesio group at 24 hours and 48 hours after
application of the taping technique to the right hand, and after 48 hours for the left hand.
These results indicate that handgrip strength increased and remained elevated in the right
hand for 48 hours. For the left hand, however, this increase was only observed after 48
hours of taping.</p><p>Considering that changes in handgrip strength were observed after 24 hours in the right
hand, which lasted up to 48 hours, and that such changes were noted only after 48 hours of
taping in the left hand, we believe that the sensitivity of the right hand is greater than
that of the left hand. Therefore, the mechanoreceptor stimulus induced by the Kinesio Taping
provided a faster response in the right hand than in its counterpart. The left hand possibly
required greater tension and a longer period of time for it to receive sufficient
stimulation to achieve the same results as for the right hand.</p><p>With regards to the augmented handgrip strength observed for the right hand of the Kinesio
group in relation to the KWT group after 24 hours of taping, we assume that the tactile
stimulus to the dermis and epidermis are present even when KT is applied without tension,
since the skin maintains it normal mobility by stretching and recoiling in relation to the
tape during upper extremity movements.</p><p>Another result noted was that the dominant hand presented greater handgrip strength when
considering the average values at each of the four assessment times, namely, before Kinesio
Taping application, and 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours later. This finding was observed
for all the groups, but with a higher percentage in the Kinesio and Control groups.</p><p>Considering the present results, it is possible to conclude that an increase in handgrip
strength occurred over pre-taping values at 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours after Kinesio
Taping application. A statistically significant increase was observed in the Kinesio group,
when compared to Control group after 24 and 48 hours of taping for the right hand, and after
48 hours of taping for the left hand. Between the Kinesio and KWT groups, an increase was
noted 24 hours after taping for the right hand. The dominant hand presented greater handgrip
strength values in all assessments of all the groups. Accordingly, this confirms that
