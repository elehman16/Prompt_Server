In three centres (Oxford, Taunton and Reading), 12-lead ECG measurements were obtained at baseline and at 6&#x02005;months. The trial was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and was registered (ISRCTN34164388).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study participants</title><p>Patients with minimally symptomatic OSA, who were usually referred due to witnessed apnoeas or severe snoring, were randomised to either 6&#x02005;months of CPAP therapy or standard care (SC). Eligibility criteria were as follows: age between 45 and 75&#x02005;years, proven OSA on the diagnostic sleep study defined as &#x0003e;7.5 oxygen desaturations of &#x0003e;4% per hour (Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) &#x0003e;7.5/h) in the baseline sleep study, and no history of excessive daytime sleepiness or daytime symptoms of OSA that would have warranted CPAP therapy initiation. Patients were not eligible for inclusion if they had been previously diagnosed with ventilatory failure, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, or blood pressure &#x0003e;180/110&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. Patients with previous exposure to CPAP, a current heavy goods vehicle or public service vehicle driver license, a history of any sleep-related accident, or disability precluding informed consent or compliance with the protocol were also excluded. Cardiovascular disease was not an exclusion criterion. All randomised patients gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sleep study</title><p>Diagnosis of OSA was made after a one-night, in-hospital, respiratory polygraphy as standard in the participating centres. The severity of OSA was quantified as the number of oxygen desaturations &#x0003e;4% per hour of study (ODI). Subjective daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Objective sleepiness was assessed using one Oxford Sleep Resistance test administered at the same time of the day (Stowood Scientific Instruments Oxford, UK), which evaluates the ability to stay awake for 40&#x02005;min in a quiet, darkened room. For consistency purposes across the three centres, a second ambulatory pulse-oximetry recording (Konica-Minolta Inc, Osaka, Japan) was performed at baseline and at 6&#x02005;months in all eligible patients, and used as the trial ODI values. Patients were then informed in detail about possible pros and cons of CPAP. Patients with an ESS above the conventional upper normal limit (9) were included, if suitable for patients.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Parallel randomisation was performed by telephoning the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit. The computer-generated allocation sequence with 1:1 ratio incorporated minimisation for OSA severity, as assessed by ODI (above or below 20/h), Pocock cardiovascular risk score<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (above or below 40), and participating centre.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Continuous positive airway pressure</title><p>Patients allocated to CPAP were instructed in the use of an auto-adjusting CPAP machine (Autoset S8, ResMed, Abingdon, UK) by trained staff who were not involved in outcome assessments or data analysis. After 6&#x02005;months, CPAP usage was downloaded from the machine.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Standard care</title><p>Patients randomised to SC were instructed to continue their current medication.

Participants rested for 5&#x02005;min in the supine position before measurements, and room temperature and lighting were kept constant. Standard commercially available 12-lead ECG devices were used in all centres. Paper-speed was set at 25&#x02005;mm/s and amplitude at 10&#x02005;mm/s. All measurements of ECG intervals were performed using a dedicated ECG analysis calipre software (DatInf Measure 2.1d, DatInf GmbH, T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany) offline by the same investigator (CS), who was not aware of the randomisation sequence or other patient-specific data. The means of all available consecutive heart cycles (three in the majority of cases) were used in all 12 leads for computation of ECG markers. The ECG indices were defined as follows: P wave: the onset of the P wave was defined as the point of first detectable upward or downward slope from the isoelectric line for positive or negative waveforms, respectively. Return to the isoelectric line was considered as the end of the P wave. Pmax/Pmin was defined as the longest/shortest mean value of consecutive heart cycles in any of the 12 leads. Pd was defined as the difference between Pmax and Pmin. The PQ interval was defined as the point from the beginning of the P wave to the first part of the QRS complex. The QT interval was defined as the time from the onset of the QRS complex to the cutting point of the tangent to the downward slope of the T wave and the isoelectric line. QTmax/QTmin was defined as the longest/shortest mean value of consecutive heart cycles in any of the 12 leads. QT dispersion was defined as the difference between QTmax and QTmin. The TpTe interval was defined as the time from the peak of the T wave to the cutting point of the tangent to the downward slope of the T wave and the isoelectric line. TpTe/QT ratio was used as a measure of dispersion of repolarisation,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and calculated as mean TpTe divided by mean QT (from all leads). QT and TpTe intervals were corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Endpoints were the absolute changes in P wave dispersion, QT dispersion, heart rate, Pmean, Pmax, Pmin, QTmean, QT<sub>c</sub>mean, QTmax, QTmin, TpTe<sub>c</sub> and TpTe/QT ratio over follow-up. In subgroup analyses, we compared the effects of using CPAP &#x0003e;4 or &#x02264;4&#x02005;h/night against control on each outcome, and the effect of CPAP in patients with ODI &#x0003e;20 vs &#x0003c;20 at baseline. The effect of CPAP on QT<sub>c</sub> and TpTe<sub>c</sub> intervals was compared between patients with QTc intervals &#x02265; or &#x0003c;430&#x02005;ms at baseline and with TpTe<sub>c</sub> intervals &#x02265; or &#x0003c;90&#x02005;ms at baseline.</p><p>Values are presented as mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA V.13 for Windows (STATA Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). Treatment effects were estimated using multiple linear regression adjusting for allocation group, the minimisation variables, and the baseline value of the corresponding outcome. The effect of CPAP in different subgroups was assessed by adding a treatment-by-subgroup interaction term to each model. All analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat principle and a two-sided p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial profile and patient characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010150F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the trial profile; 391 patients were initially randomised in the 10 participating centres of the MOSAIC trial.

We found no treatment effect of CPAP on any of the evaluated ECG risk markers.</p><p>The MOSAIC randomised trial, from which these data were derived, was a rigorously planned and performed study aimed at giving clinicians a better evidence base for treatment decisions in the many patients with OSA lacking overt daytime sleepiness. Although a previous study showed adverse effects of CPAP withdrawal on heart rhythm in symptomatic patients with moderate to severe OSA,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> no data from randomised trials in minimally symptomatic OSA patients have yet been available.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Effect of CPAP on ECG risk markers for AF</title><p>A prolonged P wave on the surface ECG represents intra-atrial conduction slowing, while an increase in P wave dispersion indicates heterogeneous intra-atrial and interatrial conduction, providing a substrate that favours re-entry mechanisms. These variables have been shown to represent independent predictors for new onset AF as well as for relapse of AF after catheter ablation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In a large retrospective cohort analysis, P wave dispersion &#x0003e;80&#x02005;ms and Pmax &#x0003e;120&#x02005;ms, were associated with HRs for developing AF of 1.95 and 1.9, respectively.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The prevalence of OSA among patients with AF is reported to be as high as 32%<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> to 56%.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These high prevalence rates must be considered carefully due to different study populations and designs. Nevertheless, clinicians should be aware of the potentially negative effects of OSA on treatment success of AF. This might be especially important for those patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF given recent findings of a meta-analysis by Qureshi <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> who found a 44% lower risk of AF recurrence in patients with OSA who used CPAP versus those who did not.</p><p>In the current study, the 95% CI for the treatment effect of CPAP on P wave dispersion excludes a reduction &#x0003e;3.4&#x02005;ms. Therefore, our results do not support CPAP treatment in minimally symptomatic OSA patients in terms of risk reduction for progression and/or recurrence of AF. Moreover, we have previously found no evidence that 6&#x02005;months of CPAP has an effect on left atrial area as assessed by echocardiography in a subset of MOSAIC patients.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Thus, CPAP appears to have no electrical and structural impact on the atria in patients with minimally symptomatic OSA. For further analysis, we compared whether there was a statistically significant different CPAP treatment effect on atrial ECG risk markers in those patients, having had an initial ODI &#x0003e;20/h when compared with those with an ODI &#x0003c;20/h. However, no such group interaction was found.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effect of CPAP on ECG risk markers for SCD</title><p>The QT interval is primarily a measure of ventricular repolarisation, although it includes the QRS interval and, hence, ventricular depolarisation too. An inherited, as well as acquired, QT prolongation is often used as a marker for risk assessment of SCD.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Prolongation of the TpTe interval, a measure of cardiac transmural dispersion of repolarisation, of the QT dispersion as a marker of general repolarisation abnormality, and of the TpTe/QT ratio, a measure of disproportional prolongation of global dispersion relative to the QT interval aimed at minimising effects of varying heart rates, are as well linked to an increased risk of SCD through enhanced susceptibility to early and late afterdepolarisations.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The Rotterdam QT project showed that a QTc interval of more than 440&#x02005;ms was associated with a 2.3 times higher risk for SCD when compared with a QTc &#x02264;440&#x02005;ms (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>There is growing evidence of a role for OSA in the occurrence of SCD. In a large longitudinal study, OSA has been proposed as a novel risk factor for SCD.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In that study, nocturnal hypoxaemia and the apnoea hypopnea index (AHI) strongly predicted SCD independent of well-established risk factors. While the general population is least likely to die from sudden death from cardiac causes during the sleeping hours, in patients with OSA, sudden death from cardiac causes peaked during the sleeping hours.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In the current study, there was no difference in CPAP treatment effect on QT<sub>c</sub> between patients with an ODI &#x02265;20/h when compared with patients with an ODI &#x0003c;20/h. Recently, a RCT evaluating the effect of CPAP on measures of cardiac repolarisation in symptomatic patients with moderate to severe OSA showed a statistically and clinically significant prolongation of QT<sub>c</sub> and TpTe<sub>c</sub> after 2&#x02005;weeks of CPAP withdrawal.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the latter study, baseline QT<sub>c</sub> and TpTe<sub>c</sub> intervals were higher than in our study (416.1 vs 397.8 and 114.7 vs 76.1&#x02005;ms, respectively), and this might be due to the fact that more severe patients with OSA were included. In those patients, a 2-week withdrawal of CPAP led to an increase of the QT<sub>c</sub> interval of 21.4&#x02005;ms, 95% CI 11.3 to 31.6&#x02005;ms, and the increase in the length of the QT<sub>c</sub> interval was positively correlated with the change in the severity of sleep disordered breathing (AHI) (r=0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.77, p&#x0003c;0.001). Conversely, in the current study, the 95% CI for the treatment effect of CPAP on QT<sub>c</sub> excludes a reduction greater than 3.5&#x02005;ms, which probably does not represent a clinically significant effect. It could be argued that in our patient sample, due to low intervals of cardiac repolarisation at baseline, no further reduction through the use of CPAP could be achieved. However, we did not find larger effects of CPAP treatment in patients with QT<sub>c</sub> intervals at baseline greater than 430&#x02005;ms, or TpTe<sub>c</sub> intervals at baseline greater than 90&#x02005;ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, the presented analysis was not the primary objective of the MOSAIC trial, thus, our interpretations must be regarded as hypothesis-generating rather than fully robust. Second, high intraobserver and interobserver variability is usually found when measuring ECG intervals. However, all measurements were made offline by the same experienced investigator, who was blinded to treatment allocation and other patient data at the time of analysis. Third, adherence to CPAP is usually an issue in patients with minimally symptomatic OSA. Patients often feel no obvious benefit from therapy, while discomfort using the device can negate any potential benefit. Median usage in the current study was 2.7&#x02005;h/night. However, subgroup analyses revealed no difference in CPAP treatment effect on any ECG risk marker in the more compliant participants who used their CPAP device more than 4&#x02005;h/night.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first RCT providing data to evaluate the effect of CPAP on ECG risk markers for AF and SCD in patients with minimally symptomatic OSA.
