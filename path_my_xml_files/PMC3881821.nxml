the mandibular ramus (SOMR) is the most common, allowing a great range of movements
and stable internal fixation (SIF), therefore eliminating the need of
maxillomandibular block in the postoperative period. Objectives: The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the biomechanical resistance of three national systems used for
SIF in SOMR in sheep mandibles. Material and methods: The study was performed in 30
sheep hemi-mandibles randomly divided into 3 experimental groups, each containing 10
hemi-mandibles. The samples were measured to avoid discrepancies and then subjected
to SOMR with 5-mm advancement. In group I, 2.0x12 mm screws were used for fixation,
inserted in an inverted "L" pattern (inverted "L" group). In group II, fixation was
performed with two 2.0x12 mm screws, positioned in a linear pattern and a 4-hole
straight miniplate and four 2.0x6.0 mm monocortical screws (hybrid group). In group
III, fixation was performed with two 4-hole straight miniplates and eight 2.0x6.0 mm
monocortical screws (mini plate group). All materials used for SIF were supplied by
Osteosin - SIN. The hemimandibles were subjected to vertical linear load test by
Kratos K2000MP mechanical testing unit for loading registration and displacement.
Results: All groups showed similar resistance during mechanical test for loading and
displacement, with no statistically significant differences between groups according
to analysis of variance. Conclusion: These results indicate that the three techniques
of fixation are equally effective for clinical fixation of SOMR.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mandible</kwd><kwd>Osteotomy</kwd><kwd>Bone plates</kwd><kwd>Bone screws</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sagittal osteotomy of the mandibular ramus (SOMR) is certainly one of the most performed
surgical procedures in orthognathic surgery. The versatility provided by its outlining
offers a wide contact between the osteotomized segments, promoting better repair and
stability, as well as allowing a precise and adequate application of the concept of
stable internal fixation.</p><p>Several studies have shown that the SOMR can be fixed by means of plates and/or inter
fragmentary screws, with good results both <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup> and in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref></sup>. Stable internal fixation (SIF) is a
method that enables the stabilization of the osteotomized segments through screws or
metallic plates. This type of fixation is put directly in contact with the bone
structure, allowing its function during the bone repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, it eliminates or reduces the application of
the maxillomandibular block, resulting in a greater benefit for the patient due to its
stability and biomechanical properties superior to the methods previously used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>. SIF of sagittal osteotomy can be made
only by screws, being these compressive or positional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref></sup>, monocortical
plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19 </xref></sup>or a combination of
both techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>. These techniques
differ according to the size, number, pattern and type of material used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref></sup>, as well as some
variations regarding its angularity and tool management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref></sup>. All of them
tend to explain which techniques present better SIF, providing greater stabilization
between the bone segments and lower morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>The first sagittal osteotomy in which SIF was used was described by Spiessl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup> (1976), using compressive screws.
However, this technique has a major disadvantage, which is, the torque of the condylar
segment, altering its position. The use of positional screws was introduced by
Souyris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> (1978), in which the
screw engages in the two cortical plates, keeping the planned space between the segments
and promoting the system stabilization in a passive way, resulting in smaller condylar
torque and lesion of the inferior alveolar nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p>In cases of great mandibular advancement or asymmetrical movements of the mandible,
however, there is a decrease between the bone contact of the distal and proximal
segments of the osteotomy, leading to a difficulty in the installation of the bicortical
screws<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup>. This lack of contact
can be solved through the accomplishment of compensatory wear and tear in both segments
or through bone grafts. Nevertheless, many times, due to the magnitude of the movement,
there is the need of altering the fixation technique, using monocortical screws and
plates. In addition to allowing the fixation in great advancements, this technique has
other advantages such as lower rates of lesion to the neurovascular bundle and smaller
torques to the proximal segment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>Tulasne and Schendel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup> (1989)
recommended the use of one or two plates combined with 2.0 mm monocortical screws. Those
authors reported that there is a lower risk of injury to the inferior alveolar nerve
directly or through the compression among the segments. After the maxillomandibular
blockage, having the proximal segment already positioned, the space of the lateral
cortical is measured and the plates of appropriate size are selected. One or two plates
could be used on each side, depending on the required stability, direction and degree of
mandibular displacement and the type of miniplate to be used.</p><p>Advantages of using miniplates and monocortical screws include easier execution of the
technique; easier correction of inadequate positioning of the proximal segment; easier
removal of miniplates under local anesthesia; no need of skin incisions; plate folding
for adaptation to the outline of the osteotomized segments; and smaller risk of injury
to the inferior alveolar nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>Foley and Beckman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> (1992) compared the
rigidity of three groups of SIF performed in 12 sheep mandibles with sagittal osteotomy.
The groups were GI (three 2.0-mm bicortical positional screws in an inverted
"L"-pattern), GII (one miniplate with four 2.0-mm monocortical screws) and GIII (three
2.7-mm bicortical screws, in a linear pattern). The osteotomies fixed with miniplates
and inverted "L" screws were more resistant than those fixed with linear screws. The
flaws in the miniplate group were caused mainly by plate deformation rather than by
flaws at the bone-screw interface.</p><p>Shetty, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref></sup> (1996) compared
several patterns of three miniplate systems [doubled plates (3D), titanium meshes and
conventional plates] combining some groups of plates with a positional bicortical screw
in the retromolar space and comparing them with the standard technique of three 2.4-mm
positional screws in a linear pattern. After the loading test, the authors concluded
that the groups fixed by miniplates and positional screws had superior stability when
compared with the groups that were fixed exclusively with miniplates or with positional
linear screws.</p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> bending strength of SIF with absorbable and metallic
screws in SOMR in sheep hemi-mandibles has been evaluated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>. The screws were inserted as lag screws, with an
inverted "L" configuration, and the set was submitted to bending strength tests. The
groups showed no statistically significant differences, indicating the feasibility of
both for osteosynthesis in SOMR.</p><p>Peterson, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup> (2005) evaluated
the mechanical resistance of polyurethane mandibles subjected to SOMR and a 5 mm
advancement, testing four types of fixation: fixation with three bicortical screws in
inverted "L" pattern, straight miniplate with 4 monocortical screws, curved miniplate
with 6 monocortical screws and adjustable miniplate with 4 monocortical screws. All
plates and screws belonged to the system 2.0 mm. The authors concluded that bicortical
screws in inverted "L" pattern presented superior resistance than the other fixations
using plates and monocortical screws.</p><p>Van Sickels, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref></sup> (2005) evaluated
the mechanical behavior in 7-mm advancements of polyurethane mandibles, using different
groups of fixations. In group I, fixation was accomplished with an adjustable miniplate
and 4 monocortical screws; group II used an adjustable miniplate with 4 monocortical
screws and a positional screw; group III used an adjustable miniplate with 4
monocortical screws and 2 positional screws; group IV used an adjustable miniplate with
4 monocortical screws and 3 positional screws; in group V, fixation was performed with 3
bicortical screws in an inverted "L" position. The authors concluded that the addition
of bicortical screws to the system improved the mechanical stability and that only after
the placement of 2 or 3 screws (group III and IV) the vertical forces became similar to
the forces of the inverted "L" group.</p><p>Ozden, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> (2006) have used fresh
mandibles of sheep subjected to SOMR and compared the stability of 10 fixation types.
The authors concluded that the groups of bicortical screws in the inverted "L" pattern
promote greater mechanical stability. In the group where miniplates were used, the one
put obliquely and fixed with 2 bicortical screws in the proximal segment was the most
rigid in the group of miniplates.</p><p>A recent case report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup> described the
technique of hybrid fixation with monocortical screws and plates combined with two
bicortical screws in SOMR in the movement of advancement and counterclockwise rotation.
In a follow-up of 14 months, the authors reported the patient's satisfaction as for the
treatment, without alterations in dental roots and regression of the paresthesia of the
inferior alveolar nerve. They have concluded that this fixation type increases the
stability of the fixation without significant risks to the temporomandibular joint and
to the inferior alveolar nerve.</p><p>In spite of some controversies, the literature demonstrates the viability of the use of
plates and monocortical screws in the fixation of SOMR. However, few works report the
mechanical resistance of the materials of national origin in both fixation forms in the
situation of mandibular advancement. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform an
<italic>in vitro</italic> comparison of the mechanical resistance of three national
systems used for SIF in SOMR in sheep mandibles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee in Research of Sagrado Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o
University (USC) under the protocol number 041/09.</p><p>Mandibles of adult sheep aged 1 year to 1 year and a half were obtained in
slaughterhouses from the region of S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil. The mandibles were
separated from the heads after total dissection of the soft tissues and, after that,
they were split up in the mandibular symphysis, generating 60 hemi-mandibles. Only the
30 hemi-mandibles corresponding to the right side were used in this study. The specimens
were measured (height and width of the ramus, length of the mandible and distance
between the anterior limit of the foramen and the anterior border of the mandible)
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) because the use of mandibles of
disproportional sizes could interfere in the mechanical test. The attribution of the
units to the experimental groups was performed by random distribution, constituting a
balanced experiment with a probabilistic sample of ten units in each experimental group.
Soon afterwards, the selected experimental units were stored frozen until the beginning
of the experiment.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mandible measures: (A) height of the ramus; (B) width of the ramus; (C) length of

of bone interferences or dental roots that could inhibit a good adaptation of the
osteotomized parts was performed, the distal segment was advanced in 5 mm and fixations
were applied in three different ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).
All materials used for SIF were supplied by Osteosin - SIN Sistema de Implante Nacional
Ltda., Fixadores, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil.</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Sagittal osteotomy used to separate the segments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-20-04-0419-g02"/></fig><p>In Group I (inverted "L"), in order to fixate the osteotomy, three self-tapping screws
of 2.0x12 mm were used (PBM 2012), in a positional pattern. After the positioning of the
segments, by using a drill of a 1.5 mm diameter, both the cortical plates were
perforated in an angle of 90&#x000ba;, under abundant irrigation of water to avoid thermal
damage to the bone. The length of the screw was determined to cross both cortical plates
and to surpass at least 1 mm of the internal cortical. The disposition of the screws was
tripoidal, with two screws in the superior border (tension area) and one in the inferior
border (compression area), installed uprightly to the cortical bone. The distance among
the screws of the superior border was of approximately 10 mm, being applied in the areas
of better contact among the cortical plates. The inferior screws were installed
approximately 10 mm above the inferior border, in places where the cortical plates
presented larger thickness and where there was a good contact area among the same ones
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Inverted &#x0201c;L&#x0201d; group (Group I)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-20-04-0419-g03"/></fig><p>In Group II (hybrid group), in order to fixate the osteotomy, a plate (PI 201004P) was

the other two in the proximal segment. The distance between the plate and the superior
border was approximately 20 mm. After the fixation of the plate, two self-tapping screws
of 2.0x12 mm were positioned in linear disposition, being the first installed
approximately 10 mm from the superior border and the second 5 mm from the first one,
keeping the same height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="f04" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Hybrid group (Group II)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-20-04-0419-g04"/></fig><p>In Group III (plates group), in order to fixate the osteotomy, two plates (PI 201004P)

acrylic resin (Jet; Artigos Odontol&#x000f3;gicos Cl&#x000e1;ssico Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil),
including the posterior border and the mandibular condyle, but without allowing contact
of the resin with the distal segment, avoiding bonding of this segment. This assembly
was performed by putting the resin in the sandy phase, in a wax mold and positioning the
hemi-mandible until final polymerization. The mold allowed the standardization of the
dimensions of all the pieces, facilitating their fixation to a U-shaped device, with 3
lateral screws on each side, welded vertically on a central base that was fixed in the
testing machine. This way, it was possible to maintain a parallelism between the oclusal
plan and the horizontal plan of the machine.</p><p>In order to perform the mechanical test, after inclusion in the resin block, the
mandibles were tied to a steel support and afterwards fixed to the basis of mechanical
test device. In the headstock of the testing machine, a force sensor was fixed,
denominated "load cell" of 50 kgf. The machine was programmed to record the maximum
resistance force, in kgf, exhibited by the system regarding a progressive load, at a
displacement speed of 1 mm/s. In order to test the sample, a vertical progressive force
was applied in the area of the second molar until a flaw was observed in the fixation or
a fracture was observed in the hemi-mandible. In the area of application of force, a
resin support was done so that the force cell could not slip and generate a mistake

mandible model. The results obtained showed that all methods provided good stabilization
of the mandible after the application of a mechanical test to evaluate maximum force and
displacement of the segments.</p><p>Biomechanical studies <italic>in vitro</italic> are useful to evaluate the resistance of
the fixation as well as the disposition of the materials of osteosynthesis before being
used in humans. Nowadays, aiming at the standardization of tests, professionals are
choosing to use resin models. However, in spite of the advantage of standardization,
these models have the disadvantage of possessing modules of elasticity which are
different from those of fresh bones, resulting in a problem that does not happen when
fresh bones are used. Fresh bovine ribs are more frequently used because they are easier
to obtain. However, they present an anatomy which is quite different than the mandible's
anatomy, and this is the main fact that contraindicates its use in this specific type of
test. The use of frozen fresh mandibles of animals is the best indication for these
purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup>. Conservation of the
pieces by freezing did not cause significant alterations in the biomechanical resistance
of the bone during many months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>The choice of working with fresh bones, as in the present study in which sheep mandibles
were used, was due to the ease of obtaining and storage of samples and possibility of
standardization and performing similar SOMR to those performed in humans. However, some
modifications of the original technique had to be done to perform the surgery in an
animal model, such as medial inclination of the cut and performing this cut below the
mandibular foramen. Other advantages of the experimental model used in this study are:
use of SIF, low cost and wide usage of fresh bone samples in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref></sup>. It is important to emphasize that the data obtained
from biomechanical studies using analogous bones cannot be directly transferred to the
clinical use in humans, serving only as indicative parameters of the behavior of a
certain technique and/or material.</p><p>The use of positional screws is the most recognized procedure for fixating sagittal
osteotomies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup>. The disposition of
positional screws in inverted "L", where two screws are installed in the superior border
and one in the inferior border below the mandibular canal, is the most cited form of
fixation, showing the best mechanical resistance when compared with other fixation
forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref></sup>. However, the use of monocortical screws and plates has
become highly widespread in recent years, with good results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref></sup>. The use of plates combined with bicortical screws has also been
described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p>The literature emphasizes the superiority of the SIF with bicortical screws compared
with the technique of fixation with a miniplate and four monocortical screws. Bouwman,
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> (1994) and Shetty, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup> (1996) have observed
increased rigidity of the systems fixed with positional bicortical screws in linear
pattern than those with a miniplate and four monocortical screws. In turn, the inverted
"L" pattern is the one that has been mostly compared with monocortical fixation
techniques, whereas all studies employing this methodology suggested that fixation with
bicortical screws results in greater resistance to displacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Regarding the hybrid groups, it has been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> that the
addition of a bicortical screw in the retromolar region substantially increases the
capacity of stabilizing sagittal osteotomy in systems with miniplates and monocortical
screws<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, the hybrid
systems have demonstrated greater resistance than the systems with three bicortical
screws in linear pattern.</p><p>Another hybrid alternative to enhance the biomechanical resistance of a system is the
use of a 4-hole miniplate, whereas the two proximal holes receive bicortical screws and
the two distal holes receive monocortical screws. Ozden, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> (2006) reported that this technique was
more resistant than the technique using miniplates and simply monocortical screws. This
technique was though inferior to the method using three bicortical screws in inverted
"L" pattern. However, when another bicortical screw was added to the basilar and distal
region of the proximal segment in the hybrid group, the results were similar to the
group in inverted "L" pattern.</p><p>Clinically, it is difficult to measure the extent to which bone repair can be damaged by
these differences of resistance among these three fixation techniques. Although in some
clinical conditions, the surgeon will need to choose which type of fixation will offer
the best post-operatory results. The type (advancement, rebound, or asymmetry) and
amount of movement and the exact position between the proximal and distal segments can
critically influence the degree of bone contact and the quality of the surface which
will receive the fixation material.</p><p>The load peaks (maximum force) generated in some specimens during the bending test
probably occurred due to the sudden reductions in biomechanical resistance of the system
at some moment during load application, and this could have been the point of failure.
In the other specimens, there was a progression of loading and displacement without the
occurrence of peaks, so the final displacement (8 mm) was considered as the point of
failure. One should consider, however, that an 8-mm displacement is far in excess of the
clinical and radiographic limit of what would be considered a failure of the fixation
system. According to Ardary, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup>
(1989), this limit would be 1 mm.</p><p>Some anatomical limitations, such as tooth position, location of the inferior alveolar
nerve, thin alveolar walls after the extraction of third molars during sagittal
osteotomy, minimum surface of overlapping between distal and proximal segments, or even
incorrect fractures, can make the use of three bicortical screws impracticable. In other
words, not always is the clinical situation favorable to the use of the most resistant
technique. The results of this work indicate that the hybrid technique or the fixation
with two miniplates and monocortical screws are good options regarding resistance to
displacement, as effective as SIF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>According to the methodology proposed and to the obtained results, it can be concluded
that fixations in inverted "L" pattern, hybrid method with two bicortical screws and one
miniplate or two miniplates with monocortical screws showed similar results when linear
loading was applied.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anucul</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Waite</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><name><surname>Lemons</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title><italic>In vitro</italic> strength analysis of sagittal split
