game training on the balance abilities of students with intellectual disabilities.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four students with intellectual disabilities were selected
and randomly divided into Wii Fit balance game training, physical education, and sedentary
activity groups. The Wii Fit balance game training group received two 40-minute Wii Fit
balance game training sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. Kruskal-Wallis one-way
analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to compare differences.
[Results] After eight weeks of training, the Wii Fit balance game training group showed
significant differences between the pre- and post-training parameters, including the
duration of standing on one leg with the eyes closed, average anteroposterior movement
speed, swing area per unit time, and speed strength index. The physical education group
showed significant differences between the pre- and post-training speed strength index
values. The sedentary activity group did not show any significant differences between the
pre- and post-training parameters. [Conclusion] Wii Fit balance game training can improve
static balance and lower extremity muscle strength in students with intellectual
disabilities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Students with intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although the main characteristic of people with intellectual disabilities is impairment of
intellectual ability, some studies have also noted significantly poorer motor nerve systems,
sensory integration, motor development, and sport performance compared with the normal
population. Thus, people with intellectual disabilities have a higher chance of falling<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The main factor leading to falls among this population is the lack of ability to control
balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because of long-term
overprotection by their caregivers or previous frustrations with achieving physical
abilities, people with intellectual disabilities often have unsuccessful physical
experiences, which hinders motor development. In this context, regular exercise can increase
not only balance abilities but also cardiovascular fitness, muscular fitness, and
flexibility. Regular exercise can also reduce the risk of development of many chronic
diseases in people with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>Recently, rapid technological development has produced many virtual reality game systems,
such as the Wii developed by Nintendo in 2006 and the Kinect for Xbox 360 introduced in
2010. Virtual reality utilizes computer simulations to produce a three-dimensional virtual
world and provides users with real world-like simulations involving vision, hearing, and
movement<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality games have
been widely used in medicine and rehabilitation for stroke patients, cerebral palsy
patients, psychiatric patients, and the elderly<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
application of virtual reality has many advantages, including the absence of restrictions in
the implementation environment, fixed training content, reduced costs, improved motivation,
safe training, and life-like experiences with demanding or unfamiliar sports<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, virtual reality training has
rarely been used in education. This study investigated the capacity of Wii Fit balance games
to improve the balance abilities of students with intellectual disabilities and utilized
this type of training to potentially improve these abilities in this particular population,
thereby decreasing the chance of future occupational injuries once the students enter
employment and reducing their risks in daily life due to poor balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Purposive sampling was applied to select 24 students with intellectual disabilities. All
the parents or guardians agreed to the participation of their children by signing a
statement of informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
National Taichung University of Education and was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. The students were randomly divided into Wii Fit balance game
training, physical education, and sedentary activity groups, with 8 students in each group.
The Wii Fit balance game training group received two 40-minute Wii Fit balance game training
sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. The physical education group underwent a general
physical education course that involved jogging and jumping rope. The sedentary activity
group experienced 8 weeks of sedentary activity. Characteristics of the subjects are listed

There were no significant differences in height, weight, or the degree of
mental retardation among the three groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>This study consisted of three experiments. The first experiment measured static balance by
having the subject stand on one leg with his/her eyes closed; the reliability and validity
of this method of measurement have been reported to be 0.87 and 0.864, respectively<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The second experiment measured dynamic balance using the Timed Up and Go test; the
reliability and validity of this method of measurement have been reported to be 0.87 and
0.864, respectively<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The third experiment measured lower limb muscle strength
(speed strength index during rapid standing).</p><p>The static balance measurement in this study required the subjects to stand barefoot on a
force plate (Kistler model 9286AA, 100&#x02005;Hz) with their hands on their hips and their body in
an upright posture. Upon hearing the start signal, the subjects closed their eyes, lifted
the nondominant leg, and then returned the leg to the force plate upon loss of balance.
After completing one round of measurement, which lasted for as long as the subject stood on
one leg with their eyes closed, the subjects were asked to sit on an experimental chair that
was placed on a path containing a force plate with their feet naturally resting on the force
plate. Upon hearing the start signal, the subjects immediately stood up, walked to a yellow
line nine meters in front of their position, and returned to sit on the experimental chair.
Dynamic balance and lower extremity muscle strength were simultaneously measured at the
moment when the subject stood up to walk.</p><p>Many studies focusing on specific groups have used median values of experimental data for
data analysis<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
the subjects were measured 3 times before (pre-training data) and after (post-training data)
training, and the median values of the three tests were used for analysis and comparison.
The independent variables were the different intervention methods, and the dependent
variables included the dynamic and static balance parameters and the speed strength index.
Kruskal-Wallis single-factor analysis of variance was used to compare the homogeneity of the
subjects in the Wii Fit balance game training, sedentary activity, and physical education
groups, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare differences between the pre-
and post-training parameters of subjects within each of the groups. The significance level
was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The pre-training static and dynamic balance and lower extremity muscle strength data were

Md: median; QD: interquartile range</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the pre- and post-training parameters, including static balance, dynamic
balance ability, and lower extremity muscle strength, for each group. In the Wii Fit balance
game training group, the static balance parameter showed a significant increase of 7.7
seconds for the duration of standing on one leg with the eyes closed (p=0.012). The pre- and
post-training anteroposterior movement speeds were 16.3&#x02005;cm per second and 11.7&#x02005;cm per
second, respectively. The post-training anteroposterior movement speed was significantly
reduced by 4.6&#x02005;cm per second compared with the pre-training speed, which suggests that the
training significantly reduced this parameter (p=0.036). The pre- and post-training swing
area per second values were 0.7&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.2&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively,
representing a significant decrease of 0.5&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> in this parameter (p=0.012).
Regarding dynamic balance ability, the pre-training value for the Timed Up and Go test was
15.9 seconds. After eight weeks of training, this time improved to 14.8 seconds,
representing a reduction of 1.1 seconds. Thus, the subjects in the Wii Fit balance game
training group were faster in the Timed Up and Go test, although the difference was not
significant (p=0.069). For lower extremity muscle strength, the pre- and post-training speed
strength index values were 3.0 times the body weight per second and 3.5 times the body
weight per second, respectively, representing a significant increase of 0.5 times the body
weight per second among subjects in the Wii Fit balance game training group (p=0.017).</p><p>The physical education group did not show any significant differences between the pre- and
post-training parameters, with the exception of the speed strength index (p=0.017), and the
sedentary activity group did not show any significant differences between the pre- and
post-training parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Because previous studies reported that short balance training programs (4 or 5.5 weeks) did
not lead to significant effects on the ability to control posture and balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, this study was designed to include 8
weeks of training. Pre-training data were collected in the week prior to training, and
post-training data were collected during the 8th week of training.</p><p>Longer durations of standing on one leg with the eyes closed indicate an improved ability
to maintain and control body posture. The duration of standing on one leg with the eyes
closed significantly improved in the Wii Fit balance game training group after eight weeks
of training. The physical education group also showed an improved standing time, although
the difference was not significant. After eight weeks of sedentary activity, the sedentary
activity group showed a reduced duration of standing on one leg with the eyes closed,
although the difference was not significant. These findings are consistent with those of Kuo
et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, who provided Wii Fit training
to children with special needs. Both studies found that Wii Fit balance games could be used
to increase the duration of standing on one leg with the eyes closed. Many researchers and
clinicians have begun to use the speed of the foot center of pressure to assess changes in
the foot center of pressure. The average speed of movement of the foot center of pressure is
related to muscle contraction and stretching changes, with a smaller average speed
indicating a better ability to control posture and balance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Wii Fit balance
training group showed a significant improvement in anteroposterior movement speed,
indicating that training enhanced the ability of these subjects to control body posture.
After eight weeks of physical education, the physical education group showed improvements in
anteroposterior and mediolateral movement speeds, although the differences were not
significant. This result may be related to the design of the physical education activities.
The sedentary activity group showed an increase in mediolateral movement speed, indicating
increased foot pressure center offset and increased body sway, but the difference was not
significant. The foot center of pressure swing area is related to visual function,
proprioception, and center of gravity<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Smaller foot center of pressure swing
area values indicate greater posture stability<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, all three groups
showed a reduced swing area per second, but the difference between the pre- and
post-training values was significant in only the Wii Fit balance game training group. This
result indicated that the subjects in the Wii Fit balance game training group showed a
significant improvement in posture stability after eight weeks of training.</p><p>A shorter Timed Up and Go test time indicates that a subject can complete the actions of
getting up from the chair, walking some distance, returning to the chair, and sitting still
in a shorter time and that the subject has better dynamic balance ability. Although the
differences in the pre- and post-training values for the Timed Up and Go test were not
significant, the Wii Fit balance game training group showed a reduction of 1.1 seconds, the
physical education group showed a reduction of 0.8 seconds, and the sedentary activity group
showed an increase of 1.1 seconds. The characteristics of virtual reality games enable them
to attract students with short attention spans. Students with intellectual disabilities, who
were often ignored in physical education in the past, showed considerable interest in
participating in Wii Fit balance game training. After eight weeks of Wii Fit balance game
training, the subjects in this group exhibited a significant improvement in static balance
but no significant progress in dynamic balance ability. One explanation may be related to
the design of the Wii Fit balance games. Among the Wii Fit balance games, Soccer Heading,
Ski Slalom, Table Tilt, Snowboard Slalom, Balance Bubble and Penguin Slide are all static
balance training games, whereas Tightrope Walk and Ski Jump are dynamic balance ability
training games. It is possible that the higher number of static balance training games led
to significant progress in static, but not dynamic, balance ability.</p><p>Lower extremity muscle strength is very important for daily life and the career adaptation
of people with intellectual disabilities. Frey et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that people with mild mental disabilities could
effectively improve their muscle strength after exercise and training. In the present study,
both the Wii Fit balance game training and physical education groups showed significant
improvements in muscle strength, suggesting that both types of training can enhance lower
extremity muscle strength. In contrast, the sedentary activity group did not show a
significant improvement. Balance ability has been reported to be closely related to lower
limb muscle strength<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
present study found that the physical education group significantly improved lower limb
muscle strength but not dynamic and static balance abilities. Whether the lack of
significant progress in balance ability in these subjects was due to influences of the
sensory system, central nervous system, or other factors requires further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, Wii Fit balance game training can improve the static balance ability and
lower extremity muscle strength in students with intellectual disabilities. Additionally,
Wii Fit is fun for the whole family, is not restricted by time or space, and is safe. It is
recommend that Wii Fit training systems be provided to the families of students with poor
