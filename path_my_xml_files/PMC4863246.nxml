This study tests a hypothesis that specific immunotherapy (SIT) plus oral Cb (an over-the-counter probiotic) alleviates the UC symptoms. In this study, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, clinical study at our hospital. A total of 80 patients with relapsing-remitting ulcerative colitis and high levels of specific IgE antibody was randomly divided into 4 groups, and were treated with SIT or/and Cb, or placebo, respectively for 1 year. The results showed that a food antigen-specific Th2 polarization immune response was observed in UC patients with food allergy (FA). The frequency of regulatory B cells was significantly less in UC patients with FA as compared with healthy subjects. The UC patients with FA were treated with SIT and Cb showed significant amelioration of UC clinical symptoms, reduction of using UC-control medicines, and suppression of the skewed Th2 polarization, which did not occur in those treated with either SIT alone, or Cb alone, or placebo. In conclusion, combination of SIT and Cb efficiently alleviates a fraction of UC patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, including two major types, Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). UC mainly affects the colon, while CD can affect the whole digestive tract<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. IBD can be one of the following types, collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, diversion colitis, Beh&#x000e7;et&#x02019;s disease and indeterminate colitis. However, no disease specific markers are currently known in the blood, enabling the reliable separation of CD and UC patients. The pathogenesis of IBD is less understood currently.</p><p>Investigators intend to consider IBD as a complex disease which arises as a result of the interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Published data indicate that alterations to internal bacteria may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Decrease in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes IBD has been noted in 30&#x02013;50% IBD patients, which may disturb the biodiversity of commensal bacteria in the intestinal tract. A portion of IBD patients reported that they were prescribed antibiotics in the last 2&#x02013;5 years before the IBD symptoms occurred<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Food allergy (FA) may be another possible cause of IBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> as mast cells can be sensitized by the antigen-specific IgE. Re-exposure to specific antigens can activate mast cells and induce mast cells to release proinflammatory cytokines and some other chemical mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, which are sufficient to induce intestinal inflammation. Since the antigen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is an effective remedy for the treatment of allergic disorders, we hypothesize that SIT may alleviate the clinical symptoms of IBD. On the other hand, based on the feature of improving immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, probiotics are employed in the treatment of IBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Thus, in this study, we specifically treated a group of UC patients with FA (hereinafter, FA-UC) with SIT and probiotics. We observed that although treating with either SIT alone or probiotics alone did not show an apparent therapeutic effect on UC, treating with both SIT and probiotics significantly improved the clinical symptoms of UC.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Assessment of food antigen specific immune response in UC patients</title><p>To investigate a potential relationship between IBD and food antigens, we collected the peripheral blood from 80 UC patients with FA history (FA-UC patients); 72 UC patients without FA history (NFA-UC patients) and 20 healthy subjects. The PBMCs were challenged with specific food antigens in the culture for 3 days; the supernatant was analyzed by ELISA. The results showed that the specific IgE was detected in both groups of UC patients, which was significantly higher in FA-UC patients than in nFA-UC patients. Although the healthy subjects did not have the FA history, low levels of specific IgE were also detected, which was compatible with that in nFA-UC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p>We also analyzed the representative cytokines of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the culture supernatant by ELISA. The results showed that the levels of IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and IL-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>) were higher in UC patients with FA than those UC patients without allergy. The levels of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>) were higher in those nFA-UC patients than those FA-UC patients. The specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected in the FA-UC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F,G</xref>). After challenge with OVA (the specific antigen) in the culture, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from FA-UC produced higher levels of IL-4 than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from nFA-UC patients and healthy subjects, while the levels of IFN-&#x003b3; were uniquely higher in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell culture of nFA-UC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1G</xref>). The results indicate that a specific immune response exists in the FA-UC patients. The results indicate the FA-UC patients have a skewed antigen-specific Th2 response in the body.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The frequency of regulatory B cells is lower in UC patients with FA</title><p>We then analyzed the regulatory B cells (Breg) in the peripheral blood. With the same batch of samples of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, we assessed the frequency of IL-10<sup>+</sup> B cells (Breg) in the PBMC by flow cytometry. The results showed that, as compared with healthy subjects, the frequency of Bregs was lower in FA-UC patients. In the nFA-UC patients, although the frequency of Bregs was lower than healthy subjects, it did not reach the significant levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Combination of specific immunotherapy (SIT) and <italic>C. butyricum</italic> improves UC</title><p>The FA-UC patients were randomly divided into four groups and treated with SIT or/and <italic>C. butyricum</italic> (Cb), or placebo, respectively, for 12 months. The design was double blind to avoid the observer bias. As shown by the truncated Mayo scores, Both of the SIT group and Cb group showed UC symptom improvement somehow, but did not reach the significant value; the SIT/Cb group showed marked improvement in UC symptoms. No statistical changes were observed in the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). When necessary, the patients were allowed to take regular medicines (mesalamine or/and prednisone; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) during the study period. The results showed that the combination with SIT/Cb significantly reduced the medication scores, while patients treated with either SIT alone, or Cb alone, or placebo, did not show statistical changes in their medication scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The results indicate that the combination of SIT and Cb can markedly improve the clinical symptoms of UC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Combination of SIT and Cb improves the immunity of UC</title><p>The effect of SIT or/and Cb administration on serum specific IgE, IL-4, IL-13, IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, Bregs and serum specific IgG4 of UC patients with FA was evaluated before and after the treatment. As shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, the treatment with SIT/Cb significantly decreased the serum levels of specific IgE, IL-4, IL-13 and TNF-&#x003b1;, and increased the frequency of peripheral Bregs and serum IgG4. The serum levels of IFN-&#x003b3; were only slightly altered. Those treated with either SIT alone or Cb alone, and placebo did not show improvement in the immune parameters. The results indicate that the treatment with SIT/Cb can markedly improve the immunity of FA-UC patients.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current therapeutic remedies for IBD mostly focus on the symptom control. Two major categories of medicines, including 5-aminosalicylate and steroids, are commonly prescribed for IBD patients. The role of 5-aminosalicylate is to inhibit inflammation. The purpose of using steroids is to suppress immune response. Although these medicines are quite effective for control IBD clinical symptoms, once stopping medication, the IBD clinical symptoms relapse sooner or later. For the purpose of seeking an effective remedy for IBD, the present study treated a group of FA-UC patients with SIT and Cb. Although either SIT alone or Cb alone did not show an apparent therapeutic effect on the suppression of UC symptoms, a combination of SIT and Cb resulted in much better results on alleviating UC.</p><p>In this study, we observed a skewed Th2 response in FA-UC patients. They had positive skin test results for one or more food antigens. This is the relative reliable evidence to diagnose FA. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of food antigen-specific IgE and the presence of food antigen-specific Th2 cells in the peripheral blood system. Thus, the FA in these UC patients was active. The relation between IBD and FA has been discussed in the literature. Such as Judaki <italic>et al.</italic> indicate that there is a significant relationship between UC and cow milk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. UC patients who are allergic to dairy products and the use of dairy products can increase the severity of UC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Kawaguchi <italic>et al.</italic> indicate that the serum levels of food antigen-specific antibodies were significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. For those have an apparent FA history IBD patients, to avoid taking the offending foods may be one way to avoid IBD attack. But in the case of the FA is at the sub-clinical status, it is better to screen the FA status in IBD patients to find the offending antigens to eliminate those foods from their diets.</p><p>SIT is a specific remedy for the treatment of allergic diseases recommended by the World Health Organization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and is extensively used in the treatment of allergic diseases. We also used SIT to treat the FA-UC patients in this study. However, treating with SIT alone did not get satisfactory outcomes in the alleviation of the UC clinical symptoms. Others also observed similar phenomenon. Such as Roger <italic>et al.</italic> treated a group of patients with allergic rhinitis and found that the SIT had no significant effect on concentrations of total IgE, specific IgE or Th2 cytokines, although satisfactory relief of allergic rhinitis symptoms was declared by most patients in the period of the treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Glover <italic>et al.</italic> found that no effect of SIT on asthma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>It got much better results on alleviating the UC clinical symptoms when we treated FA-UC patients with both SIT and Cb. To treat IBD with probiotics has been reported. Rembacken <italic>et al.</italic> suggest that treatment with a non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> has an equivalent effect to mesalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Bibiloni <italic>et al.</italic> treated UC patients with probiotics VSL#3 and resulted in 77% remission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, no apparent alleviation of the UC clinical symptoms was observed in those treated with Cb alone as shown by the present data. The difference between our data and previous data may be because we used different probiotics. Others also found that administration of <italic>L. johnsonii</italic> LA1 did not have a sufficient effect to prevent the endoscopic recurrence of CD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>After treatment with SIT/Cb, we observed a regulatory effect on the skewed Th2 response and increase in peripheral Bregs in the FA-UC patients. This is in line with a recent report. Shi <italic>et al.</italic> observed that the combination of SIT and Cb inhibited the FA-induced intestinal Th2 inflammation in a mouse model, in which the antigen-specific Bregs were increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Breg is one of the major types of immune regulatory cells in the body. By releasing IL-10<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> or transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, Bregs suppress skewed immune responses; such as inhibit food antigen-related inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>We found a low level of allergen-specific IgE was detected in the sera of healthy subjects. These healthy subjects did not have allergic disease history. Thus, the production of allergen-specific IgE is not the sole factor to initiate allergic diseases.</p><p>In summary, the present data show that a portion of UC patients has skewed antigen-specific Th2 polarization. Treatment with SIT and Cb can regulate the skewed immune response and alleviate UC clinical symptoms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human Subjects</title><p>UC patients with or without food allergy (FA) were recruited into this study.
