The cohort multiple randomized controlled trial (cmRCT) is an innovative design with the potential to overcome those challenges. In cmRCT, a prospective cohort serves as an infrastructure for multiple RCTs. We implemented cmRCT in a clinical breast cancer setting by creating UMBRELLA&#x02014;a large prospective cohort of breast cancer and DCIS patients/survivors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">For all participants, clinical data and patient-reported outcomes (PROs, i.e., quality of life, fatigue, anxiety and depression, physical activity, work ability, and cosmetic satisfaction) are being collected at regular time-intervals for a period of 10&#x000a0;years. These data are being used both for observational and randomized studies. For each intervention to be tested against standard care, a subcohort of eligible patients is identified within UMBRELLA. From this subcohort, a random sample of patients is offered the intervention. Their outcomes are compared to the outcomes of patients receiving standard care.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">So far, between October 2013 and July 2016, we have recruited 1308 participants. In this period, 1308/1486 (88%) patients who were invited for participation in UMBRELLA consented to cohort participation. Of these patients, 1138 (87%) gave broad consent for randomization to future interventions. Return rate for PROs at baseline were 80%, and varied from 67 to 74% during follow-up. Several observational studies&#x02014;and the first randomized intervention study&#x02014;are currently ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Results from UMBRELLA show that this novel study design is feasible and acceptable to patients in a clinical breast cancer setting. We invite researchers who are interested in conducting randomized or observational studies within the UMBRELLA cohort to contact the UMBRELLA scientific advisory board.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>DCIS</kwd><kwd>cmRCT</kwd><kwd>Prospective cohort</kwd><kwd>Patient-reported outcomes</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">With a lifetime risk of one in seven, breast cancer is an important public health concern among women in the Western world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Due to earlier detection and better treatment, breast cancer survival has improved substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, current treatment is associated with substantial morbidity, including lymphedema, breast deformities, (chronic) pain, and fatigue. Therefore, new breast cancer treatments should not only focus on further improving (progression-free) survival, but should also aim for good quality of life (QoL), functional outcomes, and satisfying cosmetic results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Interventions aiming to achieve these purposes include minimally invasive treatment of the primary tumor (e.g., axillary irradiation instead of surgery, radiofrequency ablation), as well as lifestyle interventions (e.g., dietary interventions, exercise programs, supportive health apps) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Before implementation in routine care, these interventions would ideally be evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to confirm whether theoretical benefits translate into actual benefits for patients.</p><p id="Par7">RCTs are the gold standard in comparative research, but often face many challenges. RCTs often are beset by slow recruitment, leading to 40% of cancer trials ending prematurely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which is unethical with regards to patients unnecessarily being exposed to potentially harmful or inferior interventions, as well as a waste of time and resources. In the field of breast cancer, the large amount of new interventions entering the market makes it virtually impossible to adequately evaluate each intervention in a separate RCT. It is also complicated to directly compare different interventions tested in separate trials, due to differences in inclusion criteria, outcome measures, and follow-up schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. RCTs often suffer from limited generalizability due to strict inclusion criteria and selective participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. When highly desired interventions are being evaluated, patients are often disappointed when allocated to the control arm, which may result in drop-out, cross-over, and/or disappointment bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. And lastly, for physicians, the informed consent procedure is cumbersome, as they have to explain (at least) two treatment options that they cannot both with certainty offer to their patients.</p><p id="Par8">In order to deal with these challenges, the cohort multiple randomized controlled trial (cmRCT) design was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this design, a prospective cohort serves as an infrastructure for multiple RCTs. Advantages of the cmRCT design have been described previously, and include efficient use of control patients, improved comparison between different trialed interventions, enhanced generalizability, and reduced disappointment bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Clinical and methodological experts in the field of breast cancer combined their knowledge to create a cohort of breast cancer patients according to the cmRCT design&#x02014;&#x02018;Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaLuAtion&#x02019; (UMBRELLA).

</p><p id="Par36">Return rates for questionnaires at baseline were 80%, and varied from 67 to 74% during follow-up (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Sixty percent of patients chose to fill out PROs online, while 40% opted for paper questionnaires.</p><p id="Par37">Descriptive baseline results already provide some insight into patients&#x02019; perspectives during and after treatment. Baseline scores for health-related QoL domains are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Compared to patients who returned the baseline questionnaires, nonresponders were slightly younger (54 vs. 58&#x000a0;years), and a higher proportion of nonresponders were treated with mastectomy (23 vs. 15%) and loco-regional radiotherapy (19 vs. 13%).</p><p id="Par38">Within the cohort, several longitudinal observational studies are investigating PROs in relation to patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Studies in progress include, for example, a study on lymphedema of the breast after breast-conserving treatment (incidence, determinants, and the effect of edema on health-related QoL). In another study the association between cardiovascular events and presence of coronary artery calcium on radiotherapy planning CT scans was investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This study showed that one in four breast cancer patients planned for radiotherapy have coronary artery calcium, which is known to be a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Within UMBRELLA, Knuttel et al. assessed preferences of breast cancer patients and healthy women regarding new non- and minimally invasive breast cancer treatment options, compared to conventional surgical treatments. These results may be helpful to guide the development of innovative breast cancer therapies and randomized studies to evaluate these novel techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Also, the first randomized comparison within UMBRELLA is currently ongoing (FIT trial). The FIT trial evaluates the effect of an exercise program on QoL in breast cancer survivors with low levels of physical activity 12&#x02013;18&#x000a0;months after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Strengths of UMBRELLA</title><p id="Par40">The major strengths of UMBRELLA are that we systematically invite all eligible patients to participate in UMBRELLA, the high participation rate, the longitudinal capturing of PROs, and the ability to foster multiple trials within a longitudinal cohort. By systematically inviting all eligible patients, and by keeping the physician out of the informed consent procedure, selection is minimized. Due to the high participation rate, UMBRELLA provides a representative study sample.</p><p id="Par41">In UMBRELLA, a wide range of PROs are systematically collected. PROs are becoming increasingly important endpoints to better understand patients&#x02019; symptoms, experiences, health-related QoL, and side effects of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Such outcomes will be important when determining which new treatments will be implemented in routine care and will provide valuable input for the process of shared decision-making.</p><p id="Par42">UMBRELLA follows the cmRCT design, which is associated with several advantages. It has the unique ability to facilitate multiple randomized evaluations of (experimental) interventions. Patients may participate in several cmRCTs simultaneously (which may sometimes require stratified randomization if interactions between interventions is to be expected). Direct comparison between interventions is possible, because all trials are conducted within the same study population, making use of the same follow-up scheme and available outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patients who are not selected for an intervention (the controls) are not informed about interventions under study, which reduces the risk of disappointment bias and contamination compared to classic RCTs. Furthermore, physicians and researchers only explain an intervention that they can <italic>actually</italic> offer to the patient. This reduces the workload of physicians participating in trials, as they only have to explain experimental interventions to patients in the intervention arm.</p><p id="Par43">By adopting a staged-informed consent procedure, we separated consent for cohort participation from consent for accepting interventions after being randomly selected. Instead of receiving a large amount of study information at once, UMBRELLA participants only receive the essential information they need, at the time they need it to make a well-informed decision. This resembles the way information is shared in routine care, thus potentially increasing generalizability to a clinical setting and potentially increasing patients&#x02019; ability to process and understand the informed consent procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Limitations of UMBRELLA</title><p id="Par44">One of the limitations of UMBRELLA is that we only include patients referred for radiotherapy. As a result, around 60% of all invasive breast cancer and DCIS patients are eligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We have recently obtained ethical approval to expand our cohort to patients without an indication for radiotherapy.</p><p id="Par45">Clinical data collected in this cohort are generated in routine care, and are therefore rather pragmatic. Endpoints for trials within UMBRELLA need to be part of the predefined outcomes being measured for all patients. However, it is possible to collect additional data for specific studies if required.</p><p id="Par46">Since cmRCT is a rather new design, several aspects still need further exploration. For instance, an in-depth evaluation of statistical approaches when running multiple trials with potential for interaction between treatments has not yet been performed.</p><p id="Par47">Finally, the questionnaire return rates slowly decrease over time. This is a problem that many other prospective cohort studies encounter. In our cohort we are actively informing patients about results of studies conducted with cohort data in the hopes of keeping participants actively involved and motivated to return the questionnaires.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Collaborators of the UMBRELLA Study Group are listed in &#x0201c;Acknowledgment&#x0201d;.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by an intramural Grant from the Department of Radiation Oncology and the Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands.
