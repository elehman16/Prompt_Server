Participants were 54 children aged under 6&#x02009;years with a diagnosis of autism, assigned to either intervention or control conditions. The app engaged children, who played consistently, regardless of developmental level, and was rated highly by parents. There were no significant group differences in parent-report measures post-intervention, nor in a measure of parent&#x02013;child play at follow-up. Therefore, this intervention did not have an observable impact on real-world social communication skills and caution is recommended about the potential usefulness of iPad<sup>&#x02122;</sup> apps for amelioration of difficulties in interaction. However, positive attitudes among participants, lack of harms and the potential of apps to deliver therapeutic content at low economic cost suggest this approach is worth pursuing further, perhaps targeting other skill domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autism spectrum disorder</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>social communication</kwd><kwd>technology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Technology-based interventions have proven successful in teaching new skills to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref rid="bibr20-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Grynszpan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Pennington, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Ramdoss et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref rid="bibr40-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>). Social skills are often considered a priority focus for autism intervention (<xref rid="bibr47-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2007</xref>), and technology-based training, despite being considered a &#x02018;non-social&#x02019; medium, has also been successfully applied to this target (<xref rid="bibr2-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Beaumont and Sofronoff, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Ramdoss et al., 2012</xref>). However, there is still a dearth of high-quality trials of technological interventions for autism (<xref rid="bibr20-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Grynszpan et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, until now technological interventions have not been provided for very young children, probably because the skills required to access the traditional computer interfaces of keyboard and mouse are beyond most pre-schoolers&#x02019; abilities (<xref rid="bibr5-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2014</xref>). Even when working with older children, computer-based learning studies have often had to incorporate an extended period of teaching basic computer skills before the intervention could be accessed (<xref rid="bibr23-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The advent of touchscreen tablets (such as the iPad<sup>&#x02122;</sup>) means that we can now explore the delivery of therapeutic and educational content to very young children using technology (<xref rid="bibr7-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000ed;ez-Juan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Kagohara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Murdock et al., 2013</xref>). This approach brings together the belief in early intervention as the best opportunity for children with ASD (<xref rid="bibr44-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Wallace and Rogers, 2010</xref>) with the specific advantages of technology. These include the use of a highly motivating medium with integrated rewards, close control of learning rate and content and personalisation to the child&#x02019;s own preferences (<xref rid="bibr10-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher-Watson, 2014</xref>). For example, if children with ASD have specific difficulties using social cues as feedback for learning (<xref rid="bibr3-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Bedford et al., 2013</xref>), non-social rewards embedded in computer games may be more effective. In addition, the intervention has the potential to be immediately and widely shared with an international community of beneficiaries. Given the popularity of touchscreen technologies among families with children with autism, combined with a lack of good evidence, there is a pressing need for well-designed studies in this area (<xref rid="bibr5-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>What is an appropriate target for a technology-based intervention for pre-schoolers with ASD? One possibility is joint attention (<xref rid="bibr4-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Charman, 2003</xref>) which has been established in research as an important skill in both typical and atypical development (<xref rid="bibr33-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Moore and Dunham, 1995</xref>). Joint attention abilities have been linked to later language and to social interaction profiles in autism (<xref rid="bibr35-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Mundy and Newell, 2007</xref>). Moreover, the consistent presence of joint attention impairments among children with ASD means that this is a key item in early screening and diagnostic instruments (e.g. <xref rid="bibr31-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Lord et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Wetherby and Prizant, 2002</xref>). Joint attention and related social communication skills are often the explicit focus of early intervention strategies (<xref rid="bibr26-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Kaale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Kasari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr50-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Kwan, 2010</xref>), which are usually therapist-led. Such interventions have been modestly successful in improving joint attention abilities in young children with ASD, but overall findings are mixed with a lack of evidence for generalisation to novel settings and maintenance in long-term follow-up in particular (<xref rid="bibr14-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher-Watson et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, therapist-led interventions such as these involve a very high financial investment which could be reduced by the use of technology-based support.</p><p>Joint attention at its most complex involves co-ordinated, triadic attention between the child, another person and an object, cued by eye-gaze, gestures such as pointing, and verbal cues (e.g. &#x02018;look at that!&#x02019;). This is challenging to re-create in a technological learning environment. However, joint attention also builds on important developmental precursors including looking at other people, and following their cues &#x02013; looking where they are looking or pointing (<xref rid="bibr42-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Striano and Reid, 2006</xref>). It is established that these sub-skills are also frequently absent among young children with autism (<xref rid="bibr6-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Dawson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Leekam et al., 1998</xref>). Targeting intervention at these basic components of social attention has the theoretical potential to trigger a cascade of social communication development. Such cascading effects, from a proximal intervention target to distal social and communication behaviours, or from a specific skill to the global array of features of autism, have been emphasised in recent intervention trial reports (e.g.(<xref rid="bibr19-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2010</xref>)) and reviews of the literature (<xref rid="bibr51-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Yoder et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This study evaluates the impact of a specially-developed iPad application (hereafter &#x02018;app&#x02019;) called FindMe on these two basic social communication skills in young children with ASD. The development of the app included user-centred design and pilot testing to create an engaging app with a foundation in theoretical models of ASD development (<xref rid="bibr13-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher-Watson et al., 2013</xref>). FindMe aimed to enhance the real-world social communication skills of the children through motivating, daily rehearsal of very basic sub-skills. On occasion, screen-based technologies have been successful in teaching skills of relevance to face-to-face social interactions (for a review, see <xref rid="bibr39-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Ramdoss et al., 2012</xref>) but it is not clear whether this will be the case for this specific app and population. Nevertheless, for the intervention to have genuine therapeutic value, we believe it must show an impact on social communication behaviours in interaction with others, and not just improvement within the game, and thus efficacy is evaluated in this context. Thus, we hypothesise that children in the intervention group will show changes in social communication (e.g. eye contact, social response, directed vocalisation) observed in interaction with their caregiver. Treatment effects on the same social communication behaviours, and on language, measured using parent report, will also be evaluated.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-1362361315605624"><title>Method</title><sec id="section2-1362361315605624"><title>Design</title><p>The study used a randomised controlled design in which participants were allocated to either an Intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) or waitlist Control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) condition following baseline assessment.

As a break from other activities, the child was given an opportunity to interact with an iPad with a series of commercially available apps for pre-schoolers.

measure was a preliminary version of the brief observation of social communication change (BOSCC), an in-development way of scoring parent&#x02013;child interaction to provide a change-sensitive measure of key autistic behaviours (<xref rid="bibr21-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Grzadzinski et al., submitted</xref>). The measure was collected at Baseline and Follow-Up, though not immediately post-intervention. These time points were selected to reduce participant burden, but also to assess the developing effect of the intervention on complex social communication behaviours founded on the basic skills rehearsed within the app.</p><p>Parents and children were filmed for 10&#x02009;min playing with a standard set of toys with no specific instructions given. These episodes were then coded using a 16-item manifest to score behaviours familiar from the ADOS system, but in the context of a naturalistic parent&#x02013;child interaction. Items provide a comprehensive account of the key features associated with autism, such as <italic>Unusual Eye Contact</italic>, <italic>Quality of Social Overtures</italic> and <italic>Unusually Repetitive Interests or Stereotyped Behaviours.</italic> Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more atypical behaviour. The BOSCC provides a total score (using all core items, numbered 1&#x02013;13) and a social communication sub-score (using the first eight items only). In addition, there are three items (14&#x02013;16) which do not contribute to the total score, as these are designed instead to capture the child&#x02019;s mood at the assessment (e.g. anxiety, activity level). Scale internal consistency was good with Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.864 for items 1&#x02013;8 and 0.856 for items 1&#x02013;13 (using Baseline data).</p><p>To minimise risk of bias and reduce variability, all BOSCC codes from both Baseline and Follow-Up appointments were scored by a single, independent researcher (J.S.B.) who was trained on the BOSCC and blind to participant group. Using a random sampling procedure stratified across sessions, we selected one-third (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;36) of BOSCC recordings for inter-rater reliability evaluations. The second rater for inter-rater agreement was the first author (S.F.-W.), who was blind to the first rater&#x02019;s results but not blind to group or time point. Mean whole scale agreement (ratings within one point scored as agreements) was high at 83% between raters.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1362361315605624"><title>MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory &#x02013; words and gestures (MCDI)</title><p>This checklist of vocabulary was completed by all parents at Baseline, Outcome and Follow-Up assessments.

This last variable was captured by asking parents to provide an estimate of the amount of time their child spent watching TV per week, and the amount of time their child spent playing computer games per week. To increase precision, parents were prompted to consider weekday average screen time in each category, across settings and devices, and how this might vary at the weekend. The purpose of this variable was to permit exploration of possible interactions between response to intervention and experience with screen media more generally.</p></sec><sec id="section14-1362361315605624"><title>Reporting on game play</title><p>In the intervention group, we collected parent impressions of the app via a short, loosely scripted interview at Outcome.

The app was designed to give children an opportunity to rehearse two key social communication skills: attending to people and following social cues. In Part 1, the correct response was to touch the single person shown on the screen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1362361315605624">Figure 2</xref>). In Part 2, the character was depicted in a shop and looked and pointed to a desired item in one of six locations around the screen. The correct response was to touch the item being pointed and looked at; this was the only motor skill required to successfully play the app. Correct responses resulted in the child being awarded a token which appeared in the bottom left corner of the screen. Collection of five tokens resulted in presentation of a short animation sequence designed to provide a positive reinforcement. As the child progressed, levels increased in complexity with more distractors appearing on screen, and in Part 2, the character moved from pointing and looking, to just looking at a target.</p><fig id="fig2-1362361315605624" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Screenshots from the FindMe app.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1362361315605624-fig2"/></fig></sec><sec id="section17-1362361315605624"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Sample size was determined with reference to a previous evaluation of an intervention targeting social and communication skills, involving 28 pre-school children with ASDs and producing a large (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8) effect size for the ADOS social-communication algorithm following a 6-month intervention (<xref rid="bibr1-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Aldred et al., 2008</xref>).

We adopted an intention-to-treat model for analysis, in which missing values were replaced using the conservative method of carrying forward the last recorded observation for that measure.</p><p>All outcomes were calculated as change scores by calculating the difference between Baseline and Outcome or Follow-Up score for each individual, to create variables where a positive value indicates a positive change.

The mean number of days on which children actually played the app was 28 (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x02013;36 days). This play was distributed over a mean number of 1.7 unbroken &#x02018;sessions&#x02019; of play per day (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5&#x02013;1.9 sessions), each one lasting on average 11&#x02009;min (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.78&#x02009;min, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.2&#x02013;13.0&#x02009;min).</p><p>The total number of minutes played per child was skewed.

This median equates to game play of approximately 6&#x02009;min per session. In other words, to the extent that there was an &#x02018;average&#x02019; child in the intervention group, that child played the game about every second or third day for 10&#x02009;weeks, normally playing for 2 sessions per day, with each session lasting 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;min.</p><p>Only four children in the Intervention group failed to reach the most complex level of the game.

The trial design set a high bar for measuring benefit by selecting as the outcome measure a parent&#x02013;child play-based observational measure taken at the Follow-Up appointment and not immediately following the intervention. This decision was made because the theoretical model for the study design was that successful intervention influencing the developmental precursors of joint attention (attention to people, following social cues) could trigger a cascade of skill development which would be most apparent some time after the intervention period itself (<xref rid="bibr51-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Yoder et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we were judging the ability of the app to produce a generalised and sustained change in symptom-relevant real-world behaviour &#x02013; something which few technology-based interventions have achieved (<xref rid="bibr17-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Golan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Swettenham, 1996</xref>), but which is essential if technology-based interventions are to have clinically significant impact. Analyses did not reveal statistically significant effects of intervention on the primary outcome, nor on other measures, including parent-report measures taken immediately following the intervention period. This does not mean that no gains were made &#x02013; in contrast, we recorded substantial improvements in both groups across the majority of measures recorded.</p><p>Taken together, results indicate that the intervention did not have an immediate effect on the behaviours targeted by the app (e.g. parent report of following others&#x02019; points in the CSBS-DP) nor were there later downstream effects on social behaviours observed in naturalistic parent&#x02013;child interaction. We infer that the app failed to trigger the hypothesised learning cascade and attribute this to the challenge for the child to generalise a skill learnt within a two-dimensional animated game to a real-world scenario. Difficulty with generalisation is a component of some theoretical models of autism (<xref rid="bibr22-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Happ&#x000e9; and Frith, 2006</xref>), and other early social skills interventions have also uncovered limited generalisation of interventions in this population (<xref rid="bibr14-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher-Watson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="section25-1362361315605624"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study used a new measure as the primary outcome, which was administered at 6-month follow-up (when cascading intervention effects were predicted to be seen) but not immediately post-intervention. The authors had access to a pre-publication version of the measure including full definitions of items, specific ratings and decision trees designed to facilitate item-level inter-rater agreement. Nevertheless, while we demonstrated good inter-rater agreement, it is unclear how these findings relate to other intervention studies given the reliance on a measure which had not yet been established or validated in the literature (<xref rid="bibr21-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Grzadzinski et al., submitted</xref>). In particular, the lack of intervention effect is potentially attributable to a lack of sensitivity in measurement, though we also note that this absence of group-level effects was observed across all the measures employed, at both Outcome and Follow-Up. Identification of outcome measures which can be blind-rated and are sensitive to change on relevant dimensions is a pressing problem in early autism intervention research (<xref rid="bibr12-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher-Watson and McConachie, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">McConachie et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section26-1362361315605624"><title>Can apps provide beneficial effects?</title><p>The results of this study should be treated with caution. They do not imply that other apps for the iPad (or other devices) would not be beneficial, any more than a null effect in a therapist-led intervention could be used to discredit all therapist-led interventions. On the contrary, we believe that this study provides several positive findings which lead us to conclude that touchscreen mobile devices should continue to be investigated as a way to support the development of children with ASD.</p><p>This report demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial using iPads. While use of the app was variable, this mode of intervention delivery permitted detailed adherence data to be collected and incorporated into analyses. The relaxed instructions to parents mimicked real-life application of this kind of therapeutic support, increasing external validity of the findings (<xref rid="bibr25-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Jonsson et al., 2015</xref>). Concerns at the outset about the security of this approach were not upheld. Faults with the iPad and the app were rare and usually straightforward to fix. There were no problems with access of inappropriate content via the iPad and no parent reported concerns about the child becoming obsessive. Parent perceptions of the intervention were largely positive and it is probable that one of the main advantages of this kind of approach is in the potential beneficial impact on family life and reduction of burden. Some parents reported that their child was able to play and concentrate for longer using the FindMe app than with other toys, even at the end of the 2-month access period. Other parents enjoyed the iPad as a way to sit with their child while mutually focussing on a rewarding activity.</p><p>Our null finding emphasises the role of rigorously designed trials in the evaluation of supports for children with autism. Apps have proven popular (<xref rid="bibr5-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2014</xref>) and case-series designs have revealed promising uses of these technologies (e.g. <xref rid="bibr7-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000ed;ez-Juan et al., 2014</xref>). Our study does not refute these findings but does indicate that the impact of an app on behaviour may have its limits, and caution should be applied when recommending technology-based supports for this population. In particular, the claims made by commercial operators based on anecdotal reports would not necessarily stand up to scientific scrutiny. New research formats are required to keep pace with technological innovation and provide evidence of value to the community (<xref rid="bibr11-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher-Watson, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section27-1362361315605624"><title>Future directions</title><p>Other technology-based intervention strategies teaching social skills to people with ASD have similarly found limited effects on real-world behaviours (<xref rid="bibr17-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Golan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Swettenham, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2012</xref>).

We are also keen to explore how a child&#x02019;s individual learning needs could be matched to specific apps and monitored over time, in much the same way that experienced practitioners provide eclectic interpersonal therapies or medication regimes.</p><p>During this study, we did not evaluate iPad skills in themselves, though we were struck by how confident children were with the iPad even when their traditional play skills were limited. It is notable that there was no lower non-verbal ability limit for access to our app in this sample. In future, we hope that the skills required to access and manipulate technology will become more highly valued, just as reading is valued as a skill, regardless of the material being read. This is an area where children with ASD may be likely to shine. Cultivation of human&#x02013;computer interaction can open up independence, social communication and learning in groups otherwise excluded from mainstream activities (<xref rid="bibr8-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Durkin, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section28-1362361315605624"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This rigorously designed randomised controlled trial revealed no significant benefits of playing the FindMe app on real-world social communication behaviours. However, there are enough indications of positive impact, considering the broader context, to encourage us to explore this intervention delivery route further. It is possible that targeting social development via technology requires more support to bridge the gap from learning within a game environment to real-world interaction. Technologies could be more effectively applied to learning non-social skills (e.g. <xref rid="bibr45-1362361315605624" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2011</xref>) In future, we hope to be able to begin to link specific technologies to personal profiles and to combine technology more effectively with interpersonal therapeutic approaches.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors extend their thanks to Professor Catherine Lord and colleagues for providing access to the BOSCC for the purposes of this study.
