The indirect costs were those related to absenteeism from the workplace due to migraine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>129 of the 148 patients with a current history of migraine randomized to the two study drugs and completing the study were analyzed. The number of attacks treated with only 1 dose of study drug was higher with frovatriptan (157 vs. 147), whereas the number of attacks treated with &#x02265;2 doses of study medication was higher with rizatriptan (122 vs. 110 and 74 vs. 67, respectively). However, more patients treated with frovatriptan took a rescue medication (71 vs. 59). The total direct cost per attack (including study drug rescue medication) was 9.12 &#x020ac; for frovatriptan and 13.54 &#x020ac; for rizatriptan (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 between-treatments). As for indirect costs, in the group of patients treated with frovatriptan the mean number of lost working hours was significantly (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) lower (1.5&#x000a0;h) compared to the subjects who used rizatriptan (2.8&#x000a0;h). Based on the earned income per unit of work, indirect costs per attack resulted to be 24.55 &#x020ac; for frovatriptan and 45.84 &#x020ac; for rizatriptan. Overall, the total costs, including direct and indirect costs, were evaluated to be 33.67 &#x020ac; for frovatriptan and 59.38 &#x020ac; for rizatriptan, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the limitations of this model analysis, frovatriptan was found to be significantly more cost-effective than rizatriptan. This outcome can be explained by the lower acquisition cost of frovatriptan, the need for fewer doses, and the loss of fewer working hours.

Studies conducted around the world have consistently shown that migraine affects approximately 12&#x02013;15% of the general adult population. This disorder is widespread across the world, mostly affecting young and middle-aged people, and is two-to three-times more common in women than in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Migraine patients differ in their management needs, largely due to the variation in severity of symptoms and their impact on the sufferer. Acute medications are needed by all migraineurs for symptomatic treatment and, for the majority of patients who have infrequent attacks, are the only therapy required. The migraine-specific medications that have become known as the triptans have revolutionized the acute treatment of migraine headache during the past 20&#x000a0;years. Triptans are the first-choice drugs for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks in all the management guidelines published in several countries, including the USA, UK, Italy, Canada, Germany and France. Triptans are selective 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor agonists. Seven oral triptan formulations are now available for the treatment of migraine, each with its own characteristic strengths over a range of treatment attributes. Frovatriptan is the newest addition to the triptan class: its mean half-life is 26&#x000a0;h, the longest in the triptan group. The molecule was selected for development based upon its distinctive pharmacologic characteristics, which suggested that it would have the clinical potential for a long duration of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and a low likelihood of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This therapeutic profile makes this triptan particularly suitable for treating patients whose migraine attacks last a long time, with an associated high risk of headache recurrence. In the new guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine established by the International Headache Society (IHS), relapse (recurrence) is deemed to be a major problem with all effective migraine treatments and should be recorded as an important efficacy index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent trials have confirmed that frovatriptan has the lowest recurrence rate, when compared to other triptans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, due to its prolonged duration of action, frovatriptan provides a higher sustained pain response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Triptans have shown to be highly effective, well tolerated and the most cost-effective migraine therapy in patients with severe symptoms and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In head to head comparative trials the patients&#x02019; preference for one triptan or the other was not linked to pain-free rates. The drugs showed similar efficacy in the short-term, but frovatriptan seems to be unique in the triptan class, having the longest duration of action and the lowest recurrence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The good long-term efficacy of frovatriptan supports its indication for those patients requiring a prolonged duration of action, with a sustained effect and less side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Rizatriptan is one of the most widely used triptans for the acute treatment of migraine. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available triptans conducted in 2001, evaluating 53 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, showed rizatriptan to be associated with the highest 2-h pain-free rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Rizatriptan is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; the bioavailability is approximately 40-45% and Tmax is about 1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The costs due to migraine (episodic and chronic) have been reported in several papers. The impact of migraine is a problem of enormous proportion, both for individual subjects and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The total indirect costs were calculated to be 1.1 billion $ per year in the US and more than 3 billion &#x020ac; per year in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Comparisons between triptan treatments, in terms of the cost to treat a single attack, were appraised in some European Countries. Whereas in France no difference between cost-efficacy of rizatriptan and frovatriptan was noted, in other three European Countries (Italy, Germany and UK) frovatriptan was shown to be associated with a lower cost per attack, with a significantly lower intake of rescue medications in the 24&#x000a0;hours following the triptan first dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The aim of this study was to compare direct and indirect costs for frovatriptan compared with rizatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine, based on the patients&#x02019; preference for one or the other of the comparative drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The cost analysis of drugs was conducted through a structured decision tree, built up taking into account the National Healthcare System perspective. Data on the cost-effectiveness of drugs and the direct and indirect costs were derived from a clinical study by Savi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The subjects eligible for participation in the study were adults &#x02265;18 and &#x02264;65&#x000a0;years of age with a current history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders &#x02013; second edition (ICHD-II), with at least one episode per month during the last 6&#x000a0;months prior to entering the study. Individuals with any contraindication to triptans or any severe or disabling medical condition (such as uncontrolled hypertension and cardiac, vascular or severe liver or renal impairment) could not be enrolled. Subjects were also excluded if they had a history of alcohol, analgesic or psychotropic drug abuse, a known hypersensitivity to the study drugs, a previous inadequate response to at least two triptans, and if they were currently using ergotamine or MAO-inhibitors, or had tension-type headache on more than six days per month. Pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and women of childbearing age with a positive or missing pregnancy test were not eligible. The study protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the independent institutional review board of each participating institution. Written informed consent was obtained for each subject.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, conducted in 15 centers across Italy. Each patient received the two comparative study treatments in sequence, being the sequence determined by randomization. After having treated 3 episodes of migraine in not more than 3&#x000a0;months with the first treatment, the patient was switched to the other treatment. After having treated 3 episodes of migraine in not more than 3&#x000a0;months with the second treatment, the patient was requested to indicate the preference for the first or second treatment, on a visual analogue scale (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The primary endpoint of the trial was to evaluate the average strength of preference expressed by the patient on the visual analogue scale for the first or second treatment received. Furthermore patients completed Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Personal Preferences Questionnaire (PPQ). The details of the trial methods and all the results (primary and secondary endpoints) are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1129-2377-14-96-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>The subjects were recommended to take the first dose of study medication as early as possible after the onset of migraine attack. In case of unsatisfactory or none response after two hours, a second dose of study medication was allowed. If the relief was still insufficient, the patients could take the rescue medication (triptans and ergot derivatives excluded) one hour after the second dose. Patients who used triptans as rescue medications were excluded from the per protocol analysis and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacoeconomic data</title><sec><title>Direct costs</title><p>Direct costs include all of the costs of diagnosing and treating a disease. In the case of migraine, this includes health care utilization figures such as rates of outpatient visits, hospitalization, the use of emergency department services, and costs of prescriptions. The latter were taken into account to the purpose of this survey. The analysis was performed in accordance with the published Italian guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The straightforward economic quantification of direct costs was represented by the drug consumption, both of triptans and rescue medications. The fixed or defined daily dose (DDD) is the recommended daily dose of the drug in the adult population. This dose is 2.5&#x000a0;mg for frovatriptan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and 10&#x000a0;mg for rizatriptan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The direct costs were calculated multiplying the number of DDDs taken in the two study arms by the corresponding DDD cost. Prices of currently marketed drugs were obtained from Italian Drug Agency price list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Indirect costs</title><p>Indirect costs include the aggregate effects of migraine on productivity at work, and in other roles. Many migraine sufferers miss work because of their headaches, and reduced productivity as a result of working during a migraine is common. Loss of productivity can be assessed measuring how much time patients have lost on workplace for their usual activities. Using a human capital approach, indirect costs can be expressed as costs incurred due to absenteeism from the work place. To determine the cost related to a lost working day, the average Italian yearly salary, i.e. 28,811.20 &#x020ac; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], was divided by the mean number of working days per year, which in Italy is 220. The average cost per day thus was estimated to be &#x020ac; 130.96. A typical working day includes 8 productive hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Results are reported using proportions for categorical data, mean as central tendency parameters for continuous data and standard deviation (SD) value as dispersion parameters. Costs were reported as mean &#x020ac;/migraine attack. In order to compare results obtained from the two study arms, a t-test was used and p-values lower than 0.05 were kept for statistical significance. All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS 9.2).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 148 patients with a current history of migraine were screened and randomized to the two study groups. A flow diagram of the patients throughout the study is reported in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Of these subjects, 129 completed both trial periods. Nineteen patients withdrew from the study for the following reasons: dissatisfaction to assigned treatment (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), withdrawal of consent (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), failure to treat one episode of migraine (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), occurrence of an adverse event (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), protocol violation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), deterioration of target disease symptoms (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), or other reasons (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2).

With the introduction of triptans, migraine therapy has made a quantum leap forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Triptans are currently the first line drugs for the acute treatment of migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as they have revolutionized the management of this disorder. Since the introduction of the first triptan, sumatriptan, launched over 20&#x000a0;years ago, six other triptans with distinctive pharmacokinetic properties have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although all triptans have the same mechanism of action and simple and consistent pharmacokinetic features, there are specific differences among individual agents that may account for their different clinical attributes. For instance, in the treatment of perimenstrual migraines, which are known to be particularly severe and disabling, the different triptans showed different profiles of efficacy, either given for acute attacks or for short-term prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the patient preference head to head comparative trials, the drugs showed similar efficacy in the short-term, in particular at 2&#x000a0;hours, but frovatriptan provided a more sustained response, with a lower recurrence rate, likely related to its much longer elimination half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The pooled systematic analysis of the three preference trials conducted in Italy suggests that frovatriptan has a similar antimigraine efficacy to other widely employed triptans (rizatriptan, zolmitriptan and almotriptan). This is true of both the immediate and the sustained pain-relieving effects. Frovatriptan has also been shown to be better tolerated than the other studied triptans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In this pharmacoeconomic study frovatriptan treatment has shown to be less expensive than rizatriptan, despite the slightly higher number of rescue medication doses required. This outcome can be explained by a combination of the lower number of doses needed, on average, to treat a migraine attack, and the lower number of hours lost from the workplace when using frovatriptan.</p><p>There are two important limitations of this study: first of all, that this is not a pharmacoeconomic study, but a sub-analysis not provided in statistical plan and secondly this analysis was based on the human capital approach. This approach suggests that health care interventions are a kind of investment in an individual&#x02019;s human capital (similar to education). According to this method, evaluation of productivity losses is based on labor costs. All future productivity losses (up to retirement age) are considered in the human capital approach, but obviously it represent a selection of costs included in the model, so some other costs aren&#x02019;t included.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>On the basis of published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and with the model analysis based on the human capital approach, results suggest the economical advantage of frovatriptan 2.5 mg among the oral triptans approved for the treatment of migraine in Italy. In this study, in particular, frovatriptan was found to be significantly more cost-effective than rizatriptan. This outcome can be explained by the lower acquisition cost of frovatriptan, the need for fewer doses, and the loss of fewer working hours. This finding could drive selection of the most appropriate oral treatment for acute migraine attacks, based on both individual patient&#x02019;s needs and the cost-effectiveness of the available drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors have occasionally served as scientific consultants for manufacturers of frovatriptan or rizatriptan.
