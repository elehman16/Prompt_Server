This 10-month group intervention targeting patients and significant others aimed to improve self-management by stimulating social support and diminishing social influences that hinder self-management. <italic>Methods</italic>: This intervention was evaluated in a quasi-experimental study using a mixed methods approach. Of 131 socioeconomically deprived patients with suboptimal glycaemic control, 69 were assigned to the intervention group and 62 to the control group (standard diabetes education). 27 qualitative in-depth interviews with the participants and 24 with their group leaders were held to study the subjective impact of the intervention. Further, self-management behaviours (medication adherence, diet and physical activity) were assessed at baseline, 10 and 16 months. Data were analysed using framework analyses and a linear mixture model. <italic>Results</italic>: Qualitative data showed that the intervention group had a better understanding of the way self-management influences diabetes. The intervention group showed more complex self-management behaviours, such as planning ahead, seeking adequate food and physical activity alternatives, and consistently taking their diabetes into consideration when making choices. In participants with complete follow-up data, we found a significant increase in physical activity in the intervention group (3.78 vs. 4.83 days) and no changes in medication adherence and diet. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: This study indicates that an intensive support group and simultaneously involving significant others might improve diabetes self-management behaviours among socioeconomically deprived patients. More studies are needed to justify further implementation of the intervention.</bold></p><p>This study is registered in the Dutch Trial Register NTR1886. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1886">http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1886</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>diabetes self-management</kwd><kwd>socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>social network</kwd><kwd>social influences and social support</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-1403494817701565"><funding-source id="funding1-1403494817701565"><institution-wrap><institution>ZonMw</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1403494817701565">76500003</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1403494817701565"><title>Background</title><p>People in lower socioeconomic groups are disproportionally affected by type 2 diabetes and its complications [<xref rid="bibr1-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Coping with type 2 diabetes requires extensive self-management skills: adherence to dietary advice and medications, engaging in regular physical activity, quitting smoking and prevention or treatment of hypoglycaemia [<xref rid="bibr4-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, compliance with and maintaining such complex health regimens is especially challenging for socioeconomically deprived patients due to their lower health literacy, low knowledge of blood glucose targets and lower self-efficacy [<xref rid="bibr3-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bibr5-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Interventions that focus on self-management behaviours seem to contribute to short term-glycaemic control, even among socioeconomically deprived patients, but long-term sustainable effects are scarce [<xref rid="bibr8-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr11-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Socioeconomically deprived patients seem to experience difficulties with maintaining newly learned behaviour after participating in an intervention.</p><p>Interventions that target social influences on self-management behaviours might be promising in terms of sustainability of the desired behaviour change. Social interactions with friends and family members have a major impact on self-management. Social support can positively influence self-management, but significant others can also hinder self-management by nagging about or paying too much attention to self-management [<xref rid="bibr12-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Socially deprived patients seem to have fewer sources of social support in their social environments and often receive insufficient social support, which is needed to improve adherence [<xref rid="bibr6-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bibr13-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bibr14-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

To the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge there are no interventions that focus on social support and hindering social influences at the same time. Therefore, <italic>Powerful Together with Diabetes</italic> (PTWD) was developed and focused on increasing social support for self-management and decreasing social influences that hinder self-management to improve self-management behaviours.</p><p>Further, our needs assessment showed that patients from socioeconomically deprived groups have specific educational needs that need to be targeted [unpublished], such as low motivation and low outcome expectations regarding education, difficulties with remembering new information, a low priority for diabetes self-management (DSM), a desire for practical information, reading and writing difficulties, and differences in knowledge about diabetes. This is confirmed by an increasing number of studies that recognize these groups might need interventions that go much further than traditional diabetes education regarding time, costs, effort and interactions with professionals [<xref rid="bibr10-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bibr11-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Based on this needs assessment, the intervention was specifically targeted to patients from socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods, and culturally targeted to the Dutch, Turkish, Moroccan and Surinamese patients in this group. It lasted 10 months and was delivered as group based.</p><p>In the evaluation of this intervention we use a mixed methods approach. We adjusted our research methods to our target population. Previous studies show that socioeconomically deprived patients often have difficulties understanding and filling out questionnaires.

This might be useful to explain changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), but might also limit the possibility to study other changes in self-management that might provide important starting points to understand the effects of an intervention. Therefore, we chose a broader evaluation of this intervention by using both qualitative and quantitative methods.</p><p>This paper reports on the effects of this intervention on medication adherence, diet and physical activity.

The design is described elsewhere [<xref rid="bibr17-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As the intervention required the participants to live close to each other and the recruitment of participants proved to be difficult, (cluster) randomization was impossible. The intervention and control groups were matched on gender, ethnicity and organization of diabetes care in the General Practitioner (GP) practice.

It lasted 10 months and consisted of 24 group meetings for participants, six group meetings for their significant others and two social network therapy sessions in which both the participant and a significant other were present. The intervention was group based, with 10 participants per group. Each group was guided by a group leader.</p><p>The intervention aimed to improve DSM by increasing knowledge, positive outcome expectations, self-efficacy and skills associated with DSM. As our needs assessment showed that the social environment of patients influences these determinants and plays an important role during self-management, important intervention objectives were to get the participants to support and positively influence each other to better manage their diabetes, to handle social influences that hinder self-management and to engage relatives and friends more in self-management [<xref rid="bibr19-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Further, the intervention strategies were tailored to socioeconomically deprived patients. A key aspect of the intervention was the underlying group process. The participants were addressed as a (learning) group, and learned and practised all the new behaviours and coping strategies together to stimulate social support, be more receptive to learning and make learning more fun. The group leaders used an inductive educational approach (the participants practiced with a problem while the group leader added information and theory to their understanding if necessary) to increase curiosity and tailor the information to the participants&#x02019; needs. Particular attention was paid to recognizing and dealing with influences on self-management in the immediate social environment (peer pressure, social norms).</p><p>Further, non-traditional intervention strategies were used, such as games, quizzes, role playing, skills training with guided practice and (fun or relaxing) energizers to optimize the attention span. To ensure a close connection to their interests, the group leaders actively involved participants in the intervention through active learning. A limited amount of information was provided at each meeting and information from previous meetings was repeated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494817701565">Boxes 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494817701565">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1-1403494817701565" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><p>Program components: phase 1 of the newly developed intervention <italic>Powerful Together with Diabetes.</italic></p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1403494817701565-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Review of the last meeting and exchange of experiences: 10&#x02013;15 min</bold><break/>At the start of each meeting, the group leader discusses how the period since the last meeting has been experienced and how the participants worked on their homework. The participants were stimulated to ask questions, exchange experiences and help each other with their homework.<break/><bold>Collection of questions: 5&#x02013;10 min</bold><break/>To guarantee that the meeting fits the needs of the participants, the group leaders start with a short description of the meeting and write down the participants&#x02019; questions on this topic. At the end of the meeting, the group leader checks whether all questions have been addressed.<break/><bold>Sharing positive news: 5 min</bold><break/>To make participants more open for new information, they share their positive news of the week with each other (self-affirmation). This news could be anything, as long as it was experienced as being positive by the participant.<break/><bold>Diabetes game: 15&#x02013;35 min</bold><break/>Many meetings contained a knowledge game. The participants participate in a quiz or a game, often teaming up and competing with each other. The group leader provides only the information that participants asked for themselves. The aim is to provide participants only with information that they need, and prevent giving an overload of information. The information provided was supported by large-sized posters/visual aids on diabetes-related topics.<break/><bold>Nutrition game: 60 min</bold><break/>The participants were divided in groups and given plastic cards with photographs of dishes and foodstuffs, divided into breakfast, dinner, lunch, snacks, beverages and others. Each card could be placed on one of three piles: green (eat as often as you like), orange (eat to a limited extent) and red (try to avoid, eat very rarely). The assignment was to place these cards on the appropriate pile; this was followed by discussing with each other the placing of the cards.<break/><bold>Letter of the week: 20&#x02013;45 min</bold><break/>The &#x0201c;letter of the week&#x0201d; is a fictional letter received from someone with diabetes who has a problem that needs to be solved. The participants were invited to brainstorm together about the problem and help solve the problem. The letter of the week was used to uncover tacit views of participants and provide them with solutions that they could also apply themselves.<break/><bold>Role playing: 20 min (on average)</bold><break/>Every meeting contained a role-playing exercise in which the participants practised a difficult situation together. The participants could also provide role-playing scenarios themselves (e.g. difficult situations they were personally confronted with). Each exercise ended with the exchange of advice and tips and tricks the participants could use in their own situations.<break/><bold>Energizers: 5&#x02013;15 min</bold><break/>Energizers included passing a ball along and giving the person who receives the ball a compliment, balancing on a balloon to feel all the muscles in the body, playing &#x0201c;web of life&#x0201d; (a game illustrating that we need each other), keeping a balloon up in the air, etc. The aim of these energizers is to stimulate bonding between group members and refresh the participants to enable them to absorb new information again.<break/><bold>Exercising with participants: 30 min</bold><break/>To show the participants how to exercise for 30 min and let them experience this, group leaders walk with the participants in the neighbourhood (i.e. the participant&#x02019;s own neighbourhood) for 30 min of each meeting . The group leaders were instructed to walk among the participants, so that they could talk to everyone.<break/><bold>Weighing pros and cons: 15&#x02013;20 min</bold><break/>To change outcome expectations, participants brainstorm with each other about the pros and cons of certain behaviours (e.g. refusing food at a party). This is achieved through group discussions, sometimes using a whiteboard to count the pros and cons. The group leader aims to emphasize the pros to stimulate positive outcome expectations.<break/><bold>Homework</bold><break/>The participants received homework at the end of each meeting. They were encouraged to pay attention to certain things (e.g. are there times when you smoke more than usual), or to try to meet up with individual participants outside the group meetings.<break/><bold>Cook book</bold><break/>The recipes of all the participants were collected and complied as a cook book and given to participants during the intervention. The cook book also contained information about choosing healthy ready-to-eat meals for participants who did not cook.<break/><bold>Summarizing the results and complimenting participants: 10 min</bold><break/>To help participants feel they have spent their time well, helped each other and have learned a lot, at the end of each meeting the group leader summarizes what the participants have learned. Group leaders also tell the participants how proud/appreciative they are of all their achievements.</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2-1403494817701565" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Box 2.</label><caption><p>Program components: phase 2 of the newly developed intervention <italic>Powerful Together with Diabetes.</italic></p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1403494817701565-table2"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Homework</bold><break/>In phase 2, the participants&#x02019; homework consists of keeping diaries, working on behavioural goals and staying in contact with each other in the weeks without an intervention meeting.<break/><bold>Keeping a diary</bold><break/>For this intervention, special diaries were developed.

KYS was realized in nine groups (each being offered six meetings) from January 2011 through to November 2011. The intervention took place in a community centre. The groups were led by group leaders (see below). All the groups finished the intervention; however, the Moroccan male group did not start due to a lack of interest among the potential participants.

They now eat more snacks in between meals and no longer eat late at night. The intervention group reported more diverse strategies for healthy eating than the control group. Only the intervention group seemed to plan ahead with regard to their blood glucose levels and adjusted their food intake accordingly (e.g. eat a low-carbohydrate snack to prevent their sugar level from being too high in the morning).</p><p>The qualitative study indicated that both groups attempted to eat less fat and sugar However, the intervention group reported more diverse and more complex strategies to do so, such as replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat, i.e. semi-skimmed milk instead of full-fat milk, 30+ cheese instead of regular cheese and so on. Only the intervention group indicated that they drink more water, less alcohol and no soda, lemonade or fruit juice. The group leaders of the intervention group confirmed that their participants had learned to eat healthier and make more deliberate choices regarding their food intake (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494817701565">Box 4</xref>, citation 6).</p><p>Other more complex strategies used only in the intervention group included choosing the most-healthy alternative at a party, and planning ahead to avoid snacking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494817701565">Box 4</xref>, citation 7).</p><p>Further, only the intervention group used more diverse strategies to eat less carbohydrates and replaced products high in carbohydrates with products low in carbohydrates, e.g. replacing white rice with whole grain rice, etc. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494817701565">Box 4</xref>, citation 8).</p><p>The quantitative analyses also indicated that both groups improved their diabetes-specific diet. At baseline, both groups adhered to their diabetes-specific diet on five days of the week and improved their adherence at 10 and at 16 months. Fat consumption was low in both groups, mainly due to not eating full-fat dairy products or red meat five days a week. In both groups, fruit and vegetable consumption was high at baseline. Contrary to the qualitative analyses, at 16 months, fat consumption had improved in the control group only. In both groups, fruit and vegetable consumption had decreased at 16 months.</p></sec><sec id="section28-1403494817701565"><title>Other aspects of self-management</title><p>Both groups indicated that they were better able to recognize low blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494817701565">Box 4</xref>, citation 9).</p><p>However, only participants in the intervention group reported that they now also know how to deal with low blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494817701565">Box 4</xref>, citation 10).</p><p>Finally, they indicated that the intervention helped them to prioritize their diabetes, because they realize that they have to continue to &#x0201c;work hard&#x0201d; for their diabetes.

They reported improvements in the ways they take their medications and are more physically active. Further, only the intervention group indicated that they drink more water, less alcohol and no soda, lemonade or fruit juice, and that they use more diverse strategies to eat less carbohydrate. Finally, only the intervention group reported to be able to better handle changes in blood sugars and to prioritize their diabetes more.</p><p>The quantitative analyses confirmed the increase in physical activity only. Other aspects of self-management did not change (medication adherence), changed in the control group only (fat consumption) or changed in both groups (diabetes-specific diet, and fruit and vegetable consumption).</p><sec id="section30-1403494817701565"><title>Strength and weaknesses</title><p>Ideally, we wanted to evaluate quantitatively the intervention and better understand the results using the qualitative data. Unfortunately, owing to a small sample size and high dropout rates, this was complicated. The qualitative data provide us with interesting insights on the effects, but provide no definite conclusions. Further validation of the results is required. Other studies to confirm these results are necessary before a further implementation of PTWD can be justified.</p><p>Secondly, we were not able to assign the participants randomly to the intervention or control group. The intervention required the participants to live close to each other which made randomization on an individual level impossible. In this study, multiple cultural groups were included and the intervention was offered in separate groups for Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Dutch patients. Predicting the number of participants per ethnic group in a specific GP practice proved to be difficult. As a consequence, also cluster randomization was not possible. Therefore, it might be that factors affecting diabetes outcomes or factors mediating the effects of the intervention are not evenly distributed in both groups affecting the results of this study. To gain more insights in these mediating factors and to further study to what extent our study population is representative to the general population of patients from socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods we also collected the HbA1c levels of a group of patients from socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods that received no intervention at all (the second control group). However, due to difficulties with the collection of hbA1c data from the participants&#x02019; medical files, we were unable to compare the HbA1c levels of this group with those of our intervention and control group on baseline, 10 and 16 months. As a result, we have no insights into the comparability of the intervention and control groups with regards to certain confounders affecting diabetes care or the effects of the intervention. This indicates that the quantitative results in this paper should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Further, the respondents for the qualitative study were selected by the group leaders. Because we aimed to study the potential effects of the intervention we aimed to interview participants that had regularly attended the group meetings and that had significant others who also participated in the intervention. This means that the findings of this study are probably not generalizable to all participants in this intervention and should be interpreted as such.</p><p>Further, the respondents were interviewed right after the end of the intervention, which gives no indication of long term intervention effects. Finally, the cultural groups that participated in the intervention were unequally represented in the qualitative study. Therefore, these results cannot be generalized to all cultural groups in this study.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were unable to collect HbA1c because it was not measured regularly in the GP practices participating in this study. Grintsova et&#x0202f;al. also show that patients from socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods receive less frequent measurements of HbA1c [<xref rid="bibr26-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To be able (as a researcher but also as a GP) to monitor the health status of socioeconomically deprived patients, this phenomenon need to be studied so attendance among this population in HbA1c measurements increases.</p><p>Finally, we did not collect information on diabetes interventions attended prior to participation in this intervention. If known, this would have led to a better characterization of the respondents, which would have increased our insight into the generalizability of the results to other populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section31-1403494817701565"><title>Discussion of the results</title><p>The intervention group showed more complex and more diverse self-management strategies, that were not observed in the comparison group. One of the distinctive features of PTWD is its focus on the social networks (social support and social influences) of the participants. Further, the intervention strategies were tailored to the educational needs of our target population.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are very few interventions focusing on increasing the social support for DSM and decreasing the social influences that hinder DSM at the same time in patients from socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods. An increasing number of studies recognize the need for this type of intervention [<xref rid="bibr27-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="bibr28-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr30-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Some other innovative interventions report promising (preliminary) results on self-care behaviours, but not all of these interventions focus on disadvantaged groups, use different intervention strategies (mobile phones) and primarily include African American or Thai patients, which makes it difficult to compare the results of these studies to our intervention [<xref rid="bibr31-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="bibr32-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr33-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr34-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Previous evaluations showed that the intervention increased emotional social support, diminished hindering social influences and increased the ability of participants to deal with peer pressure and temptations that hindered self-management behaviours [<xref rid="bibr35-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Practising self-management with and the encouragement of group members, walking together and energizers that create a pleasant atmosphere and high levels of trust in the groups contribute to these changes. Also, participants named the fun and pleasant atmosphere as one of the reasons to keep participating in the intervention.</p><p>These effects on intermediate outcome measures might explain the effects on self-management behaviours. For example, actively involving (significant) others in self-management seems a successful intervention strategy. The participants regularly discussed and practiced the strategies they formulated in their action plans through role-playing exercises. Making an action plan with the help of others and practicing strategies together probably helped participants to formulate realistic goals and strategies, to receive more social support for self-management and to feel more confident about implementing their action plan; these are important conditions for the action plan to be successful [<xref rid="bibr36-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>It also seems likely that the pleasant atmosphere in the groups and the high levels of trust facilitated learning among this population (being able to express opinions and ideas, and ask questions), which might have contributed to the better understanding of the rationale behind DSM in the intervention group.</p><p>Finally, the participants were addressed as a group, which might have made overcoming barriers to self-management behaviours easier. The quantitative analyses indicated that physical activity significantly improved in the intervention group. Low self-efficacy, poor health, fear of injury and a lack of access are known barriers for disadvantaged groups to be physically active [<xref rid="bibr37-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In our intervention, walking together in the neighbourhood with the group was obligatory. Hesitant participants were stimulated by group members and group leaders to come along; in this way, participants became acquainted with physical activity. It may also have made them aware that they can be physically active in their own neighbourhood. They experienced improvements in their and others&#x02019; expenditure and being successful together; this probably increased their confidence about performing physical activity [<xref rid="bibr38-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bibr39-1403494817701565" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section32-1403494817701565"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides a starting point for future research on the effectiveness of this intervention. It indicates that the intervention led to a better understanding of the rationale behind DSM, to the use of more complex strategies in different situations in the intervention group and to an increase in physical activity.</p><p>Once better studied, this intervention might be a promising starting point for diabetes education among socioeconomically deprived patients. Parts of this intervention could be introduced in regular diabetes care and might help socioeconomically deprived patients to achieve a basic understanding of diabetes and its management, and to involve their significant others in their self-management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Laraine Visser-Isles for editing the final draft of this paper.
