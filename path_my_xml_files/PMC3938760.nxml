The benefits of ICSs include improved control of asthma symptoms, improvement in lung function and fewer exacerbations [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A once-daily dosing of ICS can improve treatment adherence relative to twice-daily treatments [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], potentially improving asthma control. Fluticasone furoate (FF) is an ICS with 24-h activity approved for intranasal treatment of allergic rhinitis [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and is under development as a once-daily treatment for asthma. FF is structurally distinct from fluticasone propionate (FP) [<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and has both greater affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and longer retention in respiratory tissues than FP [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. FF has been shown to be effective in asthma in earlier trials, with daily doses of 100 &#x003bc;g and 200 &#x003bc;g having a favourable therapeutic index [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, noninferiority of FF 200 &#x003bc;g once-daily to FF 100 &#x003bc;g twice-daily has been shown, providing clinical evidence that FF is suitable for once-daily dosing [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The benefits of adding long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonists (LABAs) to an ICS in twice-daily treatments are well documented for lung function, symptom control, rescue medication use and asthma exacerbation frequency [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Vilanterol (VI) is a novel once-daily inhaled LABA shown to provide bronchodilation for at least 24 h; 25 &#x003bc;g is considered the optimal dose [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Once-daily FF/VI use is being investigated as a combination therapy for asthma at strengths of 100/25 &#x003bc;g and 200/25 &#x003bc;g [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily FF/VI 200/25 &#x003bc;g with once-daily FF 200 &#x003bc;g alone in patients aged &#x02265;12 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma; twice-daily FP 500 &#x003bc;g was included as an active comparator. Additionally, the study sought to demonstrate noninferiority of FF 200 &#x003bc;g once-daily compared with FP 500 &#x003bc;g twice-daily.

Eligible patients were required to demonstrate an evening pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 40&#x02013;90% of predicted normal and FEV<sub>1</sub> reversibility of &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200 mL on inhalation of albuterol/salbutamol. Patients were ineligible if they had a history of life-threatening asthma in the previous 10 years, an asthma exacerbation requiring overnight hospitalisation or emergency department attendance within 6 months of screening, and/or an asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12 weeks of screening.</p><p>At screening, eligible patients entering the study on ICS/LABA therapy were switched to the same ICS at the same dose contained in the ICS/LABA combination for the 4-week run-in period prior to randomisation. No LABA was taken on the day of screening. Patients on ICS alone continued ICS-only therapy during run-in. All patients had to be able to replace their current short-acting bronchodilator with albuterol/salbutamol and to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 h prior to study visits. At randomisation, all eligible patients were required to have recorded asthma symptoms (equating to a score of &#x02265;3 on the asthma symptom scale) and/or daily albuterol/salbutamol use on four or more of the seven preceding days. Electronic diary cards were used to capture daily measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF), symptom scores and rescue use.</p><p>Written informed consent from each adult (&#x02265;18 years) patient was obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures, as was assent and written parental consent for each adolescent (12&#x02013;17 years) patient.

Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to FF/VI 200/25 &#x003bc;g (representing an emitted dose of 184/22 &#x003bc;g), FF 200 &#x003bc;g once daily in the evening, or FP 500 &#x003bc;g twice daily (morning and evening) for 24 weeks.</p><p>FF/VI and FF were administered <italic>via</italic> a dry powder inhaler and FP was administered <italic>via</italic> Diskus/Accuhaler (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK).

Secondary efficacy end-points were mean change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods during the 24-week treatment period (a nominated powered end-point), change from baseline in the percentage of symptom-free 24-h periods during the 24-week treatment period, and change from baseline in Total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ+12) score after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Other end-points included 12-h post-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> at week 24, wmFEV<sub>1</sub> (0&#x02013;4 h post-dose) at week 24, mean change from baseline in daily morning and evening PEF over weeks 1&#x02013;12 and 1&#x02013;24, change from baseline in the Asthma Control Test (ACT) at weeks 12 and 24, number of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy over 24 weeks, and unscheduled healthcare resource utilisation for severe asthma exacerbations and other asthma-related healthcare.

AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Safety parameters, including vital signs, ECG measurements (recorded after 5 min rest before measurement of the clinic lung function tests), clinical chemistry and haematology, routine liver function assessments, and 24-h urinary cortisol (UC) excretion, were also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 588 randomised patients (196 per treatment arm) had 95% power to detect a treatment difference of 150 mL in change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> between FF/VI and FF, 96% power to detect a treatment difference of 175 mL in 0&#x02013;24-h serial wm FEV<sub>1</sub> in the subset of patients performing serial FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements, and &#x0003e;99% power to detect a treatment difference of 15% in change from baseline in percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods between FF/VI and FF. The overall power of the study to detect treatment differences for the co-primary end-points and the nominated powered secondary end-point was 92%. The sample size also provided 80% power to test for noninferiority on change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> only for the comparison of FF 200 &#x003bc;g to FP 500 &#x003bc;g with a noninferiority bound of -125 mL.</p><p>Co-primary and powered secondary end-points were analysed using an ANCOVA model with covariates for baseline, region, sex, age and treatment group. Imputation of missing data for the change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> end-point was carried out by last observation carried forward. Change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> was also analysed using a repeated measures model. wmFEV<sub>1</sub> was calculated in a subset of patients (&#x0223c;45% per arm) who performed serial FEV<sub>1</sub> at week 24.</p><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all patients randomised to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication. The per protocol population comprised all patients in the ITT population who did not have any full protocol deviations. The UC population comprised all patients whose urinary samples did not have confounding factors considered to affect the interpretation of 24-h UC data. The ITT population was the primary population for all efficacy and safety analyses other than the UC analysis. The per protocol population was of equal importance to the ITT in the assessment of noninferiority of FF 200 &#x003bc;g once daily to FP 500 &#x003bc;g twice daily on change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>To account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and key end-points, a step-down, closed-testing procedure was applied whereby treatment comparisons for the co-primary end-points (trough and wmFEV<sub>1</sub>) were required to be significant at the 0.05 level in order to infer significance for key secondary end-points percentage of rescue-free and percentage of symptom-free 24-h periods and AQLQ+12 (online supplementary fig. S1). Significance at the 0.05 level was required for each secondary end-point in sequence to allow significance to be inferred for comparison of all remaining secondary and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; end-points. If p&#x0003e;0.05 for any comparison in the hierarchy, then statistical significance could not be inferred for comparisons below that point in the hierarchy. The analysis of noninferiority for FF 200 &#x003bc;g once daily compared with FP 500 &#x003bc;g twice daily on the end-point of trough FEV<sub>1</sub> was not part of this statistical procedure.</p><p>Following routine quality control surveillance by the study sponsor, data quality issues were identified for one trial site. A <italic>post hoc</italic> sensitivity analysis was therefore conducted after the blind was broken for the co-primary and powered secondary efficacy end-points that excluded all patients randomised at this site (n=48).

At week 24, this proportion increased to 50% (85 out of 170), 51% (75 out of 147) and 48% (77 out of 162) in the FF/VI, FF and FP groups, respectively.</p><p>Over the 24-week treatment period, fewer patients withdrew due to lack of efficacy in the FF/VI group (3%) compared with the FF (11%) or FP (9%) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="erj-43-03-773-f04">fig. 4</xref>).</p><fig id="erj-43-03-773-f04" position="float"><label>Figure 4&#x02013;</label><caption><p>Cumulative incidence curves for withdrawals due to lack of efficacy over the 24-week treatment period (intent-to-treat population).

Nasopharyngitis (13&#x02013;20%) and headache (6&#x02013;8%) occurred most frequently (online supplementary table S3). More patients withdrew from the study due to an AE in the FF/VI group (seven; 4%) compared with FF (three; 2%) and FP (two; 1%). The incidence of treatment-related AEs was greater with FF/VI (9%) and FP (8%) than FF (4%). The incidence of on-treatment SAEs was greater for FF/VI (3%) than FF (&#x0003c;1%) or FP (1%). Two SAEs (atrial fibrillation in the FF/VI group and haemoptysis in the FP group) were considered treatment related. There were no statistically significant differences at week 24 in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or pulse rate, and there were no clinically significant differences for ECG measurements (QTcF or QTcB). No deaths occurred during the study.</p><p>Eight patients reported severe asthma exacerbations during treatment: six (3%) in the FF group, none in the FF/VI group and two (1%) in the FP group. All were treated with systemic/oral corticosteroids; only one patient in the FF group was hospitalised due to a severe asthma exacerbation.</p><p>The ratio to baseline for 24-h UC excretion at week 24 was slightly lower for FP (0.84) than FF (0.91) or FF/VI (0.98); treatment differences were not statistically significant for any comparison (online supplementary fig. S5).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates the benefit of combining the new once-daily LABA VI with the once-daily ICS FF, <italic>versus</italic> once-daily FF or twice-daily FP alone, in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. The main aims of this study, involving patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], were to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily FF/VI 200/25 &#x003bc;g to once-daily FF 200 &#x003bc;g alone. An additional comparison of once-daily FF 200 &#x003bc;g to twice-daily FP 500 &#x003bc;g assessed the noninferiority of the two treatments on trough FEV<sub>1</sub>. A significantly greater improvement in lung function was observed with FF/VI <italic>versus</italic> FF for both co-primary end-points and the powered secondary end-point of change in percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods, as well as <italic>versus</italic> FP for both co-primary end-points. Additionally, FF 200 &#x003bc;g once daily was shown to be noninferior to FP 500 &#x003bc;g twice daily. All treatments were generally well-tolerated and no safety signals were observed.</p><p>The inclusion criteria in this study selected for patients whose asthma was uncontrolled on high-dose ICS or medium-dose ICS/LABA therapy. FF 200 &#x003bc;g has previously been shown to be effective for patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, with higher doses not offering further benefits [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The active control (FP 500 &#x003bc;g twice daily) represents the maximum dose of FP recommended for use in patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, doses of FF/VI, FF and FP used were appropriate for the patient population assessed.</p><p>FF/VI was statistically significantly better than FF and FP for both co-primary FEV<sub>1</sub> end-points, with FF being noninferior to FP on trough FEV<sub>1</sub>. The improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> with FF/VI over FF (193 mL) and FP (210 mL) were in the range considered to be clinically relevant. These findings indicate that good efficacy is achievable with less frequent administration and, together with previous findings that VI produces prolonged bronchodilation for at least a 24-h duration at an optimal dose of 25 &#x003bc;g [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], this suggests the FF/VI is suitable for once-daily dosing, thereby offering greater convenience to patients. This is an important consideration for a maintenance therapy in asthma; poor adherence is associated with inadequate control and occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], often due to poor patient motivation [<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Simpler dosing regimens with reduced frequency of dosing have been shown to improve adherence for a variety of treatments [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Adding VI to FF significantly increased the percentage of rescue-free and symptom-free 24-h periods compared with FF alone. These findings are consistent with those of two large Cochrane meta-analyses that compared twice-daily ICS/LABA with ICS-only therapies in ICS-experienced [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or ICS-na&#x000ef;ve [<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] patients with persistent asthma. In addition, there were numerical improvements in these outcomes for FF/VI compared with FP. The AQLQ+12 score was improved with FF/VI compared with FF and FP, but the differences were not statistically significant. There was a numerically greater benefit with FF/VI <italic>versus</italic> FF or FP for 12 h FEV<sub>1</sub>, wmFEV<sub>1</sub> 0&#x02013;4 h post-dose, morning and evening PEF, and the ACT (for which all treatments achieved the minimally clinically important difference of three compared with baseline [<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Fewer withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were seen with the combination and no severe asthma exacerbations were reported for patients on FF/VI compared with FF (n=6) and FP (n=2).</p><p>The study was conducted in a clinically appropriate cohort of patients for the dose of FF/VI used and was sufficiently long to allow clinically meaningful conclusions to be drawn from the data. An additional strength of the study was that its power was sufficient to show noninferiority of once-daily FF to the maximum recommended dose of FP (500 &#x003bc;g twice daily), thereby providing a robust active treatment against which the effects of FF/VI and FF could be assessed. The use of electronic daily diaries provided a standardised method of capturing accurate date- and time-stamped information. The statistical hierarchy methodology represents both a strength and potential limitation; while it accounts for multiple comparisons and multiplicity, it also means that statistical significance could not be inferred for treatment differences for any comparison following AQLQ+12. The sponsor&#x02019;s quality control processes identified a study site with data quality issues and a sensitivity analysis of the co-primary and powered secondary end-points was subsequently performed. The results of the sensitivity analysis did not affect the overall study conclusions.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of FF/VI in this patient population. Additionally, noninferiority (on trough FEV<sub>1</sub>) of once-daily FF 200 &#x003bc;g to twice-daily FP 500 &#x003bc;g was shown. Treatment with once-daily FF/VI was associated with statistically greater improvements in lung function and symptomatic end-points <italic>versus</italic> FF, showing that the addition of the LABA VI confers significant clinical benefit in this patient population relative to high-dose ICS monotherapy. The incidence of treatment-related AEs was low and there were no apparent treatment effects on UC levels or safety parameters.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all patients and investigators involved in the study.
