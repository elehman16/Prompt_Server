and self-care, leading to higher rates of hospitalization and death<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A study found a low rate of self-care in 116 patients with HF and attributed this data
to the rates of 44.8% patients with cognitive impairment and 52.6% with no nursing
follow-up<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>Educational programs are an important tool to improve the management of self-care by the
multi-professional team specialized in the follow-up of patients with HF<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. However, it is difficult to identify the appropriate strategies and scenarios,
since the interventions are heterogeneous, as well as the number of professionals
involved, hindering the evaluation of results<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Thus, nurses working in specialized HF clinics seek strategies that can increase
adherence to treatment and enhance self-care, improving quality of life and reducing
hospital readmissions<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. However, there are no studies that have proven their effectiveness in adherence
to treatment and in self-care management, maintenance and confidence. </p><p>An integrative review of 42 articles on interventions proposed and implemented by nurses
to optimize self-care in patients with HF found that most of the studies were directed
to patients, excluding the participation of caregivers and family members, and addressed
three to four factors of self-care, such as diet, adherence to medication, daily weight,
physical activity and monitoring of signs and symptoms of decompensated HF. There was a
predominance of verbal instructions, but written materials and information technology
such as CD-ROMs, DVDs and videos, as well as telehealth, were also used. Few studies
discussed group activities<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Orientation groups are used as a supplement to the guidelines provided during the
outpatient visit. A study conducted in the Netherlands evaluated self-care and quality
of life among 317 HF patients for 12 months after participating in 21 group sessions.
The intervention showed improvements in cognitive management of symptoms (p&#x0003c;0.001),
self-care behavior (p=0.008) and quality of life (p=0.005), but no effect was found in
six and 12 months of follow-up<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A systematic review evaluated orientation groups in populations with chronic diseases
such as asthma, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, among others,
but provided little evidence on the achievement of good outcomes in quality of life and
health management. The study suggested that more studies should be carried out,
especially in order to compare the orientation groups with other strategies<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of the orientation group on adherence to
treatment and self-care among patients with chronic HF in a specialized clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial with parallel-group developed with two groups at
the same time, an intervention group (orientation group and nursing consultation) and a
control group (nursing consultation).</p><p>The study was conducted between October 2012 and February 2014. The inclusion criteria
were patients on follow-up in a clinic specialized in heart failure, in the city of
Niteroi/RJ, Brazil, who were over 18 years old, diagnosed with HF and included in
functional class I to III according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA).</p><p>Exclusion criteria were patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the three
months prior to the study; patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery in the
month prior to the study or who were indicated for surgery; patients with
neurological/cognitive dysfunction; patients who did not live in the cities of Niteroi,
S&#x000e3;o Gon&#x000e7;alo or Rio de Janeiro; and patients who did not have a landline. The
intervention occurred during 120 days, with two (02) nursing consultations and sixteen
(16) fortnightly group meetings with the intervention group (IG).</p><p>The 105 eligible patients were contacted and blindly randomized to the control group and
intervention group. Only 56 patients answered the request and then were invited to the
study, received orientation and signed a consent form (TCLE) informing on the benefits
and risks of the study. At the first visit, the first evaluation of adherence and
self-care maintenance, management and confidence was carried out through questionnaires
previously adapted and validated for use in Brazil<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">

evaluation of complementary and laboratory tests. Nursing diagnoses were identified and
an educational intervention was conducted through reading of a Guideline on Heart
Failure<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

This guideline is used in the conventional follow-up of these patients. In addition, the
nursing visit was also used to improve the prescribed treatment.</p><p>The intervention &#x0201c;<italic>orientation group</italic>&#x0201d; was based on the classification of

recommendations of the Brazilian Guideline for Heart Failure<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>

</p><p>The interventions of the Orientation Group were elaborated by the nurses/researchers
from the Heart Failure Clinic Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Valente, with the support of didactic material,
such as video, board game, tic-tac-toe, memory game and drawings and paintings. This
made the intervention more playful, enjoyable and understandable. </p><p>In addition to the topics previously proposed, the participants of the group had the
possibility to express their doubts and report their experiences. The orientation group
was open to family members or significant people. Patients who did not participate in at
least three meetings with the orientation group were excluded, which totaled one (01)
loss per month.</p><p>The control group (CG) received the conventional follow-up from the HF Clinic, which
consists of nursing, nutritional, physiotherapy and medical consultations. During the
nursing consultation, the patients of this group also received an educational
intervention based on the Guideline on Heart Failure.</p><p>The outcomes assessed in this study were adherence to treatment<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

reassessed after four months of follow-up.</p><p>Adherence to treatment was assessed through a questionnaire with 10 questions, with
scores ranging from 0 to 26 points; higher scores indicate better adherence. Adherence
is considered adequate when the patient reaches 18 points score, which corresponds to
70%<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

scales: self-care maintenance (10 items), self-care management (6 items) and self-care
confidence (6 items)<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">

&#x0201c;extremely confident&#x0201d;. The questions are about weight and edemas, physical activity,
attendance at consultations, diet, medications, signs and symptoms of decompensated HF,
management of signs and symptoms, and confidence in decision making<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup> for the same outcomes conducted with HF patients who received nursing
interventions. This study set a 95% confidence interval, a margin of error of five
percentage points, and power of 80%. Therefore, the inclusion of 20 patients (10 in each
group) was estimated. A nine-point difference between groups was considered, based on
the outcome of the study in question. The sample calculation was performed using the
Winpepi statistical program (v. 14.46). </p><p>The randomization was performed in blocks. A coin flipping determined the allocation of
15 eligible patients in the intervention group or control group. Each patient was
identified by an Arabic number on individual cards. After the draw, the numbered cards
corresponding to each patient were put in envelopes and stored in a safe place. The
person responsible for the randomization was not involved in any other research
activity.</p><p>During the baseline period, the nurses were blind to the patients&#x02019; allocation. The
professionals responsible for the randomization, the patient assessment team, and the
statistician responsible for data analysis remained blind throughout the study.</p><p>The intervention team had no contact with patients in the control group after the
baseline period and, therefore, was blind to this group of patients.</p><p>The construction and synthesis of the database were done in the software Microsoft Excel
(2007) and the analysis was done on the software Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS), version 20.0.</p><p>Categorical variables were expressed through frequency and percentage distributions and
the continuous variables through mean and standard deviation. The comparison between the
initial and final scores of the intervention and control groups was done through the
Student&#x02019;s t-test. The bivariate p value&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant
for all analyzes.</p><p>The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Ant&#x000f4;nio Pedro Medical
School/ Hospital, under the no. 175.302 and under the registry RBR-7r9f2m in the
Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 105 patients eligible to participate in the study, fifty-six (56) met the
inclusion criteria. Of these, twenty-nine (29) were allocated in the intervention group
(IG) and twenty seven (27) in the control group (CG).</p><p>During the study, the IG had eighteen (18) losses, seventeen (17) due to attendance to
less than three (03) meetings with the orientation group, one (01) for starting
dialysis, one (01) for change of address and one (01) for death. Of the twenty-nine (29)
patients included, eleven (11) completed the study.</p><p>In the CG, 27 patients participated in the first nursing visit. However, there was no
possibility of scheduling the second nursing consultation with seven (07) of them,
because the phones provided had changed and were unable to receive calls. In addition,
four (04) patients refused to continue the study. Thus, in this group, sixteen (16)
patients completed the study (figure 2). </p><p>

outcomes adherence to treatment and self-care maintenance, management and confidence in
patients with chronic HF in a specialized clinic in Brazil. The outcomes were assessed
through questionnaires previously translated, adapted and validated for use in Brazil.
The results showed that the orientation group was not effective for improving adherence
and self-care, and could lead to a reduction in self-care confidence.</p><p>The adoption of an educational program cannot guarantee the change of behavior expected
in adherence to treatment and in the practice of self-care, considering that what people
know and what they actually adopt in their life is often different. Adherence to
treatment is often affected by reasons related to the HF itself and its comorbidities;
in addition, internal and external factors to the individual such as motivation, ability
to understand, existence of adequate health services, and other factors directly
influence this aspect<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The initial scores of the sample were low in adherence (14.11 &#x000b1; 3.41), self-care
maintenance (43.82 &#x000b1; 15.54), self-care management (56.26 &#x000b1; 29.10) and self-care
confidence (62.01 &#x000b1; 23.94). Using as evaluation methods two scales used worldwide for
self-care assessment, the Self-care Heart Failure Index and the European Heart Failure
Self-Care, a comparison between self-care in 15 countries showed better indexes in
developed countries<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In a study with 197 Americans with HF, 56.1% with NYHA III, the self-care maintenance
score was (70.5 &#x000b1; 14.3), the self-care management score was (65.4 &#x000b1; 22.4) and self-care
confidence score was (70.2 &#x000b1; 16.6)<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. All these values are higher than we found in this study. The education of the
patient related to better educational and socioeconomic conditions, may be the
explanation for the difference between these scores, since in this study more than 80%
of the interviewees had only elementary education I and II.</p><p>In the Chinese population, with a population of 182 patients with HF, from three
hospitals, 71% men and 79% with NYHA II/III, the scores were: self-care maintenance
(43.5 &#x000b1; 16.7), self-care management (51.4 &#x000b1; 21.6) and self-care confidence (52.0 &#x000b1;
21.1);. They had self-care maintenance scores similar to this study and lower confidence
score<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The comprehension of the orientation provided may vary depending on the level of
education, and the intervention should be adapted to this condition. In addition, access
to the medication prescribed may be impaired, since it may be difficult for patients to
correctly understand what is prescribed in order to acquire these medications<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, low education level and income are predictors for low adherence to
treatment and self-care, leading to decompensated HF and increasing hospital
readmissions<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this study, the strategies used in the orientation group were based on recreational
activities, such as movies and games, to facilitate the understanding of the content
discussed. The multi-professional team supported the development of the activities
proposed. Considering that social support is an important element for adherence and
self-care, the orientation group was open to family members and had the participation of
spouses, siblings and children of the participants.</p><p>Social support was also offered in nursing consultations, which may explain the
improvement of self-care confidence in the control group, which had an initial score of
52.63 &#x000b1; 24.76 and a final score of 67.41 &#x000b1; 26.15.</p><p>On the other hand, the negative change in the self-care confidence score in the IG can
be attributed to the knowledge acquired during the orientation group meetings. Perhaps,
the comprehension of the condition, the stage of the disease, its incurability, and the
difficulties experienced by several patients may amplify the patients&#x02019; perception and
make them feel insecure to state that they are extremely confident in these issues.</p><p>People normally can&#x02019;t judge themselves, so they usually feel capable and confident to
carry out tasks. Unaware of their ignorance, they overestimate their experience and
talent, and consider themselves competent<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. This overestimation is more frequent among the less capable, since the more
competent can recognize their true level of abilities and compare it with others<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Thus, before the intervention group, the participants were more confident. As they
became more competent to evaluate their health status and self-care, their self-report
was more real, which may explain their lower level of self-care confidence.</p><p>It is also important to understand the full scope of the concepts of adherence and
self-care. These matters go beyond monitoring of signs and symptoms, and should include
issues such as comfort, environment, emotional factors, support system such as family
and friends, basic hygiene, sleep and rest, eating habits, daily activities, work,
leisure and ability to communicate and interact with the world<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The concepts of adherence and self-care, therefore, are complex. They involve logical
thinking in order to assess health condition and promote behavior changes, which are
difficult to measure. Therefore, in order to find changes that have clinical impact, it
may be necessary to extend the evaluation for a longer follow-up period.</p><p>The main limitation of the study was the low attendance to the Orientation Group, which
hindered the follow-up and the evaluation of the outcomes. The authors attributed this
limitation to the difficulty of public transportation to the specialized clinic, since
it is located in an urban area, with a lot of traffic and it is difficult for people
with special needs to access the location. It is worth mentioning that patients with HF
may be intolerant to some efforts, such as ramps and ladders. The fortnightly meetings
were also an increase in financial expenses, so despite their acceptance to participate
in the study and their positive verbal reports regarding the activities carried out in
the group, some participants could not attend regularly. </p><p>Thus, the irregularity in attendance at the meetings obstructed the interaction between
professionals, patients and family members, hampering the creation of a nurse-patient
bond, essential to the activity of the intervention group. This may also have been a
limitation to the intervention&#x02019;s success. Finally, with the easy access to cell phone
lines, it is easier to change numbers and carriers, making it more difficult to find the
patients. </p><p>A study that aimed to discover why patients with HF participated or not in a self-care
support program found that the main reasons for permanence in these programs were
support, friendship, exchanging information, acceptance and control of the disease,
exchange of experiences and combating depression. However, the most relevant causes for
abandonment were the physical impairment imposed by illness, depression, uninteresting
educational materials, and very small groups or individual strategies<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Thus, the results found should be analysed with caution, and multicenter studies with
longer follow-up periods should be conducted in order to obtain a better evaluation of
the orientation group and its effect on adherence and self-care. However, this study was
relevant, since, in a controlled manner, through a randomized controlled trial, it
evidenced the difficulties of investigating the effect of group interventions for
patients with HF.</p><p>A 6-month home and telephone follow-up study demonstrated a 27% relative reduction in
the outcomes hospitalization, emergency care, or death. The study also improved HF
knowledge and self-care actions<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Thus, longer follow-up periods with combined strategies seem to be better for promoting
adherence and enhancing self-care for this type of patients. Therefore, this may be an
alternative to improve these outcomes among individuals in support groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Orientation Group did not alter adherence and self-care among patients with HF in a
specialized clinic. However, it is an important educational strategy in the healthcare
area, specifically for chronic patients, and it should be better explored in other
settings and with other strategies.</p><p>Patient confidence in their self-care decreased with the group intervention; however,
this result can be considered positive in medium and long term, since it can spark an
interest in understanding their health condition and the treatment. Maintaining the
nursing intervention and associating it with the support of psychologists, social
workers and occupational therapists may be an alternative to solve the problem. </p><p>Therefore, this study is significant because it demonstrated that well-structured
strategies may not achieve the expected goal, but can provide evidence for the
construction of more effective interventions. </p><p>Multicenter studies with larger samples and in medium- and long-term may produce
positive results in the outcomes adherence and self-care through group interventions.
