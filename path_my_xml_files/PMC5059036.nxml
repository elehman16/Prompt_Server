The prevalence of type 2 DM has remarkably increased with the growing rate of obesity during the past decade, and half of these patients are unaware of their disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In 2015, approximately 8.8% of people had diabetes worldwide and this percentage will likely increase by10.4% in 2040.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Approximately 5 million people aged between 20 and 79 years died from diabetes in 2015, equivalent to 1 death every 6 seconds.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Diabetes accounted for 14.5% of global all-cause mortality among people in this age group. There are about 4.6 million diabetic people living in Iran in 2015. Moreover, the percentage of diabetic patients is predicted to increase by 122% and 42% in developing and developed countries, respectively, from 1995 to 2025. The treatment costs for retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease may be equivalent to half the public health costs in the United States.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Due to increased treatment costs, researchers suggest that achieving treatment goals can noticeably reduce the above-mentioned complications. However, only 50% to 70% of patients with type 2 DM will achieve these goals despite available treatments. Therefore, researchers have provided special attention to the use of novel drugs and treatment protocols in the recent years.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>Dopamine and dopaminergic signals control some metabolic pathways, such as those in the central nervous system (CNS).<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Based on these metabolic pathways, we can claim that glucose metabolism is accurately controlled by the CNS and medioventral area of the hypothalamus.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The CNS controls liver gluconeogenesis via sympathetic nervous system; however, this pathway is not functional in obese diabetic patients who have impaired responses to the pathway signals. These patients have increased liver gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, and &#x003b2;-cell disorders in the pancreas.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> It has also been reported that agents, which interfere with dopaminergic activity (i.e., antipsychotics), will lead to side effects, such as metabolic disorders, weight gain, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>Bromocriptine is a dopaminergic agonist type 2, which can affect serotonin turnover in the CNS.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> The main indications of bromocriptine during the past 25 years are Parkinson's disease, prolactinoma, acromegaly, infertility, and galactorrhea.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Bromocriptine can also be used to treat many metabolic disorders associated with insulin resistance and obesity.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, it is observed that treatment by a dopaminergic agonist reduces hypothalamic stimulation that increases during liver gluconeogenesis, lipids synthesis, and insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> This agent such as bromocriptine has been substantiated for use in type 2 DM patients by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In contrast to other glucose-lowering agents, bromocriptine is beneficial for controlling blood sugar levels via its effect on the CNS and by reducing glycogenesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Cycloset is a rapid-releasing variant of bromocriptine, which reduces insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia in obese or type 2 DM patients, and considered an antidiabetic agent.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>Cabergoline is a long-acting agonist of dopamine, which has a high affinity to dopamine receptors (type 2), and it is the first treatment choice for hyperprolactinemic disorders. Compared to bromocriptine, cabergoline is more long-acting, administered in lower doses, has fewer side effects, and more easily accepted by patients. However, there is a lack of studies concerning the effects of cabergoline for reducing blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Considering the issues mentioned above, this study was designed to evaluate the effects of cabergoline on blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 DM.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This was a double-blind clinical trial; a placebo was used as control to evaluate the effects of cabergoline on blood glucose levels in patients who were referred to our diabetes clinic center. Twenty patients were randomly placed in each group (i.e., control and cabergoline groups) based on calculating power (85%) and index of assurance (95%) with a significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05) in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). Each group consisted of 4 men (20%) and 16 women (80%). This study was approved by the Committee of Ethics (90&#x02013;91) of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Iran and registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial (IRCT code: 201205053176N2). All patients in this study provided signed informed consent before entering the study.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with type 2 DM, which was diagnosed at least 3 months prior to the study, who received treatment by &#x02265;2 oral glucose-lowering drugs with at least 50% of maximum dose; patients were aged between 20 and 80 years; and the level of HbA1C in patients were &#x02265;7% and &#x0003c;10%. In addition, women who were of reproductive age had to use a reliable contraceptive method during the time of the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: unwillingness of the patients; pregnancy and lactation; uncontrolled thyroid diseases; serum creatinine level &#x0003e;2&#x0200a;mg/dL; patients who were currently treated with agents that affect blood sugar levels (i.e., glucocorticoid, thiazide, antipsychotic antagonist, and ergot); severe weight loss (at least 10% during last 6 months prior to the study); and history of immunodeficiency disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetic ketoacidosis, sever hepatic diseases, allergy to cabergoline, proliferative retinopathy, and psychological disorders.</p><p>The demographic information of the patients, including age, sex, weight, height, waist circumference, duration of diabetes, and drugs (i.e., previously prescribed glucose-lowering drugs), was recorded. In this treatment, 10 patients (25%) received 2 types of drugs so that 7 patients (17.5%) got Glibenclamide and Metformin and 3 (7.5%) Metformin and Acarbose. Thirty other patients (75%) got three types of drugs, 25 (62.5%) received Metformin, Glibenclamide, and Pioglitazone and finally 5 (12.5%) used Glibenclamide, Metformin, and Acarbose. Results showed that there was no statistical significant difference between 2 groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.792). The patients also received at least 50% of maximum dose of their previous medications. Weight was measured using the SECA scale with an accuracy of 100&#x0200a;g. The waist circumference was measured in the umbilical region using fabric meters. The blood pressure was measured by a skilled nurse using a Microlife blood pressure monitor (Riester, Ri-San, Germany). Patients&#x02019; weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference were measured at 3 and 6 months of treatment.</p><p>The basic laboratory tests of the patients, including fasting blood sugar (FBS), 2-hour post-prandial glucose (2HPP), complete lipid profile (after 12&#x0200a;hours of fasting), serum insulin, prolactin, hemoglobin (Hb), alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), creatinine (Cr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), were conducted at treatment outset and at 3 and 6 months. HbA1C was measured by NycoCard kits with covariate of variation 3.5% NycoCard kits and device (Italy). Patients with HbA1C levels &#x02264;7% after 3 months were withdrawn from the study. Patients with an HbA1C level between 7% and 10% (i.e., 7%&#x0003c; HbA1C&#x0003c;10%) at 3 months received treatments of cabergoline (0.5&#x0200a;mg) or placebo twice per week for the next 3 months. Blood glucose levels were measured by Pars-Azmoon kits (Iran) and the device of Prestigezui (prestigezui 24 I Japan). Insulin and prolactin levels were evaluated by ELISA in order to analyze the effects of cabergoline on insulin sensitivity and changes in prolactin levels. Venous blood samples were obtained from all patients and placed in the centrifuge for 10 minutes with a round speed of 3000&#x0200a;r/min. It was later evaluated by an automated analyzer (Hitachi 9/7, Germany); serum insulin levels were measured by ELISA and Monobind screening test kits. Insulin resistance was calculated by the formula of homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).</p><p>The drug (cabergoline) and placebo used in this study, which should be similar in shape, size, color, and packaging, were designed by the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Medical Sciences of Mazandaran, Iran. The pharmacologists in this department were responsible for naming and coding the drugs and placebos, but had no role in choosing or prescribing them to the patients. Finally, the coded drugs and placebos were delivered randomly to the patients by a nurse who assisted the researchers in this project. The patients received oral treatments of either placebo or cabergoline (0.5&#x0200a;mg) using the sequential method once per week for 3 months while using previously prescribed glucose-lowering drugs.</p><p>Study data were analyzed using the SPSS Statistic Software version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted to quantitatively analyze the data in both groups and paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the before and after treatment results in each group.

Our patients in the cabergoline group showed a significant decrease in prolactin levels from the beginning of treatment to the end of study compared with the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.000), which is consistent with other studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> The decrease in prolactin levels is an expected finding in patients treated with cabergoline.</p><p>Cabergoline is a long-acting agonist of dopamine, which has a high affinity with dopamine receptor type 2. This agent has a remarkable effect on the receptors of a2B, 5-HT2c, 5HT2A, 5-HT1A, D4, and D3, and dopaminergic receptor type 2.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Although the effect of dopamine on pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell secretion is not strongly obvious, dopaminergic receptor type 2 has been reported to play a role in this process in a study conducted in animals.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The use of this agent has been reported to increase the level of dopamine and decrease the level of noradrenergic in the hypothalamus, resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and reduced liver gluconeogenesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the decline of serum prolactin levels will likely justify this effect in the agent. In another animal study, administration of prolactin hormone resulted in positive effects on carbohydrate metabolism and adipose tissues (i.e., reduced production of adiponectin from adipose tissue).<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Regarding the lower level of prolactin in the cabergoline group, it seems that the antidiabetic effect of cabergoline is through dopamine and prolactin metabolism. Currently, the various effects of cabergoline are claimed to be due to a lack of treatment response in some patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p><p>One of the limitations of our study includes short duration of follow-up. In addition, although there was no statistical significance for the HbA1c values after intervention between 2 groups, the values of glycosylated hemoglobin significantly decreased after treatment in cabergoline group. It is possible that lower statistical power (small sample size) affects this nonsignificance.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine agonist that may be useful as a long-acting antidiabetic agent in patients with type 2 DM.
