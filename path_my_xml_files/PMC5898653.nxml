It is usually diagnosed clinically and radiologically (X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging). Surgical treatment is indicated in severe symptomatic cases, while treatment controversy exists in the presence of less severe cases. Anterior and posterior approaches are generally used for decompression with no significant differences in the results of both.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2050312118766199"><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 287 patients of cervical spondylotic myelopathy were treated at our hospital between January 2004 and December 2015. Only 140 patients were eligible for our study. They had at least 5 years of follow-up using full clinical scores and radiological evaluation. They were divided into two groups: group I with 73 patients (aged 23&#x02013;79 years) underwent posterior decompression, lateral mass instrumentation, and fusion, while group II with 67 patients (aged 33&#x02013;70 years) underwent anterior decompression, instrumentation, and fusion. Neck Disability Index, local score, and X-ray were used in the evaluation of the patients.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2050312118766199"><title>Results:</title><p>Preoperative mean &#x000b1; standard deviation of Neck Disability Index of both the groups was 32.06 &#x000b1; 6.33 and 29.88 &#x000b1; 5.48, which improved in the last visit (&#x0003e;5 years) to 5.81 &#x000b1; 7.39 and 2.94 &#x000b1; 5.48 for groups I and II, respectively (p value &#x0003c;0.05). The local score of groups I and II was (P = 1, F = 21, G = 31, E = 19) and (P = 1, F = 12, G = 36, E = 18), which on discharge day improved to (P = 1, F = 4, G = 12, E = 55) and (P = 0, F = 3, G = 6, E = 58) at last follow-up, respectively. Fusion rate was nearly equal for both the groups during all the follow-up intervals and it was 91.1% and 91.7% in the last follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2050312118766199"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>There were no significant differences in the clinical and radiological results between the anterior and posterior approaches used in the surgical treatment of spondylotic cervical myelopathy. However, statistically significant results of Neck Disability Index of anterior approach were not clinically important and may be due to changes in the size and shape of the neck in group II.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cervical spondylotic myelopathy</kwd><kwd>anterior approach</kwd><kwd>posterior approach</kwd><kwd>lateral mass fusion</kwd><kwd>anterior decompression</kwd><kwd>radiological fusion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section5-2050312118766199"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cervical spondylosis is an age-related condition that affects the anterior (intervertebral disk, uncovertebral joints, and longitudinal ligaments) and posterior structures (facet joints and ligamentum flavum) of the spinal column and leads to spinal canal stenosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312118766199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2050312118766199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Most degenerative changes (about 85%) are diagnosed radiologically.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312118766199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Some occupations and postures that increase the load of the head on the neck may increase the risk of spondylosis of the cervical spine.

X-ray and MRI are widely used modalities of diagnosis. Surgical treatment is the ideal choice and whether to use the anterior or posterior surgical approach is still a matter of controversy. Most of the previous studies showed no significant difference between the two approaches clinically and radiologically. Our study showed statistically significant better results in NDI with the anterior approach, while the local score showed no significant differences. However, the statistically significant results of NDI, which were found with the anterior approach, were not clinically important and may be due to the changing size and shape of the neck in group II. The radiological fusion rate was nearly equal in both the groups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> Ethical approval for this study was obtained from University Research Committee of Jordan University of Science &#x00026; Technology (Number of approval: 634-2016).</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Informed consent:</bold> Obtaining written informed consent was waivered by the Institutional Review Board, as the study is retrospective on already operated patients.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Ziad A Audat <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312118766199-img1.jpg"/>
