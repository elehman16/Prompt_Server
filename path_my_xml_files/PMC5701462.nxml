However, many patients do not respond to the first medication prescribed and improvements in symptoms are generally only detectable by clinicians 4&#x02013;6 weeks after the medication has been initiated. As a result, there is often a long delay between the decision to initiate an antidepressant medication and the identification of an effective treatment regimen.</p><p id="Par2">Previous work has demonstrated that antidepressant medications alter subtle measures of affective cognition in depressed patients, such as the appraisal of facial expression. Furthermore, these cognitive effects of antidepressants are apparent early in the course of treatment and can also predict later clinical response. This trial will assess whether an electronic test of affective cognition and symptoms (the Predicting Response to Depression Treatment Test; PReDicT Test) can be used to guide antidepressant treatment in depressed patients and, therefore, hasten treatment response compared to a control group of patients treated as usual.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">The study is a randomised, two-arm, multi-centre, open-label, clinical investigation of a medical device, the PReDicT Test. It will be conducted in five European countries (UK, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands) in depressed patients who are commencing antidepressant medication. Patients will be randomised to treatment guided by the PReDicT Test (PReDicT arm) or to Treatment as Usual (TaU arm). Patients in the TaU arm will be treated as per current standard guidelines in their particular country. Patients in the PReDicT arm will complete the PReDicT Test after 1 (and if necessary, 2) weeks of treatment. If the test indicates non-response to the treatment, physicians will be advised to immediately alter the patient&#x02019;s antidepressant therapy by dose escalation or switching to another compound. The primary outcome of the study is the proportion of patients showing a clinical response (defined as 50% or greater decrease in baseline scores of depression measured using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms &#x02013; Self-Rated questionnaire) at week 8. Health economic and acceptability data will also be collected and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">This trial will test the clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of using the novel PReDicT Test to guide antidepressant treatment selection in depressed patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02790970">NCT02790970</ext-link>.

It is associated with significant socio-economic costs and has been predicted to become the greatest cause of disability worldwide by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2010, it was estimated that there were approximately 30 million patients with depression in Europe, with aggregated economic costs of approximately &#x020ac;92 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Improvements in managing the treatment of depression are urgently needed to improve patient outcomes, contain rising healthcare costs, improve workplace productivity, and help to address global economic and societal challenges.</p><p id="Par21">While a range of effective antidepressant medications are available, it takes 4&#x02013;6 weeks after starting treatment before a physician can reliably detect whether the treatment is working [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, more than 50% of patients fail to respond to the first antidepressant treatment that they are prescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it often takes several months to identify an effective antidepressant treatment for a majority of patients with depression. During this time a patient&#x02019;s ability to work and function socially may be severely impaired.</p><p id="Par22">Previous work has found that antidepressant medication alters the processing of emotional information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; for example, by causing depressed patients to label ambiguous facial expressions as more positive. Indeed, it has been argued that alteration of emotional processing bias represents one mechanism by which antidepressants cause improved mood in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consistent with this, the degree to which antidepressants induce these changes in emotional processing early in treatment is predictive of the later improvement in subjective symptoms as reported by depressed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The PReDicT (Predicting Response to Depression Treatment) Test that will be used in this study has been developed from this work. The test combines a measure of emotional processing with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms &#x02013; Self-Rated-16 (QIDS-SR-16) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The test has been designed to predict, after 1&#x000a0;week of antidepressant treatment, whether a patient will go on to respond to that treatment. A pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] of the measures used in the PReDicT Test found that it accurately predicted treatment response (defined as a 50% or greater reduction in baseline score on the QIDS-SR-16 by week 6 of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) in 74% of depressed, primary-care patients.</p><p id="Par23">The clinical opportunity provided by the early detection of antidepressant treatment response is that patients who are predicted to not be responding after 1&#x000a0;week can have their treatment altered at this time rather than waiting 4&#x02013;6 weeks as is the case with present standards of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The current study will assess the effects of using the PReDicT Test to guide antidepressant treatment primarily in a primary-care setting. Depressed patients who are judged by their primary-care physician to require treatment with an antidepressant medication will be randomly assigned to have their treatment guided by the PReDicT Test (PReDicT arm) or to receive Treatment as Usual (TaU arm). Patients in the PReDicT arm will complete the PReDicT Test after one and, if necessary, 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. If the test indicates a likely non-response after either test, then patients will have their antidepressant treatment changed. Participants in the TaU arm will receive standard care, with subjective treatment response assessed after 4&#x02013;6 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome of the study is the proportion of patients showing a response to treatment at week 8 of the study. Exploratory outcomes include assessment of treatment response at other time points and using alternative symptom measures.</p><p id="Par24">If the PReDicT Test is successful in reducing the time needed to identify and initiate effective antidepressant therapy, it will be implemented routinely in primary care provided that it is cost-effective and the technology is acceptable for use by both patients and clinicians. Additional objectives of the study will, therefore, also include robust health economic analysis assessing cost-utility and cost-effectiveness as well as assessment of the barriers and facilitators to implementation of the PReDicT Test into primary-care services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par25">The objectives of the study are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study objectives</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Type of objective</th><th>Objective</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primary</td><td>To determine whether use of the PReDicT Test to direct antidepressant treatment results in an increased proportion of depressed patients showing a response (defined as 50% or greater reduction from baseline Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms &#x02013; Self-Rated-16 (QIDS) score) to treatment at week 8 compared to TaU.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Secondary efficacy objective</td><td>To compare the change from baseline in QIDS scores (i.e. treated as a continuous variable) at week 8 between depressed patients receiving treatment directed by the PReDicT Test and those receiving TaU</td></tr><tr><td>To determine whether use of the PReDicT Test to direct antidepressant treatment results in an increased proportion of depressed patients showing a response to treatment at week 8 compared to TaU, where response is defined as a decrease of 50% or more from baseline Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>To determine whether use of the PReDicT Test to direct antidepressant treatment results in an increased proportion of depressed patients achieving remission at week 8 compared to TaU where remission is defined as a QIDS score of 5 or less.</td></tr><tr><td>To determine whether use of the PReDicT Test to direct antidepressant treatment results in an increased proportion of depressed patients achieving remission at week 8 compared to TaU where remission is defined as a MADRS score of 7 or less.</td></tr><tr><td>To compare the change from baseline in QIDS score (i.e. treated as a continuous variable) at week 12 between depressed patients receiving treatment directed by the PReDicT Test and those receiving TaU.</td></tr><tr><td>To compare the change from baseline in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms &#x02013; Self-Rated-16 (QIDS-SR-16) score (i.e. treated as a continuous variable) at 24 and 48&#x000a0;weeks between depressed patients receiving treatment directed by the PReDicT Test and those receiving TaU</td></tr><tr><td>Health economic objectives</td><td>To determine the impact on societal costs and cost-effectiveness/cost-utility of the PReDicT Test intervention in comparison to TaU over 24&#x000a0;weeks and over 48&#x000a0;weeks if feasible</td></tr><tr><td>Acceptability and implementation objectives</td><td>To explore how the PReDicT Tests are used by various stakeholders (patients, prescribing physicians and support staff), and the impact this has on care and care processes, in order to refine its future implementation across different countries.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Exploratory objectives</td><td>To compare the change from baseline in Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, 7-item version (GAD-7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] score (i.e. treated as a continuous variable) at week 8 between depressed patients receiving treatment directed by the PReDicT Test and those receiving TaU.</td></tr><tr><td>To compare the change from baseline on the depression and anxiety items (analysed separately) of the QIDS at week 8 between depressed patients receiving treatment directed by the PReDicT Test and those receiving TaU.</td></tr><tr><td>To determine the change of cognitive function (assessed using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] ) from baseline to week 8 between depressed patients receiving treatment directed by the PReDicT Test and those receiving TaU.</td></tr><tr><td>To compare the change from baseline in self-reported social and occupational functioning at weeks 8, 24 and 48 between depressed patients receiving treatment directed by the PReDicT Test and those receiving TaU.</td></tr><tr><td>Safety objective</td><td>To obtain evidence, as required by medical devices legislation, that the PReDicT Test is safe for use in primary care.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Potential participants with symptoms of depression will visit a physician. If a physician, using their standard practice, decides to prescribe an SSRI medication (excluding fluoxetine) to treat their patient&#x02019;s depression, they can be considered for the study. Treatment with fluoxetine is excluded as this drug has a long half-life which limits the ability to rapidly switch to alternative medications as required in the current study if non-response is detected. The physician will provide a brief explanation of the study and will schedule a time for a screening and inclusion visit (see <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>: Table 2) that can be cancelled if the participant decides not to take part in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study centres</title><p id="Par44">Details of study centres are provided at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02790970">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02790970</ext-link>. As the exact structure of the healthcare system, and the care pathway of depressed patients, varies by recruiting country, study centres were selected as the closest to primary-care settings in which antidepressant treatment is routinely managed.

<italic>Sample size</italic>: sample size estimations suggest that 776 participants completed to week 8 are required.</p><p id="Par70">The sample size was determined based on a minimum clinically relevant effect size (i.e. the difference in effect size between the TaU and PReDicT arms) which was set at 10% for the primary outcome (response at 8&#x000a0;weeks measured using the QIDS-SR-16). While there is no general agreement on minimum clinically relevant effect size, a review of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data on antidepressant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that in RCTs of antidepressants versus placebo a minimum of 11% difference in response was significant and measurable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, during discussion with expert clinicians in the protocol development phase an effect size of less than 10% was considered to be clinically non-significant. The baseline response rate in the TaU group was estimated, based on data from a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], at 40%. Adding the minimum clinically relevant effect of guided treatment of 10% to this value results in a response rate of 50% in the PReDicT-guided arm. Setting alpha at 0.05 and power at 80% indicates that a total sample size of 776 participants with primary outcome data (388 per group) would be required to detect the specified minimum clinically relevant difference of 10%. The expected attrition rate across the first 8&#x000a0;weeks of the trial, based on data from the pilot study, is 33%. Participants withdrawn from the study will not be replaced (that is an intention-to-treat analysis will be performed), thus 1158 participants will be enrolled to ensure that 776 participants complete the study.</p><p id="Par71">

If successful, the trial will provide evidence to support a significant alteration in the standard treatment of depression. Specifically, it will suggest a method by which the process of identifying and initiating effective treatments can be substantially condensed relative to current standard practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. By specifying non-responsive patients from a neuropsychological perspective, drawbacks of other studies of early switching of antidepressants might be overcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. From the perspective of a depressed patient, a rational system which is able to more rapidly identify an effective treatment for their illness may well enhance confidence in, and improve adherence to, treatment plans. Conceivably, the ability to personalise treatment may also enhance the risk/benefit assessment of antidepressant use which has been questioned in a recent study which pooled data from clinical trials of the non-personalised use of antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par83">Clearly, the response of patients to antidepressant treatment is variable, with evidence from treatment trials indicating that separation from placebo can be detected at the group level after 1&#x02013;2 weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and side effects commonly occurring early in the course of treatment. The PReDicT Test is, therefore, expected to be one of a number of potential sources of information that clinicians may draw on when making treatment decisions, rather than the sole arbiter of that decision. This is reflected in the design of the current trial in which clinicians are informed of the result of the PReDicT Test but are not required to use this information in their treatment decision if, for example, the patient has clearly responded or developed side effects.</p><p id="Par84">The PReDicT Test used in this trial has been developed as part of a translational research programme which investigates treatment mechanism in depression, largely utilising non-clinical human models of cognition in controlled laboratory settings, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
