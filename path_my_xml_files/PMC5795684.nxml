The report on global burden of disease estimates the point prevalence of unipolar depressive episodes to be 1.9% for men and 3.2% for women, and the 1-year prevalence has been estimated to be 5.8% for men and 9.5% for women.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Introduction of antidepressants was a revolution in the treatment of depression. Response and remission remain the ultimate goal of treatment of depression. A response to treatment is defined as 50% reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or Montgomery&#x02013;Asberg Depression Rating Scale score from the baseline because with older drugs only up to 50% response was possible, but the introduction of newer antidepressant drugs full remission is considered as the goal of treatment. As per studies up to 60% will achieve a response and 28% will have full remission. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the preferred class of antidepressants for depressive disorders. All antidepressants are not as effective as the other counterparts in all kinds of patient. Choice of antidepressants depends on various factors such as clinical features, medical, and psychiatric comorbidities and adverse effects such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Although relative efficacy, improved adverse effect profile and very less chances of toxicity in overdose as compared to older antidepressants, but still the adverse effects of SSRIs remain the most common reason for discontinuation of treatment because of which the risk of relapse and recurrence increases. The most common cause of discontinuation of SSRIs is the treatment emergent sexual dysfunction which is figured up to 24%&#x02013;73%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Escitalopram is a SSRI, for which the research has shown better efficacy and least side effect profile as compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>As all the SSRIs[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and SNRIs have its own major side effects of delayed onset of action and sexual dysfunction which remained a major reason for discontinuing the treatment and overall increase in the burden of illness. Hence, there remains a need of a newer antidepressant which can have rapid onset of action and better tolerability and better side effect profile, including sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and other adverse effects.</p><p>Vilazodone has been termed as a serotonin partial agonist reuptake inhibitor SPARI which is partial agonist of 5HT<sub>1A</sub>. The daily recommended dose for use in depressive disorder is up to 40 mg. This is newer antidepressant which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January 2011. Dual action on serotonin reuptake inhibition and partial agonism on 5HT<sub>1A</sub> increase its antidepressant effect and its tolerability. Studies have shown that vilazodone has better side effect profile and early onset of action as compared to other SSRI.</p><p>As very few studies have been done on vilazodone, and no specific study has been done on comparison of escitalopram and vilazodone. Hence, this study was planned to compare vilazodone and escitalopram in terms of its efficacy in depressive disorder and also the sexual dysfunction and weight gain caused during the course of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODOLOGY</title><p>A longitudinal study (12 weeks) was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Maharishi Markandeshwar Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Mullana.

Half of them were from urban areas, and half were from rural areas, and among them, half were nonskilled professionals and half were skilled professionals with education level of secondary school. All were married, and most of them were from Hindu community.</p><p>In our study, we have found that all the patients who were on vilazodone as well as on escitalopram had improvement in their depressive symptoms on HDRS scale as the days progressed and the difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy was not much. There are studies which have shown similar kind of results with vilazodone[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] as well as with escitalopram[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in context of improvement of depressive symptoms. As we reviewed the past literature, we could not find any study against our finding though as such data are sparse for vilazodone as it is a newer antidepressant and needs to be studied further individually escitalopram is studied very less till now, and most of the studies are broadly on SSRI as a group.</p><p>Sexual dysfunction remains a major concern of patients with depressive illness. The distress <italic>per se</italic> is too much with the symptom, and on above that stigma attached to it in Indian setup enhances the distress associated with this. The causes of sexual problems are first it is a symptom with illness <italic>per se</italic>, second, it can be due the side effect of the antidepressants which leads to the discontinuation of the treatment. In our study, we have observed that sexual dysfunction occur with escitalopram but not with vilazodone rather there was improvement on the ASEX scale of sexual function. There was a study[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] from the United States with consistent findings as that of our which was with vilazodone and citalopram showing higher sexual dysfunctions with citalopram, and there was an improvement in the same in patients who were on vilazodone. There was a randomized, controlled trial[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with inconsistent findings showing that the patients on vilazodone were having higher sexual dysfunction than the placebo. This difference in finding can be explained by that our study was between vilazodone and the older SSRI which has an established side effect of sexual dysfunction while in that randomized controlled trial, and in the second study, the comparison was in between vilazodone and placebo which is not known to us that which drug or substance was given in the form of placebo; hence, whether it has sexual side effects or not.</p><p>Weight gain is one of the major risk factors for nonadherence to treatment. There can be multiple reasons of weight gain in patients with depressive illness. It can be (a) one of the symptoms of depression; (b) can be a side effect of the treatment. Weight gain always remains a problematic issue for patients of depression. First, patients of depression <italic>per se</italic> are at risk of cardiovascular diseases, and weight gain can aggravate the risk; second, weight gain raises the issue of drop outs leading to untreated illness.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] All these factors ultimately increase the burden on economy directly or indirectly. Thus, this issue needs to be addressed carefully. That's why we have compared the two drugs for weight gain. In our study, we have seen that there is an increase in weight in patients who were prescribed escitalopram but patients who were prescribed vilazodone had almost the same weight as that of baseline.</p><p>Consistent results were found in many studies when we reviewed the literature for weight gain with escitalopram showing weight gain in acute phase as well as of chronic phase of treatment,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but there was a pooled analysis which shows paradoxical effect that there is short-term weight loss with antidepressant treatment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The difference in the result in that study can be explained on the basis that the study was done on rodents and our one was done on human beings, and there might be differences in the neuroendocrine pathways of both. Second, in the study, the short-term weight loss during treatment may be a symptom of the underlying illness as antidepressants take time to act to show the results.</p><p>We found the consistent results for weight in vilazodone treatment. All the studies show that there is either no weight gain or there is weight loss,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but we could not found any study revealing weight gain with vilazodone. However, our research for vilazodone is based on very sparse literature as it is a new drug and further studies need to be done to establish the fact. This is probably the only study comparing the weight gain and sexual side effects of vilazodone.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Strengths of study</title><p>
