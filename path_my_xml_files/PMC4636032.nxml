Enrollment occurred between December 2010 and February 2012. Individuals were eligible if they were aged 18&#x02013;35 years, overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] &#x02265; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and currently using a mobile telephone. For logistical reasons, participants were required to receive service from either Verizon or AT&#x00026;T.</p><p id="P13">Individuals were excluded if they were taking weight loss medications or corticosteroids, had weight loss surgery, weighed more than 440lbs (the limit of study scales) or had any condition deemed unsafe for the study. Recruitment occurred primarily by advertising and mass mailings.</p><p id="P14">Pre-screening assessment occurred by participants&#x02019; choice of telephone, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Short Message Service (SMS) or online survey. Participants were further screened by telephone followed by a face-to-face visit, during which all participants provided written informed consent.</p><p id="P15">Randomization occurred at a separate face-to-face visit within 10 weeks of screening, at which baseline weight was obtained. Randomization was stratified by gender and BMI (overweight [BMI &#x02265;25 and &#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] vs. obese [BMI &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>]) with equal allocation to each treatment group. Intervention lasted 24 months, with data collection at 6, 12, and 24 months post-randomization.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="P16">The primary outcome was weight change in kilograms (kg) at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included weight changes at 6 and 12 months, percent change in weight at each time-point, and weight changes in subgroups defined by self-identified race, sex, and age. Other pre-specified outcomes include change in dietary pattern and physical activity (PA).<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Interventions</title><p id="P17">Both the Cell Phone (CP) and Personal Coaching (PC) interventions were designed by our research team, based on social cognitive theory<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and the Transtheoretical model<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Both interventions used techniques of behavioral self-management<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and motivational enhancement<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Targeted goals and behaviors included moderate calorie restriction, healthy dietary pattern (based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, &#x02265;180 minutes/week of moderate PA, limited alcohol intake, and frequent self-monitoring of weight, diet and PA.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Both interventions were designed with input from the target population obtained through focus groups that were conducted in the year before the trial began.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p id="P18">The major difference between CP and PC was the source of intervention delivery and the use of the smartphone. In CP, the smartphone was used for both intervention delivery and self-monitoring. Specifically, the intervention was delivered exclusively through an investigator-designed smartphone app which included goal setting, challenge games, and social support through a &#x0201c;buddy system&#x0201d; that allowed exchange of pre-determined messages to a randomly assigned buddy participant. Self-management behaviors for CP were regularly and frequently prompted by the app according to a protocol-driven schedule; participants did not have a choice in the timing or frequency of prompts. Tailoring within the CP intervention occurred mainly via setting personal goals. Self-monitoring by smartphone was achieved by tracking weight, dietary intake and physical activity, with frequent prompts to self-monitor and feedback on the results.</p><p id="P19">In contrast, the PC intervention was delivered primarily by an interventionist during 6 weekly group sessions followed by monthly phone contacts. Intervention elements such as goal setting, challenges and social support were delivered through these personal coaching interactions, with extensive tailoring during the conversations with the interventionist. The smartphone was used exclusively for self-monitoring, with tracking of weight, dietary intake and physical activity initiated by the participant (i.e., without smartphone prompts), transmitted to the interventionist, and incorporated by the interventionist into the coaching sessions. The PC interventionists were dietitians trained in Motivational Interviewing. Fidelity to the intervention protocol was monitored by the intervention director (P-HL) during regular observation of the group sessions and review of audiotaped monthly calls.</p><p id="P20">In both CP and PC, participants received an Android smart phone, and their personal phone number was transferred to the CITY phone. Participants were expected to use the CITY phone as their sole personal phone. Because text and data service were required for both interventions, participants were reimbursed for this portion of their phone bill.. Participants were also provided a Bluetooth-enabled scale (Tanita HD-351BT) for weight self-monitoring, which automatically transmitted weight through their smartphone to the study database.</p><p id="P21">Participants randomized to the Control group were given three handouts on healthy eating and physical activity from the Eat Smart Move More NC program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eatsmartmovemorenc.com/">http://www.eatsmartmovemorenc.com/</ext-link>), but otherwise received no intervention and were not asked to self-monitor.

Indeed, future trials may need to consider &#x0201c;rapid, responsive, relevant (R3) design&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> in which rapid assessment of usage and outcome allows for responsive design changes that keep the app relevant to users.</p><p id="P45">CP also may have been ineffective because it involved no human intervention contact. In contrast, PC was based on previous trials that incorporated face-to-face or phone contact frequently over a sustained period of time<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Current obesity treatment guidelines recognize the need to &#x0201c;evaluate optimal frequency (and duration) of contact&#x0201d; [in order to focus] on improvements in efficiency and efficacy, [and to optimize] delivery and dissemination&#x0201d;.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Consistent with this need, we attempted to increase the efficiency of the personal coaching approach by reducing the required face-to-face time from at least 14 weekly sessions<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> to 6, followed by monthly phone contact. PC led to significant weight loss relative to Control at 6 months and relative to CP at 6 and 12 months, but the effect size was generally smaller than in studies with more in-person sessions (in older adults)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Thus it is possible that the dose or intensity was insufficient for sustained effect or that this intervention approach is less effective in younger than older adults.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> PC also differed from other personal coaching interventions in its reliance on a mobile app for self-monitoring, a feature that may enhance the effect of coaching.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> On-going additional analysis of detailed phone data for both CP and CP will allow us to identify usage patterns or other factors associated with weight loss.</p><p id="P46">Further research is needed to determine whether increasing both coaching contacts and mobile elements (essentially combining PC and CP) and/or more personal tailoring will increase and/or prolong weight loss.</p><p id="P47">The lack of efficacy at 24 months of both CITY interventions to some extent may be related to the behavior of the Control group, which experienced somewhat better-than-expected outcome. Based on observational data<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, we expected the Control group to gain 1.5 kg/year<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and in most similar trials, weight loss in the Control group is negligible<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Yet after 24 months, average weight was reduced in Control participants, and 22% of them lost at least 5%. Weight loss in control participants is not unusual: Participants may enroll with high motivation that was enhanced by randomization to the Control group, and they may have employed other weight loss strategies. In fact, 54% of Control participants used commercial weight loss apps. However, there was no evidence that the use of commercial apps was associated with greater weight loss: the observed mean weight change from baseline to 24 months within the Control group was &#x02212;1.2 kg (standard deviation [SD] 7.1) for users and &#x02212;1.8 kg (SD 8.0) kg for non-users.</p><p id="P48">Characteristics of our study population may have contributed to the lack of sustained effect. The mean BMI was 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 25% had Class III obesity, suggesting that CITY participants were not on the trajectory of weight gain but in fact had well-established obesity, and many had severe obesity. However, severe obesity is not necessarily an obstacle to behavioral weight loss<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, and in post hoc analysis, baseline BMI category did not modify intervention effect (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, CITY enrolled 36% African Americans, of whom most were Black women, a group that often experiences less weight loss than other trial participants.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> However, subgroup analysis did not suggest differential treatment effects by race. Similarly, there were no differences in treatment effects in subgroups defined (post hoc) by education or income (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, we noted marked heterogeneity in response (range of observed weight change &#x02212;41.2kg to + 31.8kg). These findings suggest the need to develop intervention that is tailored to the individual.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P49">In summary, although conclusions can only be drawn about the specific app tested, the CITY trial sounds a cautionary note concerning intervention delivery by mobile applications alone.. Effective weight loss intervention for young adults that can be implemented efficiently and broadly may require the scalability of mobile technology, the social support and human interaction of personal coaching, adaptive intervention design, and more personally-tailored approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S20"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><p id="P50"><bold>Figure S1:</bold> Effect of interventions on percent change in weight from baseline to 24 months.
