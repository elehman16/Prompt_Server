Currently these symptoms are managed by hormone replacement therapy. However, hormonal therapy can cause complications including malignancy which has resulted in search for various alternative therapies to improve the quality of life (QOL). Yoga is one such alternative therapy shown to enhance the QOL at all stages of human life associated with the chronic illness. There are very few scientific studies regarding the effect of yoga on perimenopause and in this study we investigated the effects of yoga therapy on physical and psychological symptoms using the standardized questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objective:</title><p>To study the effect of yoga therapy on physical, psychological, vasomotor and sexual symptoms of perimenopause.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>It is a prospective non-randomized control study of 216 perimenopausal women with 12 weeks of intervention.

During this transitional phase, woman exhibits severe and multiple symptoms. Frequently reported symptoms fall into several categories, including physical disturbances such as hot flushes, psychological complaints such as mood swings, and other changes that may impair personal or social interactions and diminish the overall quality of life.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In 1990, there were an estimated 467 million women in this state and this number is expected to increase to 1,200 million by the year 2030.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] According to the Indian Menopause Society,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] there will be a large increase in the perimenopausal women in India also. Most women in India over the age of 45 years do not understand the changes taking place in their bodies and spend their valuable years of life battling problems and diseases associated with perimenopause. Hence it becomes very important to develop methods and treatment plans to control perimenopausal symptoms and thereby to improve the quality of life of this large group of women.</p><p>To improve the immediate symptoms of menopause and to manage its long-term consequences, hormonal therapies have been used extensively. However, these therapies have created new concerns about the increased risk of neoplasia of the endometrium and possibly the breast[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and hence several researchers have investigated the role of alternative therapies in the management of menopausal symptoms and quality of life.</p><p>Yoga, the traditional Indian body-mind science has been used effectively in various health disorders affecting almost all the major organ system including cardiovascular, respiratory, neuroendocrine, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal system.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Since perimenopause also affects several organ systems, we conducted this study to evaluate the effects of yoga therapy on menopausal symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This interventional study included 216 perimenopausal women divided into two groups. One group practiced yoga therapy (test group, <italic>n</italic> = 111) and the other practiced a set of physical exercise (control group, <italic>n</italic> = 105). All these subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria of:</p><p>

</p><p>The subjects were from local community and recruited through personal contacts with various women's organizations, clubs (Lion's/Rotary) and self-help groups. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional review board (IEC 062/2008) and the informed consent was obtained from the subjects before starting the intervention.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Yoga and exercise intervention</title><p>The yoga therapy module used was developed on the basis of Patanjala yoga[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Hatha yoga[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to address the physical, psychological and emotional symptoms with suitable practice of asanas, pranayamas and dhyana to result in improvement of overall quality of life. The control group practiced a set of exercise program.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] Both the practices were initially taught under the direct contact of the principal investigator for first two weeks and were later continued with the help of suitable hand outs and regular supervision and follow-up.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Practices used for the two interventional groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-5-180-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The intervention program in both groups were started by collecting the baseline data, teaching and practicing the respective protocols for 45 minutes every day, follow-ups and collection of post-interventional data after 12 weeks of practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire (MENQOL)</title><p>The self-administered questionnaire utilized in this study included socio-demographic information with menstrual history and the menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire (MENQOL).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] MENQOL is a self-administered, &#x02018;scaled&#x02019; 29-item survey questionnaire, designed to measure quality of life in menopausal women and also to measure the extent to which an individual is affected by menopausal symptoms. It comprises the four domains, Vasomotor, Psychosocial, Physical and Sexual, which are graded separately.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All pre and post data were analyzed by using SPSS Version 15. The individual variables were evaluated to determine the changes in two groups after 12 weeks. The pre and post data of MENQOL questionnaire total and domain wise was analyzed by using repeated measures of ANOVA. The effectiveness was calculated as &#x02018;within the group&#x02019; (yoga and control group), &#x02018;between the groups&#x02019; (yoga vs. control) and &#x02018;Effect size&#x02019; (mean difference) to deduce the superiority of the methods involved and results are reported as mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The socio-demographic data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.

Many of these women expressed their distress and helplessness regarding these symptoms, which were seriously interfering in their day-to-day living. Thus there is a need to search and develop a cost-effective, simple, community-based therapeutic tool to provide symptom relief and to improve health status, and in this perspective yoga has emerged as the appropriate system to deal effectively with issues related to perimenopause. The present study clearly demonstrates the clinical utility of yoga in significantly reducing the perimenopausal symptom in all domains and thereby improves the overall quality of life.</p><p>Asanas, pranayama and dhyana, the components of yoga therapy, seem to improve the symptom profile in the four domains through several physiological and biochemical mechanisms. The improvement in physical strength and fitness caused by yoga seems to be related to several factors like muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and pulmonary function.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The intense stretching and muscle conditioning associated with attaining and holding yoga postures increases the skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and decrease glycogen utilization, possibly caused by increased vascularization, increased intramuscular oxygen and glycogen stores or by increased numbers of mitochondria.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Yoga practice also may increase the absorption of the calcium from the intestine, stimulate bone remodeling and maintain the load bearing capacity of the bone; reduces the pain in the back of the head, neck, lower back and headache by influencing limbic system modulation of endogenous pain control system.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Ours is the first study to document the beneficial effects of yoga on perimenopausal-related psychological symptoms. This impact of yoga seems to be due to its effect on the functioning of nervous system leading to increase in alpha rhythm, intrahemispheric coherence and homogeneity in the brain[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and increase in P 300 phase amplitude[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] all of which seems to enhance the cognitive processes. Menopausal anxiety can be a very difficult symptom to manage, but yoga therapy showed significant improvement compared to physical exercise. Several mechanisms like altered neurotransmitters,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] changed brain blood flow and brain metabolism[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and sympathetic activation[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] seems to be responsible for this improvement brought by yoga practice.</p><p>Compared to physical exercise group, yoga showed most significant effect in managing the symptoms of vasomotor domain. All the three symptoms in this domain, that is, hot flushes, night sweats and sweating were significantly reduced in the yoga group while no improvement was observed in any of the symptoms in control group. Especially, the improvement in hot flushes through yoga was very rewarding, since this is most difficult symptom to manage and affects the overall quality of life. The vasomotor symptom improvement brought about by yoga intervention seems to be due to its effect in modulating autonomous nervous system with special attention to decreased sympathetic nervous system activation[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which in turn seems to affect the thermoregulation resulting in vasodilatation and sweating.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>All the three symptoms in the sexual domain were also significantly improved after yoga therapy. Though the reported prevalence of sexual complaints in Asian woman is lower than in their Caucasian counterparts, improvements in these symptoms contribute to the overall quality of life. The yoga postures used in this study are known to improve the tone of the muscles of pelvic region and enhance the blood circulation to the urogenital area.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Thus, yoga improved most of the symptom profile thus contributing significantly in the improvement of overall quality of life. Yoga is relatively simple to learn and is economical, non-invasive with multiple collateral lifestyle benefits. Group and individual practice may also help to improve lifestyle choices and health-related attitudes in part, by enhancing psychological well-being and thereby contributing significantly to chronic disease protection and health promotion. Though most of the clinical effects of yoga are probably brought about by vagal stimulation and parasympathetic activation, the complete mechanisms underlying the reported benefits remain poorly understood. Clearly, additional high-quality research is warranted to confirm and further explore the putative beneficial effects of yoga in perimenopausal women.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Speroff</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Lobo</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The menopause a signal for the future</article-title><source>Treatment of the Postmenopausal Women</source><year>1999</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippincott Williams and Wilkins</publisher-name><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>10</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Research on menopause in the 1990s.
