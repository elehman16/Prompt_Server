Introduction</title><p>Postmenopausal women exhibit higher concentrations of inflammatory markers and are also at increased risk for many of the age- and inactivity-related diseases that are prevalent in our society today, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].  Chronic exercise has been shown to create favorable changes in the inflammatory profile and is a viable means for preventing the onset and slowing the progression of these diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While this reduction in inflammation has been linked to a decrease in cardiovascular disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], understanding the molecular underpinnings associated with this response may provide further support for the use of resistance exercise as an adjunct or primary treatment for postmenopausal women with inflammatory risk factors.</p><p>Acute alterations in inflammation immediately after exercise are evidenced by elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>), and increased activity of macrophages    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].  In conjunction with increased macrophage activation, acute alterations in inflammation after an exercise bout cause downstream increases in circulating levels of macrophages, natural killer cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, T-helper, and T-cytotoxic cells    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].  Conversely, a previous work has shown that chronic, combined resistance, and aerobic exercise leads to a reduction in inflammation within 10&#x02013;12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and a recent report suggests that resistance training alone may have a significant role in reducing inflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Specifically, consistent exercise is associated with a reduction in inflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines in circulation in conjunction with altered sensitivity of macrophages to inflammatory stimuli    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>One area of cellular signaling that has been seemingly overlooked in the exploration of the effects of exercise on inflammation is the melanocortin system. Melanocortin receptors are well characterized G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors (GPCRs) that act to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There are five known melanocortin receptor subtypes: melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) through melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R). One of the most well-studied systems with respect to the MC3R is the leptin signaling pathway. Briefly, leptin is an endocrine hormone secreted in proportion to the amount of adipose tissue present. Leptin binds to leptin receptors located on pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons within the hypothalamus, specifically the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. POMC is upregulated in response to leptin binding and is proteolitically cleaved into several active peptides, including alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These peptides act as agonists within the CNS for MC3Rs. Activation of CNS MC3Rs leads to increases in lipolysis and energy expenditure    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. MCRs are also expressed in the periphery where they may play a role in immunomodulation. The melanocortin receptor subtypes, MC1R, MC3R, and MC5R are found on the plasma membranes of monocytes, macrophages, CD4+ T helper cells, granulocytes, and natural killer cells where, separately, they are activated in response to stress    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We hypothesize that a redundant signaling mechanism involving POMC and its peptide variants may activate and modulate expression of MCR on systemic monocytes. Interestingly, activation of the MC3R by <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH and ACTH in the periphery causes secretion of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10 (IL-10)    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The MC3R-induced secretion of IL-10 underscores the potential importance of MC3R as an anti-inflammatory modulator due to the ability of IL-10 to inhibit inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> secretion from leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].  Because of its anti-inflammatory properties as well as its role in energy metabolism, the melanocortin system has become an area of robust research as a potential therapeutic target to pharmacologically treat inflammatory-related conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that MC3R may play a novel role in exercise-mediated changes in inflammation. Using chronic resistance training in overweight, postmenopausal women, we hypothesized that RT may increase MC3R expression, reduce inflammation, and change the sensitivity of leukocytes to inflammatory stimuli. </p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Subjects</title><p>Obese (BMI 32.7 &#x000b1; 3.7) women aged 65.6 &#x000b1; 2.8 years, not having participated in consistent exercise for the previous 6 months, signed an informed consent, completed a medical history form, and obtained written approval from their personal physician. Potential subjects underwent a medical screening (physical exam and dementia screening) by our study physician and completed a sub-maximal treadmill test while blood pressure and ECG were monitored.  Any subject meeting the exclusion criteria of the American College of Sports Medicine for exercise testing was excluded.  NSAID users were asked to refrain from taking their medication until after the experimental trials on test days.  Other exclusion criteria were  severe arthritis, central or peripheral nervous system disorders, previous stroke, acute or chronic infection, major affective disorder, HIV infection or autoimmune disorders, metabolic disorders (type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus), smokers or smokeless tobacco users, regular aerobic or resistive exercise within the previous six months, oral steroid use, and alcohol intake greater than &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; (1 drink/day).  Subjects were asked to maintain their &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; diet regimen throughout the intervention period and to consume no alcohol the days prior to any blood sampling.  Subjects recorded all food consumed during the 24 hours prior to the pretraining blood sample which was to represent a &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; day's diet.  After the 12-week intervention, they were given a copy of that food log and asked to record and consume the same meals during the 24 hours prior to the posttraining blood sample.  Several subjects were taking general multivitamins, but no one was taking supplemental fish oil or omega-3. Subjects were randomized to either a control (CON: <italic>N</italic> = 11) or exercise group (EX: <italic>N</italic> = 12).

Results</title><p>This was a supervised exercise intervention, and data presented here represent a subset of subjects from a larger study.  Adherence to the exercise protocol was excellent as all EX subjects completed the prescribed 36 resistance exercise sessions. CON participants attended an average of 91% (22 of 24) of their control sessions. There was no difference in body weight, BMI, or percent body fat between groups prior to the intervention period.  No differences were observed after the intervention period for the descriptive variables above in resistance trained or untrained control postmenopausal women.

In comparison, control individuals showed no change in MC3R mRNA expression following the intervention period. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>Traditionally, exercise has been used to help prevent or slow the progression of several inflammatory diseases including type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].  More recently, RT has been found to positively alter inflammatory profiles    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].  Here, we show evidence that MC3R may play a novel role in explaining these improvements. Specifically, our results are the first to suggest that chronic resistance training may be involved in increasing MC3R gene expression in human whole blood. These results are provocative given that there was a slight increase in IL-10 mRNA coupled with a significant increase in MC3R gene expression without a concomitant change in leukocyte number and a reduction in monocyte number. Given the lack of change in leukocyte counts and the reduction in monocyte number that has been shown in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], these findings point to changes in gene expression and cell function that are not merely reflective of changes in cell population number. </p><p>Previous data have suggested that other cell populations or tissues may be involved in controlling inflammation    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Adiposity is directly related to inflammatory status, where inflammation is an indication of dysfunction in cellular metabolism and increased adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].  For example, MC3R KO mice exhibit increased adiposity and nutrient partitioning in addition to impaired immune function, evidenced by decreased macrophage infiltration and decreased monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and chemokine of differentiation 68 (CD68) mRNA expression into adipose tissue in comparison to wild-type mice    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].  Conversely, Trevaskis et al. have shown an increase in macrophage infiltration and increases in and CD68 and MCP-1 mRNA expression within the adipose tissue in MC3R KO mice compared to control    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Comparisons of the two studies are difficult to make, as the mice in the study by Ellacott et al. were weaned directly onto 40% HF diet for 4 weeks and sacrificed thereafter, whereas the mice in the study by Trevaskis et al. were weaned onto a standard 10% chow diet then switched to an HF 60% diet at 12 to 14 weeks of age until 24 to 26 weeks of age at which time they were sacrificed    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Differences in outcome variables may be due to the age of the mice as well as the fat content of the diet, with a dose response occurring due to each. Further support for an anti-inflammatory role of the MC3R occurs in models of vascular inflammation    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Within the mesenteric artery, it has been shown that stimulation of MC3R by <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>MSH decreases cell adhesion, emigration, and cytokine expression in response to ischemia and reperfusion injury of the vasculature    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Agonist stimulation of MC3R  also decreases arthritis incidence and severity, evidenced by decreased  nuclear factor kappa B (NF<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) DNA-binding activity in response to receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) stimulation and decreased chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) expression. Additionally, MC3R expression is crucial in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects induced by vascular tissue injury, as MC3R KO mice exhibit increased cell emigration and adhesion and increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine  mRNA expression in response to mesenteric artery tissue injury    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. MC3R KO mice also express increased IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-6, chemokine receptors, and chemokine ligands within isolated osteoclasts from arthritic joints, indicating increased inflammation in response to inflammatory stress, further supporting a role of MC3R in mediating the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].  While it is well established that adiposity and MC3R expression play a significant role in inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], it is possible to achieve alterations in inflammation without changes in body composition. For example, exercise training studies have shown that inflammation can be altered, even with short intervention periods without a change in body composition    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].  Thus, it is important to note that while the EX subjects in the current study tended to experience an increase in IL-10 mRNA expression and had increased expression of the MC3R, they did not experience significant alterations in body weight or composition. RT causes changes in gene expression independent of changes in adiposity and despite decreases in monocyte number. </p><p>The results presented here provide a glimpse into how circulating cell function may be altered with exercise. Specifically, maximal capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines, as evidenced by the LPS-stimulated TNF-a production, was increased in EX compared to CON groups.  These data differ from a previous work which has shown a decrease in LPS-stimulated TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> after exercise training in postmenopausal women    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].  It is possible that alterations in MC3R expression lead to sensitization of circulating immune cells to inflammatory stimuli.  Thus, future studies that involve stimulating whole blood cultures with agonists and antagonists to MC3R and measuring inflammatory markers may provide more information on the activity of these receptors in response to RT.  Exercise-induced changes in MC3R may be mediated by ACTH and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>MSH    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It is known that an increase of ACTH is observed during an acute bout of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Possible mechanisms responsible for these increases in ACTH may be related to the induction of IL-6 or IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> observed acutely after exercise    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].  Postexercise increases in IL-6 may be due to changes in macrophages/monocytes or myocyte IL-6 production, whereas IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> secretion is more tightly linked to leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].  These cytokines may be associated with increased exercise-induced concentrations of ACTH and our observed monocyte/macrophage (whole blood) sensitization and MC3R upregulation.  It is also possible that sensitization of the MC3R  and expression, indirectly regulated by proinflammatory cytokine production acutely during and following an exercise bout,  may be linked to the reductions in circulating inflammatory markers observed in other exercise studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. </p><p>There were several limitations in this study.  This was an exploratory investigation designed to examine the relationship between exercise and inflammation, but it was not specifically focused on the melanocortin receptor.  As a result, we acknowledge that our subject pool was somewhat small. Regardless of sample size, however, we observed a statistically significant upregulation (16-fold) of the MC3R in our participants with a statistical power of 0.5811 with the current number of subjects. Yet, when we divided our EX group into LR and HR, we observed a significant upregulation (34.9 fold) of MC3R with a statistical power of 0.902. A larger study will be necessary to explore the reasons for the variation (HR versus LR) in response to the RT program.  Furthermore, although MC3R is expressed in a number of immune cell populations, its actions have been most explored in the monocyte population because they are some of the most responsive and largest producers of inflammation in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, measuring exercise-induced changes in MC3R cell-surface expression in specific immune cell populations, including monocytes, may be an important direction for future work. Finally, stimulation assays in untrained and trained individuals with known agonists and antagonists to MC3R will help further understand the role of exercise in modulating the sensitivity of this receptor.  </p><p>In summary, it appears that 12 weeks of moderate-intense resistance training led to a 16-fold upregulation of MC3R gene expression in whole blood from obese postmenopausal women.  We are the first to examine the influence of exercise on aspects of the melanocortin system in humans.  These findings may help to explain previously observed reductions in inflammation consequent to consistent exercise training.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a Texas Christian University Research and Creative Activities Fund Grant, the John Peter Smith Hospital Sport Medicine Program, and the Louisiana State University Graduate Student Corbett Award to T.
