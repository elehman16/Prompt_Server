Pregnancy is an important developmental milestone that is associated with significant opportunities for weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] including carrying excess weight into a pregnancy or failing to lose weight gained during pregnancy. This excess weight associated with the childbearing years may contribute to obesity-related risk and illness later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Physical activity (PA) has well-established beneficial effects on weight management. There is strong evidence that engaging in moderate-intensity PA most days of the week can improve health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Sedentary behavior is more prevalent among Latinas than among their Anglo counterparts, contributing to a relatively higher risk of poor health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While limiting energy intake plays an important role in decreasing one&#x02019;s risk of obesity, increasing PA is an important strategy that has been successfully used to manage weight across the lifespan. Despite the known benefits of PA, 67.5% of Hispanic women of Mexican heritage of all ages fail to meet the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for 150&#x000a0;minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity, and 46.7% are classified as inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further, the problem of postpartum weight management is coupled with limited understanding of overweight, obesity, and PA with subsequent risk for conditions that may lead to chronic illness, mediated by unfavorable metabolic changes such as increased inflammatory processes.</p><p>Among Latinas, social support and strong peer exercise norms are consistently and positively related to PA. Social support is the most commonly reported correlate of PA for Latinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and support can be an important mechanism for behavior change related to weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pregnant and postpartum Mexican-born Latinas view social support more essential to the maintenance of PA to a greater extent than women of other ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In data from the Women&#x02019;s Cardiovascular Health Network, correlates of PA among Latinas included knowing and observing others who engaged in PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An important correlate is the neighborhood environment that can promote or deter the desire to be physically active, but neighborhood characteristics such as safety concerns, heavy street traffic, and presence of stray dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] may create barriers to regular PA. Neighborhood characteristics and resident perceptions about neighborhoods are associated with neighborhood-level socioeconomic status, obesity/body mass index (BMI) and related behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Factors associated with a neighborhood that can discourage healthy behaviors (e.g., healthy eating, PA) include unlighted streets, lack of curbs or sidewalks, limited neighborhood food purchase accessibility, and crime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The socioeconomic barriers to residing in more desirable areas tend to be higher for Latinos of Mexican and Puerto Rican origin than for other racial/ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and living in more disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with higher BMI values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Neighborhood characteristics are not the sole factors inhibiting PA participation as childbearing provides its own unique challenges. Women tend to decrease PA during pregnancy and after birth for many reasons, such as the demanding role transitions to new motherhood or the occurrence of depression symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Other barriers to PA after birth may be associated with cultural norms regarding the acceptability of PA or decreased opportunity to lose pregnancy-associated weight due to a shortened interconception phase.</p><p>Weight loss, especially fat loss, in the postpartum phase has important health consequences. Accumulating evidence from recent studies points to the role of proinflammatory cytokines released by fat tissue in generating the chronic inflammatory profile associated with obesity and its related metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Obesity-associated insulin resistance is thought to result, at least in part, from chronic subclinical inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Rather alarmingly, this chronic subclinical inflammation is observed in both obese and overweight people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Elevated concentrations of many circulating inflammatory factors are also considered markers of systemic inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 (IL-6, IL-8, respectively), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). These markers are associated with obesity and insulin resistance and also appear to predict the development of diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease<italic>.</italic> Fat tissue may contribute to the increased concentrations of inflammatory factors by producing endocrine and paracrine inflammatory factors (adipokines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Adipose tissue secretion of IL-6 may constitute up to a third of its plasma concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The secretion rate of IL-8 by adipose tissue correlates with BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and may account for the elevated plasma IL-8 concentration found in obese people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Regular physical activity suppresses tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) production by fat tissue and thereby offers protection against TNF-&#x003b1;-induced insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Physical activity and diet, but not diet alone, decrease plasma levels of CRP and IL-6 and improve abdominal fat tissue metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. As well, weight reduction, due to diet and physical activity, decrease circulating levels of CRP, IL-6, and IL-8 and decrease markers of fat tissue inflammation, such as the expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#x003b1; in fat tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In premenopausal women, changes in plasma concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; correlate well with specific alterations in the relative amounts of subcutaneous fat mass and visceral fat mass after PA training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. One postulated mechanism by which PA and/or weight loss reduces circulating levels of the inflammatory markers is through a decrease in levels of cytokines produced by fat tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For example, physical activity reduces the expression of IL-6 in fat tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and increases circulating levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1receptor antagonist (Ra) and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Improving the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory markers may be a key factor underlying the metabolic benefits of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and for this study, we used (1) mRNA concentrations of representative inflammatory markers (IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1;) using Real Time PCR (RTPCR) and (2) protein concentrations of typical regulators of inflammation (NF-&#x003ba;b p65 and NF-&#x003ba;b Inducing Kinase).</p><p>Here we report the effects of <italic>Madres para la Salud</italic> (<italic>Madres</italic>), a theoretically driven social support intervention program, on health outcomes among postpartum Latina women.

The number of minutes spent in aerobic steps also was recorded.</p><p>Both the accelerometer and the pedometer were worn concurrently on opposite hips for 7&#x000a0;days during waking hours and at the same time the PA records were kept (e.g., baseline and 6 and 12&#x000a0;months).

Using a one-minute epoch duration to aggregate movement counts, the Freedson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and Matthews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] ActiGraph cut points were used to compute PA intensity levels as sedentary (&#x0003c;100 counts), light (100-760 counts), moderate-lifestyle (760-1,951 counts), moderate-walking (1,952-5,724 counts), and vigorous (&#x0003e;5,725 counts).

The significant Group &#x000d7; Time interaction on total steps/day was qualified by a significant interaction with Violence (F(2, 118)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.14, <italic>p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.</italic>0468), such that in the control group, total steps/day increased steadily from baseline to 12&#x000a0;months, with Violence consistently negatively related to total steps/day across all time points (i.e., main effects of Time and Violence), while in the intervention group, change in number of steps (particularly from 6&#x000a0;months to 12&#x000a0;months) was positively related to the level of Violence. Intervention participants in higher Violence areas showed relatively stronger increases from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months than those reporting average or low levels of Violence. Intervention participants reporting higher levels of Violence showed slight increases in PA from 6&#x000a0;months to 12&#x000a0;months, while those reporting average and low Violence levels showed modest decreases.

Other work has yielded similar findings among postpartum Latinas. Thornton and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] indicated that husbands were a primary source of support in promoting healthy eating and regular PA and in-laws were considered a secondary source of support. Our data show that 76% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;107) of the women in this study lived in households with 4-7 occupants who were primarily family members. Household size might explain the finding that family presence was related to perceived support. However, the results show that while social support increased during the social support intervention assessed at 3&#x000a0;months, the support declined to pre-intervention levels at the end of the 48&#x000a0;weeks walking conclusion. Our interview data following the intervention indicated that the majority of the Latinas&#x02019; perceived support for walking was from family members, including husbands, mothers, siblings, and to some extent in-law relations. The support was emotional, advisory, and instrumental with provision of childcare and room and board. For women in the Madres intervention, it appears that social support was effective when it was &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; (first 3&#x000a0;months, during the social support intervention delivery) leading to the possibility that participation in the study contributed to improvement in social support and subsequent increases in PA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Physical activity</title><p>There were significant improvements in pedometer-determined aerobic steps, time spent walking at an aerobic pace, and total steps taken and in accelerometer-assessed time spent in moderate intensity walking activities due the intervention. At baseline, the wide range of overweight and obesity in the Latinas in this study was accompanied by a low and narrow range of PA as measured by self-report SBAS, pedometer steps, and accelerometer data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Given that we excluded women who were physically active from the study, their sedentary behavior was not surprising, but still lower than expected. The increases in intentional PA in the intervention group provide evidence that the support offered during study participation as well as perceptions of most neighborhood characteristics can facilitate walking behaviors in young mothers with infant and sibling children. The young Latinas recruited for <italic>Madres</italic> began this intervention with higher levels of obesity and sedentary behavior than reported by survey data, setting the stage for improvement following the <italic>Madres</italic> social support intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>In research examining associations among acculturation, overweight and obesity, and sedentary behavior acculturation has been found to be strongly associated with obesity but less strongly associated with obesity-related behaviors such as diet and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. For example, in a study of Mexican women, the highly acculturated had higher BMI, fat mass, fasting insulin, and diastolic blood pressure than low-acculturated women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p>Many acculturation measures assess language use and comfort with the use of native language; however, emerging thought considers that other factors, such as length of time in the country and contextual nuances of neighborhood life, might contribute to sedentary behavior and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Research suggests that immigration status, length of residence in the U.S., socioeconomic status, and residential environment might play a much larger role in the health statue of culturally diverse and immigrant women than previously thought. Findings based on Latina members of focus groups who discussed their immigration status and weight gain/overweight showed that immigration affects cultural practices and may negatively influence diet quality through lack of preferred foods, social isolation, and food choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Other research has found that Latinas who become more acculturated may be at greater risk for certain adverse health outcomes and engage in less PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. As seen in our data, recent immigrants may move to neighborhoods where safety concerns make the areas less conducive to PA, thereby contributing to current or future obesity risks. These findings raise important questions regarding how immigrants make choices about relinquishing values and behaviors of their native cultures and adopting those of the mainstream U.S. culture and how these choices affect health and related behaviors as time living as a U.S. resident increases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Dietary intake</title><p>As compared to 2009-2010 population data on all women, dietary intake reported at baseline in this sample of young Latinas was lower than expected for total calories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and higher than expected for percentage of fat intake. This finding is consistent with data showing underreporting intake among Mexican American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], that individuals using 24-hour recall underreport energy intake by 16-20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], and our own earlier research showing a similar pattern of under-reporting or under-expected energy intake among Latinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Though the data are inconclusive, plausible reasons for under-reporting of energy intake include women forgetting where and with whom food was consumed; eating patterns geared to food and food preparation for growing families; or patterns in dietary intake in the context of gender, culture, and ethnicity that have been reported as significant confounders by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The joint influence of all or some of these factors on underreporting of consumption could explain the apparent paradox of low caloric intake coupled with overweight and obesity in this sample of Latinas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Neighborhood characteristics</title><p>Aspects of a neighborhood&#x02019;s built environment that contribute to healthy behaviors (e.g. healthy eating and PA) include safety, lighted streets, curbs, neighborhood food purchase accessibility, and crime. Hispanics have been shown to be more socioeconomically limited in their ability to live in or move to better neighborhoods than other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], and living in more disadvantaged neighborhoods may contribute to overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Baseline data of the Neighborhood Environment Questionnaire showed that the Latinas in this study judged their neighborhoods to be somewhat below the mean in interest, shared values, availability of healthy foods, safety cohesion, and interaction with neighbors. They assessed violence as above average. Census and community survey data underscored the women&#x02019;s modest neighborhood support and indicated that their residential milieus were suboptimal for engaging in neighborhood support and outdoor activities. The neighborhoods from which our sample was drawn were largely comprised of immigrants and were often targets of immigration checks by local law enforcement officers, resulting in behaviors that prioritized hidden identity (i.e. not walking in neighborhoods, shopping) behaviors that often precluded the neighborhood support and cohesion needed for optimal health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Parameters for body fat</title><p>The young women in this study showed parameters for body fat in the &#x0201c;obese&#x0201d; range, and declines in body adiposity assessed using bioelectric impedance. Because we did not obtain pre-pregnancy weight and the majority of the participants had several children, we are unable to assess if the weight postpartum was retained from earlier pregnancies or the most recent pregnancy. Nonetheless, overweight and obesity in this group of Latinas mirror those of Latinas in national surveys, indicating significant obesity-related health risks in these young women as a group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The weight gained during pregnancy and retained at postpartum is often characteristic of central adiposity, and these deposits contribute to insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Thus, the health risks associated with pregnancy weight gain and retention place these women at risk for future metabolic disorders.</p><p>What is interesting though is while the physical activity increased among the treatment group in terms of steps, aerobic steps and duration of aerobic steps, this had relatively little short-term impact on body fat, and no sustained effect on body fat. Indeed, the control group showed a monotonic decrease over time and the intervention group showing a slight decrease from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months and then a slight increase from 6&#x000a0;months to 12&#x000a0;months. This shows that for initial and sustained fat loss, physical activity needs to be sustained and aerobic, and certainly more effective with dietary moderation.</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Fat tissue inflammation</title><p>While findings from a few studies (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]) suggest that exercise reduces systemic inflammation associated with obesity, to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#x003b1;) in fat tissue of overweight and obese women correlated positively with sedentary activity and negatively with light activity during normal daily life at baseline. Although the small sample size for the inflammatory marker group may have contributed to the overall lack of statistical significance when examining changes over time, light- and moderate-intensity activity after the intervention correlated negatively with fat tissue content of a common regulator in inflammation (NF-&#x003ba;b). The inflammatory markers chosen in this study served as representative, typical markers that have been shown to play important roles in linking fat tissue inflammation with systemic inflammation and subsequent metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. At best, the findings suggest that sustained moderate-intensity walking is needed to help reduce inflammation in fat tissue, and possibly other organs, thus minimizing systemic inflammation and related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Depression symptoms</title><p>The Madres intervention had no impact on depression rates among this group of postpartum Latinas, and depression symptoms showed a predicted decline across the 12-months of the study. The impact of mental health on physical health and associated morbidities is complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Some research shows that depression is high among Hispanic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and higher among Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans than among non-Hispanic whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], but that within Hispanic groups, rates of depression vary depending on socio-demographic, health, and economic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The Latinas in this study were at high risk for depressive symptoms after birth possibly due to their socioeconomic status, neighborhood characteristics, and primary language. Our choice to use higher cut scores for measurement of depressive symptoms may have resulted in women with problematic depressive symptoms being categorized as non-depressed (scores &#x02264;12). Cut scores of 7/8 for likelihood of depression and 11/12 for likelihood of major depression have been used to evaluate postpartum women living in Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. In a validation study, Lagerberg and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] colleagues found a specificity of 24% when using the traditional cut score of 11/12 as we did in the present study. Sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 82% were found in the Lagerberg study when using cut scores of 6/7. Thus, a lower cut score than was used in this study may be warranted, especially when working with disadvantaged groups or those for whom English is not a first language.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study reports the effects of the <italic>Madres para la Salud</italic> program on health outcomes among postpartum Latinas and examined the effectiveness of the <italic>Madres</italic> intervention for improving (i.e., reducing) the distal outcomes of (a) percent body fat, (b) fat tissue inflammation, and (c) depression symptoms among postpartum Latinas and determined the relationship between the immediate outcome of walking (minutes walked per week) and change in the distal outcomes. While the social support intervention showed increases in social support, the link between these increases were only tenuously linked to increases in PA and body fat reduction. Some limitations are apparent in this protocol: 1) the attention control group was not an equal attention-control group- receiving only monthly newsletters, and 2) the use of the BIA as a measure of body fat is subject to variability of lean tissue, hydration and age. Three implications from this report are evident: 1) the behavioral intervention of social support was effective in increasing PA among the women in the intervention study arm, but only during active treatment delivery, 2) the dose of moderate PA without dietary intervention was insufficient to reduce body fat in the treatment arm, and 3) the possibility that neighborhood environment (i.e. safety), contributed to the lack of sustainability in women&#x02019;s walking. Further research requires a combination of diet and PA to achieve weight (fat loss) and social support strategies need to be determined that achieve long lasting behavioral change in PA.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CK designed study, conducted intervention, supervised data analysis and interpretation, wrote manuscript.
