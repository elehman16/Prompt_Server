However, dementia remains underdetected and suboptimally managed in general practice. Our objective was to test the effect of a workplace-based tailored educational intervention developed for general practice on the clinical management of people with dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The tailored educational intervention was tested in an unblinded cluster randomized controlled trial with a pre/post-intervention design, with two arms: usual/normal care control versus educational intervention. The primary outcome measure was an increase in the proportion of patients with dementia who received at least two documented dementia-specific management reviews per year. Case identification was a secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>23 practices in South-East England participated. A total of 1,072 patients with dementia (intervention: 512, control: 560) had information in their medical records showing the number of reviews within 12 months (or a proportion of) before intervention or randomization and within 12 months (or a proportion of) after. The mean total number of dementia management reviews after the educational intervention for people with dementia was 0.89 (SD 1.09; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 8) compared with 0.89 (SD 0.92; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 4) before intervention. In the control group prior to randomization the mean total number of dementia management reviews was 1.66 (SD 1.87; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 12) and in the period after randomization it was 1.56 (SD 1.79; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 11). Case detection rates were unaffected. The estimated incidence rate ratio for intervention versus control group was 1.03 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.927, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.86).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The trial was timely, coinciding with financial incentives for dementia management in general practice (through the Quality Outcomes Framework); legal imperatives (in the form of the Mental Capacity Act 2005); policy pressure (The National Dementia Strategy 2009); and new resources (such as dementia advisors) that increased the salience of dementia for general practitioners. Despite this the intervention did not alter the documentation of clinical management of patients with dementia in volunteer practices, nor did it increase case identification.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00866099">NCT00866099</ext-link>/Clinical Trials</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dementia</kwd><kwd>Memory disorders</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Family medicine</kwd><kwd>Information management</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>UK</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Timely diagnosis can relieve the significant psychological distress that people with dementia and their close supporters experience. It allows them to engage with medical and psychosocial support, acquire or strengthen positive coping strategies, fulfill short-term goals and plan for the future, all of which can maintain and/or improve functioning and morale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Efforts to improve the identification and diagnosis of dementia should be targeted at primary care, as this is the first point of contact for most individuals and their caregivers. However, dementia presents many challenges for primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and it remains underdetected and suboptimally managed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. General practitioners in England consistently report limited skills and confidence in diagnosis and management of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and a minority see this as a task only for specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. An educational intervention to improve the skills of practitioners in the recognition of, and response to, dementia syndromes would be expected to be beneficial. However, in the absence of organizational change in health services and incentivisation of high quality care, evidence suggests that education alone is unlikely to change practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Since 2000, a natural experiment has occurred in the English National Health Service (NHS) via the introduction of policies and financial incentives for dementia diagnosis and management that have made a trial of an educational intervention in primary care to improve clinical practice particularly timely. Evidence-based policy imperatives, including guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], are driving NHS management to prioritize dementia, especially earlier diagnosis and better clinical management in the community (the English Dementia Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Since 2006 changes in the reimbursement of primary care physicians through the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) have incentivised the diagnosis and management of dementia syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], rewarding construction of a dementia disease registry and completion of an annual review of each patient with dementia (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These policy and financial incentives for dementia diagnosis and management have created an ideal environment for a trial of an educational intervention in primary care, designed to improve clinical practice.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Dementia indicators for the quality and outcomes framework</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Indicator</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Description</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">Dementia (DEM) indicator 1<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The practice reports the number of patients with dementia on its register and the number of people with dementia as a proportion of its list size.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rationale: A register is a prerequisite for the organization of good primary care for a particular patient group.

Patient assessments should therefore include the assessment of any behavioral changes caused by: concurrent physical conditions (for example, joint pain or intercurrent infections) new appearance of features intrinsic to the disorder (for example, wandering) and delusions or hallucinations due to the dementia or as a result of caring behavior (for example, being dressed by a carer).<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Depression should also be considered since it is more common in people with dementia than those without the diagnosis and sources of help and support (bearing in mind issues of confidentiality).</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Table adapted from the Quality and Outcomes Framework guidance 2009/10, BMA 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec><title>Recognition of and response to dementia</title><p>This project builds on an earlier trial, which demonstrated that educational interventions can improve the recognition of dementia syndromes in general practice, but did not alter documented practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The educational intervention reported here was developed by a group of practitioners from relevant disciplines and advised by caregivers of people with dementia. The design process, which is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], was based on three premises:</p><p>1. An adult learning approach to solving real-world problems would be needed, emphasizing the educational benefits of conversations, understood as social acts of collaboration that generate and improvise ideas collectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>2. Tailoring of learning to the needs of the learners can be achieved using processes of educational needs assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and educational prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], both techniques developed by the evidence-based medicine movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Educational prescriptions are a useful tool for enabling follow-up of learning and can be used in any practice setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>3. Learning would take place in the workplace, and be open to all team members (healthcare practitioners and administrative staff). Through reciprocal learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] peers and colleagues can be the most effective educators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and there is a particular benefit from learning from other disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This group effect in learning meant that a cluster-randomized design, with randomization at the practice level, was appropriate to this trial.</p><p>Adopting these premises, we developed a flexible learning needs assessment tool that allows an educational intervention to be tailored to the group needs and skills of the existing practice team. After a feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] this intervention was tested in the current EVIDEM-ED randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The effectiveness of the new educational intervention was tested in an unblinded cluster randomized, controlled trial with a pre/post design and with two arms; usual care versus educational intervention (see consort diagram in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The EVIDEM-ED flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-397-1"/></fig><p>Standard significance tests assume that random sampling has taken place, and that the behavior or knowledge of any one individual is not affected by others in the sample.

This 'clustering effect&#x02019; can mean that false conclusions are drawn about relationships in the data, an effect that we controlled for by using cluster membership (that is, respondents in each practice).</p><sec><title>Study setting</title><p>The study took place in group practices within the geographical care covered by the North Thames Dementias and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (NT DeNDRoN).</p></sec><sec><title>Educational intervention</title><p>The educational intervention consists of practice-based workshops designed to elicit and assess the educational needs for the team as a whole. Experienced general practitioners with a background in postgraduate education facilitated the small group workshops with the practice teams. This comprised of an initial needs assessment group discussion, which was guided by a set series of questions. The questions were designed to elicit information about what systems were already in place for the diagnosis of and care for dementia patients, but also to encourage all staff to reflect on what they were already doing, whether they were doing that well, what they still need to be doing, and how to fill the gaps in knowledge and service. The educational needs assessment questions were as follows:</p><p>1. How would you rate your current care for people with dementia and their carers (using a simple scale of good enough/satisfactory/needs substantial improvement)?</p><p>2. What grounds or criteria is your rating based on?</p><p>3. How do you arrive at your decision for diagnosis of dementia?</p><p>4. After diagnosis, what follow-up do you provide to people with dementia and their carers?</p><p>5. Are you using a shared care protocol for cholinesterase inhibitors? If 'yes&#x02019;, then: (i) who was involved in producing the protocol; (ii) who is involved in its implementation (for example, hospital consultants, community psychiatric nurses (CPNs), Care of Older People team)?</p><p>6. How effective do you think cholinesterase inhibitors are and how effective have you found them in your practice?</p><p>7. What non-pharmacological alternatives do you have available to help your patients (and their carers)?</p><p>8. Based on your experience, what do you think are the important quality markers in caring for people with dementia? (What would you want for yourself?)</p><p>9. What would you like to improve in the care of patients with dementia, in your practice?</p><p>From this discussion, an educational prescription tailored to those needs was generated and supported with workshops and electronic information resources. The 'usual/normal&#x02019; care control practices were provided with a summary of the UK NICE/ Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) dementia clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and were offered workshop training and electronic information resources at the end of the study. Practices were asked at the end of the study about any competing educational events.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><sec><title>Primary care practices</title><p>Group practices in the North Thames DeNDRoN area were identified in collaboration with the local Primary Care Research Networks. Practices were contacted by the Trial research team, by letter and by awareness-raising through primary care educational meetings and by regular newsletters. Inclusion criteria for the practices were willingness to participate as a group in an educational experiment, and routine use of electronic medical records to capture the content of clinical encounters.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>All practices were asked to identify patients with dementia by using electronic searches of their clinical record system updated by manual checks of the resulting list by medical and nursing staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The size of the sample was based upon the following assumptions: (1) we expected a difference between the intervention and control groups in the proportion of patients with two or more dementia reviews in the 12 months after the educational intervention (or randomization to normal/usual care) of 50% (that is, control 20% versus 70% intervention); and (2) 20 practices would be included with an effective sample size of 10 patients per practice. Thus, a total effective sample size of 200 was reached.</p><p>This sample size was calculated based on randomization at the cluster (practice) level and allowed the study to maintain 90% power to detect the difference postulated in the presence of an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.37 and less.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measurements</title><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Our hypothesis was that the proportion of patients receiving two dementia reviews per year (as recommended by guidelines as being clinically necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) would differ by 50%, (that is, 20% (usual care) versus 70% (intervention)) after the educational intervention. Electronic medical records were audited retrospectively for a period 12 months prior to intervention and again for the 12 months after intervention.</p><p>The primary outcome data was assessed by independent clinical research staff via an audit of the Dementia Indicators of the Quality Outcome Framework (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Additional information collected was of the age, gender, date of diagnosis (pre or post trial randomization and/or intervention dates), diagnosis, and whether the person lived in their own home. (Individual patient consent was sought for a more detailed examination of the secondary outcome measures, reported elsewhere; see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Clinicians independent of the practices classified management reviews for dementia in one of two ways; as planned, coded Dementia Annual Reviews eligible for inclusion in the Quality Outcomes Framework, and as opportunistic Dementia Reviews, which were documented reviews of any aspect of dementia during clinical encounters prompted by other problems. These clinical reviewers were trained in data extraction using a standardized data extraction form developed for the trial, and uncertainties about classification were discussed with the principal investigator.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Participating practices were randomized to intervention or usual care arms by an independent researcher using a computer randomization program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

The practices came from 12 different primary care organizations in urban, semirural and rural areas. Practice enrolment occurred in 2008 to 2010.</p><p>As a result of the field-testing the variety of learning materials used were broadened to include more reference material given during sessions and available online for instant access. The pacing of delivery for topics was also amended and the expert tutors became more knowledgeable and aware of areas of need that were consistent across individuals and groups.</p><p>The intervention practice teams were offered flexible delivery of the needs assessment of workshop training and advised that 1-h sessions be the optimal length of each session. Practices had a mean of three educational workshops, including the needs assessment workshop at the beginning of the trial (range 2 to 4). These were staggered across the practices and took place from 2009 to 2011. The educational needs assessment generated individual workshop content for each practice. The workshops were delivered by one or two general practitioner dementia experts each working to a tutor&#x02019;s manual that included learning objectives and timings. For three of the workshops a single trainer with non-participant observer facilitated the workshops (SI (3); FL (3)) and in four practices both facilitators were present (SI and FL). A non-participant observer (JW) took notes at all meetings to ensure that all educational needs were met and to check for consistency in delivery of the intervention.</p><p>Each practice defined their own team, which comprised the core clinical staff but with an extension of the intervention to administrative and support staff, community nursing teams and other professionals linked with the practice. We found this approach to work well with consistent attendance throughout the sessions from the teams. In several practices, the support staff attended the sessions and one practice invited community nursing staff and one representatives from the local paramedic team.</p><sec><title>Practice information</title><p>A total of 11 practices were randomized to the intervention arm and 12 to the usual care arm.

The IMD is based on seven domains: income, employment, health and disability, education and skills, barriers to housing and services, living environment, and crime. The scores used in the indices are relative to each other and (in most cases) do not indicate an absolute value as such. For example, an IMD score of 40 does not mean that an area is twice as deprived as an area with a score of 20, but it does mean that the area with the score of 40 is more deprived than the area with a score of 20.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Patient information</title><p>A total of 1,072 (intervention: 512, control: 560) patients had information available in their medical records showing the number of reviews (planned/opportunistic/total) within 12 months (or a proportion of) before intervention or randomization and/or within the 12 months (or a proportion of) after.

The educational intervention was developed following the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s recommendations for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], with strong elements of codesign modified by nominal groups to gain the insights and experiences of a range of practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Codesign is a technique adopted from product development, which has tangible benefits in developing or redesigning health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The educational needs assessment deployed in this trial is an example of a strategy aimed to improve quality of care by overcoming the translation block that obstructs the diffusion of clinical guidelines and knowledge into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In this study, we found no significant improvement in case identification or documentation of dementia management reviews after an educational intervention tailored to practice educational needs, despite the financial incentives to identify and follow-up patients with dementia. There are several possible reasons for this.</p><p>The intervention may have been too weak to change practice. More workshops may have been needed, with reinforcement or mentoring of practitioners over longer periods of time. This level of educational input was not practicable in this trial, and we doubt that it would be feasible in real-world primary care organizations. Physicians have a limited ability to accurately self-assess their competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although the educational needs assessment was designed as a group process to offset this tendency, more external assessment may have been needed to truly tailor the intervention to needs.</p><p>It is possible that the trial was underpowered for the 50% expected change. Other changes may be detectable. Professional knowledge, confidence and attitudes; Dementia management activity concordant with the NICE guidelines and carers&#x02019; satisfaction and unmet need were all measured pre and post intervention and will be reported elsewhere. It is possible that these or other unmeasured outcomes (such as patient satisfaction with care) may have had an impact as a result of the intervention.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>It is possible that using medical record coded QOF management reviews as the primary outcome did not capture changes in dementia management. However, our creation of a category of 'opportunistic dementia review&#x02019; fitted with clinical practice and allowed a generous interpretation of clinical activity. Additionally, many patients with dementia joined or left during the pre/post periods, truncating the data collection time, so that length of follow-up may have been too short to capture a difference.</p><p>The study took place in the South East of England, with practices that were probably innovative early adopters, not typical general practices, and local educational programs developed to implement the National Dementia Strategy may have influenced practice activities, although we found no evidence of this. The volunteer practices were probably different from others, in that they wanted to take part in a pilot educational program about dementia. However, the results of this study have wider implications, particularly about the value of tailoring educational interventions. Distribution of newsletters and guidelines to normal care arm practices may have had an effect on their behavior.</p><p>The intervention was developed in ways consistent with current understanding of how effective interventions are made. Nevertheless, there may have been deficiencies in the development process. For example, the views of people with dementia and their family carers may not have had sufficient weight. Some professional perspectives may have been too powerful, resulting in an oversimplification of the educational needs assessment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study suggests that a tailored educational intervention aimed at general practitioners does not improve documentation of clinical management for people with dementia, or dementia case identification, even when policy pressure and consumer demand encourage changes in clinical practice and the reimbursement system rewards it. Educational interventions in settings where a coordinated system of dementia case management operated have shown positive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], so the effective change may need to include the additional resource of case management as well as focused education.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SI, JW and MG conceived the study and obtained funding for it.
