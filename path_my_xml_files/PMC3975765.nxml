<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which most likely result from the interaction of medication, genes and lifestyle factors, such as physical inactivity and high fat diet.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, the mechanisms underlying antipsychotic metabolic adverse effects are incompletely understood.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapy was introduced to the market for treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2006.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> GLP-1 is an incretin hormone, which is secreted from endocrine L-cells of the small intestine in response to nutrients in the gut lumen.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> GLP-1 plays a central role in the regulation of glycaemic control. It conveys an insulinotropic effect via GLP-1 receptors on the &#x003b2; cells of the pancreas and inhibits the secretion of glucagon from the &#x003b1; cells of the pancreas, which together lower the blood glucose level.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Both of these effects are strictly glucose dependent. The effects are more pronounced at higher levels of blood glucose and the effect ceases as blood glucose reaches values below 4&#x02013;5&#x02005;mmol/L.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Therefore, stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor keeps the blood glucose at normal levels without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Naturally occurring GLP-1 is rapidly degenerated within minutes by dipeptidyl peptidase 4. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1R), has a 97% homology with naturally occurring GLP-1 hormone, but has a significantly longer half-life (12&#x02013;14&#x02005;h), which makes it useful for diabetic treatment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Antipsychotic medications are often associated with body weight increase and metabolic disturbances.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> Psychiatric patients on antipsychotic treatment, especially those who are overweight or obese, and/or have metabolic disturbances, are often encouraged to increase physical activity. Studies including patients with type 2 diabetes have shown that different types of exercise interventions with supervised training have positive effects on glycaemic control.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Exercise improves the aerobic capacity and muscular strength, which is often related to fat loss, increased muscle mass, increased cardiovascular fitness and improved glycaemic control. Exercise-induced fat loss and increase in muscle mass may improve glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in those patients, even in the absence of an absolute weight loss.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, in clinical practice, exercise interventions in patients with antipsychotic treatment have often proven to be difficult and may be without pronounced or sustained effect.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> Another possibility includes instructions about healthier food intake. This has proven efficacious in some patients, but not in others, and there exists a large group of patients, where healthy lifestyle interventions have not proven to be very efficacious.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> In patients treated with a weight-increasing antipsychotic, another possibility would be to shift treatment to a compound with less weight-increasing potential.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However two of the most potent weight-inducing antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, are also two of the most efficacious antipsychotic compounds, and especially clozapine is often used to treat patients resistant to other antipsychotics.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Consequently, switching antipsychotic treatment is often not possible in these cases.</p><p>In a recent meta-analysis of 32 studies on antiobesity adjunction drug treatment, 13 different drug treatments were investigated for a total of 1482 patients with antipsychotic-related weight gain: metformin, nizatidine, topiramate, amantadine, fluoxetine, reboxetine, sibutramine, rosiglitazone, dextroamphetamine, d-fenfluramine, famotidine, orlistat and metformin+sibutramine. Only five of these agents were found to be superior to placebo, that is, metformin, topiramate, fenfluramine, sibutramine and reboxetine.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Three of these compounds, fenfluramine, sibutramine and reboxetine, have since been removed from the market due to adverse effects leaving only two evidence-based augmentation agents for clinical use, that is, metformin and topiramate. Both compounds cause approximately 2.5&#x02013;3&#x02005;kg weight loss compared to placebo.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Nevertheless, remarkably little is known about metabolic advantages of these two add-on agents, and most studies were small.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Taken together, there exists a large and important group of patients with antipsychotic treatment, who are in urgent need for medical interventions to improve their metabolic status, so that risk factors for life-shortening cardiovascular morbidity can be reduced. In this context, studies have shown that non-psychiatric patients with type 2 diabetes treated with GLP-1R agonists improve body weight and glycaemic control.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It is of note, the idea to use metformin in patients with non-diabetes treated with antipsychotic was also triggered by data showing that metformin was capable of mitigating the weight-inducing effects of other antidiabetic medications in patients with diabetes.</p><p>In addition, patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders not infrequently have comorbid alcohol addiction.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The well-established effect of GLP-1 analogues on food reward seems to be driven by two key mesolimbic brain structures, which are involved in the rewarding properties of food as well as drugs of abuse, including alcohol.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> To this effect, very recent preclinical data demonstrated the inhibitory effects of the GLP-1R exendin-4 on alcohol-mediated behaviour in rodents.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Moreover, the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide was reported to reduce alcohol intake in patients with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>On the basis of the identified medical need and the promising data of GLP-1R in patients with type 2 diabetes, we aim to investigate whether these beneficial findings on glycaemic control, and secondarily on alcohol intake can be extended to psychiatric patients treated with antipsychotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview</title><p>The present study is a 16-week, double-blinded, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial, designed to evaluate the effects of liraglutide or placebo in 100 patients, who are prediabetic, overweight (body mass index (BMI), &#x02265;27&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and on stabile treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine.

The estimated screening failure rate is 15&#x02013;20% and consequently we expect 125 patients to be randomised and included in the study. The expected number of dropouts is difficult to estimate, since to our knowledge similar interventions with daily subcutaneous injections have not been performed before among psychiatric patients.

Consequently, we expect a dropout rate of maximum 20% in our study population over the 16-&#x02005;week trial period, that is, a maximum of 25 of 125 patients will dropout during 16&#x02005;weeks of treatment resulting in about 100 patients completing the trial (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004227F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004227F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study flowchart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004227f01"/></fig><p>Completion or trial termination for any reason will be fully documented in the <italic>Case Record Form</italic>.

However, this would likely have resulted in a higher sample size as dropout rates increase with the duration of the trial. In addition, recruitment could have been affected too, as patients may be less likely to commit for a longer term study. We also considered following patients after stopping the treatment at 16&#x02005;weeks, in order to assess the durability and speed of the loss of efficacy. However, this would have increased the budget and would be premature, as we believe that this information is only valuable once a significant benefit of liraglutide has been established. We further considered adding a third arm and comparing liraglutide to one of the two established add-on treatments for antipsychotic-induced weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, that is, metformin or topiramate. However, adding a third arm would have increased the complexity and cost of the trial considerably and we considered this also premature, as efficacy of liraglutide would have to be demonstrated first before considering an active comparator trial.</p><p>A definite weakness of this study is the need for the daily subcutaneous injection of liraglutide. However, this is a proof of concept study. Should robust efficacy be demonstrated, this would provide the necessary stimulus to invest in the development of an orally administered formulation of liraglutide or a related GLP-1 analogue. A further weakness is that we will assess the effect of liraglutide on alcohol consumption without requiring a minimum alcohol-intake in all participants. Although this will reduce the power to show an effect, the change in alcohol consumption is only a secondary outcome and restricting participants to those using alcohol would have reduced eligible patients for this study. Moreover, we also deliberately excluded patients with substance abuse or addition, as marked alcohol use can interfere with the primary outcome, insulin resistance, and as substance abuse has been associated with decreased treatment adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present trial aims to evaluate the effects on glycaemic control following 16&#x02005;weeks of treatment with liraglutide or placebo in 100 patients, who are prediabetic, overweight, diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and on treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine.
