However, in-person CBT is currently difficult to access by large segments of the population. The proposed SIGMA intervention (i.e., the Self-help, Integrated, and Gamified Mobile-phone Application) is a mHealth intervention based on CBT principles. It specifically targets overweight young adults with underlying maladaptive behaviors and cognitions regarding food. The SIGMA app was designed as a serious game and intended to work as a standalone app for weight maintenance or alongside a calorie-restrictive diet for weight loss. It uses a complex and novel scoring system that allows points earned within the game to be supplemented by points earned during outdoor activities with the help of an embedded pedometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The efficacy of the SIGMA mHealth intervention will be investigated within a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The intervention will be set to last 2 months with a 3-month follow-up. Selected participants will be young overweight adults with non-clinical maladaptive eating habits embodied by food cravings, binge eating, and emotional eating. The primary outcomes will be represented by changes in (1) self-reported maladaptive thoughts related to eating and body weight, (2) self-reported maladaptive eating behaviors in the range of urgent food cravings, emotional eating or binge eating, (3) as well as biased attentional processing of food items as indexed by reaction times. Secondary outcomes will be represented by changes in weight, Body Mass Index, general mood, and physical activity as indexed by the number of steps per day.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Through an evidence-based cognitive behavioral approach and a user-friendly game interface, the SIGMA intervention offers a significant contribution to the development of a cost-effective and preventive self-help tool for young overweight adults with maladaptive eating habits.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN70907354?q=A%20mobilebased%20serious%20game%20for%20young%20adults%20with%20disordered%20eating&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=1&#x00026;totalResults=1&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basicsearch">70907354</ext-link>.

Currently, obesity and overweight affect as many as 30% of the worldwide population and this number is expected to grow up to 50% by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The high rates of obesity and their aforementioned health consequences strain the public health system and result in significant economic and societal burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This highlights an urgent need for readily accessible evidence-based interventions aimed at prompting weight loss and weight maintenance.</p><p id="Par6">Currently, CBT is the first-line of treatment for overweight and obesity cases that originate in <italic>maladaptive eating habits</italic> (i.e., eating in the absence of hunger, eating prompted by stress or negative emotionality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Maladaptive eating habits are the main cause behind &#x0201c;yo-yo&#x0201d; dieting and represent a barrier to losing weight and to a healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], as well as an important relapse factor after bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">CBT targets not only (1) maladaptive behavioral habits, but also (2) <italic>maladaptive cognitive styles</italic> (e.g., dysfunctional or unhealthy beliefs). Maladaptive cognitive styles are central in CBT and are theorized to underlie negative emotions and undesirable behaviors, such as emotional eating, as indicated by several trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and reviews (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]).</p><p id="Par8">Maladaptive behaviors and cognitive styles can be best assessed and altered in their ecological environment. A potential avenue towards achieving this is the delivery of interventions through smartphone apps (i.e., mHealth interventions). These interventions are particularly relevant for the young adult population (i.e., 18 to 35 years old) for two main reasons. Firstly, young adults (i.e., 18 to 35 years old) are particularly susceptible to becoming overweight or obese (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). Moreover, weight gain during this life-stage is not only a marker of obesity but also for developing chronic disease risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). Secondly, young adults are the most likely age group to own and constantly interact with smartphones. As many as 100% of young adults in developed countries own smartphones, with constantly increasing rates in developing countries as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, the increased usage of mobile phones among the young adult population and the health consequences associated with early-life weight gain provide the motivation for delivering weight management interventions (i.e., mHealth) on a large scale and in an ecological manner.</p><p id="Par9">Mobile or mHealth interventions for weight management have demonstrated promising results across various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, they face two important limitations, as argued below.</p><p id="Par10">The first limitation is that most studies report up to a 50% dropout rate in the use of existing mHealth and eHealth applications (i.e., electronic/technologically mediated apps), which makes them subject to short-term use only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A potential solution for long-term use would be to increase the interactivity and attraction of current mHealth interventions via gamification. Gamification refers to the employment of game-like components (e.g., challenges, storylines) in non-game contexts such as psychological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although research on the topic remains in its initial stages, current evidence suggests that gamification can have a positive impact on motivation and health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and, most importantly, it promotes long-term treatment adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">A second limitation of existing m/eHealth interventions is that currently there is no available application or scientific trial targeting maladaptive eating habits despite their high prevalence in overweight individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Hence, new portable, evidence-based, integrated, and interactive applications for weight management are needed.</p><p id="Par12">Therefore, the purpose of the SIGMA application (i.e., the Self-help, Integrated, and Gamified Mobile-phone Application) is to primarily address the maladaptive behavioral and cognitive styles that impede weight management in young adults at risk for obesity (BMI 25&#x02013;29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The SIGMA app is a CBT-based intervention that was designed as a serious game and is intended to work as a standalone app for weight maintenance or alongside a calorie-restrictive diet for weight loss. The aim of this report is to describe the theoretical rationale and intervention design of the SIGMA study.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p id="Par13">The SIGMA intervention was informed by CBT&#x02019;s <italic>cognitive ABC model</italic> (<italic>A</italic>ntecedents &#x02013; <italic>B</italic>eliefs &#x02013; <italic>C</italic>onsequences). The cognitive ABC model states that negative emotions and undesirable eating behaviors (C) are caused and maintained, contrary to common beliefs, not by adversities or antecedents (A), but by (1) maladaptive beliefs and (2) faulty information processing (B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] concerning those adversities, as evidenced below.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par14">Maladaptive beliefs are central in CBT for obesity. Prior research has indicated that obese participants have more unhealthy food and weight-related beliefs including catastrophizing, faulty body-image perception, and poor self-control than healthy-weight participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. According to CBT&#x02019;s ABC model, maladaptive beliefs (B), particularly sabotaging thoughts, cause uncontrolled and unplanned eating (C). Osberg, Poland, Aguayo, and MacDougall ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], p.26) define sabotaging thoughts as &#x0201c;cognitively distorted and unhealthy attitudes and beliefs regarding food&#x0201d; (e.g., I can&#x02019;t possibly live without chocolate).</p><p id="Par15">An example of the cognitive ABC model is the following: (A) a feeling of sadness in the context of losing a job triggers a sabotaging thought (B) &#x02013; &#x0201c;I hate this feeling. If I eat I will feel better&#x0201d; that causes (C) emotional eating followed by guilt (A) and the loop of maladaptive cognitive and behavioral styles is preserved. Hence, CBT&#x02019;s <italic>mechanism of change</italic> is not A, nor C, but B. In other words, the aim of CBT is to replace maladaptive beliefs with more adaptive and healthy alternatives (e.g., &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t like this feeling, but eating won&#x02019;t solve my problem&#x0201d;) that help adherence to a calorie-restricted diet and prevent gaining any additional weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">Another central factor in the CBT conceptualization of obesity refers to faulty information processing, a selective processing of food stimuli in the environment. One highly investigated faulty information process is attention bias to food cues, otherwise known as the tendency to attend to food stimuli. A growing body of research has indicated that biased attention toward food predicts the strength of cravings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], stress eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the amount eaten, and even the amount of weight gained in obesity cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par17">Attention bias is theorized to precede maladaptive beliefs, making environmental stimuli more difficult to resist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Targeting attention biases is a complementary path that maximizes resistance to tempting situations which become less likely to trigger sabotaging thoughts. This process operates at an implicit level, but there is evidence that it can be modified by specific interventions (i.e., ABM &#x02013; attention bias modification; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]) that can be successfully integrated into CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Overall, the ABC model provides an evidence-based theoretical guiding structure for the SIGMA intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par19">The SIGMA trial will be a randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to last for a total of 22 weeks including a 2-week baseline point.

The primary objective of this trial is to contrast the SIGMA intervention against a sham intervention that will include all the modules developed for the SIGMA intervention with the exception of the gamified intervention module.

For the purposes of the SIGMA trial, all participants (both intervention and control groups) will be asked to actively follow a calorie-restrictive diet of their own choice. General information about dieting and daily exercising is embedded in the psycho-education module of the SIGMA app and should assist in choosing a healthy and balanced calorie-restrictive diet. This information will also be accessible online via the study&#x02019;s dedicated website if more detailed content is needed.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the Self-help, Integrated, and Gamified Mobile-phone Application (SIGMA) trial configuration</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2340_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The gamified interface is an important element of this module, providing (1) a storyline, (2) animated characters that go through difficult and tempting situations, (3) learning opportunities to cope with temptations, and (4) a reward point system that opens new theory-based game levels, as detailed below. The SIGMAe game is inspired by the Beck CBT protocol for weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of the Self-help, Integrated, and Gamified Mobile-phone Application -&#x000a0;explicit cognitive-behavioral intervention (SIGMAe) interface</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2340_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par25">The storyline is standard; the users learn that they are superheroes in training who should help save the world and the characters from eating temptations. In the game, the characters find themselves in a situation where they should resist temptations, such as eating some highly palatable food, eating when feeling distressed or eating in a social context. To facilitate real-life application, the game-settings are diverse, varying from home-inspired scenarios to holiday and social gathering scenarios. The user&#x02019;s task is to assist the characters in making a decision in the context of a problematic situation. This will be achieved by choosing the best coping card out of four possible alternatives, varying from the worst coping option to the best coping option (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These alternatives are organized by levels and can target either behavioral choices, cognitive self-statements or a combination of both (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Once the user has chosen a coping card, SIGMA will provide <italic>healthy habit points</italic>, which increase the user&#x02019;s total score and <italic>mastery</italic> level and allow them to further advance in the game.

If no choice is made within 2500 ms, the task moves on to the next trial. The second level of gameplay will present the user with two up to six food items for a short amount of time varying from 700 ms to 1200 ms and depending on the number of images per trial.

With each healthy food choice, the user earns one healthy habit point. Hence, due to the design and reward points system, the SIGMAi intervention not only helps the user learn the distinction between healthy and unhealthy food items, but it also makes unhealthy food choices less salient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

This is achieved by way of a visual breathing aid. The user can choose between a predefined and a customized breathing rhythm. As a visual aid, an onscreen balloon will expand or contract following the chosen calming breathing pace.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Distraction</title><p id="Par35">Because it mimics a standard game (e.g., fast responses to challenges, shifting stimuli) and because it relies on fast and effortlessly responses, the SIGMAi module can also be used for distraction purposes via the crisis module.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>The self-monitoring, feedback, and evolution module</title><p id="Par36">Only the design and key features of the module will be discussed here, details on the instruments used for self-monitoring are described in the &#x0201c;Outcomes&#x0201d; section of the paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Self-monitoring</title><p id="Par37">The self-monitoring module serves two relevant functions, detailed below.</p><p id="Par38">The first function is to assist users in self-monitoring their own eating and physical activity patterns, a proven predictor of weight-loss and weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. SIGMA includes self-monitoring components aimed at monitoring dietary intake and physical activity, enabling users to plan a meal/menu and physical exercise in advance and offering personalized tips (i.e., psycho-educational content) and feedback regarding eating and physical activity styles.</p><p id="Par39">Aside from planning, the monitoring of physical activity is aided by an embedded <italic>pedometer</italic>. The decision to incorporate a pedometer was informed by the fact that it has been reliably associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in BMI ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). The pedometer will monitor and compare the user&#x02019;s daily performance with a daily suggested target and will provide feedback and healthy habit points accordingly. As such, a norm of between 5000 and 7499 steps/day is considered low active, 7500 to 9999 steps/day is somewhat active, and 10,000 or more steps/day is considered an active lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]).</p><p id="Par40">The second function, drawing on the cognitive-behavioral principles, is to monitor how well the participants apply the CBT principles of the SIGMA game to real-life situations. Hence, a special feature of the monitoring module is the <italic>ABC diary</italic> that focuses on understanding the <italic>A</italic>ntecedents and <italic>C</italic>onsequences of maladaptive <italic>B</italic>eliefs regarding food, weight or the ability to maintain the diet. This should aid the users in noticing and challenging their maladaptive patterns without relying on a therapist for weight management.</p><p id="Par41">Regarding the consequences of eating behaviors, users will be enabled to monitor their levels of reported satiety after a meal, as well as their emotional reactions after eating, such as guilt or satisfaction. Lower levels of satiety and negative emotional reactions after eating may predict a relapse and it is important for the app to offer alternative ways of thinking in tempting or adverse situations. This should help alleviate urges to eat outside planned meals or prevent feelings of guilt when it happens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Feedback and evolution</title><p id="Par42">The first 2 weeks of SIGMA usage focus on calibrating the SIGMA intervention through a baseline evaluation of the users&#x02019; behavioral and cognitive patterns (e.g., more emotional eating content for individuals with emotional eating issues). Following the initial baseline evaluation, the SIGMA app will produce a report identifying the users&#x02019; vulnerabilities that will also serve as a starting point for customizing the intervention. For instance, if the evaluation reveals that a user is more likely to succumb to dietary temptations in the evening, the app will send more tips and motivational messages at that specific time. Moreover, the feedback report is designed to be intuitive; for instance, the user&#x02019;s points and the number of steps on the pedometer are delivered through a meaningful interpretation of the progress (e.g., &#x0201c;This week, you have accumulated X out of Y possible points and the total number of steps taken is equivalent to the distance from A to B&#x0201d;).</p><p id="Par43">Feedback plays an important role in the serious game module, as each progress or failure is followed by feedback along with a detailed statement explaining why the specific choice made during SIGMAe or SIGMAi was erroneous. SIGMA will also provide feedback, in the form of charts, regarding the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional indexes of progress as compared to the user&#x02019;s baseline level. Feedback on user&#x02019;s progress (i.e., number of accumulated points, mastery level) will be based on objective assessments. These assessments are represented by both the healthy choices made during the SIGMAi trials, as well as the healthy cognitive and behavioral coping choices made during the SIGMAe trials.</p><p id="Par44">Moreover, the SIGMA app uses a complex and novel scoring system that allows SIGMAe and SIGMAi points to be supplemented by points earned during outdoor activities with the help of a pedometer. As such, additional points are earned depending on the level of activity (i.e., daily step count) the user is willing to make. We do not want to encourage a fixation on other outcomes such as calorie counting or daily weighing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, we have embedded a calorie counter in the SIGMA app. Overall, all the earned points help the user reach a higher mastery level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>The SIGMA randomized controlled trial (RCT)</title><p id="Par45">The SIGMA trial is set to be a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that is nationally funded through a research grant. Throughout this trial, the SIGMA intervention will be contrasted against a specific form of placebo, also known as an <italic>attention placebo control condition</italic>. An attention placebo control refers to a condition that mimics an intervention but does not address the proposed mechanisms of change. Participants allocated to the attention placebo control condition will have full access to a modified version of the SIGMA app, which includes all the SIGMA modules except for the gamified intervention module. This control condition is highly suitable to investigate the active ingredients of an intervention, as in our case. Furthermore, this type of control arm is considered a highly valid control condition for RCT&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

Our working hypothesis is that the SIGMA intervention will be significantly more effective in promoting change in maladaptive behaviors and cognitive styles, decreasing the maladaptive counterparts and increasing adaptive food-related behavioral and cognitive styles of response. Significant differences favoring the SIGMA intervention are to be expected in an evidence-based intervention, as more extensive use of theory in eHealth interventions is associated with an increase in effect size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Within the SIGMA application, there are three possible sources of earning points: (1) the explicit cognitive-behavioral intervention (SIGMAe), (b) the implicit attention-training intervention (SIGMAi), and (c) the pedometer. In SIGMAi and SIGMAe awarded points vary from 0 to 8 healthy habit points. Regarding the pedometer, the points received by the user each day will be proportional to the number of steps taken (i.e., 5 points for 5000 steps, 8 points for 8000 steps, etc.). Furthermore, a calorie counter is also available to keep track of daily calorie consumption. However, the application does not encourage a fixation on calorie counting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Hence, no points are earned for its usage.

The SIGMA mHealth intervention combines a portable, serious game interface with evidence-based theoretical models and up-to-date cognitive and behavioral principles for weight management. Furthermore, it targets overweight young adults with maladaptive eating habits that are at risk for obesity. Hence, the SIGMA intervention also incorporates attributes that are specific for preventive interventions and is, to our knowledge, the first evidence-based serious game for weight management. In addition, there are no RCTs that examined the efficacy of mHealth interventions in overweight and/or obese young adults, and even more so on individuals with maladaptive eating patterns.</p><p id="Par79">Despite its advantages, the SIGMA intervention is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the data concerning maladaptive eating patterns, as well as weight and BMI, will be collected by means of self-report. Therefore, being susceptible to distortions resulting from social desirability effects. However, many of these outcomes require subjective judgments, thus self-reports are inevitable. When possible, we try to supplement our subjective measures with more objective ones, such as reaction times or daily step counts. Secondly, the decision to allow participants to follow a diet of their own choice potentially adds a source of variability in the results but only with regard to the secondary outcomes. However, as evidenced in a recent comprehensive meta-analysis, the ability to freely choose one&#x02019;s diet promotes adherence to the weight-loss program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].
