Approval was granted by the University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee (AEC ID 1112263.2). The foxhounds ranged from 2 to 6 years of age and weighed between 28 and 37 kg. All dogs were up&#x02010;to&#x02010;date with vaccinations, worming prophylaxis, and had shown no clinical signs of respiratory disease (eg, coughing) for more than 4 weeks before the start of the study. All 10 dogs underwent complete physical examinations and 2&#x02010;view thoracic radiography to exclude the possibility of underlying respiratory disease as far as possible. Each dog underwent 2 individual, short training sessions in which they were acclimated to the face mask and spacer apparatus to the point where they did not resist mask placement; during this time, they also were exposed to the noise of an operating nebulizer. The dogs were randomly assigned to 2 groups by lottery without replacement, determining the sequence of treatments. The dogs were given each of the 2 treatments separated by a 7&#x02010;day washout period. For the initial study, dogs were given acepromazine 0.05 mg/kg IV and were mildly sedated but conscious during aerosol inhalation from both devices. Subsequently, a second study was performed in which 6 of the dogs were selected randomly and received aerosol administration without sedation. These 6 dogs received an additional 5 training sessions to acclimatize them to the nebulizer and MDI.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14832-sec-0010"><title>Radiolabeling and Inhalation Procedures for Nebulization</title><p>Commercially available liquid nebules containing fluticasone propionate<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14832-note-1003">1</xref> and a jet nebulizer<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14832-note-1004">2</xref> were sourced for this part of the study. The radiopharmaceutical used was <sup>99m</sup>technetium&#x02010;diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (<sup>99m</sup>Tc&#x02010;DTPA) which was manually mixed with aqueous fluticasone propionate from the nebules and the mixture nebulized as described previously.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Each nebulizer bowl was filled with a 1.5&#x02010;mL mixture containing 100 MBq of <sup>99m</sup>Tc&#x02010;DTPA and 200 &#x003bc;g of fluticasone propionate. The radioactive dose in the nebulizer bowl was measured in a dose calibrator<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14832-note-1005">3</xref> before and after aerosol administration. The nebulizer bowl was connected to a baffle, a right&#x02010;angled connector and a face mask; the face mask was placed snugly onto the dog's muzzle. All face masks were detergent&#x02010;coated to decrease electrostatic charge before use. Each dog inhaled from the operating nebulizer for a 1&#x02010;minute period during which the dog was allowed to breathe tidally.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14832-sec-0011"><title>Radiolabeling and Inhalation Procedures for the MDI</title><p>Commercially available MDIs containing fluticasone propionate were sourced; the radiopharmaceutical used was sodium pertechnetate (Na<sup>99m</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub>). The techniques employed for radiolabeling have been reported previously.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Briefly, sodium pertechnetate was sonicated with chloroform, and the mixture passed through a phase separation filter into an empty canister. The chloroform subsequently was evaporated from the canister under a stream of nitrogen gas, leaving a <sup>99m</sup>Tc&#x02010;lined canister. Both the radioactive canister and the commercial canister of fluticasone propionate were supercooled with dry ice. The commercial canister containing fluticasone propionate was decrimped, and the contents poured into the <sup>99m</sup>Tc&#x02010;lined canister. The radioactive canister containing fluticasone then was recrimped. After undergoing validation procedures, this canister was connected to a spacer<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14832-note-1006">4</xref> and a face mask for aerosol administration. Each dog was given 2 actuations from the MDI; after each actuation into the spacer, the dog was allowed 5 tidal breaths. Radioactivity in the canister was recorded with a dose calibrator before and after actuation. Before inhalation, all face masks and spacers were detergent&#x02010;coated to decrease electrostatic charge.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14832-sec-0012"><title>Validation of Radiolabeling for MDIs</title><p>Validation procedures were performed to ensure that radiolabeling of the MDI did not change the product characteristics; these techniques have been described previously in in vitro studies and in studies on adult human males.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Briefly, the PSD of the commercial canister and the radioactive canister was measured with a Marple&#x02010;Miller Cascade Impactor;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14832-note-1007">5</xref> the results were compared to ensure no alteration to the PSD by the radiolabeling procedures. The Marple&#x02010;Miller Cascade Impactor is a 5&#x02010;stage apparatus used to assess PSD of aerosols in a moving airstream. It consists of a mouth piece that allows the MDI to be attached, followed by a &#x0201c;throat&#x0201d; stage that mimics the human throat, and 5 stages of impaction starting at 10.0, 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.625 &#x003bc;m followed by a filter as the last stage. Each stage collects particles larger than the indicated size but smaller than the previous stage. Samples collected at each stage can be extracted for chemical analyses. High&#x02010;performance liquid chromatography was used to assess the amount of fluticasone propionate delivered per actuation to ensure no clinically relevant change had occurred to the total mass delivered per actuation after radiolabeling.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14832-sec-0013"><title>Imaging</title><p>After aerosol inhalation, 2D planar scintigraphy with a single&#x02010;headed gamma camera<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14832-note-1008">6</xref> immediately was performed. Two&#x02010;minute acquisitions of the following views were acquired in the following order: ventral chest, ventral abdomen, dorsal chest, dorsal abdomen, lateral head and neck (right), lateral head and neck (left), and equipment. The period of time between administration of aerosol treatment and end of image acquisition of all regions ranged from 15 to 22 minutes for 19 of 20 studies.

All small, focal, and intense pools of radioactivity within the region of the mediastinum were recorded as originating from the esophagus (not the trachea). The investigators made this assumption based on the subjectively intense but focal nature of these pools of radioactivity, mimicking the appearance of the swallowed radioactivity in the stomach. These pools of radioactivity were unlikely to represent inhaled radioactivity (such as that seen within the region of the lungs) because inhaled activity was subjectively more diffusely distributed.</p><p>Deposition in counts per minute (cpm) was recorded for each region, and the geometric means were calculated by averaging counts from the dorsal and ventral or left and right views. Adjustments were made for background activity, length of acquisition, delay of time of acquisition from administration (radioactive decay), and tissue attenuation (ACF). Respiratory tract deposition finally was calculated as a percentage of the delivered dose of radiolabeled aerosol in cpm.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14832-sec-0016"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The following response variables were calculated for each dog as a percentage of the delivered dose: dose recovery, respiratory tract deposition, head and gastrointestinal tract deposition, and equipment deposition. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the above variables were calculated for each treatment group. An analysis of variance with effects of sequence, dog within sequence, period, and treatment was conducted to compare the 2 devices. A normal distribution of the residuals was assessed by the Shapiro&#x02010;Wilk test, and these did not show evidence of non&#x02010;normality because all 4 <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;values were &#x0003e;0.05. The correlation coefficient between delivered dose (cpm) and respiratory tract deposition (cpm) was calculated for each of the 2 devices using the same 10 dogs. These 2 dependent correlations with nonoverlapping variables then were compared by the <italic>cocor</italic> package.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14832-note-1010">8</xref> The assumption of normality of both variables was satisfied by the Shapiro&#x02010;Wilk test.

Similarly, the extrathoracic deposition patterns also were statistically different with the nebulizer achieving significantly higher deposition in the head and gastrointestinal tract of the dogs and the MDI achieving higher deposition in the equipment.</p><p>Respiratory tract deposition from both devices in this group of dogs was generally low, ranging from 0.2 to 6.1% of dose delivered from both devices.

The postulated reason for this improvement is the movement of particles during all phases of the respiratory cycle (leading to increased deposition in larger airways), with possible influences from the airway humidification achieved during nebulization and the slower breathing patterns employed.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> Postulated reasons for the difference in performance of the devices between children and dogs may include the following: differences between performance of the devices between different species; use of varying indices of performance, as our study investigated imaging results rather than clinical indices in respiratory function; and differences in performance of the devices in a population affected by asthma rather than a healthy population such as the dogs used in our study. For our study, the major postulated reason for the superior performance of the nebulizer is the continuous nature of aerosol treatment with nebulization, versus the momentary pulses of treatment delivered by the MDI; non&#x02010;compliance then may result in unsuccessful administration of an entire dose of aerosol from the MDI. This hypothesis is supported by the statistically significant correlation between the delivered dose of aerosol and respiratory tract deposition from the nebulizer, suggesting that nebulization is a reliable way to deliver aerosol to dogs. Additionally, there is more equipment between the MDI and the animal in comparison with the nebulizer and the animal; this results in a greater opportunity for leakage of aerosol between the components if the seals between them are not complete.</p><p>Qualitative assessment of the respiratory tract deposition images showed that radiolabeled fluticasone propionate reached the periphery of the lung fields, suggesting deposition both in the central and peripheral airways. This observation does not, however, prove deposition in smaller airways because research in the human medical field shows that even quantitative calculation of peripheral versus central lung deposition based on 2D images is a crude indicator of small airway deposition, predominantly because of overlapping of alveolar and airway structures, and overlapping of airways in the hilar region of lungs in people.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> More accurate calculations and ratios can be made by 3D imaging such as single&#x02010;photon emission computerized tomography or positron emission tomography.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> These methods were not available in our study.</p><p>Our study showed nebulization resulted in higher deposition in the head and gastrointestinal tract of dogs (including the muzzle, oropharynx, esophagus, and stomach) and the MDI resulted in higher deposition in the equipment (including the actuator, spacer, and face mask). These results are not surprising because 1 purpose of the spacer is to allow larger particles (which typically deposit in the oropharynx) to impact on the inner walls of the device, leaving a fine aerosol available for inhalation.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> Because a spacer is not used in nebulization, the larger particles are likely to have been delivered to the dogs&#x02019; muzzle or oropharynx and subsequently swallowed. Although serum concentrations of fluticasone propionate were not measured in the dogs in our study, nebulization potentially could result in higher systemic absorption and unwanted adverse effects because of a higher level of deposition on the head and in the gastrointestinal tract. Fluticasone propionate delivered via a MDI and spacer resulted in mild suppression of the hypothalamic&#x02010;pituitary&#x02010;adrenal axis (HPAA) in dogs.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Depending on the metabolism of the corticosteroid aerosolized, nebulization of a steroid could result in more suppression of the HPAA and clinical signs of polydipsia, polyuria, or polyphagia in dogs. For the purposes of our study, all of the spacers and face masks used were washed with detergent and left to dry without rinsing to decrease electrostatic charge. Electrostatic charge has been shown to result in significant reduction in aerosol delivery through a spacer in an in vitro setting, stressing the importance of equipment preparation before use.<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>
</p><p>No statistically detectable differences were shown between the sedated and unsedated groups of dogs, with mean respiratory tract deposition of both groups being approximately 3.5&#x02013;4.0%. The reason for the use of sedation in the initial study was the unforeseen reaction of the dogs to the odor of the aerosol plumes, to which they were not acclimated, having been exposed only to the face mask apparatus and the noise of an operating nebulizer. Subsequently 6 of the dogs were retrained using the same medications as employed in the study. Subjectively, we observed better compliance in the group of unsedated dogs after retraining, but this difference was not expressed in any differences in respiratory tract deposition between the 2 groups. This observation may be explained by the use of sedation in the first group, resulting in similar levels of compliance between the sedated and unsedated dogs, or, less likely, that compliance does not equate with better respiratory tract deposition in dogs. In 1 particular dog in our study, we observed high levels of resistance to mask placement and frequent movement during treatment. This dog had the lowest respiratory tract deposition of all dogs in the study, with a respiratory tract deposition of 0.2% of dose delivered. In pediatric patients, a leak in the face mask has been shown to greatly decrease drug delivery to the patient<xref rid="jvim14832-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>; it is presumed that a tightly fitting mask is equally important in aerosol delivery to veterinary patients. Poor compliance and patient movement are likely to substantially affect the airtight seal achieved in a well&#x02010;fitted mask, resulting in loss of aerosol to the environment and decreased respiratory tract deposition. Measurement of exhaled and leaked aerosol in future studies will facilitate understanding where and why the majority of loss is occurring during aerosol administration to veterinary patients.</p><p>Despite the finding that nebulization achieved a higher mean respiratory tract deposition percentage in this group of healthy dogs, a number of other factors will influence the choice of device for each patient. Additionally, 3 of the 10 dogs in our study achieved higher respiratory tract deposition percentage with the MDI than with the nebulizer, and it should be reiterated that individuals can respond better with 1 particular device than the other. The factors to take into account include the following: potential for higher systemic absorption during nebulization; ability to mix medications for aerosol administration in nebulization that cannot be performed using a MDI; compliance or resistance to a particular device; costs of equipment or medications; time required for aerosol administration, which is longer for nebulization; and reliability of nebulization for delivery of aerosol, particularly for noncompliant patients. Based on our results, potential ways to manage poor clinical response to aerosol treatment in practice may include the following: increasing doses of medications delivered, improving seal of face masks, detergent coating of spacers and face masks, or switching devices for administration of aerosol if an animal is noncompliant for a particular device.</p><p>Limitations of our study include the small sample size, use of healthy dogs, and the use of 1 particular breed, resulting in a relatively homogenous population. The crossover nature of the study did eliminate animal factors as a source of variation between the 2 groups, but the findings cannot be extrapolated to other breeds or dogs with respiratory disease. Another major limitation was the lack of access to pneumotachometry at the time of the study. As a result, no comparisons of aerosol deposition in the respiratory tract to the number or volume of each dog's breaths could be performed. Lastly, the assumption that mediastinal radioactivity originated from the esophagus rather than the airways may have introduced error into the calculation of respiratory tract deposition. If the deposition was within the trachea or principal bronchi, then respiratory tract deposition is likely to be higher for both devices and gastrointestinal deposition likely to be lower for both devices. Areas for additional research include the following: assessing respiratory tract deposition in animals with respiratory disease; measuring breathing patterns and tidal volumes of healthy dogs and dogs with respiratory disease and correlating these with respiratory tract deposition; correlating respiratory tract deposition with clinical response to treatment in animals with respiratory disease; assessing the relationship between dosage of aerosolized medication with clinical response; analyzing the relationship between PSD and respiratory tract deposition in animals; investigating the relationship between the seal of face masks and decrease in respiratory tract deposition in animals; using 3D gamma scintigraphy to investigate peripheral versus central respiratory tract deposition in animals; and measuring exhaled or leaked aerosol during administration in animals to improve understanding of the generally low level of respiratory tract deposition achieved.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14832-sec-0025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study confirms respiratory tract deposition of aerosolized radiolabeled fluticasone propionate delivered from a nebulizer and MDI in healthy, tidally breathing dogs with and without sedation.
