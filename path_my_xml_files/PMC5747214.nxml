IUI method in combination with ovulation stimulation is commonly considered as the first-line treatment for many infertile couples. IUI treatment is mainly used to treat male infertility, unjustifiable infertility, and spontaneous immunity against sperm, sexual dysfunction, and cervical cancer.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>IUI treatment is more cost-effective and less invasive compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) treatment, and it is one of the most commonly used therapies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] According to the statistics of Milad Infertility Center of Mashhad in 2010, IUI treatment (88,831) was used more than other aids from the total number of referrals to the center (13,103,422) who received fertilized treatment.</p><p>Performing fertility aid treatments leads to a lot of psychological stresses in patients in addition to the need to spend time and money.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In the study by Behdani <italic>et al</italic>. (2005), the most common psychiatric disorder in infertile women undergoing fertility aid treatments was distributed anxiety disorder (44.4%), other anxiety disorders were reported to be in 11.8%, and depression was reported to be in 30.4% of patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the study by Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 35% of patients undergoing IUI treatment had sleep disorder,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and in the study by Kokanal&#x00131; <italic>et al</italic>., most women undergoing IUI treatment had moderate anxiety.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In the study by Moosavifar <italic>et al</italic>., there was a relationship between the mean of anxiety and success in treatment and success in treatment decreased with increasing state and trait anxiety, but there was no relationship between different levels of depression and success in treatment.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] There was a relationship between the level of anxiety and depression and the success of IVF treatment in the study by Peivandi <italic>et al</italic>., and relative risk and associated risk for lack of occurrence of pregnancy in individuals with high severity of anxiety and depression were, respectively, 1.5% and 33%.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In the study by Kokanal&#x00131; <italic>et al</italic>., the state anxiety level during treatment with IUI was significantly associated with the success of the treatment in addition to factors such as age, ovarian status, and folic acid numbers. The level of state anxiety was significantly lower in patients who had successful treatment compared to patients with failed treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), but there was no significant relation between the success of the treatment and the trait anxiety (<italic>P</italic> = 0.125).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>A limited number of studies have been reported about anxiety and depression of women treated with IUI so far. In the study by Heidary <italic>et al</italic>. on 110 infertile women treated with cognitive behavioral therapy IUI treatment, the mean state anxiety (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and trait anxiety (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) decreased significantly in the intervention group.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The problem-solving is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] All cognitive-behavioral therapies are considered as a problem-solving method and individuals use those to learn the method of thinking about problems. The problem-solving is the cognitive-behavioral process which is guided by the individual him/herself and that individual tries to use it and find effective or adaptive solutions to his/her daily life problems.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>This training is expanding on a daily basis due to its prominent characteristics such as having structure, being in short-term, having simple and understandable principles for patients, possibility of its implementation by trained health personnel.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The problem-solving is an important coping strategy which enables an individual to thwart the problematic situations of everyday life and their emotional impact.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the study of Zwick (2003), a positive attitude toward the problem and logical problem-solving was related to a reduction in the symptoms of depression in infertile women.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Many psychiatric distresses in infertile women are the result of maladaptive and ineffective coping strategies and poor adaptation lead to symptoms of anxiety and depression in infertile women. Problem-solving is one of the most important coping strategies in dealing with infertility, treatments, and many of its psychological effects.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>No similar studies have been reported on the effect of problem-solving skills (PSS) on anxiety and depression in infertile women so far. Lotfinia <italic>et al</italic>. concluded in their study on male and female students of Tabriz University that training of PSS is effective in decreasing depression severity of students and the mean of depression in the PSS group was significantly lower than the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Given that limited studies have been conducted on anxiety and depression in women under IUI treatment up until now and with respect to characteristics of PSS, having simple and understandable principles for patients and the possibility of their implementation by the health staff, researcher decided to make an intervention aimed at determining the effect of PSS on the anxiety of infertile women undergoing IUI treatment who referred to Milad Infertility Center in Mashhad in 2015&#x02013;2016.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized clinical trial with two groups was conducted on 72 women with primary infertility, aged between 18 and 40 years who referred to Milad Infertility Center of Mashhad since December 2015 to June 2016 and have criteria for entering the study. The researcher acted on taking samples after approval of subject by research committee of the Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (IRCT2016020926490N1).

The intervention was conducted by the researcher after confirmation of the researcher's ability in holding PSS sessions by Clinical Psychologist Ph. D. Advisor. The duration of each session was 45&#x02013;45 min according to the time of referral of the research units to the treatment centers as follows:</p><p>The focus in the PSS group in the first session (2&#x02013;3 days of the first menstrual cycle) was on the issues of orientation and defining problem and session contents were definition and causes of infertility, levels of IUI treatment, role of using PSS to deal with everyday life problems, method of defining the problem, and the factors involved in the occurrence of the problem. Then, each research unit was asked to define her problem and determine factors that contribute to the problem. At the end of the session, the person was asked to make a follow-up list of the issues that the person was involved with and define them accurately and then prioritize them and identify the most important problems during the IUI treatment. The focus in the second session (9&#x02013;12 days of menstrual cycle) was on the process of providing solutions, contents of the session were teaching about method of providing solution using brainstorming method, and each participation was asked to use brainstorming method to create solution for her problem and prepare a list of solutions that comes to her mind until the next session. The focus in the third session (14&#x02013;15 days of menstrual cycle) was on the level of evaluating solutions, decision-making and implementation of solution, and method of evaluating solutions, contents of the session were training on method of evaluating disadvantages and the benefits of implementing solutions, choosing the best solution and implementing solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, and the contents taught in the previous sessions were reviewed at the end of the session and the person was asked to practice PSS in dealing with her daily issues and record those in the PSS training checklist. The control group received the usual services from the center and on days 2&#x02013;3, 9&#x02013;12 and 14&#x02013;15 days of menstrual cycles referred, to Milad Infertility Center for the treatment of IUI for ultrasound examination and determination of therapeutic measures. STAI and Beck Depression Inventory were completed by both groups in the day of IUI operation (2&#x02013;3 days after the last training session of problem-solving training).
