Cinnamon (containing cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde) is used as spices and as a pharmacological agent in ancient medicine. Intense exercise can result in oxidative damage to cellular compounds and also muscle soreness. Efficacy of dietary ginger and cinnamon as antioxidant agents and their effectiveness in exercise performance and reducing muscle soreness have been investigated in limited studies on humans. So we studied the effects of dietary ginger and cinnamon on oxidative stress and exercise performance and body composition in Iranian female taekwondo players.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty healthy trained women, aged 13-25 years, were enrolled in the 6 week investigation and randomly categorized in three groups (cinnamon, ginger, or placebo) and received three grams of ginger, cinnamon, or placebo powder each day depending on the group they belonged.

Inclusion criteria were exercising three times a week for at least three years. Participants were excluded if they had taken supplements, had a history of any medical condition, or used medication known to affect body metabolism, had any chronic condition that might limit their ability to be involved in the intervention or the existence of pregnancy or lactation. This study was a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial approved by the Isfahan University Committee and Ethics Advisory Committee, and written consent was obtained from all participants. Blood samples were obtained from all subjects 24 hours after specific resistance exercise for the competitive season. Body fat percentage was calculated from triceps skin-fold thickness measurement on the right side of the body by an educated dietician. The skin-fold with the thumbs and index finger of the left hand about 1 cm proximal to the skin fold site was grasped firmly and pulled away from the body, respectively. The caliper which was perpendicular to the long axis of the skin fold and with a faced-up dial was hold in the right hand. The caliper was read 4 seconds after pressure from the measurer's hand had been released from the lever. The measures were recorded 3 times with 10 seconds intervals. It is worth mentioning that measurements were not made immediately after exercise and athletes were asked to seat and relax for around 3 minutes. For functional test, initially, the subjects performed a brief warm-up that consisted of running around the court at low velocity for 5 minutes. Afterwards, agility tests were carried out. The 360 meter run was used to measure the anaerobic power and one must complete the run without any help. The goal was to run the distance as quickly as possible and must run to and through the finish line. Treatment order was determined by an online randomization program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>).</p><p>In a double-blinded fashion, subjects received 3 grams of oral dietary ginger powder (<italic>n</italic> = 15) or dietary cinnamon powder (<italic>n</italic> = 15) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 15) for 8 weeks. All participants were instructed to take the 3 grams of powder during a day and were asked to follow regular diet and record their diet for one day before the first blood sample was drawn at baseline and during the intervention for 3 times. Diet records were analyzed using the nutritional analysis system. and then the blood samples and skin fold and agility test were measured after intervention, human malondialdehyde (MDA) ELISA Kit was used to assay MDA in the samples of subject' serum.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results are presented as a mean &#x000b1; standard error. One-way multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) controlling for the pre-test differences, followed by Dunnett's <italic>post hoc</italic> comparison was used for multiple comparisons between the groups. Within group comparisons were done using paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test. Due to non-normality of the studied variables (positive skewed distribution) logarithmic transformation was done and homogeneity of covariance matrix has been tested via Box'M statistics. Analyses were performed with the SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) statistical package.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Sixty subjects were enrolled with median (range) of 19 (13-25) years; 49 of them completed the 6 weeks intervention.

Our findings indicate that there were minor but not significant decreases (paired <italic>t</italic>-test) in MDA in cinnamon and ginger group compared with the placebo group, and significant increase in exercise performance in ginger group and in skin fold in cinnamon groups, whereas there were significant accretion in BMI for ginger and cinnamon groups.

Since the beginning of this study coincided with the start of the competitions and the end of the study was consistent with the recovery phase, so BMI and skin fold increased during the study.</p><p>The effects of receiving ginger and cinnamon were investigated in one study together and this was one of the strength points of the present study. A few human studies have evaluated the effects of receiving ginger and cinnamon on lipid peroxidatin. This investigation is one of the limited studies which accessed antioxidant properties of cinnamon and ginger besides body composition and exercise performance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It is possible that ginger did not exhibit lowering effects in the oxidative stress in current study because the dose was insufficient and effects were related to ginger dose for body weight or the duration of the assessment did not allow adequate time for the ginger to act as antioxidant and improve the performance for cinnamon group.
