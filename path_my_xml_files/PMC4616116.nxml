were grouped by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) class (CDR-0.5, CDR-1, or CDR-2, n = 10 per
group), which is based on level of cognitive functioning, and cognitive rehabilitation was
applied for 50 minutes per day, five days per week, for four weeks. [Methods] After
cognitive rehabilitation intervention, CARDS tests were conducted to evaluate memory.
[Results] Bonferroni tests comparing the three groups revealed that the CDR-0.5 and CDR-1
groups showed significant increases in Delayed 10 word-list, Delayed 10 object-list,
Recognition 10 object, and Recent memory performance compared to the CDR-2 group. In
addition, the CDR-0.5 group showed significant decreases in Recognition 10 word

CDR-1 subjects showed significantly greater memory improvements than CDR-2 subjects.

AD
causes amyloid-&#x003b2; protein to be deposited in brain tissues, which generate senile plaques and
tau protein. The generated substance is hyper-phosphorylated, causing damage to brain nerve
cells<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinical symptoms of AD include
decline in cognitive abilities, memory impairment, and speech impairment, and damage to
cognitive and speech areas becomes more extensive as the disease progresses<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. At the beginning of AD, there are
difficulties understanding and expressing appropriate words, and damage to vision and
perception occurs as the disease progresses<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although no perfect preventive or treatment method has been found
thus far for this disease, receiving cognitive rehabilitation as soon as possible is
important for relieving symptoms or reducing the speed of disease progress. Recently,
cognitive rehabilitation has been applied to patients with diverse diseases because it can
be tailored to patients&#x02019; cognitive abilities and it provides accurate and immediate feedback
about its effectiveness<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
reported that cognitive rehabilitation in AD patients slowed the progression of cognitive
impairments<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive rehabilitation
may produce different outcomes based on the degree cognitive impairment. Cognitive
rehabilitation should produce more effective outcomes in subjects with mild versus severe
cognitive impairments. However, no study has examined the effect of cognitive rehabilitation
based on level of cognitive functioning. The purpose of the present study was to apply
cognitive rehabilitation with AD patients with different levels of cognitive functioning to
compare changes in Cognitive Assessment Reference Diagnosis System (CARDS) performance and
present standards for more effective intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects were 30 inpatients diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia. Subjects were eligible if
their Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was 0.5&#x02013;2, and their Mini-Mental State
Examination-Korea (MMSE-K) score was 23 points or lower (Cha et al., 2014). This study was
approved by the University Institutional Review Board and all the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study, in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki. Subjects were categorized as CDR-0.5, CDR-1, or CDR-2 (n = 10 per group) based on

The tester provided instructions before the intervention so that subjects
could adapt to the computers and manipulate the mouse by themselves. The cognitive
rehabilitation program is designed to improve memory, and consists of items that target
visual and perceptual attention, attentive discrimination capacity, attentive tracing,
attention maintenance, simple recognition memory, simple spatial memory, sequential recall
memory, sequential language recall memory, and combined recall memory. This program was used
50 minutes per day, five times per week, for four weeks.</p><p>The CARDS is a cognitive battery that includes seven memory tests and five non-memory
tests. The five memory tests used in this study were recognition 10 word, delayed 10
word-list, recent memory, delayed 10 object-list, and recognition 10 object. The test-retest
reliability and inter-rater reliability were very high 0.74&#x02013;0.99<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The CDR is a tool for evaluating the severity of dementia.
The CDR evaluates six dimensions: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, social
activities, in-house life and hobbies, hygiene and brush up, on 5-point scales. A score of 0
is normal, 0.5 is questionable dementia, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, 3 is severe, 4 is
profound, and 5 is terminal. Inter-rater reliability was very high 0.89<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Paired t-tests were used to compare memory performance
before and after cognitive rehabilitation. Groups were compared with a one-way ANOVA. In
addition, a post hoc test was performed using Fisher&#x02019;s least significance difference (LSD)
test. The statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervention, the CDR-0.5 and CDR-1 groups showed significant decreases in

rehabilitation on AD patients&#x02019; CARDS performance, and present more effective intervention
times according to level of cognitive functioning. Hoffmann et al. (1996) found that the
CDR-0.5 group showed the greatest improvements in cognitive functions and daily living
activities after cognitive rehabilitation, followed by the CDR-1 group and the CDR-2
group<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study
indicate that after cognitive rehabilitation, CDR-0.5 or CDR-1 subjects showed significantly
greater memory improvements than CDR-2 subjects. Moreover, cognitive rehabilitation was not
effective for CDR-2 subjects. This is consistent with the results of a study that reported
that dementia symptoms were correlated with cognitive impairments and that the speed of
memory recovery varies with AD patients&#x02019; level of cognitive functioning<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of this study suggest that cognitive
rehabilitation can be an effective treatment for CDR-0.5 (questionable dementia) or CDR-1
(mild) patients. However, cognitive rehabilitation is not sufficiently effective for CDR-2
dementia patients. Therefore, other cognitive rehabilitation methods may be more appropriate
for these patients. CARDS recognition 10 word scores decreased significantly over the course
of the study. This is consistent with a previous study that found that AD patients
experienced decreases in their ability to distinguish between different words and to
accurately understand the meanings of words compared to patients with other types of
dementia, and had lower recognition 10 word scores<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because the number of subjects in the
present study is small, the results may not generalize to all AD patients, and the
evaluation methods based on level of cognitive functioning were not quantitative, nor did
they evaluate implicated brain areas. Future studies should address these limitations by
including more subjects and considering long-term effects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Eggert</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Crismon</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Ereshefsky</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group>: Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease.
