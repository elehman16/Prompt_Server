Subjects were caffeine-consumers that avoided caffeine during the day of evaluation.

Furthermore, depending on the brand, these drinks have other ingredients such as amino acids, minerals and vegetable extracts, together with acidulants, preservatives, flavorings and colorings. These types of products have gained popularity worldwide since the 1990s, increasing exponentially the consumption among adolescents, athletes, and even senior citizens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Manufacturers of these products promote their consumption with statements offering a variety of benefits among which increased physical performance, improved reaction rate, increased attention, higher concentration, improved emotional state and weight loss are included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These are desirable characteristics for anyone, especially for active individuals. The interaction of the major bioactive compounds has been proposed as responsible for the alleged effects of these products; however, such statements have not been well studied and are not fully supported. Furthermore, there are contradictory results on the issue. Some studies attribute the alleged effects in improving the state of concentration and physical endurance to the combination of the compounds that make up these products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other studies point out that is very likely that most of the observed effects after consumption of these drinks are mainly produced by caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On the contrary, other studies have found no increase in the performance after consumption of these drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Currently, many people seek benefits for their physical and mental health situation that has led them to use these types of drinks; nonetheless, despite an increased consumption by the general population, there is a lack of knowledge about the physiological effects of the compounds used in the formulations, the level of security in their consumption and their position within food standards. This is probably because there are few well-designed studies that provide accurate and conclusive findings on the subject.</p><p>Therefore, in this study we evaluated the efficacy and safety of energy drink consumption in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial and thus we were able to assess the direct involvement of caffeine and taurine, as major bioactive compounds of energy drinks, on physical and cognitive condition in young adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>A sample of 9 or 13 subjects was calculated in order to find differences in cognitive or physical tests. This was done by using PRIMER software 3.02 (PRIMER-E Ltd, United Kingdom), after establishing a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%. Nonetheless, 14 volunteered male soldiers, members of the National Army of Colombia Seventh Division, were included in the study. No cigarette smokers or users of psychoactive substances, or subjects under any medication (e.g. beta blockers) were included. People who consumed more than 600&#x000a0;ml of coffee or more than 5 units of colas per day were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>All participants underwent a complete physical examination and an electrocardiogram to determine their physical and mental conditions and all were diagnosed as healthy. In addition, they all signed the informed consent before the physical and cognitive tests. The procedures performed were endorsed and approved by the Indeportes Antioquia Research Committee and the National Army Research Committee in order to provide protection to the study participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This research used a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, crossover design, in which each participant visited six times the Exercise Physiology Laboratory from Indeportes Antioquia, in Medell&#x000ed;n, Colombia, at 1540&#x000a0;m above sea level. Three fitness tests and two cognitive condition tests were applied in each visit. All evaluation sessions were separated between 48 or 72&#x000a0;hours and three subjects were evaluated per day. In the first session the subjects performed the tests, without drink consumption, to become familiar with their development. Testing was always conducted at the same time (2&#x000a0;pm-5&#x000a0;pm) in an environment with controlled temperature and humidity of 25&#x000b0;C and 60%, respectively. A training specialist and a psychologist with extensive experience in sports fields were responsible for measuring all variables.</p><p>Participants maintained their regular food intake, workplaces and recreational activities during study participation, but did not train at high intensity eight hours before the tests, did not eat heavy meals two hours before the tests and avoided caffeine consumption during the day of evaluation. Since the participants were soldiers, they had a very controlled schedule regarding food and exercise every day. So we are sure that during the day of evaluation the variation in these variables was kept to the minimum. All subjects used appropriate clothing for physical exercise.</p><p>Before developing the tests all subjects were randomly assigned (with the help of Excel 2007, Microsoft Co, USA) to a treatment (a placebo drink, a caffeinated drink, a caffeine and taurine combined drink, a drink with only taurine, or a commercial energy drink) and after 45&#x000a0;minutes performed each of the tests.

We used the official food composition table from University of Antioquia&#x02019;s School of Nutrition and Dietetics (Medell&#x000ed;n, Colombia) to determine the calories and nutrients consumed by the tested subjects and the average values were used in the analysis of consumption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Level of physical activity</title><p>The level of physical activity was measured using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) of the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Subjects were interviewed to remember the number of days from the last week when they did vigorous intensity or moderate intensity activities in three aspects (work or home activities, travel to different places or leisure activities) and the number of hours and minutes per day of different activities performed. This multidomain questionnaire was used since it was validated in both developed and developing countries and several populations including Latino people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

After explaining the test to each subject, the resting ergospirometry parameters were taken and the test was started with a three minutes warming up period at a speed of 3.5 mile/h with a band inclination of 1%, then the speed was increased by 0.5 mile/h every minute until exhaustion. To measure participant recovery, subjects continued walking with an intensity and duration similar to the warming up period for three minutes, followed by other two minutes of passive recovery in standing position. After the test each subject was disconnected from the computer and the information obtained was recorded. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max), maximum heart rate (HRmax) and time to exhaustion (TTE) were determined from test results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Strength calculation</title><p>A static dynamometry test of the upper limbs was performed.

For handgrip strength measurements (finger flexor force), a previously calibrated Takei Kiki Kogyo digital dynamometer (Japan), with a transducer 1270A, series 86002, 90&#x000a0;kg, was used. Each of the participants performed a ten minutes guided warming up, focusing on the muscle groups that were evaluated. Subsequently, the evaluated subject stood up and held the transducer, in such a way that the upper end of this rests on the palm, under thenar and hypothenar regions, and the lower end on the second to the fifth finger second phalanx. Then, with the upper limb away from the body and no support points for the transducer, the soldier proceeded to perform bilateral maximum handgrip strength for five seconds; this procedure was repeated after one minute of recovery and the highest value was recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Power calculation</title><p>Three vertical jumps were performed on a contact, previously calibrated, platform (Newtest Power timer series 10327) that calculated the flight time. Data obtained allowed to calculate the height reached and the subject mechanical power. Functioning of the test was explained to participants; then, there was a warming up emphasizing the muscles of the lower limbs. After subjects performed three nonconsecutive free jumps using arms, the height was measured by taking into account the flight time. Out of the three jumps performed the highest flight time was recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cognitive tests</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Focused attention test (Grid)</title><p>This instrument allowed the evaluation of outside attention, both broad and narrow according to basic principles of attention control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

So, their lack of effect on the studied variables cannot be proposed to result from inadequate quality of the beverages. Also, we want to make clear that the aim of the study was not to evaluate the effect of increasing doses of caffeine or taurine on the physical and cognitive performance, rather, it was to evaluate the effects of the amounts of these compounds currently found in most energy drinks available for free consumption.</p><p>Some of our findings contrast with those of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The effects have been attributed to the combination of ingredients like caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone and B vitamins in these drinks. However, we must clarify that in those studies the main ingredients of an energy drink (caffeine and taurine) were not isolated and the drinks were separated as control (placebo) and experimental (other drinks) groups without, in several cases, good masking of the treatments. In our study each subject was his own control which can minimize the bias introduced when evaluating compounds such as caffeine and taurine, since the individual response to the consumption of these substances may be different. Also, our methodology allowed a good masking of the treatments and gives strength to this study. On the other hand, our findings are consistent with the results obtained by Candow and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], Umana-Alvarado and Moncada-Jim&#x000e9;nez [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and Nelson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] in which the consumption of the commercial beverage had not positively influenced the outcome of the physical tests performed. It is important to note that in our study we assessed the cardiorespiratory fitness directly (through ergospirometry) which can provide more reliable information than when tests are performed indirectly through a stress test.</p><p>Results shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> demonstrate that the consumption of the commercial energy drink did not affect the HRmax of the evaluated subjects, in agreement also with the findings of Baum and Weiss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], Bichler and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the recent work of Nelson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In contrast, in Gei&#x000df; and colleagues&#x02019; work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], lower HR values were reported after endurance athletes consumed a commercial energy drink. However, the subjects in the last research were athletes, while our study was conducted in a different population (soldiers). Since the soldiers studied have very similar dietary patterns, physical activity, employment and lifestyle (hours of sleep, free time management, level of education), the differentiating effect that could have these patterns on fitness and cognitive tests can be minimized.</p><p>In a recent report with similar design to ours, Nelson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] did not find any change in ride time-to-exhaustion and some cardiovascular performance variables on a sample of similar size of young, moderately fit subjects, after they drunk a caffeinated and taurinated commercial drink. Since we used subjects with higher VO<sub>2</sub>max values and the results were the same, it is tempting to speculate that the lack of effects of the studied compounds may persist in people within a relatively large range of physical capabilities.</p><p>On the other hand, a paper showed a significant increase in VO<sub>2</sub>max, TTE and maximal workload in a stress test after consuming a taurine supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The authors postulated that this could be due to attenuation of exercise-induced damage to deoxyribonucleic acid and increased exercise capacity by its protective properties at cellular level, which differs with the results found in this research. Unfortunately, we did not further explore in our subjects the mechanisms mentioned by that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>In this research it was not found that the bioactive compounds have a positive effect on immediate memory and concentration tests, as opposite to several reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], where the effect was attributed to either the caffeine or an ingredient combination. In those studies, however, each energy drink main compound was not evaluated. In our case, no differences were found in cognitive tests when combined or isolated bioactive compounds were consumed; possibly because either the amount of caffeine used is insufficient to positively influence the concentration and immediate memory test outcomes or there is not an actual effect. These results are consistent with findings made by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], who found no effects in the subject memory and alertness and concentration state. The dose we administered to the subjects was between the range of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mg/kg proposed by some authors to have physiological effects on several cognitive and physical functions when administered in energy drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Although some authors have proposed that low doses of caffeine are associated with increased energy, alertness and vigilance, motivation and concentration, but not with memory in non-athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], i.e., there is a task specific profile of response to caffeine, the variability in results obtained in active people with energy drinks suggests that this is not clear yet (see for instance [1,5,32 and results from the present work]). Further investigations are necessary for people who exercise to identify the lower caffeine doses that produce beneficial effects in their performance that can really be worthwhile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], to evaluate the effect on several variables of cognitive performance more sensitive to low doses of caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and also to study the potential additive effect of the components of energy drinks. The history of caffeine consumption and withdrawal in the subjects studied is not expected to affect our results, since in both low (about 50&#x000a0;mg/day) and high caffeine (about 200&#x000a0;mg/day) consumers, a period of withdrawal comparable to that used in the present work has no effect on the cognitive responses measured after a caffeine challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The lack of influence of the consumer type on different variables affected or not by caffeine, has also been reported in works which involved people with a history of caffeine consumption ranging from zero to more than 200&#x000a0;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. So, it is likely that caffeine habituation (from zero to 200&#x000a0;mg/day) is not an important variable to explain results from studies evaluating the effect of energy drinks on sports performance.</p><p>It has also been suggested that taurine can help in skeletal muscle contractile function, by increasing the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and muscle force generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Moreover, the potential synergistic or additive effects of caffeine and taurine when administered in energy drinks deserve attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this study, however, neither the drink with taurine, nor the taurine combined with caffeine nor the commercial drink favored a higher generation of strength than the placebo drink.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The different bioactive compounds studied here at the concentrations (caffeine 80&#x000a0;mg and taurine 1000&#x000a0;mg per serving of 250&#x000a0;ml) found in most currently available energy drinks do not have positive effects on cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO<sub>2</sub>max, HRmax and TTE), force or power; neither on concentration test nor on immediate memory in young, healthy, active adults.
