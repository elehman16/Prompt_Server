It is still questionable as the protective effect of antihypertensive drugs for gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension in comparison with preeclampsia has not been confirmed.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>However, the main question is about the etiology of an increase in BP in pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Some hypotheses have been recently suggested for the role of stress in preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The effect of stress in producing essential hypertension has been known clearly;[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] however, it has not been confirmed in pregnancy, and the results of the studies are controversial.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Homeostatic imbalance may lead to a huge number of stress-induced diseases by overstimulation of target organ. Therefore, self-regulatory treatments are useful treatments for stress-induced disorders.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Relaxation techniques are used as an effective treatment for these kinds of disorders. The response to relaxation brings about homeostatic balance. Muscular tension decreases during relaxation, and peace of mind is achieved.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Nowadays, different methods of relaxation have been used. The most common ones are diaphragmatic breathing, meditation, imagery techniques, music therapy, massage therapy, progressive relaxation, hypnotism, autogenic training, and biofeedback.

Based on the data received monthly from health centers no. 1, no. 2, and no. 3, six sub-centers with higher numbers of hypertensive pregnant women were selected. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Inclusion criteria were systolic BP &#x02265;135 mmHg or diastolic BP &#x02265;85 mmHg, absence of severe preeclampsia [diastolic BP &#x02265;110 mmHg, proteinuria ++ and more, headache, visual problems, upper abdominal pain, oliguria, an increase in serum creatinine and liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), pulmonary edema] or eclampsia, absence of chronic hypertension or hypertension before 20 weeks, gestational age of 20&#x02013;36 weeks, single pregnancy, no contraction or bleeding, absence of underlying diseases and mental disorders, absence of polyhydramnios, hydatidiform mole, and placenta previa, not being addicted to drugs, alcohol, mood-altering medicine, and cigarette, not using similar relaxation methods and breathing techniques during pregnancy, reading and writing literacy, and having a contact number. Exclusion criteria were using antihypertensive drugs (for experimental groups), complete bed rest, bleeding, contraction or leakage during the study, deterioration of preeclampsia to a severe form, hospitalization, starting medical treatments for experimental groups, subjects' decision to leave the study, being absent in one session of personal instructions in the experimental groups, not doing exercises of more than three sessions of relaxation and breathing control at home, occurrence of delivery during the 4-week intervention, and presence of symptoms such as confusion, fatigue, feeling of suffocation, pain, and blurred vision during doing exercises.</p><p>Subjects were selected using non-probable convenience sampling. They were randomly assigned to three groups. The order of the three groups was decided by drawing of lots. The first 10 were assigned to relaxation, the second 10 to breathing technique, and the third 10 subjects were assigned to the control group. It was repeated during the study. After a pilot study was conducted on 10 subjects of each group, the sample size was calculated by comparing the means formula (no. = 18 subjects in each group). Study continued until 20 subjects entered the study for more confidence and consideration of 10% more subjects, selected in sampling. In the relaxation group, two patients were excluded because of delivery, two because of their decision to leave the study, and one for starting medical treatments. In the breathing control group, four cases were excluded because of their decision to leave the study, two for delivery, and another one as she wanted to go on a vacation. In the control group, one subject was excluded for her decision to leave the study and another one as she wanted to go on a vacation.</p><p>Data collection tools were an interview form containing demographic and midwifery data, and a checklist for doing exercises in the class and at home.</p><p>In this study, two methods of progressive muscular relaxation and breathing control were compared. The researcher was trained by a psychologist to administer the techniques. It took 4 weeks for the subjects to do exercises in four classes that were held at Omm-ol-banin hospital. For the rest of the week, they followed researcher's oral instructions that had been recorded on a CD, at home. Continuation of doing exercises was followed by the phone calls. The symptoms of severe preeclampsia were checked both by phone calls and at the beginning of each personal class. In the personal classes, necessary explanations were given about doing exercises after the primary interventions and control of BP. The subjects were asked to empty their bladder and be in a convenient position (sitting or lying).</p><p>Progressive muscular relaxation was done using Jacobson method[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] by contracting and relaxing selected groups of muscles until total relaxation was achieved. Subjects were asked to contract and then relax their muscles including hands, different parts of face, shoulders, and other parts by the researcher's order. Each exercise session took around 20 min.</p><p>Breathing control technique included deep diaphragmatic breathing and decreasing the respiration rate to 6&#x02013;10/min. Subjects were guided to do 20 deep diaphragmatic respirations, which took around 5 min.</p><p>No intervention was done in the control group.

In general, the effects of both techniques were more obvious on systolic BP compared to diastolic BP.</p><p>In both the two experimental groups, no subject needed a medical treatment; however, in the control group with no intervention, six patients underwent medical treatments due to high BP. Based on statistical analyses, a significant difference was found between the two intervention groups and the control group in terms of decreasing BP. It could be mentioned that the decrease in BP in the control group could be partly attributed to the medications. If the six patients taking medications in the control group are excluded, the difference between groups would become much more and the <italic>P</italic> value would decrease.
