Several cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, including interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23. These cytokines act via induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines which promote chronic inflammation and auto-reactivity. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against the common p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ustekinumab have demonstrated significant and prolonged efficacy in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Adverse events were generally similar across treatment and control groups. Studies are ongoing to assess the long term safety and efficacy profiles of ustekinumab.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ustekinumab</kwd><kwd>psoriasis</kwd><kwd>plaque</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psoriasis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease which primarily affects the skin and joints. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is multifactorial, with genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors contributing to the phenotype. Although the inheritance pattern for psoriasis remains unclear, a definite genetic predisposition has been noted through sibling and twin studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-btt-3-159">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-btt-3-159">2</xref> Evidence for the role of environmental or external factors in psoriasis has been observed clinically by the appearance of psoriatic lesions at sites of physical trauma, known as Koebner&#x02019;s phenomenon. Infections, especially streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract, have also been recognized as triggers of psoriasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-btt-3-159">3</xref></p><p>Immunologic mechanisms in psoriasis are complex, and are mediated by an aberrant T cell response to an unknown pathogen in the skin. The importance of T cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is supported by the response to treatment with compounds that act on lymphocytes, such as cyclosporine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-btt-3-159">4</xref> In addition, psoriasis may develop for the first time after bone marrow transplantation from a donor with psoriasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-btt-3-159">5</xref> Animal models demonstrate that T cell dysregulation occurs without prior epithelial abnormalities, and appears to be dependent upon a susceptible environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-btt-3-159">6</xref> The cell mediated immune response in the skin of psoriasis patients is thought to be tilted toward a T helper-1 (Th1) response with over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN&#x003b3;).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-btt-3-159">7</xref> Several cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#x003b1;), IFN&#x003b3;, interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-17 and, more recently, IL-23.</p><p>The use of biologic therapies in psoriasis is based on targeting one or more of the steps in the cellular immune response. Three fundamental modes of action are being explored: decreasing the number of pathogenic T cells, blocking T cell migration and adhesion, and inhibiting effector cytokines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-btt-3-159">8</xref> Current therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacy; however, several problems exist. First, non-specific suppression of T cell function leads to global immune suppression, which underlies many of the toxicities associated with conventional systemic psoriasis treatment. Additionally, long term safety and efficacy data for recently developed therapies are just becoming available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-btt-3-159">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-btt-3-159">10</xref> There remains a need for therapies with long term clinical efficacy and safety profiles, which would improve patient compliance and satisfaction.</p><p>Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. Studies in animal models demonstrated the drug&#x02019;s ability to block IL-12 and IL-23 binding to their receptors, with inhibition of downstream signaling. Clinical trials in humans have shown ustekinumab to have favorable short term clinical efficacy and safety profiles. Long term studies are ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Immune mechanisms in psoriasis</title><p>Current research suggests that the T cells in psoriasis become reactive to an unknown antigen in the skin, which results in persistent T cell activation and low level expression of cytokines and their receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-btt-3-159">11</xref> The cell mediated immune response has classically been characterized by the nature of infiltrating CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, with polarization toward a Th1 or Th2 response being dependent upon the cytokine milieu and other local factors. The Th1 tilted immune response is characterized by a strong cytotoxic response directed against intracellular pathogens, whereas the Th2 response involves antibody production by B cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-btt-3-159">12</xref> Psoriasis has classically been thought of as a Th1 tilted, cell mediated disorder, with infiltration of leukocytes into the dermis observed before any obvious epidermal changes occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-btt-3-159">13</xref> T cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis via induction of an inflammatory cytokine cascade, with subsequent acceleration of the growth of epidermal and vascular cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-btt-3-159">14</xref></p><p>The first step in the cellular immune response involves the interaction of a na&#x000ef;ve T cell with an antigen-presenting cell (APC), which leads to T cell activation and differentiation. This initial interaction involves the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex on the surface of the T cell, which binds specifically to an antigen-presenting MHC receptor on the APC. Co-stimulatory signals are required for T cell activation. One co-stimulatory signal is the interaction of CD40 on APCs with CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells, which results in the synthesis of high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 by mature dendritic cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-btt-3-159">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-btt-3-159">16</xref> IL-12 is the main cytokine in regulating the mitotic activation and differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells to type 1 cells &#x02013; CD4+ Th1 cells, which can subsequently induce clonal expansion of type 1 cytotoxic (Tc1) CD8+ T cells, the main effector cell in psoriatic lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-btt-3-159">17</xref> The increased expression of IL-12 in psoriatic skin, along with increased IL-12 receptor expressed on lesional T cells could drive the differentiation to a Type 1 mediated immune response seen in both skin lesions and peripheral circulating lymphocytes in patients with psoriasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-btt-3-159">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-btt-3-159">19</xref></p><p>IL-12 is also an important regulator of the cell-mediated immune response, by inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-btt-3-159">20</xref> These cytokines play a role in the innate immune response via stimulation of phagocytic activity, facilitating T cell infiltration into the epidermis, and inducing keratinocyte proliferation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-btt-3-159">21</xref> IFN&#x003b3; also may play an important role in enhancing survival of keratinocytes, since keratinocytes derived from psoriatic plaques were found to be resistant to apoptosis compared to normal skin samples.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-btt-3-159">22</xref> Recent studies have implicated the importance of IL-23, a newly discovered cytokine which shares a common p40 subunit with IL-12, in psoriasis. IL-23 acts on different effector cell populations, including memory T cells and a novel T helper cell population, known as Th17 cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-btt-3-159">23</xref> Through their elaboration of IL-17 and other cytokines important in the inflammatory response, Th17 cells are thought to have an increasingly important role in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-btt-3-159">24</xref></p><p>IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of two disulfide linked subunits, known as p40 and p35.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-btt-3-159">25</xref> While p35 is expressed ubiquitously at low levels, p40 expression is limited to cells that elaborate IL-12: monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and B cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-btt-3-159">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-btt-3-159">27</xref> IL-12 plays an essential role in mediating the innate immune response via enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN&#x003b3;, by natural killer (NK) cells and T cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-btt-3-159">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-btt-3-159">29</xref> Other roles of IL-12 include promotion of Langerhans cell maturation in the skin, and increasing cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-btt-3-159">30</xref> The gene encoding the p40 subunit of IL-12 is highly inducible by microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-btt-3-159">31</xref> Therefore IL-12 production can be induced in a T cell-independent fashion by cells of the innate immune system, as well as by T cell interaction with APCs. IFN&#x003b3; also promotes further IL-12 production, potentiating a positive feedback loop.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-btt-3-159">32</xref> Dysregulation of any of the steps in this pro-inflammatory cascade can lead to chronic inflammatory changes, as seen in psoriasis and other Th1-mediated disorders.</p><p>As mentioned above, IL-12 is the key effector cytokine in commitment to a Th1 response, which is thought to be important in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. However, experiments in mouse models of inflammation have demonstrated that deficiency of IL-12 or IFN&#x003b3; does not protect from the development of autoimmune diseases, and that often these mice have a more severe clinical picture than their wild type counterparts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-btt-3-159">33</xref> This led to the discovery of IL-23, a novel biologically active cytokine which consisted of a p19 subunit linked to the p40 subunit of IL-12.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-btt-3-159">34</xref> It is produced primarily by activated macrophages and dendritic cells, and is thought to play an important role in linking the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-btt-3-159">35</xref> Similarly to IL-12, IL-23 induces the production of IFN&#x003b3; by Th1 cells, however at a much less efficient rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-btt-3-159">36</xref> Instead, IL-23 has unique cellular targets &#x02013; memory T cells and a recently discovered subset of Th cells, termed Th17 cells because they produce IL-17.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-btt-3-159">21</xref> Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, and actually perform several of the functions originally attributed to IL-12 and Th1 cells. IL-23 also acts on memory T cells, as evidenced by the expression of functional IL-23 receptor on the surface of human peripheral blood memory T cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-btt-3-159">37</xref> Contrary to the role of IL-12 in inducing a Th1 tilted immune response, IL-23 may play a more dominant role in maintaining chronic inflammation in psoriasis and regulating end-stage inflammatory processes. Further evidence for the role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is supported by repeated intradermal injection of IL-23 in mice, which leads to psoriasis-like changes including epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-btt-3-159">38</xref> In human psoriasis lesions, increased expression of IL-23 subunits compared to healthy controls was noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-btt-3-159">39</xref></p><p>Cytokine function is dependent upon binding to functional receptor on cell surfaces. The IL-12 receptor is composed of two subunits, &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2, which form a heterodimer to allow high-affinity IL-12 binding. The p40 subunit of IL-12 interacts with IL-12R&#x003b2;1, whereas p35 binds to IL-12R&#x003b2;2, which is the subunit involved in signal transduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-btt-3-159">40</xref> Expression of the &#x003b2;2 subunit of IL-12R on activated T cells and NK cells is maintained by IFN&#x003b3;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-btt-3-159">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-btt-3-159">42</xref> IL-12 receptor is also expressed on dendritic cells, forming a positive feedback loop for IL-12 expression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-btt-3-159">43</xref> The IL-23 receptor is also composed of two subunits: IL-12R&#x003b2;1, which is also a subunit of the IL-12 receptor, and a second subunit which is unique to IL-23, known as IL-23R.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-btt-3-159">44</xref> The p40 subunit of IL-23 interacts with IL-12R&#x003b2;1, whereas the p19 subunit binds to IL-23R.

Mice deficient in IL-12p40, p35, or IL-12R&#x003b2;1 have similar phenotypes of decreased IFN&#x003b3; secretion and NK cell activity, and impaired Th1 differentiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-btt-3-159">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-btt-3-159">48</xref> However, in a mouse model of colitis it was noted that p40&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were more immunocompromised than p35&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, owing to the lack of both IL-12 and IL-23 in the p40&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-btt-3-159">49</xref> IL-12p40&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice showed compromised Toxoplasma gondii clearance, which was associated with decreased IFN&#x003b3; production.

In contrast, 2% of subjects who received placebo achieved PASI 75, with a p value of &#x0003c;0.001. In addition to evaluation of PASI, the physician&#x02019;s global assessment (PGA) was also used in efficacy evaluations throughout the 32-week study. PGA scores, which were determined by treating physicians and ranged from 1 (clear) to 6 (worse), were significantly better in all active treatment groups versus placebo.</p><p>PGA scores were also used to determine which study subjects were eligible to receive an additional dose of ustekinumab; 37% of patients received one 90 mg dose based on PGA scores of 2 or greater at week 16. Study authors noted that PGA scores remained relatively stable throughout week 24, suggesting that this extra dose did not improve clinical outcomes in those patients who did not originally respond to ustekinumab. This observation further supports the notion that there may be a unique population of responders to anti-IL-12/23 antibody, possibly defined by baseline cytokine profiles.</p><p>Two phase 3 trials were performed to assess long term safety and efficacy of ustekinumab in large patient cohorts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75-btt-3-159">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76-btt-3-159">76</xref> The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, known as PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2, consisted of nearly 2000 patients combined, and had similar study designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-btt-3-159">Figure 1</xref>). The PHOENIX 1 study design was SC administration of 45 mg or 90 mg of ustekinumab at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks thereafter. The study was conducted in three phases: a placebo-controlled phase (weeks 0&#x02013;12), placebo-crossover and active treatment phase (weeks 12&#x02013;40), and a randomized withdrawal phase (weeks 40&#x02013;76). During the placebo crossover phase, half of study subjects originally assigned to placebo received 45 mg injections every 12 weeks, and the other half received 90 mg injections. As in previous studies, the primary endpoint was PASI 75, which was achieved in approximately 67% of patients in both active treatment groups, versus 3% of placebo group patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-btt-3-159">Table 1</xref>). Similarly to previous studies, onset of efficacy was noted by week 2, and maximal efficacy was observed between weeks 20 and 24. Patients originally randomized to placebo achieved similar response rates after crossover at week 12. After re-randomization at week 40, time to loss of PASI 75 response was better in patients receiving maintenance therapy than in the withdrawal of treatment group. The median time to loss of PASI75 in patients withdrawn from treatment was reported as 15 weeks. Rebound psoriasis was not reported in patients withdrawn from treatment. Among all active treatment groups, PASI 75 response was sustained through week 76.</p><p>PHOENIX 2 was similar in design to PHOENIX 1, but with dosing intensification for those subjects who did not respond fully to ustekinumab. Partial responders were defined as patients who achieved greater than 50% but less than 75% improvement in PASI scores from baseline. At week 28, partial responders were re-randomized to continue with their current dosing regimen (45 mg or 90 mg ustekinumab every 12 weeks), or to increase dosing frequency to every 8 weeks at their originally assigned dose. Primary endpoint results for PHOENIX 2 paralleled PHOENIX 1 results, with PASI 75 achieved in 75.7% and 66.7%, respectively, of patients in the 90 mg and 45 mg groups. At week 52, median improvement in PASI from baseline was around 95% in all active treatment subjects. There were 93 (22.7%) partial responders in the 45 mg group, and 65 (15.8%) in the 90 mg group. In the 90 mg group, 22 of 33 partial responders achieved PASI 75 after increasing dosing frequency to every 8 weeks. This observation may have been mediated by increased serum drug concentration with shortened dosing intervals, but does not explain the improvement fully since dosing intensification did not improve clinical outcomes in partial responders in the 45 mg group. Subgroup analysis of partial responders revealed a tendency toward higher bodyweight, more severe disease by PGA, longer duration of skin disease, previous failure of biologic agent(s), and a higher incidence of psoriatic arthritis. Only higher body weight was a statistically significant predictor of partial response to treatment with ustekinumab every 12 weeks. In addition, 12.7% of partial responders were found to have antibodies to ustekinumab, and serum trough levels of ustekinumab at week 28 were 2 to 3 times lower than levels in responders.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>SC and IV administrations of ustekinumab were generally well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events being mild in intensity. The most commonly reported adverse events included upper respiratory symptoms, headache, arthralgias, transient increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lymphopenia. Adverse events were relatively evenly distributed across placebo and study groups. Importantly, changes in levels of T lymphocyte and NK cell groups were noted in early studies but these changes did not appear to be consistent or dose-dependent, and did not correlate with any clinical symptoms. Injection site reactions were generally mild and not considered to be clinically relevant.</p><p>In the phase 2 study, adverse events were high in both active treatment and placebo groups (79% and 72%, respectively). Serious adverse events, defined as requiring hospitalization, occurred in 4% of patients treated with ustekinumab and 1% of patients in the placebo group. Two patients receiving ustekinumab were hospitalized for infection, and three for cardiovascular events. Contrary to findings of the phase I studies, there were no significant differences observed in changes in absolute lymphocyte counts or lymphocyte subsets between treatment and placebo groups. Antibodies to ustekinumab developed in 5.1% of phase 3 study participants through week 76; these were predominantly low titer and not associated with injection site reactions. No anaphylactic reactions were observed in either large scale study.</p><p>Patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of cardiovascular events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77-btt-3-159">77</xref> In the phase 2 trial of ustekinumab two patients experienced myocardial infarction and one suffered a stroke during the placebo-controlled phase. Subsequent larger phase 3 studies revealed no increased risk of cardiovascular side effects. One patient in the placebo and group and one patient in the active treatment group experienced an adverse cardiac event, including a sudden cardiac death in the active treatment group.</p><p>Since the Th1 response is important for clearance of intracellular pathogens and defense against malignancies, the incidence of these adverse effects was considered to be especially important in the evaluation of ustekinumab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-btt-3-159">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79-btt-3-159">79</xref> During PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2, two serious infections occurred during the placebo-controlled phase in patients receiving ustekinumab 90 mg, one case each of cellulitis and herpes zoster. Patients receiving maintenance ustekinumab therapy did not experience increased rates of adverse events compared to patients in the randomized withdrawal group.</p><p>Patients were screened for tuberculosis (TB) before enrollment. Exclusion criteria included symptoms of active TB. However patients with a newly identified positive skin test (&#x0201c;latent TB&#x0201d;) could be included if appropriate treatment was initiated before or along with first administration of the study agent. No cases of TB, latent reactivation of TB, other mycobacterial infections or salmonella infections were observed.</p><p>Cutaneous malignancies were reported in two patients during the placebo-controlled phase of PHOENIX 2, a squamous cell cancer in the placebo group and a basal cell cancer in the 90 mg treatment group. No differences were observed in common laboratory tests between active treatment and placebo groups, including liver function tests, fasting glucose, or hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> levels.</p><p>Although the incidence of serious infections was low in studies to date, concern remains for the risk of generalized impaired immunity after treatment with ustekinumab, since IFN&#x003b3; and IL-12 are essential for cell mediated immunity. Additionally, blocking both IL-12 and IL-23 through their common p40 subunit may also impair the Th17 response, which is thought to be important in normal keratinocyte host immunity.</p><p>IL-23 knockout mice were demonstrated to have impaired clearance of bacterial and parasitic pathogens, decreased numbers of NK cells, and deficient Th cell development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80-btt-3-159">80</xref> They also have a defect in re-activation of memory T cells, which leads to impairment in the humoral immune response and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81-btt-3-159">81</xref> In human subjects suffering from severe mycobacterial and salmonella infections, defects in the genes encoding IL-12p40 and IL-12R&#x003b2;1 were detected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82-btt-3-159">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83-btt-3-159">83</xref> These observations suggest continued vigilant observation of patients treated with this agent.</p><p>Studies to investigate potential limiting factors in the use of ustekinumab were performed in monkeys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-btt-3-159">68</xref> Embryo-fetal toxicity studies performed during the period of organogenesis did not reveal maternal or fetal abnormalities. Nevertheless, study participants to date have been predominantly males, since women of childbearing age were excluded from participation. Additionally, studies were conducted in a monkey model of asthma, which showed that ustekinumab did not exacerbate the pulmonary function of study monkeys following two IV doses at 50 mg/kg, spaced 4 weeks apart. Further research is needed to determine whether these results will translate to human subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The above results support the strategy of development of monoclonal antibodies directed against Th1 cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory responses. Although there are limitations in comparison across studies, current data indicate that clinical efficacy of ustekinumab compares favorably with the highest efficacy reported for currently available biologic therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84-btt-3-159">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85-btt-3-159">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86-btt-3-159">86</xref> Additionally, the long half-life of ustekinumab allows for prolonged efficacy with infrequent dosing schedules, which may improve treatment adherence. Treatment with subcutaneous injections of ustekinumab every 12 weeks appeared to be efficacious for most psoriasis patients, but intensification to every 8 week therapy at 90 mg may be necessary to elicit a full response in a subset of patients. Partial responders, which could represent approximately 20% of the total population, were found to have lower serum drug levels than PASI 75 responders, indicating an association between drug levels and clinical response. Identification of partial responders may be facilitated by demographic characteristics, such as increased body weight or lack of response to other biologic agents, or possibly by cytokine profiles. Residual skin disease may be mediated by alternate immune pathways in these individuals. In patients withdrawn from ustekinumab therapy in phase 3 trials, psoriasis gradually recurred, showing that temporary blockade of IL-12 and IL-23 did not reverse the underlying causal mechanism of psoriasis. Therefore, sustaining clinical response and quality of life improvements could require indefinite maintenance dosing. Current studies did not reveal any major safety concerns in blocking IL-12 and IL-23 for up to 18 months; however, uncommon events or events that occur after longer exposure cannot be excluded based on current study data. For this reason, the PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 studies have been extended for a total of 5 years.</p><p>It is important to note that serious adverse events may not be noted in newly approved medications until post-marketing surveillance studies. This may be in part because some serious adverse events are very uncommon, and are not detected until a drug has been used in a large number of patients. Additionally, patients participating in clinical trials have specific inclusion and exclusion criteria which may not be applicable to the general population. A recent study examined the nature and frequency of safety-related regulatory actions for biologic drugs following approval, including dear health care professional letters and black box warnings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87-btt-3-159">87</xref> The probability of a safety-related regulatory action for a newly approved biologic agent was 14% 3 years after approval, and 29% 10 years after approval. Additionally, biologics first in class to obtain approval had a higher risk for a safety-related regulatory action, with a hazard ratio of 3.7. Therefore, providers and patients should be vigilant in monitoring patients being treated with ustekinumab, as serious adverse events may only become apparent during post-marking surveillance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>Robert E Kalb has served as a consultant and/or investigator for Abbott, Astellas, Amgen, Centocor (the manufacturer
