We tried to clarify the neural mechanisms of the facilitation system during physical fatigue using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a classical conditioning technique. Twelve right-handed volunteers participated in this study. Participants underwent MEG recording during the imagery of maximum grips of the right hand guided by metronome sounds for 10 min. Thereafter, fatigue-inducing maximum handgrip trials were performed for 10 min; the metronome sounds were started 5 min after the beginning of the handgrip trials. The metronome sounds were used as conditioned stimuli and maximum handgrip trials as unconditioned stimuli. The next day, they were randomly assigned to two groups in a single-blinded, two-crossover fashion to undergo two types of MEG recordings, that is, for the control and motivation sessions, during the imagery of maximum grips of the right hand guided by metronome sounds for 10 min. The alpha-band event-related desynchronizations (ERDs) of the motivation session relative to the control session within the time windows of 500 to 700 and 800 to 900 ms after the onset of handgrip cue sounds were identified in the sensorimotor areas. In addition, the alpha-band ERD within the time window of 400 to 500 ms was identified in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 46). The ERD level in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was positively associated with that in the sensorimotor areas within the time window of 500 to 700 ms. These results suggest that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the neural substrates of the facilitation system and activates the sensorimotor areas during physical fatigue.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors thank Forte Science Communication for editorial assistance with the manuscript.

Fatigue can be classified as physical or mental, and physical fatigue can be classified as peripheral or central. In contrast to peripheral fatigue, central fatigue is caused at sites proximal to the peripheral nerves and is defined as a progressive decline in the ability to activate muscles voluntarily <xref rid="pone.0080731-Gandevia1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080731-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, we performed a neuroimaging study of classical conditioning of physical fatigue <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Participants underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements during the imagery of maximum handgrips guided by metronome sounds for 10 min. Thereafter, fatigue-inducing physical task trials were performed for 10 min; metronome sounds were started 5 min after the beginning of the task trials. The metronome sounds were used as conditioned stimuli and the physical task trials were used as unconditioned stimuli to cause central fatigue. The next day, neural activities during the imagery of maximum handgrips guided by metronome sounds for 10 min were measured. The level of fatigue sensation caused by listening to the metronome sounds on the second day was increased relative to the first day and the equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) in the insular cortex and posterior cingulate cortex were observed only after the conditioning session. These MEG results showed that classical conditioning of physical fatigue took place, and that these brain regions were involved in the neural substrates of central fatigue, which limits the motor output from the primary motor cortex (M1) and physical performance under the condition of physical fatigue.</p><p>A motivational input activates a facilitation system to increase the motor output from M1 to overcome central fatigue <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The frontal area, in particular the dorsolateral prefrontal area, seems to play a pivotal role in increasing motor output, that is, enhancing the facilitation system, against the effects of central fatigue. After a fatigue-inducing physical task, an increased movement-evoked MEG response to the imagery of maximum handgrips in the dorsolateral prefrontal area was shown and the activation level in this brain area was positively associated with those in the bilateral sensorimotor areas <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Because the endurance duration for a physical task was shown to be related to activation in the prefrontal area <xref rid="pone.0080731-Dettmers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the prefrontal area seems to contribute to activation in the bilateral sensorimotor areas to compensate for central fatigue. We therefore hypothesized that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the neural substrates of the facilitation system during physical fatigue. However, to confirm that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is related to the facilitation system against central fatigue, it is essential to investigate the neural substrates under conditions without physical fatigue while participants feel central inhibition <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka4" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, that is, fatigue sensation, such as a conditioned physical fatigue. This is because physical fatigue is a complex phenomenon or state, and confounding factors other than central inhibition and the facilitation system may be involved <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080731-Hilty1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to identify the neural mechanisms of the facilitation system during physical fatigue. We compared neural activities between the motivation and unmotivated control conditions under the condition of classical conditioning of physical fatigue. In addition to having a high temporal resolution, MEG has an advantage of measuring brain activity by using time-frequency analyses <xref rid="pone.0080731-Stam1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Oscillatory brain rhythms are considered to originate from synchronous synaptic activities of a large number of neurons <xref rid="pone.0080731-Brookes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Synchronization of neural networks may reflect integration of information processing, and such synchronization processes can be evaluated using MEG time-frequency analyses. Multiple, broadly distributed, and continuously interacting dynamic neural networks are achievable through the synchronization of oscillations at particular time-frequency bands <xref rid="pone.0080731-Varela1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In particular, event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha (8&#x02013;13 Hz) and beta (13&#x02013;25 Hz) frequency bands were reported to be associated with fatigue in the central nervous system <xref rid="pone.0080731-Neuper1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080731-Ishii1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Alterations of the decreased MEG alpha and beta power densities in some brain regions induced by enhanced motivation during the imagery of maximum handgrips may provide valuable clues to identifying neural mechanisms of the facilitation system under the condition of physical fatigue. In addition, the correlation analyses among the MEG variables may provide important clues regarding the roles of MEG variables in physical fatigue. Therefore, correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationships among the MEG responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Twelve healthy male volunteers (age, 24.8&#x000b1;7.2 years [mean &#x000b1; SD]) were enrolled.

The same participants performed the control and motivation sessions and the order of the sessions was counterbalanced, that is, six participants began with the control session and the others began with the motivation session. On the first day, MEG recordings during the imagery of maximum grips of the right hand, guided by metronome sounds, was performed for 10 min (first MEG session). Thereafter, 10-min fatigue-inducing maximum handgrip trials using a device (HAND GRIPS 30 kg; IGNIO, Nagoya, Japan) were performed (conditioning session), in which the metronome sounds (same as the MEG session) were started 5 min after the beginning of the handgrip trials and the sounds were continued until the end of the handgrip trials.

Participants were not informed about the metronome sounds before the task trials. On the next day, two 10-min MEG recordings during the imagery of maximum grips of the right hand guided by metronome sounds were performed (second and third MEG sessions). In the motivation session, participants were instructed that when they performed the imagery of maximum grips of the right hand with the maximum level of motivation, they could earn up to 7000 yen (approximately $70). In the control session, they could not obtain any monetary rewards even when they performed the imagery with the maximum level of motivation. Participants were told that electrocardiography was being performed and recorded during the MEG sessions to assess motivation levels.</p><fig id="pone-0080731-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0080731.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to two groups in a single-blinded, two-crossover fashion to perform two types of magnetoencephalography (MEG) sessions (the same participants performed control and motivation sessions and the order of the sessions was counterbalanced, that is, six participants began with the control session and the others began with the motivation session).

The pacing cue consisted of white noise that lasted 33 ms; the handgrip cue consisted of a 1000 Hz tone that lasted 1 s. All the cue sounds were produced by Windows Media Player (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and were converted to electric signals by a sound card (Creative X-Fi Audio Processor [WDM]; Creative Technology, Singapore, Singapore) installed in a personal computer (DELL Precision 390; Dell, Round Rock, TX).

These data were then analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, Sherbon, MA). The MEG anatomical/spatial parameters used to warp the volumetric data were transformed into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template of T1-weighed images <xref rid="pone.0080731-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>) and applied to the MEG data. The anatomically normalized MEG data were filtered with a Gaussian kernel of 20 mm (full-width at half-maximum) in the x, y, and z axes (voxel dimension was 5.0&#x000d7;5.0&#x000d7;5.0 mm). The decreased oscillatory power, that is, ERD, for alpha (8&#x02013;13 Hz) and beta (13&#x02013;25 Hz) bands within the time window of 0 to 1000 ms (every 100 ms) in the motivation session relative to the control session was measured on a region-of-interest basis to obtain the neural activation pattern of the facilitation system during physical fatigue. The resulting set of voxel values for each comparison constituted a SPM of the t statistics (SPM{T}). The threshold for the SPM{T} of individual analyses was set at P&#x0003c;0.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons).

These results indicate that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the neural substrates of the facilitation system and activates the sensorimotor areas to overcome central fatigue.</p><p>We tried to identify the neural substrates of the facilitation system during physical fatigue by comparing neural activities during imagery of maximum handgrips between motivation and control sessions, as the difference between these conditions is limited to the presence or absence of the enhanced facilitation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Our MEG study showed that the sensorimotor areas and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 46) were specifically activated during the motivation session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080731-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that these brain regions are involved in the neural substrates of the facilitation system during physical fatigue. Because the neural activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during imagery of maximum handgrips showed positive associations with that in the sensorimotor areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) and activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex proceeded that in the sensorimotor areas (400 to 500 ms vs. 500 to 900 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g005">5</xref>), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seems to play a primary role in increasing motor output from the contralateral M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The role may be through activation of the sensorimotor areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080731-g004">Fig. 4A and B</xref>) in order to compensate for central fatigue.</p><p>Recently, we reported that after a fatigue-inducing maximum handgrip session, while the level of the motor movement-evoked MEG response in M1 was decreased, that in the ipsilateral area was increased, and activation levels in the contralateral and ipsilateral M1 were both positively associated with those in the dorsolateral prefrontal area <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex alters motor output from M1 <xref rid="pone.0080731-Kolb1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080731-Narayanan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and the endurance to carry out a physical task (duration) was related to activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0080731-Dettmers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, this brain area may attempt to compensate for the loss of the force-generating ability of fatiguing muscles and even compete with the inhibitory input to the sensorimotor area by recruiting the descending motor output <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, by driving the motor cortex, was reported to constitute a brain pathway that allows emotional arousal to facilitate physical effort <xref rid="pone.0080731-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we did not show that this brain is involved in the neural substrates of the facilitation system, maybe because of methodological differences.</p><p>There are four limitations to our study. First, we performed our study with a limited number of participants. To generalize our results, studies involving a large number of participants are essential. Second, it was difficult to assess the neural activities of the brain regions located deeply by using MEG. Therefore, some brain regions involved in the neural substrates of facilitation system might be missed because of the limitations of MEG. For example, the basal ganglia and orbitofrontal cortex are considered to be associated with the facilitation system under the condition of physical fatigue <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080731-Dettmers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080731-Korotkov1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka5" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Future studies using other neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, would address this limitation. Third, the possibility that the difference in imagery of maximum handgrips between the motivation and control sessions represents imagery of strong vs. weak force production rather than the additional recruitment of the facilitation system. Forth, it is impossible to conclude with certainty from our results that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the neural substrates of the facilitation system and activates the sensorimotor areas to overcome central fatigue. Causal data analyses linking brain activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with activity in the sensorimotor areas would be necessary to draw this conclusion.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the neural substrates of the facilitation system and increases motor output of the contralateral M1 through activation of the sensorimotor areas during physical fatigue. Dysfunction of the facilitation system has been considered to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of motor-related chronic fatigue in multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome, and this dysfunction may be a common feature of motor-related fatigue in human diseases or syndromes <xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka5" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080731-Tanaka7" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our findings provide new perspectives on the neural mechanisms underlying physical fatigue as well as on the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue in human diseases or syndromes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Forte Science Communications for editorial help with the manuscript and Manryoukai Imaging Clinic for MRI scans.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0080731-Chaudhuri1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
