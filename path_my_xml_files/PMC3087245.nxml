Various drugs through different routes have been tried to produce adequate analgesia in patients after surgery. Gabapentin is a new drug with minimal side-effects which has been used for post-operative analgesia.</p><p>Demographic variables were comparable among all the four Groups. The duration of surgery and anaesthesia were also comparable among all the four Groups (P&#x0003e;0.05). Fassoulaki and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> did not observe any difference in time of first rescue analgesic consumption after pre-operative administration of 1200mg of oral Gabapentin but on the contrary Turan and associates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> found a highly significant difference between the Gabapentin and Placebo Groups. In the present study, we also observed a very highly significant difference in the time of first rescue analgesic consumption in patients who consumed Gabapentin (Group 3) and combination of Gabapentin with Acetaminophen (Group 4) in comparison to patients who consumed Placebo / Acetaminophen. There was no statistical difference in the time of first rescue analgesic consumption in patients who consumed Acetaminophen or Placebo. But when Acetaminophen was combined with Gabapentin (Group 4), the time of first rescue analgesic consumption was higher in comparison to the patients who consumed Gabapentin alone (Group 3) which indicates that Gabapentin might have potentiated the analgesic effect of Acetaminophen. Similar effect was seen in few studies where the effect of Rofecoxib<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> and Morphine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> was enhanced by Gabapentin.</p><p>The difference in the number of rescue analgesic consumption was very significantly reduced in patients who consumed Gabapentin (Group 3) and the combination of Gabapentin with Acetaminophen (Group 4) in comparison to patients who did not consume Gabapentin. Similar results were observed in patients of ear-nose-throat surgery in a study conducted by Turan and associates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>. In the present study Gabapentin and Acetaminophen combination (Group 4) reduced the total analgesic requirement (Tramadol) by 51% in comparison to the control Group (P&#x0003c;0.001) and 48% in comparison to Acetaminophen Group (P&#x0003c;0.001). Similarly Gabapentin alone (Group 3) also reduced the Tramadol requirement by 48% on comparison with the control Group (P&#x0003c;0.001) and 44% in comparison to Acetaminophen Group (P&#x0003c;0.001). The difference in total rescue analgesic consumption noticed by addition of Acetaminophen to Gabapentin on comparison to Gabapentin alone was statistically found to be insignificant during first 24 hours post-operatively which could be because of short half life of acetaminophen of just 2-3 hours and a weak anti-inflammatory action.</p><p>Similar reduction in post-operative total rescue analgesic consumption by 32% to 62% was noticed in various research works on post-operative analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>. On the other hand Fassoulaki and associates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> found no reduction in analgesic requirement during first 24 hours of breast surgery for cancer but it was decreased from second to tenth day.</p><p>In the present study, patients who consumed Gabapentin alone (Group 3) had lower VAS scores at rest (VAS-R) and on movement (VAS-M) at all time intervals in comparison to the Placebo Group (Group 1). Similarly patients who consumed Gabapentin along with Acetaminophen (Group 4) had lower VAS scores at rest and on movement at all time intervals in comparison to the Placebo Group. Patients who consumed Gabapentin alone had lower VAS scores at all time intervals in comparison to the patients who consumed Acetaminophen alone (Group 2) but the difference in VAS-R was statistically significant only at 0, 1, 2 and 24 hours post-operatively while VAS-M was statistically significant at all time intervals except at 6 hours.</p><p>Similarly patients who consumed Gabapentin along with Acetaminophen had lower VAS scores at all time intervals in comparison to the patients who consumed Acetaminophen alone but the difference was statistically significant only at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 24 hours post-operatively. Patients who had Gabapentin along with Acetaminophen had lower VAS score at all time gaps except at 6, 8 and 12 hours for VAS-R and at 8 hours for VAS-M in comparison to the patients who consumed Gabapentin alone but this difference was statistically insignificant.</p><p>In discectomy/spinal fusion surgery, Turan and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> noticed a reduction in pain scores during 1, 2 and 4 hours in patients of Gabapentin (1200mg one hour prior to surgery) Group. But Pandey and co-workers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> found a reduction in pain scores up to 24 hours post-operatively with a smaller dose of 300 mg of Gabapentin given two hours before lumbar discoidectomy.</p><p>On the contrary, Radhakrishnan and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> found no reduction in pain scores for eight hours post-operatively in patients who underwent lumbar laminectomy and discectomy after two divided doses of Gabapentin of 800mg in comparison to Placebo. The results of all the above mentioned studies in a similar pain model are contradictory.</p><p>Patients who consumed Gabapentin (Group 3 and Group 4) did not have much difference in pain intensity at rest in comparison to pain on movement at any time during 20 hours post-operatively while it was significant at 24 hours. Statistically insignificant difference in pain at rest and on movement (less pain on movement) signifies the potent effect of Gabapentin on post-operative pain.</p><p>Patients who consumed Acetaminophen had significant or highly significant difference in pain scores at rest on comparison with pain scores on movement except at 0 hours. The inability of acetaminophen to decrease post-operative pain on movement reveals its weak anti-inflammatory action. Similar effect on post-operative pain on activity was noticed in various research works<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>. But Fassoulaki and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> found reduction in pain on movement only from second to fifth day following breast surgery for cancer.</p><p>In the present study, the main side-effect that was noticed as a result of consumption of Gabapentin was post-operative nausea / vomiting. Incidence of PONV in patients who consumed Gabapentin was 36.66% higher than the patients who were given Acetaminophen / placebo (P&#x0003c;0.001). Use of tramadol as rescue analgesic in the present study might have increased the incidence of PONV. Similar statistically significant increase in the incidence of PONV was also noticed in few studies of post-operative analgesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></p><p>Sedation was discovered to be another major drawback due to consumption of Gabapentin. A significantly high number of patients (100%) in Group 3 and Group 4 (patients who consumed Gabapentin) had sedation of level 4, 5 or 6 in comparison to 65.52% patients in Group 1 and 73.33% patients in Group 2 (patients who did not consume Gabapentin).</p><p>Similar increase in level of sedation as a result of administration of Gabapentin was noticed in some research works of post-operative analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr"

demonstrated that it may be possible to protect the patient and the patient's nociceptive system, from the negative effects of noxious stimuli by protective premedication with combination of various
