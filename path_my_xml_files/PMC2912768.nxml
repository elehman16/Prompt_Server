The problem is greatest in sub-Saharan Africa, where infection with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the most virulent human malaria parasite, is responsible for hundreds of millions of illnesses and about one million deaths each year <xref rid="pone.0011759-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Recent advances have led to some optimism regarding the control of malaria, and there have been documented decreases in malarial incidence in a number of parts of Africa <xref rid="pone.0011759-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0011759-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the problem remains great, with little improvement in much of Africa, and improved malaria control interventions are needed. One important component of malaria control is the prompt administration of highly effective therapies to those ill with malaria. With increasing resistance to older therapies, current WHO recommendations call for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Africa with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Multiple studies have shown excellent efficacy for the two widely advocated ACTs for Africa, artesunate/amodiaquine (AS/AQ) and artemether/lumefantrine (AL) <xref rid="pone.0011759-Mutabingwa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0011759-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, the non-ACT combination regimen amodiaquine/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has shown good antimalarial efficacy in many <xref rid="pone.0011759-Staedke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0011759-Zwang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but not all <xref rid="pone.0011759-Mutabingwa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011759-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> trials in Africa, and is recommended by the WHO as an alternative therapy for malaria when ACTs are unavailable.</p><p>The epidemiology of malaria varies greatly across Africa, with large variations in transmission intensity and both seasonal and year-round transmission in different areas. The greater the transmission intensity, the more rapidly humans acquire the partial immunity to malaria that allows older children and adults to be relatively spared from malarial incidence and risks of severe malaria. Thus, in high transmission areas children acquire effective immunity over the first few years of life, and malarial illness is uncommon in older children and adults. In areas with lower levels of transmission, including many cities, the acquisition of immunity occurs more slowly. The level of immunity in a population directly impacts upon responses to antimalarial therapies, especially in the context of sub-optimal treatments, as the immune response plays an important role in control of infection, and there is a clear correlation between transmission intensity, level of antimalarial immunity, and response to therapy with partially effective agents <xref rid="pone.0011759-Djimde1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0011759-Francis1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>We studied the comparative efficacy of 3 antimalarial combination therapies in an urban cohort of children in Kampala, a city with a level of malaria transmission that is relatively low for sub-Saharan Africa. An interim analysis identified a clear rank-order of treatment efficacy (AL &#x0003e; AS/AQ &#x0003e; AQ/SP) <xref rid="pone.0011759-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Malarial incidence was heterogeneous, and associated with host genetics, use of bednets, and distance of a child's residence from a mosquito breeding site <xref rid="pone.0011759-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The efficacy of AQ/SP diminished over time, but this change appeared to be due to changes in host immunity rather than increasing parasite resistance to the components of AQ/SP <xref rid="pone.0011759-Greenhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We now present a final evaluation of the relative efficacies of the 3 combination antimalarial therapies, changes in the prevalence of malarial parasitemia and incidence of malaria over time, and other clinical features in this urban cohort of Ugandan children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011759.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011759.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Enrollment of cohort</title><p>A detailed description of the cohort has been published previously <xref rid="pone.0011759-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The study was conducted in the Mulago III parish of Kampala, where malaria is reportedly mesoendemic, occurring throughout the year, with peaks during and after the two rainy seasons. A census was carried out from July to October 2004, enumerating a population of 16,172 <xref rid="pone.0011759-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. All children from randomly selected households were screened for enrollment. Enrollment took place between November 2004 and April 2005 and again from January&#x02013;May 2007 to enroll younger children from study households who had reached an eligible age. Eligibility criteria were: age 1 to 10 years, agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile episode or illness, agreement to avoid medications administered outside the study, agreement to remain in Kampala during the study period, no known adverse reactions to the study medications, weight 10 kg or more, absence of severe malnutrition or known serious chronic disease, absence of life threatening screening laboratory results, and willingness of parent or guardian to provide written informed consent. Children with symptomatic malaria on the day of screening were treated with quinine and enrolled only after documentation of a negative blood smear 7 days after initiation of therapy. The study received ethical approval from the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, the Makerere University Research and Ethics Committee, and the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Follow-up of study participants</title><p>Parents and guardians were asked to bring their children to the study clinic for all medical care. The clinic was open daily from 8 AM to 5 PM, and after-hours care was available. Participants who presented with new medical problems underwent a standardized evaluation. Malaria was diagnosed if a child had complicated malaria (presence of severe malaria or danger signs <xref rid="pone.0011759-World1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) or fever (documented tympanic temperature 38.0&#x000b0;C or history of fever in the previous 24 hours) and any parasitemia. Children underwent routine clinical assessment at least monthly. Blood smears were performed monthly until April 2006, and every 3 months thereafter. Asymptomatic parasitemia was not treated. Medications with antimalarial activity were avoided for the treatment of nonmalarial illnesses if possible.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Treatment allocation and study drug administration</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 oral regimens at their first episode of uncomplicated malaria and then for all subsequent episodes diagnosed during the study. Study medications were administered by the nurses according to modified WHO recommendations for weight-based administration of fractions of tablets. The regimens were: AQ/SP (AQ, 10 mg/kg on the first 2 days and 5 mg/kg on the third day; sulfadoxine, 25 mg/kg and pyrimethamine, 1.25 mg/kg on the first day); AS/AQ (AQ as above and artesunate, 4 mg/kg on all 3 days); and artemether 20 mg/lumefantrine 120 mg twice daily for 3 days (5 through 14 kg, 1 tablet; 15 through 24 kg, 2 tablets; and 25 through 34 kg, 3 tablets per dose). Administration of first daily doses were directly observed by study nurses; second daily doses of medication or placebo (for AQ/SP and AS/AQ arms) were given to the parents or guardians to administer in the evening. All study personnel involved in outcome assessment were blinded to treatment allocation. Study participants and their caregivers were not informed of their assigned treatment regimens. Placebos were administered to match the twice-daily schedule of AL. However, because the study drugs were not identical in appearance and taste, the study was considered single-blind. After treatment in the clinic, patients were observed for 30 minutes and the dose was readministered if vomiting occurred. Patients who vomited persistently were referred for treatment with parenteral quinine. Participants with severe malaria or danger signs were also treated with quinine. The AQ/SP treatment arm was discontinued in March 2007 after our interim analysis demonstrated inferior efficacy <xref rid="pone.0011759-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and children in this arm were randomized to one of the other two arms. The AS/AQ arm was discontinued in January 2008 due to loss of availability of the study formulation of AS, and children in this arm were moved to the AL arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Follow-up and outcome classification</title><p>Participants diagnosed with malaria were asked to return on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 or any other day they felt ill. Follow-up evaluation consisted of a standardized medical history and physical examination. Blood was obtained by finger prick for thick blood smears and storage on filter paper on all follow-up days, except day 1. Treatment outcomes were classified according to 2005 WHO guidelines; for this analysis all failures (early treatment failure, late clinical failure, and late parasitological failure) were combined. Patients with failure within 14 days of initiation of therapy were treated with quinine (10 mg/kg three times a day for 7 days, unsupervised), beginning a new 28-day follow-up schedule. Symptomatic malaria diagnosed more than 14 days after a previous episode was managed according to the study protocol.

All participants were from randomly selected households in the Mulago III parish of Kampala <xref rid="pone.0011759-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The second period of enrollment included only children from households already taking part in the study, to include younger children who had reached an eligible age since the initial period of enrollment. Characteristics of study participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011759-t001">table 1</xref>. Of these, 209 children were withdrawn before the end of study follow-up in December 2008 for the following reasons: movement out of study area (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;110), inability to locate participant after 60 consecutive days (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;61), withdrawal of informed consent (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22), inability to comply with the study procedures (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3), serious adverse event due to study medication (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1), and diagnosis of serious chronic disease requiring frequent medical care (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12). The percentage of participants lost to follow-up was similar during each year of the study (7.8&#x00025; to 9.5&#x00025; per year), and it did not differ between treatment arms. A total of 481 (69.7&#x00025;) children completed the study in December 2008.

Our study design included ready access to care for all medical problems. Thus, treatment outside of our study protocol was very uncommon, and we obtained accurate measures of malarial incidence and antimalarial drug efficacy. Children were randomized to one of 3 combination regimens with the first episode of uncomplicated malaria, and we subsequently followed them through up to 30 episodes of malaria. Although further comparisons were limited due to the sequential drop-out of two treatment arms, our results add to our interim analysis <xref rid="pone.0011759-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, showing a clear rank order in the efficacy of our combination treatment arms. In addition, our study offered important insights into the incidence of malaria in Kampala in the context of high quality health care. With available prompt therapy for each episode of malaria and adoption of ITNs, study children experienced remarkable decreases in the prevalence of malarial parasitemia and incidence of malaria over time, and no episodes of severe malaria and no deaths were seen.</p><p>Additional efficacy comparisons beyond those previously reported were limited by our need to eliminate the AQ/SP treatment arm due to inferior efficacy in 2007 and the AS/AQ arm when the study formulation of AS was no longer available in early 2008. Consistent with earlier analyses, both ACTs demonstrated excellent efficacy, but AL was superior to AS/AQ <xref rid="pone.0011759-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This result is not surprising, as AQ resistance is fairly common in East Africa, and AS/AQ was also inferior to AL in studies from Tanzania <xref rid="pone.0011759-Mutabingwa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0011759-Martensson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Republic of Congo <xref rid="pone.0011759-vandenBroek1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our results and others suggest that, at least for East Africa, AL is a more appropriate choice than AS/AQ for the treatment of malaria.</p><p>We identified remarkable decreases in the incidence of malaria and the prevalences of asymptomatic malarial parasitemia and anemia over the course of our 4 year study. Undoubtedly, these decreases were due to multiple factors. First, a decrease in malarial incidence is expected with increasing age, although in this area of relatively low malaria transmission, changes in incidence with age were modest <xref rid="pone.0011759-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Second, we provided ITNs to all study participants in mid-2006. Third, the highly efficacious ACT AL became the standard therapy for uncomplicated malaria in Uganda in 2006. Although AL distribution was limited in Kampala, its use presumably contributed to decreased malaria transmission. Indeed, due to malaria control measures including ITNs and improved therapies, the incidence of malaria has been documented to decrease in some other areas of Africa <xref rid="pone.0011759-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0011759-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A fourth factor contributing to the dramatic decrease in malarial incidence in our cohort was likely the prompt provision of effective therapy for each episode of malaria. With prompt effective therapy, children were rapidly cured, recrudescences leading to recurrent illness were uncommon, and progression to severe malaria was eliminated. Although interpretations are complex due to multiple changing factors, our results offer support for ready availability of ACTs for the treatment of malaria as a critical component of malaria control efforts.</p><p>The most ominous feature of falciparum malaria is progression to severe malaria, with subsequent high mortality. It seems likely that prompt evaluation of febrile illnesses and prompt therapy for all illnesses diagnosed as malaria will decrease the incidence of severe malaria. In our study 1464 episodes of malaria were seen, 21 were complicated, mostly due to single seizures soon after presentation, and no episodes of severe malaria and no deaths were seen. These results further support emphasis on availability of prompt effective therapy for those with malaria as a key control strategy.</p><p>It is useful to consider our results from a cohort of children in Kampala in the context of current malaria control efforts across Africa. Resources for malaria control have increased greatly in recent years, and initial gains in control have been seen, with marked decreases in malarial parasitemia and incidence in some areas. At the same time, many areas of Africa continue to have very high levels of malaria transmission and disease incidence. Our results suggest that, in an area of intermediate transmission, prompt therapy with effective agents greatly limits progression to severe disease or death. Thus, distribution of new effective therapies across Africa is a critical priority. Nonetheless, with prompt and effective therapy the incidence of malaria, although decreased, remained quite high in our cohort, and so additional control measures, including ITNs, rational use of insecticides, and, when available, an effective vaccine, are also needed for control of malaria in Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0011759.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(1.12 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0011759.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0011759.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0011759.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank study participants, their parents and guardians, and all members of the study team in Kampala.
