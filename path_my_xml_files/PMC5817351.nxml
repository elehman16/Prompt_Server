Clusters were randomly allocated to receive the intervention (a comprehensive radio campaign) or control group (no radio media campaign). Household surveys were performed at baseline (from December, 2011, to February, 2012), midline (in November, 2013, and after 20 months of campaigning), and endline (from November, 2014, to March, 2015, after 32 months of campaigning). Primary analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis, based on cluster-level summaries and adjusted for imbalances between groups at baseline. The primary outcome was all-cause post-neonatal under-5 child mortality. The trial was designed to detect a 20% reduction in the primary outcome with a power of 80%. Routine data from health facilities were also analysed for evidence of changes in use and these data had high statistical power. The indicators measured were new antenatal care attendances, facility deliveries, and under-5 consultations.

The average number of villages included per cluster was 34 in the control group and 29 in the intervention group. 2269 (82%) of 2784 women in the intervention group reported recognising the campaign's radio spots at endline. Post-neonatal under-5 child mortality decreased from 93&#x000b7;3 to 58&#x000b7;5 per 1000 livebirths in the control group and from 125&#x000b7;1 to 85&#x000b7;1 per 1000 livebirths in the intervention group. There was no evidence of an intervention effect (risk ratio 1&#x000b7;00, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;82&#x02013;1&#x000b7;22; p&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;999). In the first year of the intervention, under-5 consultations increased from 68&#x02008;681 to 83&#x02008;022 in the control group and from 79&#x02008;852 to 111&#x02008;758 in the intervention group. The intervention effect using interrupted time-series analysis was 35% (95% CI 20&#x02013;51; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). New antenatal care attendances decreased from 13&#x02008;129 to 12&#x02008;997 in the control group and increased from 19&#x02008;658 to 20&#x02008;202 in the intervention group in the first year (intervention effect 6%, 95% CI 2&#x02013;10; p=0&#x000b7;004). Deliveries in health facilities decreased from 10&#x02008;598 to 10&#x02008;533 in the control group and increased from 12&#x02008;155 to 12&#x02008;902 in the intervention group in the first year (intervention effect 7%, 95% CI 2&#x02013;11; p=0&#x000b7;004).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>A comprehensive radio campaign had no detectable effect on child mortality.

However, it has been acknowledged that behaviour change has an important part to play in enhancing child survival in low-income and middle-income countries.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p id="para20"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para30"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para40">Four reviews, done before this study, concluded that targeted, well executed mass media campaigns can have small to moderate effects not only on health knowledge, beliefs and attitudes, but on behaviours as well (Grilli et al, 2001; Hornick, 2002; Noar, 2006; Bala et al, 2008). However, much of the evidence for an effect comes from non-randomised designs and the limited number of randomised studies that have been reported have often failed to demonstrate an effect. Hornick (2002) has suggested that in many of the randomised trials the exposure to the media was too small to result in an effect. Development Media International's (DMI) experiences in delivering mass media campaign corroborate this crucial implementation principle and indicate that implementation at sufficient scale and intensity is the most important (Head et al, 2015). However, evaluations of the DMI's Saturation+ approach, prior to this study, relied on pre-post designs and on self-reported knowledge or behaviours only. Using the Lives Saved Tool, DMI predicted that a sustained, comprehensive campaign of sufficient scale and intensity could reduce under-5 mortality by between 16% and 23% during the third and subsequent years of campaigning through increases in coverage of key life-saving interventions (Head et al, 2015).</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">To our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to conduct a randomised controlled trial to test the effect of mass media on a health outcome in a low-income country. From March, 2012, to January, 2015, DMI implemented a comprehensive, high intensity radio campaign to address key family behaviours for improving under-5 child survival in Burkina Faso. Using a repeated cross-sectional, cluster-randomised design, we report on the effect of the campaign on child mortality and family behaviours after 32 months of campaigning.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">The available evidence supports the view that mass media campaigns can lead to changes in some behaviours linked to child survival. However, some behaviours are likely to be less amenable to change than others. Furthermore, that some mass media campaigns can produce changes in behaviour should not be interpreted as meaning that any and every mass media campaign can change behaviour. The &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; delivered and received by the target audience as well as the quality of the messages are likely to be key determinants of the effectiveness of any campaign. These findings have important policy implications, suggesting that saturation-based media campaigns should be prioritised by governments and belong in the mainstream of public health interventions.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">Behaviour change interventions encompass a wide range of approaches including interpersonal-based, community-based, media, and social marketing approaches. Compared with other approaches, mass media campaigns have the potential to reach a large audience at relatively low cost. A recent review of evaluations of mass media interventions for child-survival-related behaviours done between 1960 and 2013 in low-income and middle-income countries concluded that so-called media-centric campaigns can positively affect a wide range of child health behaviours.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Of the 32 evaluations that relied on moderate to stronger designs, all but six were reported to show some positive effects on behaviours. However, the researchers acknowledged likely publication bias towards successful campaigns. Additionally, all but six evaluated programmes included interpersonal communication components or implementation of community-based activities, but none could disentangle the effect of different components. To our knowledge, there have been no attempts to do a randomised controlled trial to test the effect of mass media on any health outcome in a low-income country.</p><p id="para100">From March, 2012, to January, 2015, Development Media International (DMI) implemented a comprehensive radio campaign to address key family behaviours for improving under-5 child survival in Burkina Faso.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In 2010, Burkina Faso ranked 161 of 169 countries in United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Index with 44% of the population living below the poverty line and 77% living in rural areas.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The under-5 mortality rate was high, estimated at approximately 114 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2010, with malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhoea the leading causes of child death.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Burkina Faso was chosen both for its high child mortality before the campaign and its unique media landscape (community FM radio stations with limited transmission range and relatively high listenership in rural areas but very limited national radio listenership).

For evaluation purposes, clusters around each radio station were identified using the last national census to provide an evaluation population of about 40&#x02008;000 inhabitants per cluster. We included villages located around the selected community radio station, with a good radio signal but limited access to television (and thus more likely to listen to the radio). We did this by excluding communities likely to be served by the electricity grid&#x02014;ie, the towns from which the selected radio stations were broadcast, villages within 5 km of these towns, other villages with electricity or with a population larger than 5000 inhabitants (and likely to be a priority for the national electrification programme).</p><p id="para130">Seven clusters were then randomly allocated to receive the intervention or control using pair-matched randomisation based on geography and radio listenership (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Specifically, we defined three radio listenership strata (61&#x02013;70%, 71&#x02013;80%, and &#x0003e;80%), and within each stratum we paired the areas geographically closest with each other, one of which was randomly assigned to receive the intervention. Randomisation was done by SS and SC, independently of DMI. The randomisation sequence was generated using computer-generated random numbers (Stata version 13). Because of time constraints, randomisation was done before the baseline survey. The nature of the intervention precluded formal masking of respondents and interviewers. The average number of villages included per cluster was 34 in the control group and 29 in the intervention group. In all clusters the government was the main health service provider and, with the exception of Kantchari (intervention cluster), a regional or district hospital was located in the town with the community radio station. The trial population also had access to primary health facilities in villages across each cluster.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pair-matched randomisation based on geography and radio penetration rate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Interventions</title><p id="para140">DMI's radio campaign launched in March, 2012, and ended in January, 2015.

This finding comes against a background of rapidly decreasing mortality in both groups, which will have reduced our power to detect an effect on mortality (set at 80% to detect a 20% reduction in mortality). The decrease in mortality we recorded is broadly consistent with estimates for Burkina Faso as a whole from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.childmortality.org" id="interrefs40">UN Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME)</ext-link>. Recent improvements in child survival could reflect changes in national health policies, in particular two rounds of free national distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (2010 and 2013), and the addition of the pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines to the expanded programme for immunisation in 2013. However, routine health facility data did provide evidence of increased utilisation of health services in intervention clusters relative to control clusters, especially with respect to care seeking for childhood illness. Self-reported behaviours might have been over-reported due to socially desirable bias, especially in the intervention group as a consequence of DMI's campaign itself. Nevertheless, we observed some evidence of improved care seeking and treatment in the midline survey.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Although no overall difference was apparent at the endline survey, the survey data are consistent with increased care seeking among families living within up to 5 km of a facility, with no effect at greater distances.</p><p id="para450">With only a limited number of clusters available, a major limitation of our trial is that, despite randomisation, important differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline were not unlikely.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The use of pre-intervention mortality estimated at baseline survey was precluded by the intervention timeframe, and we therefore used a pair-matched randomisation procedure based on geography and estimated radio listenership. Nevertheless, intervention communities had a different ethnic and religious mix, tended to live further away from health facilities, and experienced higher mortality than the control communities. We generated a confounder score to account for imbalance between groups, but cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding. Furthermore, contamination of one of the control areas occurred due to an increase in the strength of the transmission signal of the neighbouring radio partner, above that permitted by the national authorities. However, excluding women living in villages where contamination occurred had little effect on the results (data not shown).</p><p id="para460">The DMI campaign seems to have reached a high proportion of the primary target population as a high proportion of mothers interviewed in the intervention group reported recognising DMI's spots and listening to the long format programmes. One in five women in the control clusters also reported recognising the spots or long format programme. Excluding the control cluster in which contamination occurred, only a few women mentioned one of DMI's radio partners when asked on which radio station they listened to these broadcasts, which could suggest courtesy bias or confusion with other radio programmes.</p><p id="para470">In interpreting these results it should be considered that our survey data are likely to have much lower power than the facility data to detect a change in care seeking. While the survey data include 1000 or fewer sick children per group, the facility data record tens of thousands of consultations. However, both sources of data are prone to errors. Retrospective reporting of illness episodes and care seeking in surveys is known to have important limitations. We used a recall period of 2 weeks, as used in DHS, but it has been shown that recall of disease episodes tends to decline after a few days,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> as well as reporting of clinic visits.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Thus, our population-based surveys almost certainly missed some episodes of recent illness. However, the routine facility records might also be subject to recording errors and come without precise and up-to-date denominator data. The population of Burkina Faso is estimated to be increasing by about 3% per year<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and it is therefore likely that the under-5 child population served by the facilities for which we have data was increasing over time. Interpretation of the observed differences between intervention and control groups as being attributable to the intervention requires the assumption that any increases in the underlying populations served by the facilities were of similar magnitude in both groups (or smaller in the intervention group). However, we have no reason to believe that population growth differed between groups.</p><p id="para480">The facility data suggest a large increase in under-5 consultations in the intervention group in the first year of the intervention. The estimated impacts in subsequent years are smaller. While this apparent decline could be a chance finding, it might reflect attenuation in the effect of the intervention. In Burkina Faso, in-depth interviews with health workers and patients have revealed low satisfaction with the quality of care in public facilities.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The low use of and dissatisfaction with community-based insurance in northwest Burkina Faso has been attributed, in part, to the suboptimal quality of care provided, including poor health worker attitudes and behaviours.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In the same area, Mugisha and colleagues found that, while many factors influence initiation of the demand for services, only perceived quality of care predicted &#x0201c;retention&#x0201d; in modern health-care services.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> They concluded that increasing patient initiation and patient retention require different interventions and that the latter should focus on improving the perceived quality of care. A possible, admittedly speculative, explanation for our findings is that women were initially encouraged by the campaign to take their children to a facility, but that poor perceived quality of care may have discouraged some from returning for subsequent illnesses.</p><p id="para490">Our findings showed no effect of the campaign on self-reported habitual behaviours, such as child feeding practices, handwashing, and child stool disposal practices. The campaign's broadcasts were heavily weighted to care seeking rather than home-based behaviours, and as we have discussed previously, it might be harder to achieve sustained changes in habitual behaviours that need to be performed daily with little obvious immediate benefit, than for behaviours that are only performed occasionally and for which some immediate benefit may be perceived.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The confidence intervals for the effect of the intervention on habitual behaviours are wide and do not preclude modest but important changes in these behaviours.</p><p id="para500">While we detected evidence that the intervention was associated with an increase in care-seeking in facilities we did not detect any evidence of a reduction in mortality. There are several possible explanations for this apparent inconsistency. First, our mortality data do not exclude the possibility of an impact on mortality with the lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the mortality risk ratio compatible with an important reduction in mortality. The impact of the campaign on child mortality has been modelled using the Lives Saved Tool and showed an estimated 8% reduction in the first year, and 5% reduction in the second and third years (unpublished data). In addition, mortality at baseline differed between the two groups despite randomisation. Although we adjusted for pre-intervention mortality risk and a confounder score, which performed reasonably well in explaining the baseline mortality imbalance, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding which might have masked an intervention effect. Second, while the numbers of consultations with diagnoses of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea, three of the leading causes of child death in Burkina Faso, all increased (unpublished data), we have no data on the severity of the episodes for which children were taken to facilities. If most of the increase in consultations was due to children with mild self-limiting illness, then limited impact on mortality might be expected. In some parts of Burkina Faso a preference for traditional care has been reported for some severe manifestations of illness, such as cerebral malaria.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Third, if the quality of care received at the facility was low, this could limit any mortality reduction through increased care seeking. An evaluation of the quality of care at health facilities for children under-5, conducted in 2011 in two regions in the north of Burkina Faso, found that on average only six of ten tasks that should be performed as part of IMCI were performed.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Only 28% of children were checked for three danger signs, and 40% of children judged to require referral by an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness expert were referred by the health worker. In addition, the 2010 DHS indicated that among children in rural areas who were taken to a public primary health facility, 54% of those with fever received an antimalarial, 35% of those with diarrhoea received oral rehydration solution, and 77% of those with cough and fast or difficult breathing received an antibiotic. Fourth, mortality data were collected by interviewing women about their pregnancy histories. Such data are subject to measurement errors. We did a number of checks on the data, similar to those routinely performed by DHS. Apart from heaping of deaths at age 12 months, which occurred to a similar degree in both groups and should not have affected the under-5 (post-neonatal) mortality estimates, these analyses did not identify any major concerns. The cluster-level estimates of mortality risk at baseline correlated well with subnational estimates from the 2010 DHS and the time trend in mortality is broadly consistent with that estimated by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.</p><p id="para510">In summary, there is evidence that DMI's campaign led to increased use of health facilities, especially by sick children. However, we noted no effect of the campaign on child mortality. The small number of clusters available for randomisation together with the substantial between-cluster heterogeneity at baseline, and rapidly decreasing mortality, limited the power of the study to detect modest changes in behaviour or mortality. Caution should be exercised in interpreting these results since, despite randomisation, there were important differences between intervention and control clusters at baseline. Nevertheless, this study provides some of the best evidence available that a mass media campaign alone can increase health facility utilisation for maternal and child health in a low-income, rural setting.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
