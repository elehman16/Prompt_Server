It is initiated by an array of complex microorganisms as well as by the susceptibility of the individual to their action. Various systemic factors, diabetes mellitus being the most common of them, help in aggravating this complex pathology.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is common knowledge that there is a two-way relationship between periodontal disease and diabetes. Diabetes influences the progression of periodontitis, and it is considered as the sixth major complication of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Poor glycemic control leads to worsened periodontal condition and vice versa. Nonsurgical therapy of periodontal disease has shown to improve the glycemic status of diabetic individuals.</p><p>Many herbal antidiabetic products are used for the treatment of diabetes in India. One such product which is most widely used as an oral insulin substitute for treating diabetes is fenugreek seeds (<italic>Trigonella foenum-graecum</italic>). The beneficiary effect of dietary fibers in the management of diabetes has been well recognized. Fenugreek seeds have been shown to have both antidiabetic and antilipidemic properties [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and are commonly used as an ingredient in the food for maintaining the blood sugar level in Asia, especially in India.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] These seeds are rich in 4-hydroxyisoleucine, saponins, trigonelline, diosgenin, and soluble fibers.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Fenugreek seeds possess galactomannan. These are rich in soluble fibers, and it helps in reducing blood sugar level by paring down the digestive process and inhibiting the absorption of carbohydrates. Fenugreek can be used either in powder or in the form of extract for therapeutic use. Therefore, there has been a greater source of awareness of the antidiabetic properties of fenugreek. These seeds are also rich in minerals such as iron, potassium, calcium, copper, zinc, selenium, magnesium, and manganese. Many human and animal trials have shown the antidiabetic and hypolipidemic effect of oral fenugreek powder.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This study was also done to observe the hypolipidemic effect of fenugreek powder along with metformin in comparison with metformin alone after nonsurgical periodontal therapy.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Mechanism of action</title><p>There are several reasons behind the antidiabetic effects of fenugreek. It is credited mainly to galactomannan and 4-hydroxyisoleucine (4-OH-Ile). 4-OH-Ile is a natural nonproteinogenic amino acid possessing noninsulinotropic activity, which has a direct effect on the individual islets of Langerhans causing increased glucose-induced release of insulin.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Studies done on human trial shows that fenugreek increased the number of insulin receptors and reduced the area under the plasma glucose curve.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Glucose-dependent insulin from pancreatic beta-cells is stimulated by the hypoglycemic effects of fenugreek, and also, it inhibits the activities of two intestinal enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, namely, alpha-amylase and sucrase.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] These seeds also lower serum triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). This effect may be due to sapogenins, which also increases biliary cholesterol excretion, ultimately leading to reduced serum cholesterol levels.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The impact of fenugreek on lowering the levels of serum lipids can be credited to its estrogenic constituent, by boosting the thyroid hormone T4 indirectly.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were randomly selected from the outpatient clinic of the department of periodontics, Chennai.

Collection of blood samples was also done for all the patients after an overnight fasting of minimum 10 h at baseline and 1 month after treatment. After documenting the periodontal status, patients were informed about the oral hygiene instructions and received full-mouth nonsurgical periodontal therapy with the administration of local anesthesia. Group 1 patients were advised to take their regular treatment protocol, that is, metformin tablets 500 mg twice a day, as per the instruction of the physician. A pilot study was done, and 25 g of fenugreek powder was standardized per day for the Group 2 patients. Group 2 patients were dispensed with fenugreek powder in a container and were advised to take 12.5 g two times daily before breakfast and lunch along with the regular metformin tablets. These patients were given a measuring cup and a chart with instructions to be followed until the next visit. Patients were asked to report once a week to check if they are consuming the fenugreek powder properly. After the periodontal treatment, patients were advised to maintain their oral hygiene with proper brushing and flossing technique. During this experimental period, patients were asked about alteration in medications concerned with diabetic treatment, use of any antibiotic or anti-inflammatory drugs, and change in lifestyle, along with exercise and diet.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Collection of blood samples was done in the morning after fasting for minimum 10 h the previous night.

It is a well-known fact that periodontal disease is more severe in diabetic than in nondiabetic participants. The chronic challenge of the periodontal pathogens may provide a constant source of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may be associated with two factors: poor glycemic control and an increased tissue insulin resistance.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] These cytokines play an important role in the diabetic pathway. This, in turn, has a direct impact on the alleviation of the disease. There are multiple abnormalities in NIDDM such as insulin resistance, lipid abnormalities, and endothelial dysfunction.</p><p>In this current study, there was a statistical significance observed in all the clinical parameters on intragroup comparison. When intergroup comparison was done, there was a statistical significance seen only in plaque index. Nonsurgical periodontal treatment helps to reduce the microbial load, thereby showing improvement in glycemic control. There is an unmistakable link between diabetes and periodontitis, both being chronic in nature. CALs in diabetic patients are significantly higher than in nondiabetic patients. Studies done by Grossi <italic>et al</italic>. have revealed that diabetics are twice more prone to clinical attachment loss than nondiabetic.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A study by Bridges <italic>et al</italic>. revealed the fact that the disease invades into all the periodontal parameters. Fenugreek seeds stimulate insulin secretion and produce a hypoglycemic effect. Therefore, a considerable improvement in glycemic control helps to improve the periodontal parameters significantly. The improvement in all the clinical parameters in this study was similar to a study done by Rodrigues <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In our study, when intragroup comparison was done, there was a reduction in the FBS and HbA1c values when compared with the baseline values in both the groups. When intergroup comparison was done, there was a significant statistical reduction only for FBS. Nonsurgical periodontal therapy restores periodontal health and improves glycemic control.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, Group 1 patients were treated with metformin and Group 2 patients were given fenugreek powder along with metformin. In many diabetic patients, blood glucose levels are not properly controlled by bonafide antidiabetic medicines, and malnourished individuals take suboptimal doses of drug to prevent hypoglycemic episodes. As fenugreek is commonly used as a condiment in India, the beneficiary effect of fenugreek in controlling blood sugar and overall cholesterol levels would have a considerable practical implication. Insulin secretion is enhanced by the fenugreek fibers due to 4-OH-Ile, which lowers the intestinal absorption of glucose, thereby regulating blood sugar.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Arginine and tryptophan are two other amino acids exerting an antidiabetic effect. Fenugreek seeds can also replace legumes in a diabetic patient's diet as they are excellent source of proteins. A daily intake of 50 g of fenugreek seeds can help in effectively controlling the disease.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In our study, blood glucose level showed a statistically significant on intragroup comparison which was evidenced by a reduction in the FBS values for both Group 1 and Group 2 patients and HbA1c values in Group 2 patients where fenugreek seed powder was administered adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal therapy along with metformin. The galactomannan-rich soluble fiber is responsible for its antidiabetic properties.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The secondary mechanism for its antiglycemic effect is its high fiber content (25%).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A human study done by Sharma [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] revealed the positive effects of fenugreek seeds in treating both Type 1 and Type 2 DM patients. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have revealed that the amino acid content in fenugreek possesses a direct stimulation on the &#x003b2;-cells. It is found to be around 0.55%. Glucose-induced insulin levels were found to be significantly higher in both humans and rats, according to studies done by Sauvaire <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>In this current study, when intragroup comparison was done for serum lipids, there was a statistical significance seen in TC, LDL, and TG levels. Fenugreek seeds exert a distinct hypocholesterolemic effect besides lowering LDL, TG, and serum cholesterol levels. This may be due to the effect of sapogenins, which lowers serum cholesterol levels by increasing biliary cholesterol excretion.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] When intergroup comparison was done at baseline and after treatment, there was a statistical significance observed in TC and LDL after nonsurgical periodontal treatment. The results of our study were similar to a study done by Sharma.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In our study, on intragroup comparison, there was significance seen in the TG level at baseline and after treatment. The TG-lowering effect may be due to the pectin component that absorbs bile acid salts. There is also an increase transformation of hepatic cholesterol to bile salts which may be caused by loss in the feces with saponins and fenugreek fiber. Fenugreek can lower lipids due to its saponin content which is converted into sapogenins in the gastrointestinal tract. Fiber galactose and mannose being the main ingredient of the gum are also present in fenugreek seeds which help in reducing the cholesterol level in hypercholesterolemic patients.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Cholesterol-lowering activities are also present in the fiber-rich gum portion of the seed which reduces the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. Both these mechanisms can largely contribute to the effect of fenugreek on serum lipids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study shows that fenugreek seeds decrease blood glucose and TG levels and also have a significant effect on LDL and TC levels. Since diabetic patients have an increased inflammatory cytokine which can modify the risk of diabetes, nonsurgical periodontal therapy not only helps in reducing clinically evident inflammation but also has been associated in decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and glycated hemoglobin levels. This is evident from our current study, which has shown statistically significant reduction in FBS and HbA1c values and also significant reduction in serum inflammatory markers when compared to baseline values.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no
