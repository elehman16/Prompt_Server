Although customers may appreciate the fact that the indoor environment is now healthier and that their clothes do not smell of smoke anymore when they come home, they may be bothered by the unpleasant smells when they are out, which can negatively affect the experience of their night out.</p><p>A possible solution to this problem is to install a fragrance machine that distributes a pleasant scent in order to mask the unwanted odors. Moreover, scents may improve the perceived quality of the environment (Mattila and Wirtz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>; Spangenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>) or enhance the mood of the customers (e.g., Baron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1990</xref>; Cann and Ross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1989</xref>; Ehrlichman and Bastone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1992</xref>; Ehrlichman and Halpern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1988</xref>). Therefore, we performed a study to test the effectiveness of three ambient scents in improving the nightlife experience.</p><p>Mehrabian and Russell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1974</xref>) have proposed a stimulus&#x02013;organism&#x02013;response paradigm to study the effects of environmental stimuli on human behavior. According to their paradigm, environmental stimuli, such as smells, may affect people&#x02019;s affective states that in their turn affect approach or avoidance behavior. According to these authors, three dimensions underlie people&#x02019;s affective states: pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD). Schifferstein and Tanudjaja (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>) assessed the emotional associations on the three PAD scales for 14 fine fragrances. They found most significant differences between fragrances on the pleasure scale (27% of all comparisons), fewer differences on the arousal scale (13%), and almost none on the dominance scale (1%). These outcomes suggest that the pleasure and arousal dimensions will be the most relevant for evaluating the effects of ambient scents.</p><p>Indeed, the hedonic dimension (pleasant&#x02013;unpleasant) is extremely important in the experience of odors (e.g., Engen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1982</xref>), and pleasant odors seem to be able to induce positive moods (e.g., Baron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1990</xref>). The presence of pleasant odors in comparison to no odor or unpleasant odors in stores or shopping malls can improve the store image and the intention to visit the store (Spangenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>). Furthermore, they increase product evaluations and buying intentions for products that are not (dis)liked extremely (Morrin and Ratneshwar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2000</xref>; Spangenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>). In addition, pleasant odors can increase the time spent in a store (Knasko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1989</xref>; Leenders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>; Nixdorf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1992</xref>), the number of times products are examined (Spangenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>), and the amount of time taken to evaluate products (Knasko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1995</xref>; Morrin and Ratneshwar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2000</xref>), whereas they decrease the subjectively perceived amount of time spent in a store (Spangenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>). Furthermore, people are more likely to interact with other people (Zemke and Shoemaker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2007</xref>) and to help other people (Baron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>). Although these effects do not necessarily imply that pleasant odors increase the number of items purchased or the total amount of money spent (Chebat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>; Knasko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1989</xref>), the changes in these indicators suggest that consumers are more interested in shopping when the shopping environment smells good.</p><p>According to Mattila and Wirtz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>), the evaluation of the store environment improves if the diffused scent is congruent with the other elements of the store in terms of their arousing qualities. Hence, if the store owner would like to create an environment in which visitors can relax and is already playing relaxing background music, other scents would be appropriate than if he or she wanted to stimulate or activate the visitors. Scents that may have relaxing effects include lavender (Lehrner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>; Moss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>), chamomile (Moss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>), ylang-ylang (Moss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>), and orange (Lehrner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>; Lehrner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>). Scents that may have a stimulating effect include peppermint (Ho and Spence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Moss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>; Warm, Dember and Parasuraman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1991</xref>; Warrenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2002</xref>) and rosemary (Moss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>).</p><p>A relaxing effect does not necessarily preclude an increase in alertness. For instance, Warrenburg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2002</xref>) asked panelists to indicate how much a fragrance had changed a given mood. These data showed that muguet and hyacinth were both described as having a relaxing and a stimulating effect. Apparently, participants can experience a heightened sense of calmness and at the same time an increase in awareness and energy (Warren and Warrenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1993</xref>). Analogously, nutmeg on the one hand reduced blood pressure in stressed individuals (reduced arousal, Warren and Warrenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1993</xref>; Warren et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1987</xref>), but on the other hand, it increased performance in a vigilance task (increased alertness, Warm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1991</xref>). Furthermore, when Chrea et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>) asked participants to rate odorants on 36 affective terms, they found that the relaxing and stimulating effects of odors were strongly positively (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.83), not negatively correlated.</p><p>Whether a scent is perceived as congruent or not is an important determinant of its acceptance and of the evaluation of its environment (e.g., Bone and Ellen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>; Bosmans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Schifferstein and Verlegh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1996</xref>). If a scent is dispersed in the environment and people do not expect this odor in that particular environment, they may feel uncomfortable, and they may leave the location because it smells bad. Therefore, it is important to make sure that an ambient scent is thematically congruent with its environment (Schifferstein and Blok <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2002</xref>). For instance, diffusing the smell of sunscreen at an indoor beach party can be used to emphasize the beach theme. Spangenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2005</xref>) found that Christmas scent led to favorable evaluations of a department store and its merchandise only when presented in combination with Christmas music. Furthermore, these authors showed that shoppers evaluated a clothing store and its merchandise more favorably in the presence of a gender-congruent ambient scent compared to an incongruent scent (Spangenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). Analogously, Fiore et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>) concluded that an appropriately fragranced display for sleepwear products generated the most positive effect on purchase intentions. In general, studies on the role of odor&#x02013;environment congruency indicate that an odor is likely to show the most positive effects if it fits in with the rest of the environment. Even if the advantages of better-fitting scents are not always remarkable, the detrimental effects of an incongruent odor tend to be substantial (Bone and Ellen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>).</p><p>For the present study, three scents were selected that were perceived as pleasant and fitting with the nightclub environment. All these pleasant scents were expected to increase the revenue from drinks, increase the number of visitors, improve the mood of the visitors, and improve their evaluations of the club environment compared to a no-scent control condition. Possibly, improved visitors&#x02019; mood might (partly) account for the effects found on the evaluation of the environment (e.g., Baron and Thomley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1994</xref>; Gulas and Bloch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1995</xref>). Therefore, mediation analyses (Baron and Kenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1986</xref>) were performed in order to test whether mood works as a mediator for the positive effect of pleasant scents on the evaluation of the environment.</p><p>Because people tend to go out in clubs to have fun, amuse themselves, relax, and dance, it remains to be determined whether scents should relax or stimulate the public. The three selected scents differed with regard to their anticipated effect on the arousal dimension of affect. The stimulating smell (peppermint) was expected to enhance, the relaxing smell (orange) to attenuate, and the neutral smell (seawater) to have no effect on dancing activity in the clubs.

A subset of visitors was invited to fill out a short questionnaire when they exited the club. In total, 849 questionnaires were administered. The number of questionnaires per night varied from 48 to 60. The percentage of men was 53.4, 42.9, and 53.4, and mean age was 20.2, 20.6, and 25.4 for locations 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

In each location, measurements were performed one night per week, always on the same day of the week. Scents were diffused only on target nights, not during the rest of the week. The study covered five nights per test location. On the first night, no scent was diffused as a control condition. In the consecutive 3&#x000a0;weeks, every week, a different scent was diffused on the target night by a fragrance machine. In the last week, no scent was used, resulting in a second control night (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

For each club, tests were performed on the same night of the week, with the same music style played every week. The test night was a relatively busy night for the club, with 300&#x02013;450 people visiting each club. At locations 1 and 3, testing started at 0000 and lasted until 0400 hours. At location 2, testing started at 2300 hours because the club closed at 0300. Tests were conducted in October and November 2008.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Stimuli</title><p>The three scents that were used for the experiments were orange (no. 102), seawater fresh and salty (no. 306), and peppermint (no. 007) provided by RetroScent, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. These scents were chosen on the basis of a prestudy performed among 67 visitors of four different clubs. In the prestudy, club visitors were presented with 10 scent sticks, each containing a different synthetic scent. Each scent was rated individually on a set of 7-point scales. The three experimental scents were selected because they differed considerably in odor character and nevertheless obtained relatively high and roughly comparable ratings on pleasantness (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.5, 4.3, and 4.1, respectively) and congruency with the club environment (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.9, 3.8, and 3.4). In addition, according to our literature review, orange might have a relaxing effect (e.g., Lehrner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>; Lehrner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>), while peppermint was likely to have a stimulating effect (e.g., Ho and Spence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Moss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). No specific relaxing or stimulating effect was expected for the seawater fragrance.</p><p>The scents were provided in 200-ml cartridges and diffused using a RetroScent Smell &#x00026; Sell Classic system, which is suitable for rooms measuring up to 250&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>. This system uses a room temperature nebulizing system. The nebulizing pump is placed in the cartridge holding the perfume oil and creates a 100% aerosol. A fan mixes the aerosol with the surrounding air and transports the scent through the room. The machine has three adjustable settings: the speed of the nebulizing pump, the fan speed, and the number of minutes the machine is active per 15&#x000a0;min.</p><p>For each club, the machine was adjusted up to a level at which the smell would be just noticeable throughout the space, without becoming evidently present. Fragrance distribution settings remained unchanged during the entire night. To accommodate differences in perceived intensity between fragrances, the maximum pump speed was set at 40% for peppermint, 50% for orange, and 60% for seawater at every location. The fan speed differed between locations and depended on the size of the space, the degree of air circulation, and the machine&#x02019;s distance from the ground. Because the dance floor at location 1 was large, the fan was set at maximum power. At location 2, the fan was set at 75% of maximum power because the dance floor was smaller and the fragrance machine was higher up from the floor. At location 3, the fan was set at 50% because it was located in front of another large ventilator. At all locations the machine was switched on for 7.5&#x000a0;min during each 15-min interval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Procedure</title><p>Observational measurements were made at 30-min intervals during four consecutive hours in every location (t1 to t9). At each measurement point, four to five pictures were taken from several fixed locations in the club in order to determine the number of visitors present. In addition, a 30-s video was made. Subsequently, the percentage of people dancing was estimated by the experimenter, and the temperature inside the club was recorded using a weather station (accuracy 0.1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). Videos were used to cross-check the subjective estimates of the dancing activity.</p><p>During the last 2&#x000a0;h of measurement, exiting customers were asked whether they were willing to fill out a short questionnaire about how they liked the evening in the club. To avoid introducing bias and contaminating the potential subject pool on subsequent test occasions, no mention was made about the distribution of fragrances. Each night, between 48 and 60 questionnaires were filled out. The experimenter tried to distribute the questionnaires evenly over the 2&#x000a0;h, so that approximately 15 questionnaires were filled out each 30&#x000a0;min. Respondents evaluated the quality of the evening, the music, and the club on three 9-point scales (1=very bad, 9=very good). Subsequently, they reported their feelings from earlier in the night using a modified version of the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM, Bradley and Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1994</xref>; Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1985</xref>). In our version of the SAM, each dimension of affective experience (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) was represented through five pictorial representations depicted above a 9-point rating scale with verbal end anchors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Respondents were instructed to mark a category below a picture (or between pictures) that best matched their feelings that night. Finally, participants reported age and gender. After each test night, sales data were obtained in order to assess the customers&#x02019; consumption behavior during the night.

To correct for differences in location size and visitors&#x02019; drinking behavior, the mean revenue for each location in the two no-scent control weeks was set to 100, and all revenues for a location were calculated relative to this number. For each type of data (total, beer, and liquor), we compared sales across nights (three experimental and two no-scent control conditions) by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with condition as the only within-location variable.</p><p>The number of visitors, dancing activity, and temperature were measured nine times per evening.

Correlations among these dependent variables were all substantial (0.45&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.65, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, and <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;844). This could imply that the scent effect on some dependent variable may be mediated by the scent effect on another variable. For instance, scents may directly affect the mood of the visitors, and due to the improvement in mood, the visitors may evaluate the evening more favorably. In order to investigate this relationship, whether visitor mood acts as a mediator of the effect of scents on the evaluation of the evening was examined via the approach detailed below suggested by Baron and Kenny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1986</xref>). Because the evaluation of the evening was the most general type of evaluation and showed the largest effect of scent in the ANOVAs, it was the only dependent variable investigated in the analysis of mediation.</p><p>Although pleasure, arousal, and dominance are supposed to reflect independent dimensions of affective experience (Mehrabian and Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1974</xref>), in the current study, responses on the sad&#x02013;cheerful scale were highly correlated with those on the quiet&#x02013;active scale (Pearson <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.54, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, and <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;828). In addition, statistically significant correlations were found between sad&#x02013;cheerful and independent&#x02013;dependent (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.15, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, and <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;823), and between quiet&#x02013;active and independent&#x02013;dependent (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.09, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, and <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;822), but in these cases, the correlation coefficients were much lower. In order to avoid multicollinearity in the mediation analyses, only the responses on the sad&#x02013;cheerful scale were used as mediation variable, since this is the only variable for which significant scent effects were found.</p><p>According to Baron and Kenny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1986</xref>), mediation can be assessed by performing the following regression analyses: (1) regressing the mediator (mood) on the independent variable (scent); (2) regressing the dependent variable (evaluation evening) on the independent variable (scent); and (3) regressing the dependent variable on both the mediator and the independent variable. In all regression analyses, the cheerful variable and the evaluation variable were continuous variables (responses varying from 1 to 9), while the scent effect manipulation was a dummy variable (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;scent versus 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no scent). Two additional dummy variables were included in all regression equations to code for any between-location differences.</p><p>Analyses 2 and 3 in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> indicate that the effect of scent on the evaluation of the evening decreased when the visitor&#x02019;s degree of cheerfulness was entered in the equation. This suggests that the effect of scents is at least partly mediated by the mood of the visitors. After the cheerfulness of the visitor has entered the equation, the regression coefficients for the scent effect remain positive. However, this effect is only statistically significant in the analysis performed for seawater scent and in the overall analysis of the three scents. The latter results suggest that the scent may have a small effect on the evaluation of the evening that is independent of the mood improvement.

The pleasant scents in the present study increased dancing activity, and they improved the evaluation of the evening, the evaluation of the music, and the mood (i.e,. cheerfulness) of the visitors. The study thereby roughly confirms positive effects previously found in retail stores (e.g., Spangenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>) and expands these to the nightlife experience.</p><p>As regards the type of scent, differences between the three scents were generally not statistically significant. This outcome contradicts our hypothesis that a stimulating smell (peppermint) would enhance dancing activity, whereas a relaxing smell (orange) would attenuate dancing activity. Instead, we found that all scents enhanced dancing activity. The increase in dancing activity seems to coincide with an increase in temperature in the club. Possibly, these two variables are correlated, in the sense that more dancing activity increases the visitors&#x02019; heat production and, thereby, increases the temperature in the nightclub. Changes in outside temperature are unlikely to account for our findings because it went down steadily by 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C over the five testing weeks.</p><p>In line with traditional models of environmental psychology (e.g., Mehrabian and Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1974</xref>), our mediation analysis suggests that the effects of scents on the evaluation of the evening are at least partly mediated by the visitors&#x02019; mood. Please note that this analysis cannot be used to determine the causal order in which effects occur. Chebat and Michon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>) recently suggested that the change in evaluation of the environment may actually <italic>precede</italic> the change in people&#x02019;s mood. These authors used structural equation modeling to provide support for a cognition&#x02013;affect model in which scent affected the perception of the environment and product quality, which in their turn affected mood and consumer spending. Alternatively, the effects might be interpreted as stemming from a halo effect (Thorndike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1920</xref>). A halo effect implies that one positive stimulus feature may induce favorable opinions on other&#x02014;seemingly unrelated&#x02014;characteristics. As a result, responses on various positive scales may become correlated. Hence, a halo explanation suggests that all changes in evaluation of the nightclub environment and visitors&#x02019; mood occur simultaneously, not in any particular order. Unfortunately, the current data do not allow us to distinguish between these alternative explanations.</p><p>Spangenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>) found strong effects of pleasant ambient scents on evaluations of store environment, but weaker effects on product judgments. This difference may occur because an ambient odor is diagnostic for the store atmosphere, but not for a particular product if that product does not emit the scent. Olfactory information needs to compete with other information for the attention of the observer, and since it is in many cases rather ambiguous, it often loses this battle. Therefore, the effect of an ambient scent on the evaluation of individual products in stores may be rather small. Nonetheless, Bosmans&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>) study suggests that even an incongruent, pleasant scent can have a positive effect on product evaluations, although the size of this effect depends on how salient the scent is.</p><p>However, the case may be different for nightclubs or restaurants, where products are consumed on the spot. Some scents may have an adverse or beneficial effect on the consumption of specific beverages, depending on whether their combination of sensory properties clashes or not. For instance, the authors observed that peppermint scent and beer are not a good combination. If certain combinations are regarded unpleasant, the scents may decrease sales for specific products. On the other hand, they can also act as cues that increase sales for specific drinks (e.g., orange scent for orange juice or orange-mix drinks).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methodological Limitations</title><p>In the present study, a 5-week time frame was used. This turned out to be sufficient for obtaining scent-induced differences on several questionnaire items, but not to affect revenue. Whereas responses on 849 questionnaires (48&#x02013;60 per night per club) were obtained, only 15 observations for revenue (one per night per club) were registered. Possibly, more observations could lead to more significant differences between scents.</p><p>In addition, some of the dependent measures might be improved in subsequent studies. When it was very busy during club nights, we noticed that bar personnel was sometimes unable to serve all visitors in time. If a more crowded bar implies that visitors have to wait longer for their drinks, revenue does not increase linearly with popularity of the bar. Therefore, future studies should take bar capacity into account when assessing beverage sales. Furthermore, we measured the activity of the visitors in a subjective manner. In order to obtain a more objective measure in future research, the dance floor might be filmed using a camera with movement sensor. In addition, an electronic counting system could be placed at the door and a camera could be installed above the dance floor in order to determine the total number of visitors.</p><p>Although visitor mood was assessed via SAM scales on three purportedly independent dimensions, in the present investigation, they were highly correlated. However, these correlations do not necessarily invalidate the PAD model or the SAM scales, but may be induced by the environments used as stimuli. Several previous empirical studies have found substantial intercorrelations between the dimensions (e.g., Osgood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1957</xref>). According to Mehrabian and Russell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1974</xref>), arousal amplifies approach behavior in pleasant environments and avoidance behavior in unpleasant environments. Because in the present study arousal is correlated positively with pleasantness, increases in arousal and pleasantness are both likely to correlate with increases in approach behaviors, such as duration of stay, interaction with other visitors, intention to visit the club again, and so on.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Practical Implications</title><p>Although clubs and bars look for ways to differentiate themselves from their competitors, they are also likely to encounter barriers in adopting new technologies and innovative experience concepts (e.g., Fuglsang and Sorensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>). Given that visitors gave a better evaluation for the clubs, felt more cheerful, and showed more dancing activity when scents were diffused, environmental fragrancing may be expected to have a positive effect on visitor return rate and future revenue for clubs. However, more empirical testing is needed to show whether these effects will occur and how large they are.</p><p>In a bar or nightclub environment, the music and the lights have always been important factors to create the desired atmosphere. By combining the lights and sounds with ambient scent, a full multisensory experience can be created, stimulating all senses at the same time. It is important that when scents are added, they should be in balance with lights and music (e.g., Schifferstein and Desmet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>). For example, high arousal music should preferably be combined with high arousal scents (Mattila and Wirtz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>). It may be worthwhile to develop scents that are especially designed for nightclubs and that can be dispersed throughout the night. Such a scent could become a signature scent for a specific club (e.g., Goldkuhl and Styven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>) and may become part of that club&#x02019;s brand identity. Alternatively, it may be possible to develop a set of scents that enhances the different experiences that occur during the night, depending on the crowding, the type of music, the degree of fatigue or intoxication of the customers, and the wishes of the club owner (e.g., to relax or activate the crowd, or to stimulate the last customers to go home). At present, some innovative nightclubs are already inviting aroma jockeys, who generate multiple smells over the night that are congruent with the music that is played at that specific moment (Odo7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>). Whether these smells are really effective in enhancing the nightlife experience remains a topic for further investigation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are indebted to RetroScent
