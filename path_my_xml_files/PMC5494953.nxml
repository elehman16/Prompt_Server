Study conducted among 72 patients with MS in the Farshchian Educational Hospital, affiliated with Hamadan University of Medical Sciences and Multiple Sclerosis Association, Hamadan, Iran, during July-October in 2013.</p><p>The patients who met the following criteria were included in the study: (a) 20&#x02013;45 years of age, (b) MS confirmed by a neurologist, *c) lack of hearing and visual problems, (d) lack of cardiopulmonary diseases, (e) lack of mental disorders, and (f) patients with EDSS 1&#x02013;6 in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) by a neurologist. The patients were excluded if they had any severe diseases leading to hospitalization or if they were reluctant to continue their participation.</p><p>According to the results of a previous study,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] we arrived at a sample size of 30 for each group and a total sample size of 60 at 95% significance level and 80% statistical power. The final sample size anticipating 15% sample attrition was a total of 72 (36 patients in each group) participants.</p><p>The eligible patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups using the balance block randomization. For this purpose, we prepared four sheets of paper, writing on two sheets &#x0201c;I&#x0201d; for &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; and on two &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; for &#x0201c;control.&#x0201d; The sheets were pooled, placed in a container, and randomly drawn one at a time for each patient without replacement until all four sheets were drawn. The four sheets were then placed back into the container and this action was repeated until the sample size was reached.</p><p>The trial was carried out as single blind so that the examiner who evaluated the lifestyle of MS patients' responses was not aware of the allocated intervention. Furthermore, the statistical analyst was unaware of the trial groups until the data were analyzed and the labels were decoded.</p><p>The data collection tool was a 42-item self-reported questionnaire, which was developed by Payamani <italic>et al</italic>. in 2010.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The questionnaire's validity was approved by 10 faculty members of the Hamadan Universities of Medical Sciences, and its reliability was approved using test-retest, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.95.

The main questionnaire included six subscales; self-care (3 items), nutrition (23 items), physical activity and exercise (5 items), sleep and rest patterns (6 items), stress management (4 items), and smoking (1 item), which measured MS patients' lifestyle. Lifestyle scores were interpreted in general and at subscales which were categorized into undesirable (&#x0003c;50%), partly desirable (50&#x02013;75%), and desirable (&#x0003e;75%).</p><p>Lifestyle of patients in both the control and intervention groups was assessed by MS patients' lifestyle questionnaire at the baseline before delivering continuous care. Then, patients in the intervention group received continuous care, according to its four stages, including (1) orientation, (2) sensitization, (3), control and (4) evaluation for 8 weeks. The patients in the control group received the routine care during these 8 weeks.</p><p>Continuous care in the first or the orientation stage included a 45&#x02013;30 minute session with patients and their family members to explain the problems and motivating them to learn to express their expectations. Moreover, the necessity of a sustained and continuous relationship during the study period was emphasized. In the second or the sensitization stage, the patients underwent eight training sessions (30&#x02013;45 minutes in three groups of 12 patients and one of their family members). Training sessions focused on the disease, complications, related limitations, healthy lifestyle, and necessity of family members' involvement in continuous care, encouraging, and instructing them to participate in lifestyle changes for 4 weeks.</p><p>In the third or the control stage, we assessed the patients' lifestyle by questionnaire at first and then we followed-up the continuous care for 4 weeks. Control stage was conducted according to the patients' needs and conditions through face-to-face interviews or telephone counseling and education weekly. In the fourth or the evaluation stage, we evaluated the process of continuous care and the patients' lifestyle by filling the MS patients' lifestyle questionnaire.

Because all domains of lifestyle were considered in this model and sensitization was repeated during the study period and family members were involved in the entire program, the patients' lifestyle remarkably improved in all domains. This result was consistent with that of the study conducted by Molazem <italic>et al</italic>. that showed the effect of continuous care model on the lifestyle of patients with myocardial infarction.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In their study, Ennis <italic>et al</italic>. showed that health promotion education program for patients suffering from MS produced changes in health-promotion behaviors.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Moreover, Chahkhoie <italic>et al</italic>. in their study showed that, in all dimensions of lifestyle, except sleep, there was a significant difference.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have investigated the effect of continuous care on the lifestyle of the patients and have concluded that continuous care can improve patients' lifestyle and reduce the jeopardy of the disease.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The score of self-care domain was significantly different between the intervention and control groups. This indicates the effect of continuous care model on self-care in patients with MS. This finding is consistent with the results of Chahkhoie <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Hemmati and Raiesi showed that implementing the self-management program along with regular follow-up increased the perception of self-efficacy in patients with MS.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The score of sleep and rest domain was significantly different between the intervention and control groups. This indicates the effect of continuous care model on the quality of sleep in patients with MS. Consistent with our results, Khosravan <italic>et al</italic>. and Sadeghi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that continuous care could efficiently improve the quality of life and sleep status in patients with hemodialysis and diabetes;[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in contrast, Chahkhoie <italic>et al</italic>. reported that collaborative care had no effect on sleep status of MS patients.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The discrepancy between the results of these studies may be due to the differences in the period of follow-up and the care model.</p><p>Evidence has shown that stress is common among patients with MS and can exacerbate the disease signs and symptoms. We noted that continuous care could efficiently help patients with MS in coping with stress as a component of lifestyle. Ebadifar <italic>et al</italic>. performed an educational program based on stress management using BASNEF model, and reported that the improvement of behavior in patients with MS could effectively help them in managing stressful conditions.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>MS progressively leads to physical disability. Motor disability (e.g., impaired walking) is one of the most common features of MS that changes patients' lifestyle depending on the stage of the disease. Sports and physical activities can promote health, reduce motor disability, and reduce stress and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In this study, we trained patients how to engage in physical activities. Nancy <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that sport and physical activity can modify the MS-related outcomes, and suggested that physical activity, regardless of its intensity and duration, should be considered as a part of the treatment process in order to improve the patients' lifestyle and reduce their disabilities.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Erin <italic>et al</italic>. performed a meta-analysis to assess the enabling effect of physical activities on motor function in patients with MS. They indicated that physical activity can improve impairment of walking.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The findings of Chahkhoie <italic>et al</italic>. are consistent with our results.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>A healthy diet can promote health conditions of patients with MS. Pozuelo-Moyano <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the role of diet in the clinical condition of patients with MS, and concluded that the severity of signs and symptoms of the disease and its recurrent attacks are associated with the type of diet.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Ghavami <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of continuous care model on the amount of blood sugar in diabetic patients, and concluded that implementing this model can effectively reduce blood sugar in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>There is a sufficient evidence that shows implementing continuous care model can have a significant effect on various domains of lifestyle in patients with MS. Therefore, a training course at discharge is suggested for patients with MS in order to improve their knowledge regarding the disease and to increase their self-efficacy to overcome the disease related limitations in daily activities and to reduce treatment costs.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study was that the blinding of the intervention to the patients was impossible. This might raise the possibility of information bias. Another limitation of this study is its short follow-up phase due to the limitation of research time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>With regard to the chronic nature of MS and the fact that the present programs fall short of completely controlling the side effects and the various difficulties following this disease, the existence of a continuous care method that can affect the patients' lifestyle seems quite inevitable. The results of the present study indicated that the implementation of the continuous care model can improve the lifestyle in patients with MS with no additional cost. Therefore, training the patients with this model is suggested.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This article is part of the MSc thesis in Nursing Education, approved by the Vice.chancellor of research and Technology, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.
