Patients who had been treated with curative intent were selected from four types of hospitals. Eighty-two patients were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, whereas 130 patients received the questionnaire by mail. To assess the effect of follow-up on the quality of life, the interviewed patients were randomly allocated to three groups and interviewed at different times in relation to the follow-up visit. Analysis did not show an effect of the follow-up visit on quality of life. Patients reported a positive attitude towards follow-up: it reassured them, they judged the communication with the physician to be positive, and they experienced only slight nervous anticipation and few other disadvantages. Patients reported a strong preference for follow-up, and a large majority would prefer follow-up even if it would not lead to earlier detection of a recurrence. Apart from living situation, no patient characteristics were clearly associated with the attitude towards follow-up. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00183-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="914" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00183-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="915" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00183-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="916" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00183-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="917" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00183-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="918" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00183-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="919" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00183-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="920" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
