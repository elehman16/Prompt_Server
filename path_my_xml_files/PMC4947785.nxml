Some studies have found positive effects on cognition in children with learning difficulties, elderly people with cognitive impairment and depression scores in depressed individuals.

At baseline, 6 and 12&#x02005;months, a neuropsychological test battery, a number of questionnaires and a standardised math test (baseline and 12&#x02005;months) were administered.

LCPUFAs from the n-3 family such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) are involved in many aspects of brain functioning, for example, neuronal membrane fluidity and neurotransmission.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There is evidence that consumption of Omega-3 LCPUFAs plays a protective role in age-related cognitive decline<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and Alzheimer's disease.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In premature babies, it has been shown that higher Omega-3 LCPUFAs consumption is associated with advanced cognitive development.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, in children, it might lead to improvement of symptoms associated with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although previous research is not conclusive, it does suggest that in certain sensitive periods Omega-3 LCPUFAs might contribute to optimising cognitive performance and/or cognitive development.</p><p>Adolescence has received limited attention in studies on n-3 LCPUFAs. The brain and prefrontal cortex continue to develop until the late 20s.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;11</xref> It is thus crucial to study the role of Omega-3 LCPUFA in adolescence as they play an important role in brain development and functioning. For example, DHA is an important structural component of the neural cell membrane, influencing membrane fluidity and signal transduction.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Moreover, higher DHA intake has been associated with changes in the functional activity of the prefrontal cortex in boys aged 8&#x02013;10&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Even though EPA is only present in very small amounts in the brain,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> it is also involved in important brain processes such as neurite outgrowth, regulation of gene expression and in anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and vasodilatory processes which might assist brain functioning.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Studies on the relationship between measured LCPUFA status or supplementation and cognitive functioning in adolescents are, to the best of our knowledge, not available. Observational studies investigating the association between fish intake and cognitive functioning in adolescents are, however, available. Kim <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> showed that adolescents aged 15&#x02005;years who regularly consumed fish had significantly better academic performance than their non-fish consuming or less fish consuming peers. &#x000c5;berg <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> demonstrated that high fish consumption in boys at age 15&#x02005;years was associated with better cognitive performance at age 18&#x02005;years. Finally, de Groot <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> studied 700 adolescents aged 12&#x02013;18&#x02005;years for whom fish consumption data, end-term grades (for Dutch, English and Math) and score on the Amsterdam Vocabulary Test was collected. Contrast analyses demonstrated a u-shape association between fish consumption and vocabulary (p=0.01) and a nearly significant association with average end-term grades (p=0.07). Thus, higher fish intake was associated with more advanced vocabulary and an almost significant higher average end-term grade. However, eating more fish than the recommended amount (&#x0003e;2 fish portion/week) was not associated with a beneficial outcome.</p><p>Studies looking at the measured LCPUFA status and depression in typically developing adolescents are also limited. We are only aware of the study by Mamalakis that showed a negative association between EPA measured in adipose tissue and score on the Beck Depression Inventory (ie, higher EPA, fewer depressive symptoms). Furthermore, a positive association between dihomogamma linolenic acid (DGLA, C20:3n-6) measured in adipose tissue and score on the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (ie, higher DGLA, more depressive symptoms) was shown.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This was, however, only true after correction for adiponectin. Although self-esteem has often been associated with depression,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> we found no studies taking self-esteem into account when studying the association between LCPUFA and depression in adolescents.</p><p>While observational studies point to a beneficial association between fish intake (the main source of DHA and EPA) and school grades in adolescents and since causality cannot be proven by observational studies, intervention studies are needed. Furthermore, little is known about the effects of Omega-3 fatty acids on depression and self-esteem in typically developing adolescents.</p><p>This paper describes the design of Food2Learn, a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled intervention in which the influence of an increase in the Omega-3 Index with 1-year of krill oil supplementation on cognition, academic achievement and behaviour in typically developing adolescents is investigated. In addition, we try to counteract design issues such as bioavailability, baseline Omega-3 Index and study population which could have caused neutral results in earlier trials.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Bioavailability</title><p>The bioavailability of DHA and EPA depends mostly on the form in which they are bound and the food matrix with which the DHA and EPA are taken. Most previous trials have chosen unemulsified ethyl-ester or triglycerides and have advised participants to consume capsules with breakfast, both of which lead to lower absorption of the LCPUFAs.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> In Food2Learn, krill oil is used as supplementation. Krill oil contains 30&#x02013;65% of the EPA and DHA in the phospholipid form. Phospholipids have amphiphilic properties and therefore emulsifying properties that enhance absorption<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> and are also better absorbed by the brain than triglycerides.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Another factor important for DHA and EPA absorption is the presence of fat in the meal. Some studies report a trifold higher LCPUFA absorption when LCPUFA capsules are taken with a high fat meal, compared to a low fat meal.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This is hypothesised to be caused by the stimulating effect of fat on pancreatic lipase.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, participants in Food2Learn are asked to consume the capsules with dinner, the fattiest meal of the day.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Baseline Omega-3 Index</title><p>In earlier studies, participants were often recruited without researchers knowing the baseline Omega-3 fatty acid status of participants. This has led to participants with a wide range in statuses being included, while one can expect that effects of supplementation are more likely in participants with a low Omega-3 fatty acid status. This wide range in statuses can lead to similar end Omega-3 statuses in the placebo and treatment groups and thus similar outcome measures. To increase the chance of observing any effects of supplementation, participants for Food2Learn are recruited on the basis of a low Omega-3 Index (&#x0003c;5%).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The Omega-3 Index is defined as EPA plus DHA in erythrocytes and is based on a standardised analytical method.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Additionally, to counteract interpersonal variability in the uptake/metabolism of the LCPUFA supplementation, a dose adjustment based on the individual Omega-3 Index blood levels after 3&#x02005;months of supplementation was applied. This dose adjustment should ensure that participants in the active treatment group achieve the target range of 8&#x02013;11%. This target range is an estimate based on the Omega-3 Index associated with the lowest mortality risk in coronary heart disease.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study population</title><p>Richardson showed that LCPUFA supplementation was especially beneficial in the 20% lowest performing children.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In the Netherlands, secondary education is divided into three levels: preuniversity, higher general and lower general secondary education (LGSE). Approximately 38% of all adolescents attend LGSE.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> LGSE is further divided into four sublevels. For the current study, students from the highest sublevel, the theoretical learning pathway (TLP), were recruited. Approximately 40% of students attending LGSE are in the TLP.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Objective and hypotheses</title><p>The primary objective of Food2Learn is to study the effect of an increase in the Omega-3 Index due to 1-year of krill oil supplementation in 13&#x02013;15&#x02005;year-old typically developing adolescents from LGSE on cognitive performance. The secondary objective is to study the effect of an increase in the Omega-3 Index due to 1&#x02005;year of krill oil supplementation in 13&#x02013;15&#x02005;year-old typically developing adolescents from LGSE on academic achievement and behaviour. Furthermore, the relationship between Omega-3 Index and cognitive performance, academic achievement and behaviour in typically developing adolescents will be further explored. The hypothesis is that 1&#x02005;year krill oil supplementation and a higher Omega-3 Index will lead to improved cognition, academic achievement scores and behaviour scores in typically developing Dutch adolescents attending the LGSE. The third objective is to study the effect of an increase in the Omega-3 Index due to 1&#x02005;year of krill oil supplementation in 13&#x02013;15-year-old typically developing adolescents from LGSE on sleep quality and quantity, and visual processing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study design</title><p>Food2Learn is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, with repeated measurements (at baseline, 3&#x02005;months, 6&#x02005;months and 12&#x02005;months) to study the effect of an increase in the Omega-3 Index due to 1-year of krill oil supplementation on cognitive performance, academic achievement and behaviour of second year LGSE students.

Eventually, 19 school boards gave approval. The target group was then approached in a classroom setting. A video explaining the study was shown, the capsules and the finger prick were shown, and any questions were answered. Students received an information letter and were asked to discuss the study with their parents. If requested, a voluntary additional information evening was held.</p><p>If the student wanted to participate, the informed consent form had to be signed by the student and parent(s) and/or guardian(s) and handed in to the researchers at site. All students who handed in an informed consent form received a finger prick to determine the Omega-3 Index; no other prescreening methods were used. If the participant completed the whole study, he/she received a voucher for the cinema. In cohort I of Food2Learn, the needed number of participants was not enrolled; therefore, a second cohort was added to the study. Currently, cohort II is in progress.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>On entry, participants received a participant number. An independent researcher was responsible for treatment allocation. The participants were stratified by sex and were randomly allocated to the placebo or krill oil group by an independent researcher. Equal numbers of participants were randomised to the active treatment and the placebo groups. The group allocation sequence was computer generated and executed by an independent researcher. Researchers at site were only told which box number had to be given to which participant number and were not aware how boxes were divided over placebo/krill oil group. To prevent the risk of unblinding, each participant received a personalised box with capsules. The packaging and the capsules themselves were identical for the active treatment and placebo groups. The capsules were coloured black to hide the redness of krill oil. Furthermore, a vanilla odour was added to hide any possible fishy smell/taste. Neither the researchers at the site nor the participants were informed of group allocation prior to the completion of the whole study (cohorts I and II). Preliminary unblinding of the trial was to be executed only by an independent researcher in the case of severe adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4b5"><title>Procedure&#x02014;baseline</title><p>Before starting supplementation, participants underwent a neuropsychological test battery, filled out questionnaires and performed a standardised math test (see outcome measure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011790F1">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011790TB1">table 1</xref>); these tests were executed at school in a classroom setting. Three cognitive tests were administered in a group setting (10 students max): The Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), D2 test of Attention (D2) and Digit Span Forward (DSF) and Backward (DSB). These tests were led by one researcher via a standardised protocol, while one or two other researchers (depending on group size) made sure that participants understood the tests and complied with the protocol. All tests were first explained and a practice version was always completed by the participants. After this group test session, all participants filled out the questionnaires individually, during which participants were called one by one to perform the Stroop Test and Concept Shifting Test (CST) individually under supervision of one researcher. After data collection, participants completed a standardised computerised math test, in silence, in a classroom setting.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016011790TB1" orientation="portrait"

Blood analyses and dose adjustments were executed by a researcher who was not actively involved in the study. When the increase in the Omega-3 Index in a participant of the active group was insufficient, the supplementation dose was adjusted in this participant and in one participant in the control group with the same number of capsules. This was carried out to ensure blinding of the researchers. However, the Omega-3 Indexes of the participants of cohort I were found to be significantly lower than the target range at 3&#x02005;months. Therefore, it was decided that the dose of all participants would be increased to eight capsules per day. Furthermore, it was decided to increase the starting dose of the cohort II to eight capsules per day to ensure that the target range would be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s4b7"><title>Procedure&#x02014;6&#x02005;months and 12&#x02005;months follow-up</title><p>The procedure completed at baseline was repeated again after 6&#x02005;months.

The krill oil contained at least 40&#x02005;g phospholipids per 100&#x02005;g krill oil. The fatty acid profile of these phospholipids was at least 14&#x02005;g EPA and 6&#x02005;g DHA. The remaining composition of krill oil was mainly triglycerides (32%), free fatty acids (6&#x02013;7%) and small amounts of cholesterol, cholesterol esters, ash and a trace amount of astaxanthin (80&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/100&#x02005;g). One krill oil capsule contained a total of 0.5&#x02005;g krill oil, which supplied 65&#x02005;mg EPA and 35&#x02005;mg DHA. For the placebo capsules, a fatty acid mixture was chosen that reflects the fatty acid composition of the average European diet (26.0% C16:0, 4.6% C18:0, 35.8% C18: 1&#x02013;9, 16.7% C18:2&#x02013;6, 2.1% C18:3&#x02013;3, 0% C20:4&#x02013;6 and 14.8% other compounds).<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The placebo contained a mix of olive oil, corn oil, palm oil and medium chain triglycerides in the following ratio 4:4:9:3. The placebo contained no marine n-3 fatty acids.</p><p>In cohort I, participants were instructed to start with an intake of four capsules per day containing in total 260&#x02005;mg EPA and 140&#x02005;mg DHA, almost the daily recommended amount of 450&#x02005;mg of EPA/DHA per day as set by the Dutch health council.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In cohort II, the starting dose was increased to eight capsules, as cohort I showed that the initial dose of 400&#x02005;mg DHA+EPA did not lead to a sufficient increase in the Omega-3 Index. Eight capsules provide 520&#x02005;mg EPA and 280&#x02005;mg DHA per day. To increase adherence to the protocol, participants could receive a daily text message reminder. Furthermore, participants who had an insufficient increase in their blood Omega-3 Index after 3&#x02005;months of supplementation and an equal number of participants from the placebo, as noted by the independent researcher, received a phone call to try to increase compliance. Participants were asked to return all left-over capsules at the end of the study or when they decided to drop out, so compliance could be calculated on the basis of the number of capsules returned.</p><sec id="s4c1"><title>Outcome measures&#x02014;cognitive performance measurements</title><p>The cognitive tests were selected on the basis of their usability as determined in other studies with adolescents;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> reference scores are thus available.

Also, the new power calculation took into account that there were multiple measurement moments and that dropout is possible. Multiple calculation in RMASS software with standardised input numbers such as an average effect size of d=0.25 at 6&#x02005;month follow-up and an equal or 10% higher effect size at 12&#x02005;months follow-up and a dropout of 25% per measurement moment (and thus a total dropout rate of 43%), an error variation varying from 0.4 to 0.5 and a intercept variation of 0.3 to 0.5 with a slope variation of 0.0 (fixed effects), showed that between 183 and 285 participants at baseline should be sufficient to achieve a power of 0.8.</p><p>The power calculation for the sleep substudy suggested that 42 students (21 in the placebo group and 21 in the krill oil group) were sufficient.

Furthermore, adolescence is a critical phase in the school career of students. All in all, adolescence is an important life period to study the association between LCPUFAs and cognition/school performance. Food2Learn is also one of the first studies which has recruited the participants based on a low Omega-3 Index and which makes use of a personalised dose adjustment based on individual response to supplementation. The substudies will shed light on areas that have not received much attention of the LCPUFA research community yet: sleep quantity and quality and visual processing and mental workload. The first students were enrolled in March of 2014; the final data will be collected in August 2016.
