Therefore, strategies to address the challenge of non-improvement early in the course of treatment are needed. A novel trial design was developed to assess the potential utility of antipsychotic dose escalation in patients with an inadequate initial treatment response. This design was embedded in a study intended to assess the efficacy of low dose lurasidone in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this report is to describe the background, rationale and design of this study that included a novel method for the assessment of the potential for dose&#x02013;response in early non-responding patients with schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this 6-week, international, multicenter, double-blind trial, eligible adults with acute schizophrenia were randomized to receive fixed doses of lurasidone 20&#x000a0;mg/day, 80&#x000a0;mg/day (active control), or placebo in a 1:2:1 ratio. Patients initially randomized to lurasidone 80&#x000a0;mg/day who did not have a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score improvement &#x02265;20&#x000a0;% at Week 2 were re-randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either lurasidone 80&#x000a0;mg/day or lurasidone 160&#x000a0;mg/day for the remainder of the trial. All other groups remained on their initially assigned treatment. The formal primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose lurasidone (20&#x000a0;mg/day) compared to placebo; secondary objectives included evaluating the efficacy of lurasidone 80&#x000a0;mg/day versus 160&#x000a0;mg/day in early non-responders, and evaluating the efficacy of lurasidone in all subjects initially randomized to 80&#x000a0;mg/day versus placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Since a lack of early improvement predicts poor response to short-term antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia, several treatment strategies have been proposed to enhance treatment outcome in early non-responders. A novel clinical trial design involving a placebo arm and re-randomization of early non-responders to increased or maintained antipsychotic dose was developed. The study design described in this report provides a robust method to assess the value of antipsychotic dose escalation in patients with schizophrenia who demonstrate poor initial treatment response.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01821378">NCT01821378</ext-link>; initial registration March 22, 2013</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12888-015-0629-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antipsychotic</kwd><kwd>Dosing</kwd><kwd>Early responder</kwd><kwd>Lurasidone</kwd><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Study design</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Treatment guidelines for patients with schizophrenia have typically suggested waiting 4 to 8&#x000a0;weeks to allow adequate time for a patient to respond to an antipsychotic drug prior to switching to another antipsychotic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, in a meta-analysis that included 7450 patients across 42 published studies, reductions in psychopathology were greater in Weeks one and two than in Weeks three and four, and this pattern was present even after the estimated effect of placebo treatment was removed and when results were restricted to the positive symptom subscales of the assessments used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This finding has been replicated by subsequent investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Lack of early response to antipsychotics in the acute treatment of schizophrenia has been shown in multiple studies to predict poor response at short-term trial endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, among 131 patients with schizophrenia receiving open-label fluphenazine 20&#x000a0;mg/day, every patient who experienced an improvement of less than 20&#x000a0;% in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score and 95&#x000a0;% of patients who displayed a reduction of less than 20&#x000a0;% in BPRS thought disturbance factor score following 1&#x000a0;week of treatment were classified as non-responders after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A pooled analysis was conducted of five randomized, double-blind clinical trials that compared olanzapine to other second-generation antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders. Early response was defined as &#x02265;20&#x000a0;% improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 2&#x000a0;weeks. Conditional probabilities (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) were used to characterize the likelihood of &#x0201c;subsequent response&#x0201d; to treatment (i.e., &#x02265;40&#x000a0;% improvement on the PANSS total score with treatment up to 3&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For the receiver operating characteristics curve, the area under the curve was at least 0.75 for all criteria used to assess subsequent response, indicating that the magnitude of early symptom improvement at 2&#x000a0;weeks could predict subsequent response at 3&#x000a0;months. 80&#x000a0;% of non-responders at endpoint were correctly identified as early non-responders at 2&#x000a0;weeks (specificity) and 84&#x000a0;% of early non-responders were non-responders at endpoint (negative predictive value). However, compared to early nonresponse, early response was not as strong a predictor of subsequent response.</p><p>When early non-response occurs, potential patient management strategies include increasing the dose of the currently administered antipsychotic medication within the approved dose range or beyond, adding adjunctive medications or switching to another antipsychotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Another approach to early non-response is to simply wait and continue the initial treatment. However, the chances of achieving a robust antipsychotic response at the starting dose are low in the face of early non-response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Switching to another antipsychotic in the face of early non-response has not been shown to yield substantially better outcomes. In a randomized double-blind, flexible-dosed, 12-week study in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, early non-response to risperidone was used to study the potential benefit of switching from risperidone to olanzapine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Early non-response was defined as failure to achieve a &#x02265;20&#x000a0;% improvement on the PANSS total score following 2&#x000a0;weeks of risperidone treatment. Early non-responders were randomized to continue on risperidone 2&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mg/day or switch to olanzapine 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mg/day for ten additional weeks (early responders remained on risperidone). Early response/non-response was highly predictive of subsequent clinical outcomes. Switching from risperidone in early non-responders to olanzapine at week two resulted in a small, but significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score (&#x02212;16 points versus &#x02212;12 points for those staying on risperidone). Of note, the reduction in PANSS total score following the switch to olanzapine was greater among those patients who were still moderately ill at 2&#x000a0;weeks (&#x02212;22 points versus &#x02212;16 points for those staying on risperidone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A robust decrease in the PANSS total score observed amongst early responders to risperidone (&#x02212;40 points) reinforces the clinical observation that early responders and early non-responders may comprise two distinct patient populations.</p><p>Dose escalation in the presence of early non-response has not been well studied. Both switching and dose escalation were examined in an early study in acute schizophrenia where patients received open-label fluphenazine 20&#x000a0;mg/day for 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Subjects failing to meet response criteria, which were very stringent (mild or better on each of the four BPRS psychotic items and a rating of much improved or better on the Clinical Global Impressions scale global improvement item) after 4&#x000a0;weeks were then randomized, double-blind, to continue fluphenazine 20&#x000a0;mg/day, dose escalation to fluphenazine 80&#x000a0;mg/day, or switch to haloperidol 20&#x000a0;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. No differences in efficacy were found among these treatment strategies. Dose-escalation in the presence of inadequate response has also been examined in patients with schizophrenia receiving quetiapine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and ziprasidone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In these studies, subjects were required to have demonstrated failure on a therapeutic dose in order to be eligible to be randomized to either continue their original dose or to receive a supra-therapeutic dose (quetiapine 1200&#x000a0;mg/day or ziprasidone 320&#x000a0;mg/day depending on the study) under double-blind conditions. In these three studies the higher dose was not superior to the lower. However, none of these four studies used a 2-week decision time point for randomization to dose escalation vs. standard, using instead &#x02265;4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or &#x02265;3&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] used less than minimal improvement (&#x02264;15&#x000a0;% reduction on PANSS total sore) as an &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; non-response definition. In addition, these studies used a variety of criteria to assess non-response, some of which were imprecise, such as having at least one moderate positive symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] a relatively high threshold of &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;% PANSS total improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], or &#x0201c;remaining symptomatic&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, none of these studies included a placebo arm, which may have created a significant expectation bias towards improvement of all subjects.</p><p>Lurasidone is a second-generation antipsychotic agent that has received regulatory approval for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and bipolar depression (both as monotherapy and as adjunct to lithium or valproate) in the US and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The recommended dose range for lurasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia is 40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/day. There is evidence suggesting a dose response, with lurasidone 160&#x000a0;mg/day resulting in more robust reductions in psychopathology than 80&#x000a0;mg/day in one 6-week acute study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a post hoc analysis of pooled data from five, 6-week, acute studies of lurasidone, least square mean change-from-baseline in PANSS exhibited a linear trend relative to dose of lurasidone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there is a clinical need to understand optimal dosing strategies for lurasidone, including whether dose escalation may be effective in patients with little or no early improvement. As part of the postmarketing commitments made to the US Food and Drug Administration, the utilization of lurasidone in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia with a dose lower than 40&#x000a0;mg (e.g., 20&#x000a0;mg daily) was to be studied through an adequate and well-controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This report describes the methodology of a novel clinical trial design that in addition to examining the efficacy of lurasidone 20&#x000a0;mg/day, assessed the efficacy and safety of dose escalation in patients with early non-response by re-randomizing early non-responders to either continue 80&#x000a0;mg/day (the initially assigned dose) or to receive 160&#x000a0;mg/day.

Our study incorporated the latter methodology as a way of exploring questions regarding dose response in early non-responders to antipsychotic treatment. Importantly, rather than addressing whether or not higher doses of a specific antipsychotic are more efficacious for &#x0201c;all-comers&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], or in patients not showing clinical response after an adequate trial of 3&#x000a0;weeks or longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (using various definitions of non-response that allowed for more than minimal improvement except in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), this protocol tested whether dose escalation was effective in patients with a clearly inadequate initial treatment response at week two. The population being examined was thus enriched by the specific selection of subjects who prospectively failed to achieve at least minimal response in the first two weeks of the trial. This design permitted a clear demonstration of dose&#x02013;response in early non-improvers, which may not be evident in studies involving &#x0201c;all comers&#x0201d; or in studies with variable time to early response criteria and imprecise early response definitions. Moreover, previous studies of dose escalation in the face of inadequate response have been confounded by expectation bias that may be present in the absence of a placebo control. The current study minimized this effect by the inclusion of a placebo arm. Whether dose escalation in patients with schizophrenia is an efficacious strategy has important implications regarding optimizing outcomes, maximizing the opportunity for recovery, and managing costs.</p><p>The selection of Week two as the point in time to determine non-response was based on prior published work in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This time point is further supported by naturalistic studies, enhancing the generalizability of this concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Limitations to the trial included the lack of intermediate doses of lurasidone (i.e., 120&#x000a0;mg/day) to be tested as part of the early non-responder design either as starting or target dose, and that the trial length was only 6&#x000a0;weeks; longer-term outcomes were not tested in this design. Moreover, doses of lurasidone that exceed the maximum recommended amount of 160&#x000a0;mg/day were not tested. A 24-week double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing lurasidone 240&#x000a0;mg/day versus 80&#x000a0;mg/day in treatment resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder is in progress (NCT01569659). Generalizability of the results of dose escalation of lurasidone in this study to other antipsychotics is not known.

This protocol reported here was designed in part to explore the strategy of antipsychotic dose escalation in the presence of early non-response to standard dose treatment. The study design reflected the early non-response paradigm and included blinded re-randomization of early non-responders, as well as an effort to minimize expectation bias and enhance signal detection by the inclusion of a placebo control. In this context, this is the first rigorous study to randomize well-defined, early non-responding patients with schizophrenia to either maintain or escalate an initial dose of antipsychotic treatment in a double-blind fashion, incorporating a placebo-control group.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12888_2015_629_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
