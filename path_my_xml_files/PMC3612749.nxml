Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is, by definition, the diagnosis of a toe walking gait adopted in the absence of one of these medical conditions. Long-term ITW has been associated with reduced ankle range of motion. Reported treatments have included serial casting, Botulinum toxin type A or surgery to improve the ankle range of motion. Investigating the impact of simple and non-invasive treatment options for ITW is important for future research and clinical outcomes. This study investigates the immediate impact of footwear, footwear with orthotics and whole body vibration on ITW to determine if any one intervention improves heel contact and spatial-temporal gait measures. This determination is important for future clinical trials into treatment effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p><italic>Design</italic>: this protocol describes a within-subject randomised controlled trial that measures changes in gait following changes in external stimuli. <italic>Participants</italic>: 15 children diagnosed with an ITW gait will be recruited from the Victorian Paediatric Rehabilitation Service at Monash Children's Hospital Toe Walking Clinic provided they have ITW and meet the inclusion criteria. <italic>Procedure</italic>: participants will have their gait recorded walking barefoot, in usual footwear, a custom-made, full-length carbon fibre orthotic in usual footwear and following whole body vibration. Outcome measures will include the presence of bilateral heel contact preintervention and postintervention, stride length (cm), stride width (cm), left and right stride time (s), left and right stance and swing percentage of the gait cycle, gait velocity (m/s), left and right foot toe in/toe out angle (&#x000b0;) and weight-bearing lunge pre and post each condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The results of this study will be published at the conclusion and have been approved by Southern Health HREC:12102B.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial registry number</title><p>ACTRN12612000975897.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is generally understood that toe walking is the observation of an absence or limitation of heel strike at initial contact of the gait cycle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Toe walking has been acknowledged as a symptom of disease processes, trauma and/or neurogenic influences, and when there is no identifiable medical cause of the gait pattern, it is labelled idiopathic toe walking (ITW).</p><p>In publications of paediatric gait development, children's ability to walk on their toes during the development of gait has been described as a natural and non-compulsory part of gait development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> There is no report of why toe walking has been observed, and nor are there subsequent studies conclusively proving a reason for its continuation in the absence of a medical diagnosis.</p><p>The incidence of ITW has been reported to be present in up to 7% of the general paediatric population in some small studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> However, owing to a small sample and variance in cultural influences, it may be presumed that there is no agreement on the true prevalence of ITW. There is strong agreement within the literature of a positive family history and no single sex dominance for children who have an ITW gait.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>ITW and its relationship to equinus have been discussed in the literature. The suggestion that equinus is secondary to the development of this gait abnormality is common, yet unproven.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> The effectiveness of equinus treatment has been the focus of several studies in children with an ITW gait. The presence of ITW into adolescence and beyond has now been highlighted both in long-term case-controlled studies and within case reports leading to conflicting opinions on the necessity of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> The long-term effect ITW has on the foot and ankle has not been definitively established; however, there is prolific research of equinus and its negative impact on the foot and its function as well as changes in gait in adults and the elderly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11 R12">9&#x02013;12</xref> There is limited research on many of the conservative treatment options for ITW including orthotics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> and footwear.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> These treatment options have only been reported within case studies or author opinion pieces and it is not fully understood how these treatment options are thought to minimise the toe walking gait. Studies in normal gait and the paediatric foot have found that footwear provides a tactile input that may change the neurological input, which may in turn change the gait pattern. Footwear also has a mechanical influence at the foot which affects stride length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> and motion of the subtala, midtarsal and ankle joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> and may also change the toe walking pattern. The full-length carbon fibre orthotic may have a mechanical and inhibitory action on the gait pattern, but this is yet to be established. Currently, serial casting,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> and surgical Achilles tendon lengthening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> have the best evidence for improved outcomes.</p><p>There is no research on the impact of whole body vibration on gait in children with ITW. Recent research into whole body vibration has found that short bursts of vibration have a positive effect on muscle length and strength.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> As many children who have an ITW gait also have equinus, it is unknown if the whole body vibration will provide a short-term muscle change, thus impacting the gait style. Children with ITW have also been reported to have sensory processing challenges, particularly with vibration as a tactile stimulus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> It is unknown if whole body vibration will have a neuro-modulation effect on the gait style and heel strike.</p><p>The primary objective of this research was to measure the spatial (or distance) and temporal (or timing) parameters of gait in children who have been diagnosed with ITW and examine if any changes in gait are the result of three different external stimuli. The interventions chosen, footwear, orthotic and vibration, are thought to provide external stimuli by means of tactile stimuli, a mechanical inhibitor or vibration stimuli. Any gait changes observed by these measures are important for clinicians working with children with this gait pattern and for further research into long-term interventions. The evidence for conservative treatment for ITW is in deficit; therefore, without this base knowledge of the short-term impacts of different external stimuli, future clinical trials are unable to be explored and designed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study protocol</title><p>This study protocol was finalised on 21 January 2013 and is V.1.2.

In recommended doses, BoNT-A is very safe with a very low complication rate. There have been reports of local complications, including pain at the injection site and local muscle weakness, which is a direct effect of the BoNT-A, and when it occurs, it is always temporary, lasting up to a few weeks. Systemic complications may also include a short-lived &#x02018;flu-like illness which may last 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;days. In larger doses, regional complications may occur such as bladder incontinence when upper leg injections are performed and swallowing difficulties when proximal upper limb or neck injections are performed. In children with severe cerebral palsy GMFCS V, there have been a small number of deaths worldwide associated with injections of large doses of BoNT-A given under general anaesthetic. The cause of these deaths is not clear.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33 R34 R35">33&#x02013;35</xref> Each of these treatments has a greater potential for complications that may impact the child's function in the short-term or long-term compared with conservative measures such as a change in footwear and/or orthotic therapy.</p><p>There is limited evidence of conservative measures having a positive impact on ITW gait and no evidence to support the use of whole body vibration. Authors reporting the use of orthotics with or without specific footwear are anecdotal reports of author opinion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> or have limited participant numbers within a case study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> of which has also not been published in peer reviewed media.

The results of this study will be published following full recruitment and completion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e207" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002389.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e208" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002389.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold>
