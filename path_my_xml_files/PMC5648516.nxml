The role, status, and education of women are fundamentally important facets of development. Thus, understanding the interaction of women&#x02019;s educational level and the response to interventions is important. Therefore, we examined the impact of educational level of household adults on&#x000a0;responses to a livestock-based community intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Six pair-matched communities in 3 districts of Nepal (Chitwan/Nawalparasi/Nuwakot), were randomly assigned to receive community development activities via women&#x02019;s self-help groups at baseline or 1&#x000a0;year later. At 6 intervals over 48&#x000a0;months, a 125- item questionnaire addressing family demographics and child health/nutrition was completed in each household, plus child growth monitoring. Results were analyzed in relation to the highest education attained by <italic>any</italic> woman in the household, the child&#x02019;s mother, men, or any other adult in the household.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Outcomes (wealth, water/toilet availability, child diet diversity and growth) all significantly related to adult education. However, notable differences were found comparing the impact of men&#x02019;s and women&#x02019;s education. Percent change in wealth score was significant only in households where women had primary or secondary education (respectively, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.0009 and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001). Increased soap use related only to women&#x02019;s education (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001). When adjusted for group assignment, baseline income, wealth, and animal scores, higher women&#x02019;s education was significantly associated with increased household wealth (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001), better child height-for-age z scores (HAZ, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.005), and improved child diet diversity (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.01). Higher mother&#x02019;s education predicted better child HAZ (primary, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.01, secondary, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.03) and diet diversity (primary, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.05, secondary, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001).

Moreover, households where the mother&#x02019;s education was better than the best-educated man also were significantly more likely to have children with better HAZ and dietary diversity (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.03, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001). Thus, the educational level of women and mothers had the broadest impact on child outcome variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Household characteristics vary among participants in most community development projects. Of these, adult education likely mediates response to the inputs provided by the intervention. Particularly in interventions directed towards women, better education may enhance the ability of households to put interventions into practice, thus improving wealth, hygiene, and child diet and growth indices.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>United States Agency for International Development (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>AID-OAA-L-1-00006</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to poverty in the developing world, although more complicated to implement, are more likely to result in sustained improvement in household and individual economic status than programs with a single focus. Such strategies have been the basis for many programs which seek to link agriculture-based interventions, household wealth, and child nutrition outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although some successes have been reported, the links between household wealth and child growth status are not automatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At a national level, marked differences exist between the prevalence of stunting and GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; at the household level, a complex relationship exists between income and child nutritional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although improved socioeconomic status could improve nutritional status by creating a healthier environment (with more access to medical care, clean water, and sanitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) or more diverse diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], increased household income may not always be directed toward child health needs or providing optimal foods for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Some of these differences may be explained by gender empowerment, behavior change (at the community and household level), and control over household resources.</p><p id="Par6">Previously, we evaluated the impact of a livestock-based livelihoods intervention on child growth and diet outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The intervention, conducted by <italic>Heifer International Nepa</italic>
<italic>l</italic>, consisted of a strong social capital development program, but without a specific nutrition or health focus or <italic>any</italic> emphasis on child-specific outcomes. In the initial analysis of this dataset, duration of exposure to the Heifer intervention was associated with improved household wealth, child growth, and child diet . However, more detailed analysis at the household level revealed a range of different outcomes: some families benefitted greatly while the conditions of other families did not improve, or even worsened. This finding prompted our search for an explanation. Recent findings highlight that the effectiveness of interventions depends a great deal on household-level exposure to and uptake of the goods and services on offer to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The degree of uptake is mediated by a wide range of household and individual characteristics, including baseline wealth, sources of income, demographics, and extent of participation, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We sought a reasonable explanation for the discrepant outcomes by examining the impact of the wide range of educational achievements of women in our project area.</p><p id="Par7">A key element much discussed in the existing literature is the role of gender empowerment. While level of household income matters, how and by whom it is used can matter more. While technologies may offer enhanced productivity in agriculture, if they cannot be used by women who are heavily engaged in agriculture, then adoption of these practices may be limited. In any case, the impact on children&#x02019;s well-being may be less if women are not involved. In other words, the role, status, knowledge and education of women in the household are fundamentally important facets of development, and often a deciding factor in the success or failure of programs supporting improved diets and nutrition for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, many programs focus their intervention efforts on women. Thus, understanding the interaction of women&#x02019;s educational level and the response to the intervention is important. The relative lack of attention to women&#x02019;s educational level and intervention outcomes is surprising, given the growing international focus on the importance of female education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Maternal education affects the well-being of children in many ways, specifically in protecting against mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], improving child health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and growth (height) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, little is known about how women&#x02019;s educational attainments &#x02013; or that of other members of the family - may influence household responses to community-level interventions over time. We hypothesized that the level of educational attainment by adults in the household, particularly of women, predicted longitudinal changes in specific household variables (wealth and income, household amenities and hygiene practices) and important child outcomes (health, growth, and dietary diversity). The goal was to identify characteristics of women and their households (including the educational attainments of other family members) conducive to successful program outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics, consent and permissions</title><p id="Par9">This study was approved by the Nepal Health Research Council (Reference Numbers 845 and 901) and Tufts University.

The intervention was implemented by <italic>Heifer International</italic>, an international non-governmental organization (NGO) which seeks to eliminate poverty via livestock-based community development programs. Services and inputs are provided to targeted communities at the request of local NGOs, which interact with Village Development Committees (VDCs). For purposes of this study, 3 pairs of communities were identified in each district, matched based on geographic location (including altitude), size of population, type of natural resources, local employment opportunities, health care facilities, type of agriculture, and other socioeconomic features such as caste, income and education level. Known local health risks (e.g. lead exposure, iodine deficiency) were also taken into account in the matching process. In each community, local leaders served on an advisory panel and as liaisons to the population about the project activities. Families within each community were invited to participate. <italic>Heifer International</italic> attempts to include all households for participation in the intervention: participation rates exceeded 90% of households in each study site.</p><p id="Par11">A staggered intervention design was used (previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The paired communities were randomly assigned to receive Heifer development activities either immediately (Group 1) or 12&#x000a0;months later (Group 2). Data collection was conducted at baseline, every six months through 24&#x000a0;months, and again at 48&#x000a0;months. Thus, Heifer activities began in Group 1 communities after the baseline survey; these activities continued through the entire 48&#x000a0;months. Heifer activities began in Group 2 communities 12&#x000a0;months later, continuing through to 48&#x000a0;months. Group 1 and Group 2 communities were non-adjacent to minimize &#x0201c;spill-over&#x0201d; effects.</p><p id="Par12">Data collection was performed by a local field research NGO (Nepal Technical Assistance Group) not connected to Heifer. Field supervisors monitored the performance and activities of the Field Enumerators, and conducted daily reviews of the data collection to allow rapid identification and correction of errors and omissions. Enumerators were trained at the beginning of the project with 1&#x000a0;week of orientation to the project, followed by field pilot testing in 3 villages not included in the project sites, and ongoing quality control and refresher training activities to monitor and maintain inter-observer reliability. Enumerators were blinded to the assignment at baseline of Groups 1 and 2. At each field visit, enumerators completed a 116-item questionnaire with the female head of household (or her designee, in &#x0003c;3% of 2115 household interviews conducted). The questionnaire was based on standardized tools used in the Demographic and Health Survey conducted by the Government of Nepal (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. At all 6 time points, data collection also included anthropometric measurements and health information on all enrolled children (described below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par13">The intervention consisted of an intensive 12&#x000a0;month program of participatory community development led by Heifer staff, focusing on tools for poverty alleviation (particularly via optimization of livestock management), citizen empowerment, and community development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] These activities are based in women&#x02019;s Self-Help groups, which meet weekly or biweekly with a trained facilitator to discuss local and personal issues in the context of values training, gender and family issues, social mobilization, group strengthening, microcredit, and enterprise development. At the conclusion of the 12&#x000a0;month curriculum, each participating household receives 2 meat-type goats. Notably, the Heifer training curriculum is not specifically individualized for participants with different educational backgrounds, and neither child diet nor household hygiene practices are specifically addressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par14">All members of each participating family were enrolled in the study. Children between ages 6&#x000a0;months and 8&#x000a0;years who resided in participating families were evaluated in more detail, with anthropometry, diet recall, and health survey. Child age was verified by inspection of the birth certificate or vaccine card. Children who &#x0201c;aged in&#x0201d; to the entry criteria were enrolled in the study at the first visit at which they were eligible. Children who &#x0201c;aged out&#x0201d; of the study were followed for the duration of the study. The targeted age for this study was children 6&#x02013;60&#x000a0;months. Children with physical disabilities including blindness, deafness, inability to crawl or walk as appropriate for age, inability to communicate in an age-appropriate manner, obvious birth defects, or neurologic handicaps that prevented ingestion of a normal diet for age were excluded from enrollment. In addition, children with severe inter-current illnesses at the time of survey (e.g., high fever, severe diarrhea, or other symptoms which parents considered would make the child&#x02019;s participation too difficult) were excluded from that round of data collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Educational level of adults in households</title><p id="Par15">At each visit, the educational attainments of all adult household members (over 15&#x000a0;years of age) were reviewed, and categorized as (1) none, (2) literacy classes/non-formal education only, (3) some primary school, (4) completed primary school, (5) some secondary school, (6) completed secondary school, or beyond. These were then compressed to three categories: (1) none or basic, (2) some or completed primary school, and (3) some or completed secondary school (or beyond). Outcome measures were analyzed in several ways: (1) in relation to the highest educational level attained by <italic>any</italic> woman in the household. In these conjoint households, this was justified by the assumption that women within the same household worked together to share their knowledge and expertise, and that more educated women were likely to influence less educated women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similar analyses addressed the impact of the highest educational level attained by the (2) child&#x02019;s mother, (3) <italic>any</italic> man in the household, and also by (4) <italic>any</italic> individual in the household (either male or female).

The 17 food items were aggregated into seven groups (starchy staples: grains and white potatoes); vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables; other fruits and vegetables; organ meat, meat, and fish; eggs; legumes, nuts, and seeds; milk and dairy products) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This recall was collected 6 times over 48&#x000a0;months; the results were incorporated into the &#x0201c;Dietary Diversity Score&#x0201d; as an outcome variable for regression analysis (described below). In addition, a binary indicator was constructed to reflect the child&#x02019;s consumption of animal source foods (meat, fish, eggs, or dairy) in the previous 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par23">Data were entered and analyzed using JMP 11.1 (Cary, NC) and STATA version 12.0 (College Station, TX).

Women&#x02019;s educational status, time period of exposure to the intervention, and baseline measures of household income, socio-economic status, and animal ownership were set as fixed effects, and data time point and household (or child) as random effects. A mixed effect model was constructed, with between-child variation as the random measure and the fixed effect as the variation between Group 1 (early introduction of intervention) and Group 2 (late introduction of intervention). Three models were initially constructed, based on findings in our previously published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As education can be highly correlated with socio-economic status especially in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we adjusted for three different socio-economic measures which could have related to educational status, specifically: wealth score (household durable assets), animal score, and income. The first model was adjusted for baseline wealth and animal scores, the second was adjusted for baseline wealth only, while the third one was adjusted for baseline income, wealth, and animal scores. Income was not significantly associated with outcome variables so this was eliminated from the model. Group assignment was maintained in all models.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Regression models</title><p id="Par35">Next, various regression models explored the relationships between household characteristics and child and household outcomes (child: HAZ, WAZ, dietary diversity, number of days of illness, incidence of diarrhea, incidence of any illness [diarrhea, respiratory, fever]; household: wealth score, hygiene practice [related to child defecation]), adjusting for group assignment and varying combinations of baseline wealth score, animal score, and income. Results were nearly identical with all permutations of adjustments; the findings with adjustments for group assignment, baseline wealth and animal scores are shown. Separate regressions targeted the influence of educational level of women, mother&#x02019;s, men, or the highest educational achiever in the household, regardless of gender. Higher women&#x02019;s educational levels were significantly associated with higher child HAZ scores, household wealth scores, and child diet diversity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Higher mother&#x02019;s education was significantly associated with higher child HAZ and diet diversity. (As virtually all households had more than one mother, mother&#x02019;s education was not assessed in relation to household wealth). Higher men&#x02019;s educational levels were significantly associated with household wealth score and child diet diversity, but not child HAZ, and the highest educational attainment of any household member was associated only with household wealth score. Moreover, households where the mother&#x02019;s education (but not that of other women) was better than the best-educated man also were significantly more likely to have children with better HAZ and dietary diversity (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.03, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

However, this important household characteristic is usually treated as a variable to be controlled, and rarely examined directly. We hypothesized that adult educational level, particularly that of women, would be a key factor in determining child and household outcomes. In this community-level, livelihoods-based intervention implemented via women&#x02019;s self-help groups<italic>,</italic> women&#x02019;s educational level predicted household wealth score at 48&#x000a0;months as well as the magnitude of change in household wealth during the study period. Although men&#x02019;s educational level also predicted the 48&#x000a0;month household wealth score, this impact appeared later in the course of the intervention and furthermore did not relate to the extent of change. In some households, most notably in households where men had the lowest level of education, a decrease in average wealth score between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months was observed. We speculate that these &#x0201c;more vulnerable&#x0201d; households may have experienced economic shocks during this time, causing the families to sell assets (for example to finance out-migration or to purchase consumable goods).</p><p id="Par37">Household hygiene practices, particularly soap use, access to water, improved toilets, and child defecation practices, also related to women&#x02019;s educational level, more than to men&#x02019;s. Improvements in sanitation clearly have the potential to improve child linear growth (better HAZ, reduction in stunting) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Soap use was not influenced by men&#x02019;s educational level possibly because men&#x02019;s educational level did not determine the women&#x02019;s personal practices.</p><p id="Par38">Women&#x02019;s educational level, and more particularly the educational level of the child&#x02019;s mother, also predicted two child-focused outcomes: HAZ and diet diversity. These child outcomes were of considerable interest, particularly as they were not the targets of the intervention. Only one of these outcomes, child diet diversity, was predicted by men&#x02019;s education.</p><p id="Par39">In this population, considerable improvement in growth was observed over the 48&#x000a0;months of observation, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Stunting significantly decreased only in households where a man or any adult had secondary education. Wasting decreased only in households where a man or any adult had secondary education, or where women had primary or secondary education. While higher men&#x02019;s educational level related to greater decreases in stunting overall, higher women&#x02019;s or higher mother&#x02019;s educational level specifically related to a significant better HAZ scores after adjusting for area, and baseline wealth, income, and animal ownership. Likewise, women&#x02019;s or mother&#x02019;s educational level predicted diet diversity, after controlling for these potential confounders. Furthermore, both child HAZ and child dietary diversity were better in households where mother&#x02019;s education was higher than that of the most educated man, compared to households where the level of mother&#x02019;s education and the most educated man were equal. Improvement in growth results from the complex interactions of multiple factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our results support the premise that adult educational levels &#x02013; especially of the mother - may influence these dynamics.</p><p id="Par40">The relation of educational level, particularly of women, and other household or personal characteristics has been studied in many other contexts. Interestingly, the relationship between socio-economic status or income, and women&#x02019;s education has been judged as &#x0201c;weak&#x0201d;: several meta-analyses and systematic reviews report r<sup>2</sup> values ranging from .22&#x02013;.50 for these variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, in a comprehensive review of 915 censuses and nationally representative surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>],women&#x02019;s educational attainments were linked to reductions in fertility and child mortality. The authors concluded that about half the global reduction in child mortality during the past four decades can be attributed to improvements in educational attainment in young women. Maternal education has also been correlated with various specific markers of child health, although researchers caution that a causal relationship is &#x0201c;far from established&#x0201d;, as in national surveys, education acts as a proxy for geographic area of residence and family socio-economic status (for example, more educated and wealthier individuals tend to live in cities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In a systematic survey of DHS surveys in 22 countries, controls for access to piped water and toilet (and husband&#x02019;s education) attenuated the impact of maternal education on infant mortality and child height-for-age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Maternal education remained significant only for child&#x02019;s immunization status after controlling for individual and community-level factors; this relationship was found in only half of the countries studied.</p><p id="Par42">Maternal (and to a lesser extent, paternal) education has been strongly linked to child height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and there have been recommendations to improve women&#x02019;s educational status and empowerment as a means to reduce the burden of child stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The causal links between parental education and child growth or other outcomes is not completely understood. Specific child feeding practices may be more optimal in women with more education, as has been shown in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Additionally, longitudinal analysis of DHS data in Bangladesh demonstrates that the combined effects of wealth accumulation at the household level and improvements in parental education over time are linked to reductions in child undernutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A study in Nepal suggests that women&#x02019;s education, even in poor quality schools, may &#x0201c;provide women with credentials for higher status, liberation from traditional family constraints, and modern ideas and attitudes&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, behavior change communication may be more effective among more educated women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], possibly related to their better ability to understand these messages, or to their status in influencing household behaviors.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p id="Par43">Our study had several strengths and weaknesses. We were able to follow 431 households over 4&#x000a0;years, collecting detailed household and other information. Dietary diversity was obtained using a single 24&#x000a0;h recall at each survey time; this may represent a limitation of the study. The assignment of educational attainment into three general categories was done to facilitate analysis, but it might have obscured some subtle relationships. We did not specifically search for a threshold effect for educational achievement and household outcomes, nor did we examine the quality of education. We recognize that counting the number of years of education is an imperfect indicator of true educational achievement. However, the data suggests a gradient effect of educational level, such as has been previously described between SES and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">For purposes of this analysis we focused on the highest educational level achieved by any woman in the household, but also separately analyzed the impact of the mother&#x02019;s education. In these conjoint families, an average of 2.84&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.92 (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD) women lived together, sharing household and other chores and to a great extent, sharing child care duties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We assumed that higher educated women might have an influential voice in making some of the necessary household decisions. However, we did not test this directly, nor did we measure women&#x02019;s empowerment or the degree to which they participated in the intervention activities. We also were unable to directly measure participation in household decision making according to local community rules (for example, the differences between grandmothers and young mothers in making decisions related to the child). Regardless, the level of education of the child&#x02019;s mother as well as of other women in the household predicted the child&#x02019;s HAZ and dietary diversity (both <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05). While household decision-making is complex in these conjoint families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], it is clear that women&#x02019;s education is strongly linked to these important child outcomes.</p><p id="Par45">We also found that men&#x02019;s educational level was important. This measure correlated strongly with women&#x02019;s education, but notably did not relate to child HAZ scores, even after adjusting for group assignment, baseline wealth score, income, and baseline animal score. Men&#x02019;s education also did not predict the change from baseline in household wealth score, whereas women&#x02019;s educational level did. In our analysis, we focused on women&#x02019;s and mother&#x02019;s education as the intervention specifically targeted women and was implemented via women&#x02019;s self-help groups.</p><p id="Par46">We recognize that in these communities, educational achievement was not necessarily related to intelligence. Complex social factors determine the educational opportunities for women in these rural Nepali communities where boy&#x02019;s education has historically been favored. Thus, the associations we observed could be related to other unmeasured factors, including personality or family characteristics that make a girl more likely to attend school, or on the other hand, such problems as social isolation or stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">We found convincing evidence that women&#x02019;s educational level related to changes over time in household wealth score, hygiene practices, child linear growth, and child diet diversity, even after adjusting for group assignment, baseline wealth score, income, and baseline animal score. The community-level intervention focused on livestock management. It is plausible that the better educated women may have been better able to put these interventions into practice, thus improving their household wealth. Wealth accumulation at the household level may have allowed more educated women to influence child-care practices, resulting in improved hygiene, child growth, and diet. The intervention did not specifically address these areas, but rather focused on wealth generation and community development. However, women&#x02019;s influence over these health/nutrition related variables may suggest that as households improved their access to resources through the livestock project, more educated women were better able to influence their households to invest in changed behaviors. Specific assessment of household decision-making practices might provide further insight into this pathway. Alternately, women&#x02019;s education may represent a proxy for some other household factor that allowed families to benefit from the intervention. Regardless, the educational level of mothers and women in the household was strongly linked to important child outcomes, specifically HAZ and diet diversity. While men&#x02019;s educational was also important to child and household outcomes, the key role of women&#x02019;s education was particularly notable. The relationships between educational achievements of individual household members and gender roles are complex, particularly within the context of specific family and cultural practices. The contributions of these factors to children&#x02019;s feeding patterns and nutritional status merit examination in future studies. In addition, further investigation of the relationship between women&#x02019;s educational level and response to agricultural and other interventions may enhance understanding of ways to assist households with lower educational attainments and the mechanisms by which these interventions are adopted by households.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Meghan Kershaw, Robert Houser, and Sumanta Neupane for statistical support.
