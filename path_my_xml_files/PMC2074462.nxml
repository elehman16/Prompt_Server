Treatment allocation was randomly 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg orally b.d. Eight patients were not assessable for response. All patients were evaluated for toxicity (intent-to-treat analysis). In general, the patients' characteristics were well balanced between the three randomised groups. The endocrine data from this study previously reported suggest a dose-related suppression of oestrone, but not oestradiol or oestrone sulphate. The objective response rate was 17% (95% CI 8.9-27.3%) with no complete responders. Fifteen patients (21%) had stable disease (NC) and 45 patients (63%) had progressive disease (PD). The median duration of objective response was 36 weeks. The median time to treatment failure was 12.7 weeks. The log-rank test showed no statistical difference between the dosage groups. The main adverse events reported were mild to moderate severity: nausea in 11 patients (15%), hot flashes in four (5%) and somnolence in three (4%). No serious adverse events were reported. In conclusion, fadrozole is a clinically active aromatase inhibitor with a low incidence of side-effects and phase III clinical trials in post-menopausal women are currently under way.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="539" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="540" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="541" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="542" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
