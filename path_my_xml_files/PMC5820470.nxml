The antitumor activity of olaratumab has been tested in vitro and in vivo, and inhibition of tumor growth has been observed in cancer cell lines, including glioblastoma and leiomyosarcoma cells. It represents the first-in-class antibody to be approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) in combination with doxorubicin, based on the results of the Phase Ib/II trial by Tap et al. The median progression-free survival (PFS), which was the primary end point of the study, was improved for patients treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin compared to those treated with doxorubicin monotherapy (6.6 vs 4.1 months, respectively; HR 0.672, 95% CI 0.442&#x02013;1.021, <italic>p</italic>=0.0615). Moreover, final analysis of overall survival (OS) showed a median OS of 26.5 months with olaratumab plus doxorubicin vs 14.7 months with doxorubicin, with a gain of 11.8 months (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30&#x02013;0.71, <italic>p</italic>=0.0003). In October 2016, olaratumab was admitted in the Accelerated Approval Program by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with STSs. In November 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted conditional approval for olaratumab in the same indication under its Accelerated Assessment Program. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase III study (ANNOUNCE trial, NCT02451943) is being performed in order to confirm the survival advantage of olaratumab and to provide definitive drug confirmation by regulators. The study is ongoing, but enrollment is closed. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the rationale of olaratumab in the treatment of advanced STSs and its emerging role in clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>anti-PDGFR antibodies</kwd><kwd>soft-tissue sarcoma</kwd><kwd>PDGFR&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>doxorubicin</kwd><kwd>olaratumab</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) represent a group of rare mesenchymal tumors derived from connective tissues,<xref rid="b1-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> which can arise from any site within the body, such as extremities, retroperitoneum, uterus, trunk, and head and neck.</p><p>STSs are heterogeneous diseases that are classified into more than 50 subtypes with different molecular, histological, and clinical characteristics.

The aim of this study was to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of olaratumab. Patients were enrolled into five dose-escalating cohorts of three to six patients each. Olaratumab was administered intravenously weekly at 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg (cohorts 1&#x02013;3) or once every other week at 15 or 20 mg/kg (cohorts 4&#x02013;5), with 4 weeks/cycle. The study was conducted from December 2006 to March 2009, and totally, 19 patients were treated in five cohorts. Among all cohorts, the median number of infusions was 9 (range 1.0&#x02013;54.0) and the median treatment duration was 12.1 weeks (range 1.0&#x02013;57.9 weeks). Interestingly, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed during the study, and therefore, the MTD was not identified. The most common adverse events (AEs) considered at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to olaratumab were fatigue and infusion-related reactions (IRRs; 10.5% each). With the exception of one patient (enrolled in the 20 mg/kg cohort) experiencing two grade 3 drug-related AEs (increased alkaline phosphatase) after assessment period of DLTs, all drug-related AEs were of grade 1 or 2. Following multiple doses, the trough concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub>) for 16 mg/kg weekly and 20 mg/kg biweekly were &#x0003e;155 &#x003bc;g/mL, which was the efficacious concentration in animal xenograft models. Regarding efficacy measurements, there were no complete responses (CRs) or partial responses (PRs) in this study, but 12 (63.2%) patients had a best response of stable diseases (SDs) with a median duration of 3.9 months (95% CI 2.3&#x02013;8.7 months). The authors concluded that olaratumab was well tolerated and showed preliminary antitumor activity. Identified RP2Ds were both 16 mg/kg weekly and 20 mg/kg biweekly.</p><p>The second Phase I trial<xref rid="b48-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> was a single-center, open-label, dose-escalation study conducted in Japanese patients with advanced/refractory solid malignancies. The primary objective was to establish the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of olaratumab. Three to six patients were enrolled into each of three cohorts: patients received intravenous olaratumab at 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (cohort 1), 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks (cohort 2), and 15 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (cohort 3). Doses were escalated from cohort 1 through cohort 3. A total of 16 patients were treated across three cohorts, and the median duration of treatment was 13.1 weeks (range 7.0&#x02013;13.6 weeks), 6.0 weeks (range 3.0&#x02013;13.4 weeks), and 7.0 weeks (range 7.0&#x02013;25.1 weeks) in cohort 1, cohort 2, and cohort 3, respectively.</p><p>Similar to the previous Phase I trial conducted in Caucasian patients, there were no DLTs; thus, the MTD was not reached. The most frequently reported olaratumab-related events across the three cohorts included proteinuria (25.0%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels (12.5%), while no IRRs were reported. Based on the pharmacokinetic concentration profile of olaratumab, the trough concentrations following single and multiple doses at 15 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (cohort 3) and multiple doses at 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks (cohort 2) were above the 155 &#x003bc;g/mL target. Regarding efficacy, like in the other Phase I trial, the best overall response was SD. The disease control rate (CRs + PRs + SDs) was 66.7% in cohort 1, 42.9% in cohort 2, and 33.3% in cohort 3. The median duration of SD was 2.8 months in cohort 1 and cohort 2 and 4.9 months in cohort 3. Thus, the authors concluded that olaratumab had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated, and the aforementioned two doses represent an acceptable schedule for future trials in Japanese patients.</p><p>Therefore, olaratumab safety profile emerging from Phase I monotherapy trials was consistent with its toxicology profile and the toxicity profile observed in patients with advanced-stage solid tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase Ib/II studies</title><p>On the basis of the favorable safety profile from the Phase I studies and preclinical data regarding olaratumab combination with doxorubicin in human sarcoma xenograft models,<xref rid="b39-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b45-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Tap et al<xref rid="b26-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> performed a multicentric, open-label Phase Ib and randomized Phase II study of doxorubicin alone or doxorubicin plus olaratumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic STSs, previously untreated with an anthracycline.</p><p>The enrollment of Phase Ib&#x02013;Phase II ran from October 2010 to January 2013.</p><p>The primary end point of Phase Ib was safety and that of Phase II was PFS, while OS, RR, safety, and pharmacokinetics were secondary end points.</p><p>In the Phase Ib part of the study, patients received olaratumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1 and day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle up to eight cycles.

After completion of eight cycles of doxorubicin, patients in the combination group could receive olaratumab monotherapy until disease progression, while patients in the doxorubicin-alone group were observed and could receive olaratumab monotherapy after disease progression.</p><p>Overall, 15 patients were enrolled and treated in the Phase Ib part of the study. In the Phase II portion, a total of 129 patients (out of 133 randomized patients) received at least one dose of the investigational therapy, including 64 patients who received the combination of olaratumab and doxorubicin (investigational arm) and 65 patients who received doxorubicin alone (control arm). A total of 30 patients treated in the control arm received olaratumab monotherapy after discontinuing doxorubicin, as permitted by the protocol. Baseline characteristics were well balanced in the two groups, except for a slight predominance of women in the investigational arm. Approximately 40% of patients were in the first-line setting; the remaining sample had performed at least one treatment line. The most represented histological subtypes were leiomyosarcoma (36% of patients in the investigational arm and 40% of patients in the control arm), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and liposarcoma.</p><p>The Phase II primary end point was PFS. It was 6.6 months (95% CI 4.1&#x02013;8.3 months) for patients treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 4.1 months (95% CI 2.8&#x02013;5.4 months) for those treated with doxorubicin monotherapy. This PFS improvement in favor of the experimental arm met the protocol-defined significance level of 0.1999 for final PFS (stratified HR 0.672, 95% CI 0.442&#x02013;1.021, <italic>p</italic>=0.0615). Moreover, the most relevant finding of this study was the significant improvement in OS, which was a secondary end point, for patients treated in the experimental arm: final analysis of OS, performed after 91 (71%) patients had died in the intention-to-treat population, showed a median OS of 26.5 months (95% CI 20.9&#x02013;31.7 months) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin vs 14.7 months (95% CI 9.2&#x02013;17.1 months) with doxorubicin, with a gain of 11.8 months (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30&#x02013;0.71, <italic>p</italic>=0.0003). This impressive benefit was consistent across the subgroup stratification factors, including histological tumor type (leiomyosarcoma vs non-leiomyosarcoma), number of previous treatments, and PDGFR&#x003b1; expression. PDGFR&#x003b1; expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry, did not show any predictive value on efficacy.</p><p>No difference in terms of objective RR was observed, which was 18.2% (9.8%&#x02013;29.6%) for patients in the experimental arm compared with 11.9% (5.3&#x02013;22.2) for patients in the control arm (<italic>p</italic>=0.3421).</p><p>AEs were more frequent with combination therapy vs doxorubicin alone and included neutropenia (58% vs 35%, respectively), mucositis (53% vs 35%, respectively), nausea (73% vs 52%, respectively), vomiting (45% vs 18%, respectively), and diarrhea (34% vs 23%, respectively). Grade 3 febrile neutropenia rate was similar in both groups (experimental arm 13% vs control arm 14%). The number of IRRs in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin arm was 13% vs 0% for doxorubicin. Cardiac toxicity is an expected risk of doxorubicin treatment, in particular with increasing cumulative exposure; however, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction in Phase II portion of the study was similar between the two treatment arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Ongoing trials</title><p>An ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase III study (ANNOUNCE trial, NCT02451943)<xref rid="b49-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> was planned in order to confirm the survival advantage of olaratumab and to provide definitive drug confirmation by regulators. The primary end point of the study was OS, with an enrolled population of 460 patients. From August 2015 to June 2017, patients with unresectable or metastatic STSs were randomized to receive olaratumab plus doxorubicin vs placebo plus doxorubicin, with the same schedule used in the Phase II trial. The study is still ongoing, but the enrollment is closed. The first efficacy results are expected in 2019, and the study is expected to be completed in 2020. The Phase III ANNOUNCE study will enroll a higher number of patients compared with the Phase Ib/II trial, which will make the study more powerful and may help to detect tissue biomarkers to predict survival in treated patients. Preliminary data from post hoc biomarker analysis failed to identify a significant association between PDGFR&#x003b1; or PDGFR&#x003b2; expression and OS or PFS in patients included in Tap et al&#x02019;s Phase Ib/II study of doxorubicin with or without olaratumab.

Olaratumab is supplied in single-use vials containing 500 mg/50 mL (10 mg/mL) solution, and it is administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg via intravenous infusion over 60 min; for patients requiring higher doses, the duration of infusion should be increased such that the maximum infusion rate of 25 mg/minute is not exceeded. The approved recommended dose and schedule of treatment is 15 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on day 1 and day 8 of each 21-day cycle, in combination with 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of doxorubicin on day 1 following the olaratumab infusion, for up to eight cycles of treatment or until the patient experiences an unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, followed by olaratumab mono-therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.<xref rid="b57-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="b58-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Premedication with intravenous diphenhydramine and dexamethasone can be administered on day 1 of the first cycle.</p><p>Maximum serum concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) are reached in a median time of 2 hours after the start of the infusion, and the drug reaches steady state during the third cycle.

This study substantially confirmed the data from Tap et al analysis, showing a linear drug disposition due to full target saturation at the dose levels tested. Moreover, tumor burden seemed to be associated with a higher clearance (CL).</p><p>The mechanism of action of olaratumab has been well defined, as a specific PDGFR&#x003b1; ligand and receptor dimerization and signaling blocker. Moreover, the internalization of olaratumab-bound PDGFR&#x003b1; dimer may further contribute to drug activity.</p><p>As demonstrated by preclinical sarcoma models, the PDGFR&#x003b1; inhibition is necessary but not sufficient for durable control of cell growth. In fact, the antitumor activity of olaratumab is enhanced by co-administration with doxorubicin or cisplatin. Thus, combination with other targeted agents or chemotherapy drugs may be the future scenario of olaratumab clinical application.<xref rid="b60-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="b61-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></p><p>An additional possible mechanism under investigation is the increased tumor cell permeability to doxorubicin due to olaratumab inhibition of PDGFR&#x003b1; in stromal cells.<xref rid="b62-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p><p>This pharmacodynamic interaction may reduce the number of doxorubicin plus olaratumab cycles compared to the eight administrations of doxorubicin expected from the trial of Tap et al.<xref rid="b26-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In fact, this schedule leads to 600 mg doxorubicin/m<sup>2</sup> cumulative dose, which is not recommended in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Olaratumab, a first-in-class monoclonal antibody blocking the PDGF/PDGFR&#x003b1; cellular signaling pathway, is the first agent in many years to show a survival advantage for patients with advanced STSs.</p><p>In their randomized, double-blind Phase II trial, Tap et al<xref rid="b26-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> showed a clinically meaningful OS improvement in patients treated with olaratumab and doxorubicin combination vs patients receiving doxorubicin alone, with a median survival gain of 11.8 months, with manageable toxicity: although an increased rate of neutropenia, mucositis, vomiting, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain was observed, these AEs were primarily of grade 2 and, with the exception of febrile neutropenia, severe events were not observed. By contrast, PFS, the primary end point of the study, was extended by only 2.5 months in the olaratumab arm (6.6 months vs 4.1 months in the control arm). These findings suggest a change to the treatment strategy in patients with high-grade, advanced or metastatic, anthracycline-naive STSs in the first-line setting: this was the first time that a monoclonal antibody in combination with doxorubicin was able to influence OS in soft-tissue sarcomas (perhaps also owing to the survival gain obtained by olaratumab maintenance therapy after primary induction with the combination).</p><p>These results appear remarkable also because previous studies evaluating the superiority of combination chemotherapy regimens or histology-tailored therapies vs doxorubicin alone in the first-line setting of advanced/metastatic STSs failed to show any survival advantage.<xref rid="b9-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, OS is a composite end point, influenced by all subsequent treatment administered in the metastatic setting, and the exact effect of various post-study treatments is not easy to define. This aspect will certainly require further investigation, also because PFS for patients enrolled in the study was only marginally influenced, indicating that the greatest benefit for patients enrolled in the combination treatment arm consisted mostly of survival benefits in post-progression survival (PPS).</p><p>Furthermore, PFS, particularly when assessed by RECIST criteria in patients treated with a drug that targets mainly angiogenic pathways, is usually not the best parameter to evaluate the survival gain of the population, as it can be usually observed also in other settings where antiangiogenic drugs are more extensively used, such as in colorectal cancer.<xref rid="b63-ott-11-833" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></p><p>Moreover, some issues, such as the reduced power of the study and the small number of patients included, remain and will be hopefully solved by the Phase III ANNOUNCE study, which has recently completed accrual.</p><p>Another unanswered question is the reason behind the disparity between PFS and OS study end points. Some interesting hypotheses could explain this topic, such as olaratumab may display a long-term modulatory effect on the tumor and stromal microenvironment or possess a synergistic antitumor effect with doxorubicin, even if supporting evidence is currently lacking. To date, studies investigating olaratumab mechanism of action, both as a single-agent therapy and in combination, are required to improve the efficacy of this drug. Several ongoing clinical trials are evaluating olaratumab in combination with other drugs, such as gemcitabine and docetaxel, which may help to clarify if the postulated synergic effect of olaratumab plus chemotherapy is restricted to anthracyclines or could be extended also to other chemotherapeutics.</p><p>Other concerns are raised by possible differences in disease biology between treatment groups, which may impact on the findings of relatively small studies. Some differences between cohorts in the study arms were noticed; for example, the proportion of patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, an aggressive STS subtype, was higher in the doxorubicin monotherapy arm vs the combination arm (21% vs 15%, respectively). Another imbalance also occurred in the &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; disease category (26% in the combination arm vs 9% in the monotherapy arm), and finally, more women were included in the combination arm (61% vs 51%, respectively). These differences between groups might account for the differences observed in terms of OS.</p><p>The effect of olaratumab on the PDGFR pathway also seems to be interesting, even if in the Phase Ib/II study, PDGFR&#x003b1; expression in tumor samples did not show any predictive value on efficacy and, indeed, the authors reported that negative expression of this marker was associated with a favorable outcome, which does not support PDGFR&#x003b1; inhibition in the tumor as the main mechanism of action. However, as confirmed by the authors, the immunohistochemistry assay used to assess PDGFR&#x003b1; expression was not specific; therefore, this issue would require further investigation.</p><p>Olaratumab represents a promising and well-tolerated new anticancer therapy that has demonstrated an unexpected survival benefit in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic STSs who have poor prognosis. Although in the future this combination seems to have the potential to become the new standard of care for first-line treatment of STS patients, the results of the ANNOUNCE confirmatory Phase III trial are warranted in order to confirm these optimistic perspectives and solve the unanswered questions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
