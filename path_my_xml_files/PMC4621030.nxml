Oral uracil and tegafur (UFT)/leucovorin (LV) is widely used as a standard adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer in Japan.

Patients were registered within 6 weeks after surgery and were randomly assigned to receive UFT/LV for 28 of 35 days for 6 months in the control group or for 5 consecutive days per week for 18 months in the study group. The primary end point was the disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>A total of 1071 patients were registered from 233 centers. A statistically significant difference in DFS was not observed between the study group and the control group; the 5-year DFS was 69% in the study group and 69% in the control group. The 5-year OS was 85% in the study group and 85% in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Eighteen-month treatment with UFT/LV did not improve DFS or OS compared with 6-month UFT/LV treatment in patients with stage IIB/III colon cancer.

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment of colon cancer, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy may be used to prevent postoperative recurrence, although not all patients benefit from this treatment. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer is small [<xref rid="MDV358C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and routine use for all patients with stage II is not supported. For high-risk stage II colon cancer, however, adjuvant chemotherapy is considered a reasonable approach [<xref rid="MDV358C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard treatment of stage III colon cancer and has also been recommended for the management of high-risk stage II colon cancer [<xref rid="MDV358C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To date, only 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone and 5-FU plus oxaliplatin have been shown to be useful as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for colon cancer [<xref rid="MDV358C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV358C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>To further improve the outcome of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer, it is necessary to increase dose intensity, and extension of the treatment duration should be considered because 6 months may be insufficient. In studies comparing the usefulness of intravenous 5-FU//leucovorin (LV), oral capecitabine, oral uracil and tegafur (UFT)/LV, and oxaliplatin-based regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy, the duration of treatment was 6 months. Since the rate of recurrence reaches a peak between 1 and 2 years after surgery [<xref rid="MDV358C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="MDV358C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], treatment duration for more than 1 year may suppress recurrences in a larger number of patients. To date, no trial has compared the effectiveness of 6-month to &#x02265;1-year treatment with 5-FU/LV, and the optimum duration of treatment of each regimen remains unknown. Retrospective studies have suggested that long-term FU-based chemotherapy leads to favorable survival outcomes [<xref rid="MDV358C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For long-term treatment, it is necessary to choose therapeutic regimens that are less likely to cause adverse effects and are superior in durability.</p><p>A 5-day treatment +2-day rest regimen of UFT that lasts 12 months was shown to be useful in the NSAS-CC study [<xref rid="MDV358C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Sadahiro et al. reported that a 5-day treatment +2-day rest regimen of UFT was superior with respect to patient compliance and tolerability, and the concentration of 5-FU was maintained at relatively high levels in tumors during the 2-day rest period [<xref rid="MDV358C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. UFT/LV is an oral therapy that was shown to be noninferior to intravenous 5-FU/LV in JCOG0205 [<xref rid="MDV358C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The present phase III study compared 6-month and 18-month durations using UFT/LV to determine whether long-term adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial for patients with high-risk stage II and stage III colon cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdv358_s2"><title>methods</title><sec id="mdv358_s2a"><title>patients</title><p>Patients were eligible if they had undergone radical resection of colorectal cancer with extended (D2 or more) lymph-node dissection and had pathologically complete resection of stage IIB (T4, N0, M0) or stage III cancer of the colon or rectosigmoid according to the tumor&#x02013;node&#x02013;metastasis classification of the International Union against Cancer, sixth edition.

Five weeks of this regimen (5 days of treatment followed by a 2-day rest on Saturday and Sunday) were defined as one course of treatment, and 15 courses (18 months) were administered. After completing the scheduled treatment, patients were followed up with no further treatment until confirmation of metastasis or recurrence.

Therefore, the target sample size was set at 840 patients, assuming that the percentage of ineligible patients would be &#x0223c;5%.</p><p>DFS was defined as the period starting from the day of enrollment and ending on the day of recurrence; the day a cancerous, non-recurrent lesion (either synchronous or metachronous) was detected for the first time after the day of enrollment; or the day of death from any cause, whichever was earlier. The superiority in DFS was verified in all eligible patients using a log-rank test stratified by assignment factors (excluding study site; two-sided, significance level of 5%). For time-to-event analyses, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to estimate the survival rate for each group at each time point, and Greenwood's formula was used to calculate the confidence interval (CI). In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the HR between treatment groups.</p><p>OS was defined as the period from the day of enrollment to the day of death from any cause. OS was analyzed in the same manner as for DFS. Safety was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, by compiling adverse events in the treatment group and comparing standard and investigational treatment groups in terms of the incidence of adverse events.

In Japan, oxaliplatin as adjuvant therapy became available in August 2009; i.e., oxaliplatin was not available at the initiation of this study. Moreover, for long-term treatment &#x02265;6 months, convenience of use and safety are important factors for patients, and 5-FU is preferred due to its convenience and ease of use in routine practice. Therefore, we decided to use UFT/LV, for which the efficacy and safety have been shown to be equivalent to 5-FU/LV in 6-month treatment regimens in the NSABP C06 study, as the investigational drug. None of the clinical studies conducted to date have led to the conclusion that the optimum duration of treatment with fluorinated pyrimidines as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer is 6 months. Therefore, it is considered necessary extending the treatment duration to 1&#x02013;2 years.</p><p>In clinical trials carried out in Japan, 1 year or 2 years of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with UFT alone, the key drug in this study, significantly improved survival rates compared with surgery alone in patients with rectal or colorectal cancer [<xref rid="MDV358C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma, 2 years of UFT monotherapy revealed a significant impact on survival [<xref rid="MDV358C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, most cases of recurrent colon cancer occur in the first 2 years after surgery [<xref rid="MDV358C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the rate of recurrence reaches a peak between 1 and 2 years after surgery [<xref rid="MDV358C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], adjuvant chemotherapy is discontinued within 6 months in many cases, and many recurrent lesions are found after discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy. It is estimated that continuing adjuvant chemotherapy for at least 1 year decreases recurrent events, delaying the timing of recurrence and thereby making the cumulative recurrence rate different from that in patients receiving 6-month treatment.</p><p>Since the 5-year DFS rate was 68.8% in the control group and 68.9% in the study group, statistical superiority was not verified. Although the recurrence and mortality rates at each time point in the study group were thought to be delayed compared with those in the control group, there were no differences in results, suggesting that treatment during the first 6 months determines whether and when recurrence occurs in the study group. Year-to-year changes in DFS in this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv358/-/DC1">supplementary Table S1, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>) show that the rate of recurrence peaks between 1 and 2 years after surgery in both groups, irrespective of the duration of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>Currently, 5-FU (5-FU/LV, capecitabine, UFT/LV, and S-1) and oxaliplatin are the only key drugs for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer. The results of this study suggest that it is difficult to achieve better treatment results even if the same treatment is continued for a long time. Currently, short-course postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is also being tested. The International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy is evaluating whether a 3-month adjuvant therapy is noninferior for the primary parameter to the 6-month identical therapy in patients with colon cancer. If shortened therapy could provide a noninferior treatment outcome, patients would be substantially relieved of the cumulative toxicity burden of oxaliplatin (e.g. peripheral neuropathy and allergic reactions).</p><p>In conclusion, this study, which compared 18 and 6 months of oral UFT/LV treatment, failed to verify the superiority of 18-month treatment over 6-month treatment in either DFS or OS. The important finding from this study is that not 18 months but 6 months of treatment is enough for postoperative UFT/LV for stage IIB/III colon cancer.</p></sec><sec id="mdv358_s5"><title>funding</title><p>The study was funded and conducted by <funding-source>JFMC</funding-source>.
