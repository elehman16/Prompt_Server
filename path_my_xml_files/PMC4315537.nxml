However, few studies have reported the long-term efficacy of three monthly IVB injections and to our best knowledge, no studies have reported the results of treatment with single IVB injections and three monthly IVB injections in two prospective, consecutive groups of patients with ME following BRVO and compared the 1 year efficacy and safety results between these groups. A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study, ie, 25 consecutive eyes of 25 patients initially treated with one IVB injection followed by PRN treatment and 27 consecutive eyes of 27 patients initially treated with three monthly IVB injections followed by PRN treatment.</p><p>The mean logMAR BCVA improved significantly from 0.56 at baseline to 0.33 at month 12 in the single injection group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and from 0.55 at baseline to 0.26 at month 12 in the three-injection group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The current results were similar to those of previous studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-9-175">Table 2</xref>).<xref rid="b12-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Comparing the results among different studies is difficult because of the variations in inclusion criteria and different retreatment criteria. In the current study, 1 year efficacy and safety results were compared between two groups of patients with ME after BRVO (a single IVB injection group and three monthly IVB injection group). The groups were comparable because we prospectively used the same inclusion criteria, the same retreatment criteria, and the same follow-up schedule except for the loading phase. Patients in the two groups were not randomized. However, we believe that the likelihood of sample selection bias was small because consecutive patients in the single-injection group were enrolled from August 2007 to March 2009, and consecutive patients in the three-injection group were enrolled from December 2009 to November 2010. After comparing the results, there was no significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.389) difference between the two groups regarding improvement in the logMAR BCVA.</p><p>Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-9-175">Table 2</xref>),<xref rid="b12-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> we found that the mean CFT decreased significantly from 598 &#x003bc;m at baseline to 348 &#x003bc;m at month 12 in the single-injection group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and from 514 &#x003bc;m at baseline to 293 &#x003bc;m at month 12 in the three-injection group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). There was no significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.101) between-group difference in CFT improvement.</p><p>Krohne et al reported that drug elimination from the aqueous humor closely parallels that from the vitreous and concluded that the aqueous half-life of 1.5 mg of intravitreally injected bevacizumab in humans is 9.82 days.<xref rid="b16-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Miyake et al reported that the half-life of 1.25 mg of intravitreally injected bevacizumab in macaque eyes is 2.8 days in the aqueous humor.<xref rid="b17-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The half-life of bevacizumab is therefore short and retreatment is often required.<xref rid="b16-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the current study, the average number of additional injections was 1.1 in the single-injection group, and re-injections were performed in 19 (76%) eyes during the PRN period. In the three-injection group, the average number of additional injections was 1.3, and re-injections were performed in 16 (59%) eyes during the PRN period. Comparison of results of IVB injection at 12 months between previous studies and the current study is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-9-175">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>It is difficult to compare the mean number of additional injections among different studies because of inter-study variation in inclusion criteria and retreatment criteria. In the current study, the mean number of additional injections was compared between the single-injection group and the three-injection group because the same inclusion and retreatment criteria were used prospectively, and no significant between-group difference in the number of additional injections was shown (<italic>P</italic>=0.507).</p><p>The mean total number of injections was smaller in the single-injection group than the three-injection group (2.1&#x000b1;0.8 vs 4.3&#x000b1;1.4, respectively) because the mean number of additional injections was similar between the two groups. No serious complications developed in either group. Therefore, the single injection protocol was safer and less invasive than the three-injection one.</p><p>The mean CFT in the single-injection group increased at months 2 and 3 and retreatment guidelines prohibited additional injections. There was no significant difference in the logMAR BCVA between the two groups at months 2 and 3 (<italic>P</italic>=0.403 and <italic>P</italic>=0.244, respectively). Increases in the CFT in the short term may not have an immediate effect on BCVA, whereas increases in the CFT in the long term may result in worsening of the BCVA.<xref rid="b19-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The absence of a significant between-group difference in the mean CFT and the logMAR BCVA at month 12 in patients with ME after BRVO indicated that one IVB injection followed by PRN treatment had similar effectiveness to three monthly IVB injections followed by PRN treatment in improving BCVA and CFT. Furthermore, the total number of injections was smaller in the single-injection group than in the three-injection group.</p><p>No complications occurred in our two study groups, but severe side effects occurred in other studies. Minimizing the total number of injections reduces the risk of complications associated with IVB.</p><p>Although circulating VEGF protects the integrity and patency of vessels, prolonged anti-VEGF treatment can increase the risk of thromboembolic events,<xref rid="b20-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-opth-9-175" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and reduced number of injections can lower the risk of serious adverse events.</p><p>Notably, one limitation of our study was the relatively small number of patients with available imaging, possibly preventing our analysis from reaching statistical significance.</p><p>We showed that similar visual outcomes for ME secondary to BRVO may be achieved with fewer injections when one IVB injection is followed by PRN treatment rather than when three IVB injections are followed by PRN treatment; however, a prospective, double-masked, randomized study with a large number of patients is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Supported in part by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (#24592668).
