Once the patient survives the phase of critical illness, he/she may experience numerous complications succeeding Intensive Care Unit (ICU) discharge. The residual problems can manifest as weakness, fatigue, breathlessness, anxiety,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] depression,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] posttraumatic reactions,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and reduced cognitive function which collectively limits activities of daily living and subsequently leads to physical deconditioning. There is growing evidence that ICU survivors experience long-term physical, neurocognitive, and mental health complications directly associated with their experience during ICU stay. This broad spectrum of complications can altogether affect the physical, mental, and social wellbeing of the patient thereby affecting their quality of life. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is made up of physical, psychological, and social domains which interact with each other and patient's perception. Short form 36 (SF-36) is the most widely used scale to assess the quality of life in critically ill patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] As the aftermath of critical illness, complications continues even at home, the quality of life may be compromised which necessitates the need for a hospital based and home-based exercise program after ICU discharge. Therefore, this study proposes a strong need to explore the effect of patient-specific home-based exercise on their quality of life of after being discharged from a critical care setting.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of the study is to determine the effect of individualized home-based exercise on the quality of life post-ICU discharge.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="method" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ethodology</sc></title><p>A total of 144 subjects were screened, and 35 subjects were recruited in this study from medical Intensive Care Units who were invasively mechanically ventilated for 24 h and admitted for more than 48 h in the ICU in a tertiary care hospital between February 2014 and February 2015. Patients with musculoskeletal trauma, neurological deficits, psychological/psychiatric disorders, malignancies, organophosphorus poisoning or substance abuse and having a history of ICU admission in the past 6 months were excluded from the study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Board of Ethics Committee. This study was enrolled in the clinical trial registry (CTRI/2015/09/006199). The license agreement was obtained from Quality Metric, Optum Insight company for using SF-36 version 2 (SF-36 v 2; License No. QM022571). All the eligible subjects were explained the procedure, and a written informed consent was obtained, from the patients who fulfilled the criteria and were willing to participate in the study. Patients were randomized using block randomization into two groups using concealed envelope. The participants in study group followed the medical intervention prescribed by the physician and individualized home-based exercises prescribed by the physiotherapist. The participants of control group followed the medical intervention prescribed by the physician without any formal exercise prescription.</p><p>Demographic data and detailed history of their comorbidities and intensive care unit stay were noted down. SF-36 v 2 questionnaire was administered within 48 h of ICU discharge. During the hospital stay, all participants in study and control group received routine physiotherapy. SF-36 v 2 was again administered in both groups at the time of discharge from the hospital setting. Participants in the study group received the routine physiotherapy in the hospital and underwent 4 weeks of home-based training post discharge. Before discharging from the hospital, these participants received an exercise information sheet and were familiarized with the prescribed exercises. This sheet contained a pictorial representation of the all the prescribed exercises with instructions in participant's preferred language. The exercises included in this sheet were a combination of respiratory and mobility exercises. Respiratory exercises comprised deep breathing exercises, thoracic expansion exercises, incentive spirometer (if available), pursed lip breathing, and forced expiratory maneuvers. Each exercise had to be repeated five times per session. Each session lasted for 15 min. The exercises were performed five times a week. Mobility exercises mainly included active assisted or active exercises performed on the bed, dynamic Quadriceps, sitting out of bed, spot marching, and ambulation. Each active exercise was repeated for ten times per set. Ambulation was done twice a day based on perceived rate of exertion (11&#x02013;13 on Borgs scale). Each session lasted for 15&#x02013;20 min done for five times per week. Hence, a combination of respiratory and mobility exercise lasted for 30&#x02013;40 min a session performed 5 days a week. To improve the adherence even the caregivers/bystanders of the participants were explained about the exercises which were to be performed by the participants at home. The quality of life using SF-36 v 2 was assessed telephonically after 4 weeks postdischarge from the hospital in both groups.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc.

The possible reason for these improvements could be because of spontaneous recovery over the period of 4 weeks. Another probable reason could be that subjects of the control group were benefited with the routine physiotherapy provided in the ICU and the wards. Furthermore, patients in the control group might have performed the exercises without the exercise information sheet. Hence with a maturity of time, a marked improvement in the physical and mental function would have occurred in the control group from their baseline status.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Physical component and its domains</title><p>At baseline, the median change in the scores from ICU discharge to hospital discharge was 2.99 (2.20&#x02013;4.57) and 1.83 (1.05&#x02013;4.06), in study and control group, respectively, suggesting a similar trend of change in the QoL during the hospital stay. There was an improvement in the physical component and all its domains in the study group as compared to control group over a period of 4 weeks. The individually tailored and telephonically monitored exercises performed by the patients of the study group after hospital discharge might have had positive effects on their cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal systems. Another study was done by Jones <italic>et al</italic>., similar results were found in a double-blinded randomized controlled trial where unsupervised, patient-directed home-based exercises for 6 weeks with printed rehabilitation manual and three follow-up phone calls were given to patients in the intervention group in this study. Improvements only in the physical component were noted in this study at the end of 6 months.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Mental component and its domains</title><p>The change in the MCS score before randomization was similar for both groups, i.e., 3.27 (1.81&#x02013;6.55) and 2.91 (1.29&#x02013;6.04) for study and control group, respectively. We found significant improvements in the mental component and all its domains after 4 weeks of home-based exercises in the study group. Physiologically, exercises increase the release of endorphins which in turn improves circulation and has an impact on a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which collectively improves the physiological reactivity to stress.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Hence, this could have improved the scores of MCS which corresponds to the anxiety and depression status (r = 0.88)[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] of the participants in the study group. Another reason for this improvement could be the better physical functional status of the patients in the study group. Better functional status might have led to increment in the social participation and reduction in episodes of frustration, anxiety, and depression further improving their social and mental wellbeing. Contrary to the study conducted by Elliott <italic>et al</italic>. on critical care survivors, in which graded individualized exercise program was given for 8 weeks with five follow-up phone calls to the study group and usual care to the control group. They did not find statistically significant differences in 6-min walk test or HRQoL at 8 or 26 weeks after discharge.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Similarly, in a single blinded study by Cuthbertson <italic>et al</italic>., manual-based physical rehabilitation program was given for 6 weeks to subjects in the study group. No improvement in PCS or MCS score was seen after 3 and 12 months probably because there were no measures taken to improve adherence to the exercise program which might have impaired the quality of an effective intervention.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Even though all the participants of the study group were telephonically followed up every week and logbook was provided, only 12 out of 15 participants performed the exercises consistently over a period of 4 weeks after hospital discharge. Therefore, the adherence in our study population was 80%. However, there was no difference between the group which adhered to the exercise and the group which did not adhere to the exercise at baseline. Our results from this study would be useful for providing individualized rehabilitation sheet to patients postdischarge for a better understanding of the exercises so as to improve their functional status thereby improving their quality of life. Individualized home-based program can be beneficial and cost-effective for individuals who reside in rural areas as it eliminates the need to attend an outpatient clinic located in the tertiary hospital where they were treated. One limitation of this study was a long-term follow-up for 6 or 12 months was not done as the study was time bound.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
