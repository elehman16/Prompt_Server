The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and acceptability of exercise training (ET) with behavioural support as a primary therapy for low/intermediate risk localised prostate cancer. Men with low/intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomised to 12 months of ET or usual care with physical activity advice (UCwA) in a multi-site open label RCT. Feasibility included acceptability, recruitment, retention, adherence, adverse events and disease progression. Secondary outcomes included quality of life and cardiovascular health indices. Of the 50 men randomised to ET (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) or UCwA (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;25), 92% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;46) completed 12 month assessments. Three men progressed to invasive therapy (two in UCwA). In the ET group, men completed mean: 140&#x02009;mins per week for 12 months (95% CI 129,152&#x02009;mins) (94% of target dose) at 75% Hrmax. Men in the ET group demonstrated improved body mass (mean reduction: 2.0&#x02009;kg; 95% CI &#x02212;2.9,&#x02212;1.1), reduced systolic (mean: 13&#x02009;mmHg; 95%CI 7,19) and diastolic blood pressure (mean:8&#x02009;mmHg; 95% CI 5,12) and improved quality of life (EQ.5D mean:13 points; 95% CI 7,18). There were no serious adverse events. ET in men with low/intermediate risk prostate cancer is feasible and acceptable with a low progression rate to radical treatment. Early signals on clinically relevant markers were found which warrant further investigation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Selecting clinical management strategies for men with localised prostate cancer is a balancing act. The evidence in favour of radical treatments such prostatectomy and radiation therapy is disputed, with large randomised studies such as PIVOT and ProtecT demonstrating minimal overall survival advantage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, living with an untreated cancer can be a source of anxiety for men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and active monitoring is associated with a higher rate of disease progression and development of metastatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Active surveillance has long been suggested as a primary management strategy for localised prostate cancer, particularly in men thought to be at low risk of progression, however reliably identifying such men is associated with a degree of uncertainly that men and their partners often find difficult to accept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, particularly as they perceive no active role in such treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Despite the known adverse effects of invasive therapies on quality of life, sexual, urinary and anorectal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, many men opt out of surveillance in favour of what they perceive as an active management strategy involving conventional or investigative ablative therapies.</p><p id="Par3">The benefits of participation in exercise/physical activity and the impact on cancer progression/ mortality outcomes has gained much support from observational data sets describing the impact on solid cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and specifically in prostate cancer cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a meta-analysis confirmed exercise interventions improve cancer specific outcomes such as disease specific quality of life and physical function as well as reducing fatigue in men with prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Pilot &#x02018;lifestyle interventions&#x02019; have been attempted in localised prostate cancer. However, it is important to note these studies focused nearly exclusively on modification of &#x02018;lifestyle&#x02019; to a vegan diet with soy supplementation, without data on exercise dose/adherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In tandem, physical activity will reduce risk of other common cancers and associated co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease risk, common in elderly populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, as demonstrated in the largest RCT thus far comparing treatment options, men with localised prostate cancer are nine times more likely to die of other causes rather than prostate cancer - CVD mortality being nearly three times more likely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, developing exercise training (ET) as a novel primary treatment option for prostate cancer could fundamentally change the way the disease is managed and offer cancer specific and other health advantages for men affected. The challenge with exercise programmes however, is to support men in starting to become physically active and then maintain exercise over the long-term, whilst providing objective data to confirm behaviour change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Also, such therapies need to be integrated with clinical practice, if they are ever to be considered a realistic treatment option in the health services.</p><p id="Par5">The aim of the Prostate Cancer Novel Therapy (PANTERA) trial was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering ET as a novel primary therapy to men with low and intermediate risk localised prostate cancer with a view to informing a subsequent definitive trial evaluating the effect on progression to invasive therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par6">The study was a two-arm open label RCT designed and conducted in line with recent updated CONSORT guidance for clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Following regulatory and ethical approvals (UK NHS, HRA) in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, 50 men with localised prostate cancer were recruited via outpatient clinics. All men had histological evidence of low or intermediate risk localised prostate cancer, diagnosed using a combination of clinical, bio-chemical, imaging and/or biopsy (confirmed within the previous 12 months) and had elected active surveillance as an initial management strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, only men with Gleason score &#x02264;7 (3&#x02009;+&#x02009;4, not 4&#x02009;+&#x02009;3), up to T2b clinical stage tumours, with pre-treatment prostate specific antigen (PSA) &#x02264;20&#x02009;ng/mL and life expectancy of &#x02265;10 years were included. Men with unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction (within the past 6 months), pacemakers or those already undertaking regular physical activity (greater than 90&#x02009;minutes of moderate intensity exercise, per week) or with mental limitation preventing participation in trial assessments, were excluded. All men were recruited from two hospitals in South Yorkshire (UK) and provided informed consent for study participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p id="Par7">Randomisation was undertaken using a computer generated algorithm used by cancer prevention trials unit staff at Queen Mary University of London, who were independent of the study team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedures</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exercise training with behavioural support</title><p id="Par8">Aerobic ET was undertaken for 12 months, combining supervised and independent elements. All supervised exercise sessions were guided by a specialist in clinical exercise science and took place at Sheffield Hallam University or community gym facilities involved in the National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine network. Men were set a goal of undertaking 150&#x02009;minutes of exercise per week for 12 months (i.e. 7800&#x02009;minutes of monitored exercise over 12 months). To support this goal, men were asked to attend two group-based supervised exercise sessions a week, comprising up to 60&#x02009;minutes of aerobic exercise. Exercise intensity was set at between 65% to 85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate or 12 to 17 on the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, in sessions of 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;minutes of continuous exercise for the first 8 weeks, progressing up to 60&#x02009;minutes per session thereafter. Gym based aerobic ET was conducted using standard ergometers e.g. stationary cycles, rowing ergometers or treadmills. In addition, men were required to undertake self-directed exercise sessions per week, using a heart rate monitor to objectively record independent exercise behaviour to achieve their 150&#x02009;minute per week target. These men also recorded their exercise behaviour in log books, which were checked on a regular basis.</p><p id="Par9">The behaviour change support was based on the findings of our Cochrane review of interventions to improve exercise behaviour in people living with and beyond cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We utilised the following behaviour change techniques as outlined in the CALO-RE behaviour change taxonomy: setting programme goals; prompting generalisation of target behaviour; prompting self-monitoring of behaviour and prompting of practice. Behaviour change counselling conducted by the clinical exercise specialist took place bi-monthly, either via face-to-face sessions during exercise or via telephone for the first three months and then according to participant preference for the following nine months. Ongoing feedback on exercise technique and intensity guidance was provided throughout the supervised sessions as appropriate.</p><p id="Par10">Behavioural support was based on Social Cognitive Theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (emphasising the importance of self-regulation over willpower) and on Habit Theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (increases the automaticity of behaviour) arranging, for example, a regular exercise routine with specific times, days and environments to increase the automaticity of physical activity. Decision processes regarding whether to engage in exercise would gradually be replaced by the expectation to engage in exercise, thereby improving maintenance of behaviour change. The habit element aimed to aid the transition to a more active life and, together with increasing self-regulatory skills, to increase the chance of long-term maintenance. Patient perceptions of illness and treatment beliefs were also discussed and addressed with participants using the principals of the necessities and concerns frame work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. For example, discussing beneficial and adverse outcomes from participation in active surveillance and undertaking ET as an experimental approach to controlling disease progression. Throughout the 12 months, the clinical exercise specialist helped identify and overcome barriers to exercise, facilitate self-management strategies, review individual exercise goals and promote self-regulatory skills.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Usual care with exercise advice</title><p id="Par11">Men randomised to usual care with advice (UCwA) underwent active surveillance in accordance with the local cancer network policy, based on the NICE (CG175) recommendations.

These data were assessed by extracting data from screening and recruitment logs, attendance at supervised ET sessions as well as independent exercise heart rate recordings, log book records and review of adverse event logs and clinical records. Adverse events were classified according to international ethical, scientific and practical standards i.e. Good Clinical Practice definitions see (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-clinical-practice-for-clinical-trials">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-clinical-practice-for-clinical-trials</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par13">Secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months and included resting heart rate (Polar M400, Finland) resting blood pressure and sub-maximal aerobic exercise tolerance assessed by the Bruce treadmill (H/P/Cosmos, Germany) protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, body mass and BMI. Blood pressure measures were taken by the same clinical investigator throughout with regularly calibrated automated sphygmomanometer (Dash 2500, GE Healthcare, USA) with the average of three recordings taken. Readings were taken in a seated position after the subject had rested for a minimum of 10&#x02009;minutes. Second and third readings were taken 5&#x02009;minutes later and the mean pressure of the three readings was recorded as the attendance BP. Quality of life was assessed by the EQ5D questionnaire (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://euroqol.org/">https://euroqol.org/</ext-link>). Dietary habits were assessed by the Food frequency questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, we assessed the willingness of men to provide one DNA sample for SNP genetic profiling, which could be informative in our planned explanatory trial in terms of predicting response to ET. Other secondary outcomes were safety biomarkers including PSA and serum androgen profile. A lipid profile (taken fasted) and the metabolic biomarker HbA1c was also collected, as requested by patients when we consulted them about study design prior to funding. Samples were processed at local hospital laboratories and reported on the secure internal National Health Service (NHS) results reporting system. Self-reported exercise behaviour was assessed by the Godin Leisure Score index questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> self-efficacy by the SCI Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and exercise habits by the Self-Report Habit Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Our study demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability in terms of recruitment, retention, sustained behaviour change and adherence with few adverse events and important impacts on clinically relevant outcomes in this population of men with localised disease.</p><p id="Par37">Observational data has suggested that physical activity could improve prostate cancer&#x02013;specific mortality and overall mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Few clinical studies to date have evaluated the potential of ET as direct anti-cancer treatments in men with prostate cancer. A small single centre RCT of 26 men with localised disease recently reported feasibility outcomes from a combined lifestyle intervention of exercise and whole-grain rye diet supplementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Over a six month intervention, the authors reported a median level of 91&#x02009;min/week of vigorous activity for the first 3 months and 66&#x02009;min/week for the last 3 months from heart rate monitor recordings. It is important to note this study reported an adverse ratio of prostate cancer progression of 3 vs 0 men from the intervention group vs controls during the trial. Further this study retained less than 75% of its cohort, excluded men with PSA above 10 and also those with moderate or severe co-morbidity. The present study performed better in terms of trial retention, objectively recorded exercise behaviour, had much more inclusive enrolment criteria (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and over a 12 month period, three men progressed to radical treatment: only one doing so from the ET group after discontinuing with exercise very early in the programme (i.e. after just one session).</p><p id="Par38">The mechanisms whereby aerobic exercise reduces PCa progression are not clear: several pathways around how exercise might interact with the tumour microenvironment have been covered in a recent review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of exercise required to achieve benefit has only been estimated from observational data. Pilot &#x02018;lifestyle interventions&#x02019; have been attempted but focused almost exclusively on strict dietary modification i.e. to veganism, without data on exercise dose/adherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, we have used a specific and pre-specified target exercise intensity, supported by regular supervision and goal-setting:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> the majority of men were able to either reach or indeed exceed such a threshold. Future large-scale trials are required to establish the dose-response curve and relationship between aerobic exercise and progression of localised prostate cancer. Encouraging data from a small single centre RCT in men with biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy has reported improvements in fitness levels correlated with increasing PSA doubling time (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12 completing training)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We saw no impact on PSA over our 12 month follow-up, but a longer follow-up could elucidate biomarker responses associated with cancer progression using ET as prescribed and delivered in PANTERA.</p><p id="Par39">The matter of acceptability of ET within active surveillance should be mentioned. Although self-empowerment has received much attention in cancer management in recent years, most of the effort and literature revolves around survivorship or self-empowerment <italic>after</italic> definitive management. Men with prostate cancer often describe low levels of empowerment. Given the controversy around the risks and benefits of invasive therapies for localised prostate cancer, and the potential benefit suggested in reducing disease progression and mortality from observational studies&#x000a0;of physical activity, there is a real imperative to provide prospective evidence for such a management strategy. Qualitative evaluation within this study found support from participants for continuing exercise prescription and longer follow-up (see online supplement 1).</p><p id="Par40">One of the commonest causes of death in men with prostate cancer is cardiovascular disease. Indeed, as demonstrated in the largest RCT thus far comparing treatment options, men with localised prostate cancer are nine times more likely to die of other causes rather than prostate cancer - CVD mortality being nearly three times more likely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As such men have a diagnosis of cancer, in the absence of autopsy data or central review of cause of death, it is possible that the quoted rates are an underestimate in clinical practice. Physical activity is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality in the general population as well as a reduction in the incident risk of other common cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We also found the ET impacted important markers of cardiovascular health i.e. both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in our study cohort. Whilst these are not cancer-specific, these represent clinically relevant changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> in important health outcomes in elderly men. The cardio-protective value of ET as a pre-cursor to conventional cardio-toxic prostate cancer treatments such as ADT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> is something of real clinical and health-economic interest in the management to prostate cancer survivors.</p><p id="Par41">Estimated costs of ET per-man in the PANTERA study would be &#x000a3;855 p.a. inclusive of specialist supervision, behaviour change, access to a community exercise facility and four progress/progression assessments per year. This cost figure does not take into consideration any health economic benefits from the ET such as fewer invasive cancer treatments, the cost to the health service of treating adverse effects of those treatments or reduction in risk of new co-morbidities associated with age. ET also&#x000a0;provided qualitative evidence about improved feelings of wellbeing which is supported by data from EQ5D assessments reporting improved quality of life. This is consistent with trials designed to improve cancer-specific quality of life in men with advanced disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This is in stark contrast to conventional invasive approaches to localised disease management which have well established adverse effects on sexual, urinary and anorectal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, developing ET as a novel primary treatment option for prostate cancer could fundamentally change the way the disease is managed and offer cancer specific and other health advantages.</p><p id="Par42">There are limitations to the present study that should be noted. Follow-up will likely need to be much longer in our definitive trial, extended to at least 3&#x02013;5 years to provide sufficient time to detect changes in progression to invasive treatment endpoints. No blinding was used in this phase II trial, so preliminary effects on subjective outcomes need to be interpreted with caution. More acceptable methods of collecting dietary confounders will need to be included in subsequent studies (e.g. three day diet diaries), given the food frequency questionnaire was poorly completed in our present cohort. Mechanistic data would be helpful in interpreting progression free survival data in the subsequent study: this will likely have to extend beyond typical kallikrein markers and could include immunological, metabolic and inflammation markers as well as circulating tumour cell profiles. Whilst the study was open to men with PSA over 10&#x02009;ng.ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and Gleason score above 6, the majority of recruits had a PSA of less than 10&#x02009;ng.ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and Gleason score 3&#x02009;+&#x02009;3. Strategies to recruit men with intermediate risk disease could be developed to inform our definitive trial. The inclusion of exercise advice in the usual care arm could be a potential confounder in determining the true impact of a supervised exercise intervention. Nevertheless, given the observational evidence supporting the benefits of exercise in such an age cohort as well as the predominantly sedentary nature of the men recruited, providing no exercise guidelines was seen as unethical in this group. In any case, the provision of such guidance to the usual care group could have the effect of reducing the differences in study outcomes between the groups, something that will need to be factored into any future definitive study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">The PANTERA study demonstrated encouraging feasibility and early signals on clinically relevant markers in men with prostate cancer as a result of ET. A multi-centre definitive clinical trial to establish clinical and cost effectiveness is now indicated before such interventions could be considered as part of management in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
