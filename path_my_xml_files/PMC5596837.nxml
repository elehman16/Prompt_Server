The aim of our study was to design a brief, structured educational intervention and evaluate its usefulness in preventing HE-related hospitalisation over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-nine cirrhotic outpatients with a history of HE were enrolled and randomly assigned to an intervention (group A; n=20) or control group (group B; n=19). All of them underwent evaluation of HE (clinical and quantitative neuropsychiatric assessment) and completed the Questionnaire on the Awareness of Encephalopathy. A 15&#x02009;min educational session was then provided to patients in group A, including basic information on the pathophysiology, hygienic and medical management of HE.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No demographic/clinical differences were observed at baseline between the two groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in HE-related information available at baseline between the two groups; knowledge of HE was limited in both. The intervention was highly effective in increasing patients&#x02019; understanding of treatment of the condition (from 5% to 80%). The educational intervention also reduced the risk of developing an episode of HE over a period of 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The educational intervention confirmed the poor knowledge of patients with previous HE about their condition, served as a tool to increase patients&#x02019; awareness, and minimised HE-related readmission rates over a period of 1&#x02009;year.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cirrhosis</kwd><kwd>hepatic encephalopathy</kwd><kwd>education</kwd><kwd>re-admission</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Italian Ministry of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gobierno de Extremadura and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Summary box</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known about this subject?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy&#x000a0;(HE) and their caregivers have limited understanding of HE and its management.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The HE educational procedure form&#x000a0;(HEEPF), an educational intervention tool designed and tested in this study, increased patients&#x02019; awareness and minimised HE-related readmission rates over a follow-up period of 1 year.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study provides pilot data to design and perform a definitive study on the usefulness of HEEPF.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been estimated that the cumulative risk of recurrence after a first-ever episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is nearly 40% over a period of 1&#x02009;year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A retrospective analysis has reported that the readmission rate for HE-related reasons within 1&#x02009;year is around 40%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The total healthcare cost for each HE hospitalisation has increased over the last decade, reaching $37&#x02009;500 per each HE-related admission.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Hence, preventing this complication of liver disease after discharge is challenging.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/European Association for the Study of the Liver (AASLD/EASL) Practice Guideline<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> has emphasised the importance of a multidisciplinary approach where patients, caregivers and practitioners should join to prevent/reduce the incidence of some precipitating factors of HE, such as infections, constipation or dehydration, and avoid subsequent hospitalisations.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The alliance of both patients and caregivers in the healthcare process has been proved to be effective in the reduction of hospital admissions in other diseases.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref>
</p><p>In a recent study, we have observed that both patients and their caregivers have limited understanding of the disease/its management, and we have suggested that this may be the consequence of insufficient provision of information.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, providing structured information for the understanding of HE might be relevant to its prevention and management. Based on this hypothesis, the aims of this study were: (1) to test the awareness of HE in a group of patients who had had a previous episode of HE&#x02265;grade&#x02009;II; (2) to validate a short educational procedure for these patients; (3) to provide a preliminary assessment of the efficacy, if any, of an educational intervention to prevent HE-related hospitalisation (HE&#x02265;grade&#x02009;II) over time by a prospective randomised intervention study.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Patients&#x000a0;and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 39 consecutive outpatients referred to the Internal Medicine/Regional Centre for Liver Diseases of the Department of Medicine of Padova University Hospital were enrolled.

</p><p>The educational intervention was based on commenting three cartoons (HE educational procedure form&#x000a0;(HEEPF)) including: (1) basic information on the pathophysiology of HE; (2) education on how to ensure/maintain regular bowel emptying; and (3) drugs used to treat HE with a simple explanation of their mechanism of action, pharmacological and commercial names (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The educational intervention was planned to be completed in approximately 15&#x02009;min. The intervention was designed with a view to inform/educate the patient on manoeuvres and decisions that can be made without the intervention of a doctor, thus changes in the dose of diuretics and introduction/tapering of psychoactive drugs were not covered.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Hepatic encephalopathy educational procedure form.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjgast-2017-000161f01"/></fig><p>Within 1&#x02009;hour of the educational intervention, patients completed a questionnaire designed to check if they were satisfied with the information received and if they had acquired novel information (Novel Information Questionnaire (NIQ)) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Novel Information Questionnaire</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1">1.

The usefulness of such programme was immediately evaluated by means of NIQ, and over the subsequent 12 months by a monthly telephone interview, to check for the occurrence of HE-related hospitalisations.</p><p>After the intervention, 70% of patients had acquired new information about the pathophysiology of HE, and 80% of them had improved their knowledge about HE prevention/treatment. These findings highlight two issues: (1) the limited awareness of these patients about their condition, which is in line with a previous report<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and (2) the need to strengthen the communication between patients and physicians, at least within the context of the Italian healthcare system. In other diseases, educational approaches have been shown to enhance patients&#x02019; personal understanding, to improve long-term control of the disease, and also to improve evidence of the usefulness of pharmacological treatment.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>
</p><p>Importantly, when the results were corrected for the severity of the clinical condition, HEEPF was shown to reduce the risk of HE recurrence over time. This was despite the high absolute number of HE events over the follow-up period. Although well-informed patients in group A could have avoided precipitant factors such as constipation or dehydration, factors such as infection or bleeding are obviously more difficult to prevent/control. Nonetheless, the number of &#x02018;avoidable&#x02019; precipitants in both groups was similar. The fact that the AASLD/EASL Practice Guideline on HE<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> strongly encourages definition and recording of HE precipitants may help with similar studies in future, by way of clearer and better information in this respect in notes/medical records.</p><p>In addition, the AASLD/EASL Practice Guideline<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> highlights the importance of the education of both patients and their relatives/caregivers. Caregivers have a crucial role in the healthcare process once the patient is discharged,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> hence new tools are being designed to help them detect episodes of HE.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Similarly, the HEEPF could have been administered to both patients and their caregivers, or even only to caregivers. Indeed, one of the initial aims of the present study was to involve caregivers. However, very few patients were accompanied on the day of study, making enrolment impossible.</p><p>Altogether, the improved awareness/understanding of HE by use of a single, quick (15&#x02009;min) educational intervention (HEEPF) constitutes preliminary evidence of its usefulness. The tool is cheap, user-friendly, and can be administered by trained nursing staff to improve patients&#x02019; self-management (and possibly pharmacological treatment) so that HE-related readmission rates can be reduced. This has considerable consequences, as poor understanding of HE/its management among patients may also impinge on the likelihood of demonstrating the efficacy of treatments in future. In conclusion, the present study:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>confirms limited disease awareness in patients with a history of HE</p></list-item><list-item><p>proposes a simple and short educational procedure (HEEPF) that is effective in increasing awareness, and most likely also in reducing readmission rates</p></list-item><list-item><p>provides pilot data to design and perform a definitive study on the usefulness of HEEPF. Future research is also needed to characterise the features (ie, precipitants and others) of the HE with the highest likelihood of benefiting from the educational approach in terms of prevention.</p></list-item></list>
