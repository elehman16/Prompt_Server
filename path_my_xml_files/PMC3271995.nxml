This family based randomized controlled trial examines whether face-to-face delivered counselling is effective in reducing sedentary time and improving health in adults and increasing moderate-to-vigorous activities in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The families are randomized after balancing socioeconomic and environmental factors in the Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4; region, Finland. Inclusion criteria are: healthy men and women with children 3-8 years old, and having an occupation where they self-reportedly sit more than 50% of their work time and children in all-day day-care in kindergarten or in the first grade in primary school. Exclusion criteria are: body mass index &#x0003e; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, self-reported chronic, long-term diseases, families with pregnant mother at baseline and children with disorders delaying motor development.</p><p>From both adults and children accelerometer data is collected five times a year in one week periods. In addition, fasting blood samples for whole blood count and serum metabonomics, and diurnal heart rate variability for 3 days are assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up from adults. Quadriceps and hamstring muscle activities providing detailed information on muscle inactivity will be used to realize the maximum potential effect of the intervention. Fundamental motor skills from children and body composition from adults will be measured at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Questionnaires of family-influence-model, health and physical activity, and dietary records are assessed. After the baseline measurements the intervention group will receive tailored counselling targeted to decrease sitting time by focusing on commute and work time. The counselling regarding leisure time is especially targeted to encourage toward family physical activities such as visiting playgrounds and non-built environments, where children can get diversified stimulation for play and practice fundamental of motor skills. The counselling will be reinforced during the first 6 months followed by a 6-month maintenance period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If shown to be effective, this unique family based intervention to improve lifestyle behaviours in both adults and children can provide translational model for community use.

At the same time, parents face multidimensional challenges to support physical activity in their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While the physical activity guidelines stress the importance of moderate-to-vigorous exercises in both children and adults, evidence is merging that even small amounts of physical activity can have health-related benefits. One recent report shows that people who exercise 15 min more/day have 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Conversely, every hour of TV viewing adds all-cause mortality by 11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Further, a physically active lifestyle has been shown to reduce genetic predisposition to obesity by 40%, and thus also the risk for obesity-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Recently, daily inactivity time has been shown to be independent from purposeful physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore, not only adding physical activity but avoiding inactivity has an important role in healthy lifestyle. Epidemiological studies have shown that sedentary time, independent from exercise, predicts all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], obesity and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], abnormal glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition to the effects of total sedentary time, the pattern in which it is accumulated may be also important. Healy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed that total number of breaks in sedentary time was associated with lower waist circumference, triglycerides, and 2-h plasma glucose, independent of total sedentary time. These authors suggested that breaking prolonged periods of sitting might be a valuable addition to the public health recommendations. Although the evidence provides support to the importance of avoiding prolonged, uninterrupted periods of sitting for cardiovascular health in adults, further evidence from intervention trials is required.</p><p>Promotion of sitting begins at schools at the latest and increasing number of evidence show inactivity-related symptoms also in adolescents and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, the amount of parent's sedentary time, nor their individual physical activity, seems to transfer to their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. On the other hand, parent's and siblings' participation in physical activity with a child and reinforcement for physical activity seems to be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, while our society supports sitting and motorizing every action, promoting physically active lifestyle as early as from childhood is crucial.</p><p>Based on Bandura's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] social cognitive theory, a child learns by imitating and copying other people and by making own reasons founded on these social situations. Own parents and siblings act as one of the most powerful role models to a young child. Thus, the family environment is in key position influencing child's physical activity habits taking shape in the childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The effective family interventions focused on increasing physical activity in children have prompted parents to set specific goals for changes in physical activity behaviour and to self-monitor behaviour change progress and to identify barriers faced. It has also been important that behaviour change techniques have spanned the spectrum of behaviour change process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Parents have been shown to be motivated to their role as important models, if they receive knowledge why physical activity (PA) is important to their children. They also seem to profit from concrete ideas and model how to promote physical activity with their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>For young children the parent's encouragement toward outdoor play seem to be essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] because the amount of outdoor play correlates with overall physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Further, playing outdoors and intensity level of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) correlates with fundamental motor skills (FMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The more children are physically active the better FMS they have and the more possibilities they have to be physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Good FMS during childhood predict physical activity and physical fitness during adolescence and later in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. On the other hand, poor motor skills or clumsiness predicts low physical activity and poor physical fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of a tailored family based intervention on the activity level of both parents and their children. In parents with a sedentary job we investigate whether simple actions to reduce time in sitting position are viable and whether they have health-related benefits. Work-related inactivity is one important aspect of the present study, since in Finland 46% of women and 51% of men sit daily at least 6 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. At the same time, we examine whether the counselling delivered to parents on the importance of children's physical activity transfers to the increase in children's physical activity level and hereby facilitates development of FMS.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to describe the design, setting, recruitment process, methodology and intervention of this randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>Parallel-group randomized controlled intervention trial (RCT) design is used with one intervention group and one control group of adults and their children. Adults in the intervention group receive tailored counselling to decrease time in sitting position and to increase non-exercise daily activity. This counselling is also targeted to encourage parents to increase their children's time spent outdoors and to increase children's intensity of activity toward MVPA level. Parents are also helped to recognize the amount of children's indoor activities, especially sedentary behaviour like TV viewing and playing video games.</p><p>An ethics approval for the project has been received from the Ethics committee of Central Finland Health Care District on March 25, 2011 (Dnro 6U/2011). Before signing consent, an info meeting is held where the subjects are informed about the procedures, risks and benefits of the study, and where they can ask questions. Subjects are volunteers with right to withdraw from the study at any time without consequences. Consent for the children to participate in the study will be signed by both legal guardians. The study is conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki and good scientific practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible participants are parents with work that primarily includes sitting and their children of 3-8 years of age. <italic>Inclusion criteria</italic>: healthy men and women with children 3-8 years old, and having an occupation where they self-reportedly sit more than 50% of their work time. Children in all-day day-care in kindergarten at least 10 days per month or in the first grade in primary school. <italic>Exclusion criteria</italic>: self-reported chronic, long-term musculoskeletal disease or progressive neurological disease, diagnosed cardiovascular or metabolic disease with regular medication, families with pregnant mother at baseline and BMI &#x0003e; 35. Children with a developmental disorder or other disorders delaying motor development are excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>In the entire project we aim to see the main effect of the intervention as reduced inactivity time in adults. Sample size was calculated by assuming that the intervention could induce a decrease in the longest muscle inactivity periods from 6.37 &#x000b1; 3.42 min to 5.22 &#x000b1; 2.59 min in persons sitting 50-100% of their work time. This assumption was based on our data from previous project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] where a mean duration of five longest continuous inactivity periods was measured from 84 people with self reported sitting (%) during work. A sample size of 86 in both groups would have 80% power to detect this 18% difference at the level of &#x003b1; = 0.05. Estimating a small cluster effect (1.133) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and drop outs a sample size of 100 in both groups was reached. However, since we also aim to show health effects of the intervention, we used changes in plasma triglycerides as an example of potential metabolic changes to estimate the power of the design with 100 subjects. Olsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] reported triglycerides to change with 14 days reduction in ambulatory activities from 617 &#x000b1; 56 &#x003bc;mol/l to 647 &#x000b1; 47 &#x003bc;mol/l. With the assumption that this effect is reversible within a year with increased ambulatory activity, a sample size of 100 in both groups will have 98.4% power to detect this change. In addition, while conventional thinking holds that sample size is the primary adjustable variable for increasing statistical power, effect sizes depend on phenotypic definition and will likely increase the closer one connects to the underlying biochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Since the metabonomic analysis provides more detailed phenotype characterization this translates to even greater statistical power.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting and randomization</title><p>The recruitment is performed in the city of Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4;, Finland, by delivering advertisements to parents via kindergartens and primary schools which have been pre-randomized to control and intervention groups after balancing different environmental and socioeconomic regions within the city. Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4; with 130,000 residents and surface area of 1171 km<sup>2 </sup>has relatively small city centre and suburbs are characterized with proximity of lakes and forests. In the city opportunities for active commute using built-in bike paths and sidewalks are numerous although winter with snow creates challenges for a year-around commute. Also many of the kindergartens and primary schools have the possibility to utilize the natural environments in their daily program.</p><p>The compulsory education begins in August at the same year children have their seventh birthday. Before the first school year, 96% of Finnish children participate to a year-long voluntary preschool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The average enrolment rate of children aged 3-5 years in childcare and early education services is 74% in Finland which is slightly lower than average of 77% in OECD-countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Kindergarten teachers have the pedagogical responsibility of children's early education and their proficiency requirement is 3-5-years of university or polytechnic education.</p><p>The recruitment started in April 2011 with five kindergartens that resulted in about 16% response rate. Based on this initial result we estimated that randomization of 32 kindergartens and schools would be required to reach required sample size. In the randomization the areas within the city centre and in different types of suburbs were balanced. Regarding socioeconomic regions, information from city registry was used to balance the areas. Thus, in each type of environment and socioeconomic region there were to be two or more kindergartens and/or primary schools that were then randomized into control and intervention groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Tailored counselling by research personnel (TF, AL, AP) is targeted to decrease time in sitting position and increase non-exercise activity during workdays (commute and work time) and in leisure time (evenings and weekends) in adults. A common 30-min lecture is given to maximum of six participants accompanied with face-to-face discussions. The lecture contains research-based justifications for physical activity recommendations, effects of physical activity and, specifically for adults, information why reduction in sitting time can be beneficial.</p><p>In the discussions the subjects will be first asked to describe their current way of commute to work and to think of feasible ways of increasing active modes of commute. Then goals set by the subject regarding the mode and frequency of the change (e.g. Instead of taking the bus I will bicycle to work <italic>i</italic>) sometimes, <italic>ii</italic>) once a week, <italic>iii</italic>) several days a week, <italic>iv</italic>) every day) will be marked down to a form.</p><p>Second, the work time will be discussed and the subjects are asked to identify items that can be modulated, e.g. standing in coffee breaks, walking about while talking to phone, breaking long periods of sitting, taking a walk before lunch etc. Third, considering leisure time (both weekdays and weekends) is especially focused to encourage families to spend time together in nature and non-built environments, playgrounds and parks where children can get diversified stimulation for play. In discussions the parents are also encouraged, if needed, to reinforce children to play outdoors with peers, to acquire motivational equipment for play, to maintain summertime physical activity level and to utilize the material given. Moreover, leisure time habits will be asked and changes in habits such as walking to grocery shop instead of driving by car or walking stairs instead of taking the lift are discussed.</p><p>The items that the subjects themselves suggest to modify will be written down and an agreement document will be signed by the subject and researcher to confirm the intended changes in behaviour.</p><p>During counselling, material for break exercises during work time, children's indoor and outdoor activities and local places for hiking are delivered. Documents "License to Move" and a fair copy of the agreement are given. The subjects are also informed about project web-page [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] containing motivational material for intervention group which will be regularly updated.</p><p>The counselling is reinforced by a phone call after 1 and 5 months during which the compliance is asked and modifications to the agreement can be made. During the phone discussions execution (both compliance and barriers) of each of the goals are asked and modified when required. In addition, motivational e-mails with information on health promotion by life-style physical activity for adults and illustrative tips to increase physical activity and play developing FMS in children are sent monthly. This reinforcement period lasts for 6 months. At Midline the subjects in the intervention group will be given individual feedback of their daily inactivity and activity times (from Baseline muscle activity measurements). Feedback of children's motor skills with motivational tips will also be given at Midline. After the Midline there will be no researcher contact with the subjects except for the 9 month measurements.</p><p>The control group will not receive the counselling intervention but will undergo the measurements similarly as the intervention group. After 12 month-measurements the control group will be invited to a feedback and counselling session where they have the possibility to receive the same information as the intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol and outcomes</title><sec><title>Protocol for adults</title><p>The timeline of the study is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Baseline, Midline and Endline measurements contain fasting blood samples, anthropometry, questionnaires, strength measurements and functional tasks.

FMS will be tested using K&#x000f6;rperkoordinations Test fur Kinder (KTK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] for balance and motor coordination and using APM object control test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. APM is a widely used motor skill test for children in Finland. FMS tests are conducted as part of daily activities in kindergartens, schools and, in some cases, in the laboratory of Department of Biology of Physical Activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The maximal effect of counselling will be tested using mixed model ANOVA comparing the control and intervention groups at baseline and at 0 months. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to determine effects of intervention with an intention-to-treat principle. Mixed models are used in case of missing data points and to examine the clustering effect as well as to examine the relationships between physical activity and health-related indices. Self-organizing maps (SOM) will be applied for multi-metabolic understanding of metabolic interrelationships and pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is unique in implementing intervention to both parents and their children at the same time. The intervention focusing on reducing inactivity rather than increasing physical activity is a rather new concept and the actual execution by the adults is likely to determine the significance of this study. For the intervention group we have carefully designed a motivating environment with face-to-face discussions where the goals will be set by the subjects themselves and the commitment is formalized by signing an agreement. This type of intervention has been shown to be very effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>To reliably extract the possible changes in physical activity the present study utilizes both conventional (such as activity counts from accelerometer) and novel methods (histograms and signal half power from accelerometer and EMG) for more accurate determination of physical activity intensity and durations. Further, the measurements are done long enough periods 5 times during the year to assess the altered behaviour. Whether the altered behaviour in adults is reflected to health, it is postulated that the metabonomics analysis is sensitive enough to detect even subtle changes that would not be visible in conventional clinical markers.</p><p>There are challenges in this trial. Firstly, the compliance cannot be foreseen. The subject group is at very busy stage of life making careers with small children and a year-long commitment may result in considerable attrition rates. Further, seasonal variations in Finland with warm summer and cold winter with snow may show a greater effect on physical activity and health indexes than the low threshold intervention. We have considered this effect by performing the baseline measurements sequentially in spring and fall seasons.</p><p>Overall, this study has the potential to provide novel and timely information on the cause-effect relationships of low threshold physical activity intervention. However, the effectiveness of the intervention can only be assessed after the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ECG: Electrocardiogram; EMG: Electromyography; FMS: Fundamental motor skills; MVPA: Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; NMR: Nuclear magnetic resonance; PA: Physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TF, AS and SS initially designed the study and obtained funding for the research.
