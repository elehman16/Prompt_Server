Changes in this angle after surgery may be an esthetic concern for both the patient and the surgeon. The aim of the present study was to evaluate gonial angle changes after mandibular setback by the bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) and vertical ramus osteotomy (VRO) techniques. <bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-eight male patients with mandibular prognathism only were treated from 2004 to 2006 (deformities such as discrepancy of jaws, mandibular setback of more than 10 mm, asymmetry, and vertical discrepancy were excluded). Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. In the first group, mandibular setback was performed using the Obwegeser technique and wire osteosynthesis with 4 weeks' fixation (IMF), and in the second group, mandibular setback via VRO without wire osteosynthesis and 4 weeks' IMF was carried out. Lateral cephalograms were obtained for all the patients before surgery (<italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>) and 1 year after surgery (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>). Gonial angle and occlusal plane-SN in <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> were evaluated. <bold>Results:</bold> After surgery, the gonial angle had decreased in all patients. Decrease in the gonial angle in the VRO group was greater than the BSSO group. The average decrease in the gonial angle was significantly more (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the VRO group (7&#x000b0;) than in the BSSO group (2&#x000b0;). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Gonial angle decrease was observed in the present study following mandibular setback by the VRO and BSSO techniques.

There were 29 patients in the first group and 29 patients in the second group. The average gonial angle in the first group before surgery was 136 &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0; and the average gonial angle in the second group before the surgery was 134 &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0;.

Previous studies conducted to evaluate gonial angle changes and its relapse rate concluded that the use of the Obwegeser setback technique caused a decrease in the gonial angle. Singer and Bays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> and Gomes and Wisteh<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> in different surveys concluded that the gonial angle increases with mandibular advancement. Because the gonial angle plays an important role in ensuring a harmonious facial profile, changes in this angle after surgery may be an esthetic concern for both the patient and the surgeon. Gu et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> performed sagittal split ramus osteotomies on 62 patients and showed a 2.6&#x000b0; reduction in the gonial angle, which was similar to that achieved in the current investigation. In a recent study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref> it was shown that considerable remodeling of the bilateral gonial angle also occurs after surgery. Yoshioka et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> reported a significant correlation between the amount of setback and the amount of lateral gonial deviation in the VRO technique. However, stability after VRO was equal to that after SSRO.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> Vertical ramus osteotomy (intraoral) offers some advantages, such as lower chance of nerve damage, over SSRO for the treatment of prognathic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> Apart from other parameters, and with regard to profile from an esthetic point of view, the mandibular or gonial angle may be more harmonious following VRO mandibular setback.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> We sought to assess the impact of these 2 techniques with regard to postoperative profile. In our study, although the change in occlusal plane-SN angle was not significant, gonial angle decrease was observed following mandibular setback by both the VRO and BSSO techniques. Although the lips, sella-nasion A, and sella-nasion B angles were corrected postoperatively in both groups, the decrease in gonial angles was significantly greater in the VRO group. Although VRO creates a better profile and significantly less possibility of alveolar nerve damage intraoperatively, it is used less frequently today.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> The ability to rigidly fixate the segments and a less need for maxillomandibular fixation postoperatively are invaluable features of BSSO for mandibular prognathism despite inherent drawbacks.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study showed that in patients requiring greater reduction in the gonial angle, the VRO technique may be considered for mandibular setback.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
