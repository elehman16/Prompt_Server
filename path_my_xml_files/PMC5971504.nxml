All single-bundle reconstructions were performed by two surgeons experienced with ACL reconstruction according to the standard protocol used by the department. First, using a standard femoral guide, the femoral tunnel was made using the anteromedial portal as far as possible on the lateral condyle. Targeting was performed so that the posterior wall of the femur was left with a thickness of 2 to 3&#x02009;mm. Tibial tunnel positioning was standardized in both groups using the same instrument set. The tibial tunnel was targeted in the center of the footprint of the native ACL using a tibial guide. Both the BTB and HT grafts were stabilized with a titanium interference screw (Linvatec, Utica, NY, USA). The screw diameter was 2&#x02009;mm less than the bone tunnel diameter for the BTB graft and 1&#x02009;mm greater than the bone tunnel diameter for the HT graft.</p><p>All patients underwent standard postoperative rehabilitation. The rehabilitation protocol started the day after the operation and consisted of partial weight bearing with support by crutches and simple muscle-strengthening exercises. No brace was used in any patient. The crutches were discharged as soon as the patients had good muscle control of the operated knee and reached full extension, usually within the first 2 to 3 weeks. The patients underwent physiotherapy three times a week for the first 6 weeks after surgery, focusing on achieving full extension and strengthening of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Jogging was allowed after 4 months, but return to competitive sports was restricted to at least 6 months after surgery.</p><p>The study protocol was accepted by the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of &#x00141;&#x000f3;d&#x0017a; (resolution RNN/43/13/KE, dated 12 March 2013).</p></sec><sec id="sec4-0300060517722696"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 10 (Dell Software, Round Rock, TX, USA).

Quantitative variables (measurable) are presented both as the number of observations (n) and percentage (%). The Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test was used to confirm the normality of the measured data.

Because most of the variables had a non-normal distribution, non-parametric tests were also used: Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test for consecutive pairs was used to compare two dependent samples, and the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test was used for two independent samples.

All analyzed patents had chronic knee instability, and those with acute injuries were excluded from the study. These criteria made the patients comparable because early versus delayed operative treatment may give different results.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Both groups showed improvement in the Kujala score and most aspects of the KOOS at the last follow-up visit compared with the preoperative status, demonstrating the effectiveness of both procedures. However, the HT group demonstrated a more significant improvement in the Tegner score.</p><p>The differences between the two graft types are well documented in the literature. Recent data from a 15-year follow-up to a randomized controlled trial showed that BTB and HT ACL reconstructions were comparable in terms of both subjective and objective results, and some of the differences seen in the earlier review were not present at the long-term follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Similarly, a double-blind randomized clinical trial by Mohtadi et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> provided clinically valuable results: neither patient-reported nor clinical observations were significantly different among BTB, HT, and double-bundle HT ACL reconstruction techniques during a 2-year follow-up.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those of Fu et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> They noted similar effectiveness for both types of surgical procedures, with only a small difference in postoperative stability, muscle strength, and activity level at 2, 3, and 5 years following the procedure. Another study by Zelic et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> compared the effectiveness of the two procedures with regard to knee joint stability 2 years following ACL reconstruction. The study included 112 patients: in one group, the graft was taken from the central band of the patellar tendon (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;54 patients; mean age, 28 years), and in the other group, the graft was taken from the HT (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;58 patients; mean age, 26 years). The evaluation was performed using the Lachman test, pivot shift test, and an apparatus for testing joint laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer; MEDmetric Corp., San Diego, CA, USA). The results revealed no significant difference in knee joint stability between the two surgical techniques 2 years following reconstruction.</p><p>Similar results were obtained in a large prospective randomized study by Eriksson et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In total, 164 patients were recruited for the study. The patients were allocated to 2 groups based on the type of surgical procedure: 64 patients underwent ACL reconstruction with the central band of the patellar tendon (BTB graft), and the other 100 patients were treated using an HT graft. The patients were evaluated with the following tests before and after the procedure, with a mean intervening period of 31 months: the Stryker knee laxity test, single-leg hop test, Tegner activity scale, Lysholm scale, patellofemoral pain scale, and International Knee Documentation Committee scale. All patients underwent the same rehabilitation procedures. The results revealed no significant differences in the flexibility test results, functional test results, or scores on the various analyzed scales between the BTB and HT groups. Only one slight difference was noted: an insignificant deficit in the extension of the operated knee joint in the BTB group, which is inconsistent with the findings of the present study.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Xie et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> performed a meta-analysis of 22 articles taken from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to compare the effectiveness of the two reconstruction techniques. The analysis encompassed a total of 931 patients who underwent BTB graft transplantation and 999 who underwent semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) tendon graft transplantation. The results revealed no significant difference in stability, flexibility, the degree of graft acceptance/damage, subjective assessment of functional knee deficit, or range of extension/flexion between the two groups. Patients with the BTB graft performed better in the pivot shift test and more effectively returned to their preinjury activities, while patients with the STG tendon graft had better results regarding knee pain and kneeling.</p><p>Stolarczyk et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> noted that the use of a BTB autograft appears to be a better strategy for patients taking part in light athletic disciplines, while the STG tendon graft is better for patients with a lower activity level. In addition, Barenius et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0300060517722696" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> reported that the technique used for ACL reconstruction does not influence the degree of degenerative changes observed in the knee joint in the later postoperative period. In summary, the results of the present and other well-structured studies do not reveal clear differences in effectiveness between the two surgical techniques. Thus, the graft site should be chosen based on the preferences of the surgeon and patient.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is its relatively short follow-up period. However, the main aim of the study was to compare the early results of ACL reconstruction, and the follow-up duration in both analyzed groups was the same; thus, the groups were comparable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7-0300060517722696"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients undergoing BTB and HT graft ACL reconstruction have comparable improvement in functional results after 1 year of rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec id="sec15-0300060517722696"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec13-0300060517722696"><title>Consent for publication</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="sec16-0300060517722696"><title>Funding</title><p>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-0300060517722696"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The protocol of the study was accepted by the Bioethics Committee of our institution (resolution RNN/43/13/KE, dated 12 March 2013).</p></sec><sec id="sec12-0300060517722696"><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>ACL, anterior cruciate ligament; BTB, bone&#x02013;patellar tendon&#x02013;bone; HT, hamstring tendon; KOOS, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0300060517722696"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silvers</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandelbaum</surname><given-names>BR</given-names></name></person-group>
