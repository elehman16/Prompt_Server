The programs were carried out 8 weeks and 3 days/week. The postural back pain intensity was assessed by Visual Analogue Scale. Spinal alignment and spinal inclination were evaluated with the Spinal Mouse&#x000ae; (Idiag, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). Assessments were applied before (BP) and after program (AP). Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney U tests were utilized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The significant differences were observed for postural back pain (BP: 1.33 (1.16); AP: 0.33 (1.16)), thoracic curvature (BP: 44.50 (11.75); AP: 36.50 (13.25)), lumbar curvature (BP: -29.00 (10.00); AP: -7.00 (19.50)) and spinal inclination (BP: 5.00 (5.25); AP: 0.00 (4.00)) in Exercise Group between BP and AP (p&#x0003c;0.05). No significant differences were observed in Control group for all the parameters (p&#x0003e;0.05). The intergroup comparison showed that postural back pain, thoracic curvature, lumbar curvature and spinal inclination decreased in Exercise Group in comparison to Control Group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The exercise program with eight weeks regular practice was effective on improving postural back pain, spinal alignment and inclination in university students with postural back pain.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
