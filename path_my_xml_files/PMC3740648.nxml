The spectrophotometer was calibrated according to the manufacturer&#x0203a;s instructions before taking each reading and then carefully placed at right angle to buccal surface of the crown. The resulting shades were taken directly from the digital screen of spectrophotometer device and CIE L*a*b* readings were taken using Degudent Shadepilot software version 3.01.10079. Pretreatment color shades and readings of the entire buccal surfaces were taken and considered as baseline data to which the subsequent readings at 3, 10, and 17 days were compared. The color difference (&#x00394;E) at each time interval was calculated according to the following formula: &#x00394;E = [(&#x00394;*)<sup>2</sup>+ (&#x00394;a*)<sup>2</sup>+ (&#x00394;b*)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>&#x000bd;</sup> where &#x00394;L is the difference in lightness calculated from differences in the L* readings between two periods.

These sealers were AH Plus (resin-based sealer) which is a substitute for AH26, Apexit Plus (calcium hydroxide-based sealer) and Sultan (ZOE-based sealer). The literature review proved that these types of sealers have good sealing ability and good biocompatibility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Premolars crowns were used in the present study because of their reasonable wide pulp chambers that allow bulk placement of sealers. The pulp chamber of each sample was mechanically cleaned using and irrigated with 3% sodium hypochlorite and to eliminate any organic debris that could affect the measurement of tooth color. In addition the pulp chambers were also irrigated with 17% EDTA similar to previous studies to simulate most common clinical conditions regarding smear layer removal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, two control groups were utilized to test the ability of coronal dentin and enamel to transmit the color induced by materials that placed into the pulp chamber. The results obtained from the control groups may indicate that the dentin and enamel have the ability to transmit the color of the material placed in the pulp chamber. Application of sealer into the pulp chambers was similar to that of previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Spectrophotometry is an objective and more reliable method alternative to the subjective (visual) method of assessing color.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Spectrophotometers are extremely sensitive devices which can determine minute color changes that are not even clinically observable. These color changes can also be detected much earlier when compared to the traditional visual assessment of tooth color.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] For these reasons, it was decided to use spectrophotometric analysis in the current study for evaluating tooth discoloration determining CIE L*A*B* variables and delta E (&#x00394;E) as well as closest shades using an intraoral spectrophotometer (Shadepilot).</p><p>The exact time interval for tooth discoloration to occur resulting from root canal therapy is still not documented. The required time for discoloration to be clinically observed depends on many factors that include the thickness of the remaining dentin, the quality and quantity of the sealer, and the presence of the smear layer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Previous studies revealed that coronal tooth discoloration resulting from endodontic materials takes place from seven weeks after obturation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] to several months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Differences in the results of the previous studies could be attributed to the methodologies employed. In the present study, the discoloration effect of the sealers was determined at short periods (3, 10, and 14 days) to test prompt staining effect of sealers. In each group, the color of each sample was determined before sealer placement to act as a baseline for calculating the color change at each subsequent time interval. In addition, the color of samples at 3 and 10 days was also taken as a base to evaluate color change from 3 to 10 days and from 10 to 17 days, respectively.</p><p>The results indicated that all tested sealers did not show any evident of coronal discoloration after 3 days. This could be explained by the sealers that may penetrate into dentinal tubules, due to smear layer removal, did not show immediate chemical changes that could affect their colors. All sealers showed clinically observable coronal discoloration at 10 days (&#x02206;E &#x0003e; 3.5) which progressively increased with time. This was in contrast to the results of previous studies in which tooth discoloration occurred after longer times.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This could be largely explained by the difference in methodology utilized to prepare the experimental samples and the method of color analysis. Some of these studies did not attempt to remove the smear layer, which could reduce the rate of sealer penetration through the dentin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In the current study, sealer penetration within dentinal tubules was not evaluated, so it was difficult to confirm the ability of the tested sealers to penetrate dentinal tubules. However, there is controversy among authors where some of them concluded that sealers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] did not penetrate the dentinal tubules, while others[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] showed that the pathway by which staining materials can diffuse from the canal is through dentinal tubules.</p><p>The current results indicated that Sultan sealer displayed the greatest overall coronal discoloration and these were similar to the findings of previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The cause of severe discoloration observed with ZOE sealer may be probably due to the presence of eugenol, which forms a bond with zinc oxide. Free or even bound eugenol changes chemically (oxidizes) and darkens with time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Although AH Plus is silver-free and advertised as nonstaining compared to its predecessor AH26, it caused more overall coronal discoloration (grayish discoloration) than Apexit Plus sealer (reddish brown discoloration). Some authors found the same results but with AH26 sealer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Therefore, it can be argued that the silver ions were not the sole reason for tooth discoloration caused by AH26 and some ingredients in AH Plus could be the cause of this grayish discoloration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] The literature lacks evidence regarding the staining potential of AH Plus; therefore, additional research is required to investigate the constituents of AH Plus that might be responsible for the discoloration of endodontically treated teeth. The highest color changes in 3-10 days were for Sultan (&#x02206;E = 7.55), while the lowest color change was for AH Plus (&#x02206;E = 5.43), and Apexit Plus (&#x02206; = 6.16). The color changes in 10-17 days were not clinically detectable (&#x02206; &#x0003c; 3.5) except for AH Plus with a mean &#x02206;E value 3.63. These could indicate that the main color change occurred in the period from 3 to 10 days and did not dramatically increased from 10-17 days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Within the limitation of the present study, the following could be concluded:</p><p>
