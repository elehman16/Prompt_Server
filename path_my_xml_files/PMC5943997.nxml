Neck pain is associated with dizziness and responds favourably to neck manipulation. However, it is unknown if chiropractic intervention including instrument-assisted manipulation of the neck in older people with neck pain can also improve dizziness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This parallel two-arm pilot trial was conducted in Melbourne, Australia over nine months (October 2015 to June 2016). Participants aged 65&#x02013;85&#x000a0;years, with self-reported chronic neck pain and dizziness, were recruited from the general public through advertisements in local community newspapers and via Facebook. Participants were randomised using a permuted block method to one of two groups: 1) Activator II&#x02122;-instrument-assisted cervical and thoracic spine manipulation plus a combination of: light massage; mobilisation; range of motion exercises; and home advice about the application of heat, or 2) Sham-Activator II&#x02122;-instrument-assisted manipulation (set to zero impulse) plus gentle touch of cervical and thoracic spinal regions. Participants were blinded to group allocation. The interventions were delivered weekly for four weeks. Assessments were conducted one week pre- and post-intervention. Clinical outcomes were assessed blindly and included: dizziness (dizziness handicap inventory [DHI]); neck pain (neck disability index [NDI]); self-reported concerns of falling; mood; physical function; and treatment satisfaction. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rates, compliance with intervention and outcome assessment, study location, success of blinding, costs and harms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Out of 162 enquiries, 24 participants were screened as eligible and randomised to either the chiropractic (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) or sham (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) intervention group. Compliance was satisfactory with only two participants lost to follow up; thus, post-intervention data for 12 chiropractic intervention and 10 sham intervention participants were analysed. Blinding was similar between groups. Mild harms of increased spinal pain or headaches were reported by 6 participants. Costs amounted to AUD$2635 per participant. The data showed a trend favouring the chiropractic group in terms of clinically-significant improvements in both NDI and DHI scores. Sample sizes of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;150 or <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;222 for dizziness or neck pain disability as the primary outcome measure, respectively, would be needed for a fully powered trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Recruitment of participants in this setting was difficult and expensive.

Among Australian adults, 36% of people aged over 50&#x000a0;years report the presence of dizziness within the last month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, the prevalence of neck pain in Australian older adults has been estimated at 36% and 41% for men and women respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and in older adults, 5% of men and 8% of women report that neck pain interferes with their physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Dizziness is a known risk factor for falls in community-dwelling older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and dizziness is not optimally managed at present. One in three older people with dizziness are prescribed medications that are known to increase the risk of falling including: anti-hypertensives; anxiolytics and antidepressants; nitrates; analgesics; and anti-vertigo medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Anti-vertigo medications in particular, are commonly prescribed for non-vestibular causes of dizziness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to develop and validate non-pharmacological treatment strategies for dizziness in this population, which in turn may reduce the need for prescription of pharmacological agents with their attendant potential side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Neck pain may increase the risk of falls in the elderly. Sensory information from various structures including the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, the eyes, and the proprioceptive receptors in muscles and joints, particularly of the neck, is integrated by the brain for position sense, balance and motor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In some individuals, neck pain is linked with dizziness, in a syndrome termed &#x02018;cervicogenic dizziness&#x02019; or &#x02018;cervical dizziness&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There are reports in neck pain patients of a correlation between cervical joint stiffness and hypertonicity of the upper cervical musculature and the presence of dizziness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There are many different causes of dizziness in older people, including vestibular, cardiovascular, and psychological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, since cervicogenic dizziness is a diagnosis of exclusion, its exact incidence and prevalence remain unknown and a definitive diagnosis of cervicogenic dizziness is not possible in primary care settings. Therefore, this study recruited older people who reported both chronic non-specific dizziness and chronic neck pain to optimise the relevance of the study findings for primary care settings.</p><p id="Par18">Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is widely used by chiropractors, osteopaths and physiotherapists, for musculoskeletal conditions, including neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. SMT has been shown to reduce neck pain in adults in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and in older people specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, there have been small studies reporting positive effects of manual therapy in improving dizziness and musculoskeletal pain in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In fact, there is evidence that dizziness specifically associated with neck pain in adults may be attenuated with manual therapy, including SMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, previous studies have several important limitations including: lack of specific examination of neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; lack of a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; use of a &#x02018;no treatment&#x02019; control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], issues with appropriate outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and small sample sizes. SMT can be performed manually or assisted through an instrument. There is some evidence suggesting that low-force Activator&#x02122;-instrument-assisted manipulation may produce effects on musculoskeletal pain that are comparable to those of manual SMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Even though reported significant harms following neck SMT in older people are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], due to increased risk of osteoporosis in this population, low-force SMT techniques are recommended by recent chiropractic guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">A feasibility or pilot study is generally recommended before a Phase III clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Feasibility studies can determine the efficiency of recruitment strategies, adequacy of randomisation and blinding, appropriateness of outcome measures, and acceptability of compliance levels, as well as give some indication of the frequency and nature of harms. In this way, it is possible to ensure that the full-scale trial makes efficient use of resources, and is sufficiently powered to provide meaningful results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">We conducted a feasibility randomised sham-controlled trial (RCT) of a chiropractic intervention including instrument-assisted SMT in older people with chronic dizziness and concomitant chronic neck pain. The primary objective of this trial was to test the feasibility of a fully-powered RCT, based on recruitment rates, compliance with intervention and outcome assessment, study location, success of blinding, costs and harms. The secondary objective of this trial was to calculate, based on observed group differences, sample sizes for fully-powered RCTs using the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) or neck disability index (NDI) as the primary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par21">We conducted a parallel two-arm, randomised, sham-controlled feasibility trial.

Instrument-assisted manipulations to the thoracic spine were delivered in the prone position. Manipulation with or without mobilisation was supplemented with massage to hypertonic muscles of the cervical and thoracic spine, as determined by the clinical judgment of the practitioner, as well as advice on local application of heat at home. Massage consisted of a combination of effleurage, and ischaemic compression techniques.

However, a trial may be feasible with modifications to the study location and recruitment strategies. Recruitment of this study achieved sufficient numbers to calculate sample sizes for potential larger trials. Blinding was acceptable in both groups.</p><sec id="Sec37"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par63">We aimed for a sample size of 40 participants. However, recruitment did not reach this pre-defined arbitrary number, even with a six-month extension to the recruitment period. If conducted in the same setting, to reach the estimated sample size of 150 participants (using DHI as the primary outcome measure) would take more than four years, assuming a similar recruitment rate. This study found that using online recruitment methods could be useful in targeting older Australians over a wider geographic area. On the other hand, newspaper advertisements, while more expensive, captured a local population. Considering the relatively high proportion (12%) of participants who could not make the travel commitment to our single location, for future studies we recommended having multiple sites with sufficient geographical spread to increase recruitment and retention or performing the study in a facility with a high concentration of elderly people with neck pain and dizziness such as a specialty clinic.</p><p id="Par64">Older adults experiencing neck pain and dizziness often have co-morbidities. However, chiropractic intervention is unlikely to impact dizziness due to known vestibular or neurological origin, dizziness as a result of postural hypotension, or poly-pharmacy. Therefore, we recommend that the same exclusion of people with vestibular or neurological causes of dizziness be used for the larger study. Excluding these participants based on self-reported previous diagnoses, however, may not capture these individuals accurately. We recommend basing a future, larger trial in a rehabilitation setting such as a dizziness/falls clinic which provides access to clinical expertise and equipment to rule out vestibular, neurological, hypotensive and pharmacological causes of dizziness. Alternatively, the larger trial can be based on an effective referral system from a network of general medical practitioners. Exclusion of people based on cognitive-function testing has been shown to reduce the generalizability of findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], particularly in older people with pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, the validity of self-reported measures of pain and function depends on intact memory and executive function. Participants in this trial who were excluded based on cognitive function were significantly disappointed to the extent that one of them lodged a complaint to the ethics committee. Future studies should consider how participants with potential impairments in cognitive function can be included, using outcome measures that are still able to capture self-reported pain and function. Alternatively, if a threshold of cognitive function is used as an exclusion criteria in future studies, procedures need be in place to direct excluded participants to providers of therapeutics for neck pain and dizziness to avoid disappointment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Compliance with outcome assessment</title><p id="Par65">The assessment regime was not too onerous for the participants and was completed in a timely manner. However, several participants missed individual questions on the questionnaires, and had to be prompted by the investigator to fill these in. It was necessary to have an investigator review completed questionnaires to check that all questions had been completed at the end of the assessment session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Compliance with the intervention</title><p id="Par66">The drop-out rate for participants was acceptable, with less than 15% for each group. However, this was for a relatively short intervention schedule of 4 visits over 4&#x000a0;weeks. It cannot be determined from this study if a longer, more intensive or less intensive schedule would have good compliance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Location</title><p id="Par67">Conducting the trial at a university campus meant that some participants became lost trying to find the building location. Future studies should be conducted in an easy to find location with convenient car parking facilities, and ideally with a choice of several sites to capture participants who cannot travel long distances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Interventions and blinding</title><p id="Par68">The protocol of using the Activator II&#x02122; instrument (set on zero) as a sham-chiropractic intervention appeared to achieve sufficient blinding in participants. This tool appears to be a useful blinding tool for future similar studies, particularly ones in which the experimental intervention consists of Activator II&#x02122;-instrument delivered manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Costs</title><p id="Par69">The costs and time to recruit sufficient numbers may be a challenge for a larger fully-powered RCT. Use of a network of chiropractic intervention sites may increase feasibility of recruitment. The cost of AUD$2415 per participant may prove prohibitive if only small grant funding is available. To reduce this expenditure, the larger study could be based in a dizziness/falls clinic of a general or rehabilitation hospital. The use of a specialised or hospital recruitment setting would necessitate modification of this protocol, and our results may not be reflective of the participants recruited in such settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Harms</title><p id="Par70">Fifteen out of 23 participants did not report any harms. Mild harms such as transient increases in neck pain or headache are common following chiropractic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, participants in the sham group also reported these harms, so these may be related to natural and non-specific effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par71">Trials of non-pharmacological interventions for pain and dizziness in older people are scarce. This trial provides useful information in the Australian context on recruiting older people, and blinding for spinal manipulation, both of which are challenging. This is important information for future research. Furthermore, this was a feasibility study for determining effectiveness rather than efficacy. This necessitated that the intervention given reflected a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; combination of intervention strategies that Australian chiropractors would provide. Effectiveness studies by nature are not mechanistic and cannot identify the &#x02018;active ingredient&#x02019; in the intervention package. But they do have higher external validity in their relevance and applicability to actual practice. In this sense, this was a trial comparing usual chiropractic care with sham chiropractic care. The intervention combination used here reflects the practice approach of a majority of Australian chiropractors (unpublished data), and follows contemporary practice guidelines for the treatment of the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, it does not reflect every chiropractor&#x02019;s practice style, particularly in its exclusion of manual manipulation of the neck. This limits the relevance of this study to trials of manual neck manipulation, as the biomechanics of manual manipulative thrusts are likely to be different from those delivered by an Activator instrument.</p><p id="Par72">This trial was limited by the short-term follow-up, and no conclusions can be drawn about compliance with longer follow-up times. While the results of this trial advocate for conducting a fully-powered RCT at multiple locations, it did not test the feasibility of a protocol to ensure consistent recruitment and data collection across several sites. These issues should be investigated before such large-scale multi-centre studies are attempted. Another limitation of this study is that the participants were excluded based on self-reported previous diagnoses of dizziness, and were not uniformly screened by specialist medical staff to exclude other causes of dizziness. This may have made the cohort of participants somewhat heterogeneous. However, this heterogeneity reflects private practice that takes place within the primary care setting. Furthermore, this study is limited by including participants with very low intensities of dizziness and neck pain. There was no threshold for severity or intensity of dizziness or neck pain for inclusion. Setting of minimum DHI and NDI scores as inclusion criteria for future studies is recommended, although this would lead to a lower proportion of interested participants being eligible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par73">A large trial in an Australian university setting using the current protocol is not likely to be feasible primarily for financial and recruitment reasons. However, a fully-powered clinical trial may be feasible at an appropriate hospital or rehabilitation setting, which would require sample size of 150 (75 per group) or 222 (111 per group) using DHI or NDI as the primary outcome measure respectively. Activator II&#x02122;-instrument-assisted sham intervention provided acceptable blinding.
