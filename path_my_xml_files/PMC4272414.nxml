repolarization in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers were randomized to one of four treatment
sequences (n = 112) involving four successive treatments in different order: pasireotide 600
&#x000b5;g (therapeutic dose) or 1,950 &#x000b5;g (maximum tolerated dose) bid by subcutaneous
injection (sc), placebo injection and oral moxifloxacin. Maximum &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI occurred 2
hours post-dose for both doses of pasireotide. Mean &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI was 13.2 milliseconds
(90% CI: 11.4, 15.0) and 16.1 milliseconds (90% CI: 14.3, 17.9) for the 600 and 1,950
&#x000b5;g bid doses, respectively. Maximal placebo-subtracted change in QTcI from baseline for
moxifloxacin was 11.1 (90% CI: 9.3, 12.9) milliseconds. Both pasireotide doses caused a
reduction in heart rate: maximal heart rate change compared with placebo occurred at 1 hour for
pasireotide 600 &#x000b5;g bid and at 0.5 hours for pasireotide 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid, with heart rate
reductions of 10.4 and 14.9 bpm, respectively. At the therapeutic dose of 600 &#x000b5;g, pasireotide
has a modest QT-prolonging effect. The relatively small increase of &#x0223c;3 milliseconds in
&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI in the presence of a 3.25-fold increase in dose suggests a relatively flat
dose&#x02013;effect relationship of pasireotide on &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI in healthy volunteers. No
safety concerns for pasireotide were identified during the study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pasireotide</kwd><kwd>QT intervals</kwd><kwd>heart rate</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>healthy volunteers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Pasireotide, a somatostatin analogue, has been approved for the treatment of Cushing's

a William's square four-way crossover in healthy volunteers. Assuming a 35% dropout
rate, it was expected that approximately 112 subjects should be randomized (28 per treatment arm) to
ensure 72 completers. The study consisted of a 3-week screening period followed by one of four
randomized treatment sequences, each with four successive treatment periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).

sc dose). Subjects were not allowed to consume alcohol or caffeine; all meals were controlled and

recommended in the ICH guidelines,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> that is, to determine
that the upper one-sided 95% confidence bounds for all the mean differences between
pasireotide sc 600 &#x000b5;g bid and placebo (pasireotide minus placebo) on the QTcI interval change
from baseline exclude 10 milliseconds.</p><p>The null hypothesis was a union of 11 individual hypotheses (one non-inferiority hypothesis at
each time point), commonly referred to as an intersection&#x02013;union test. The null hypothesis was
rejected if the upper one-sided 95% confidence bounds for all 11 tests were less than 10
milliseconds. Therefore, the &#x003b1; level (type I error) did not need to be adjusted in order to
maintain the overall &#x003b1; level. However, the need for simultaneous rejection required &#x003b2;
(type II error) to be adjusted using the multiplicity adjustment. Since observations within the same
subject were possibly correlated (assumed to be compound symmetry [cs] structure), it
was expected that the hypotheses were also correlated. Given that no statistical methodology was
readily available then to obtain sample size after accounting for the correlation, a simulation was
conducted to obtain a sample size estimate. It was estimated that 72 subjects (18 subjects in each
of the four sequences) would provide at least 90% power to claim no QT effect. The
assumptions were: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The true difference (active/placebo) was equal to 2 milliseconds at two time points and was equal

time points. The above calculation was based on the Simes test<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and an overall type I error of 5% (one sided), with the assumption that the mean
differences were 5 milliseconds or more between the moxifloxacin 400 mg and placebo groups at 0.25,

health based on past medical history, medical examination, vital signs (including blood pressure,
heart rate, weight, and body mass index), ECG, and laboratory screening.</p><p>The study was approved by the Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (German
authority) and Ethics Committee Berlin and was conducted according to the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided written informed consent.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, autonomic dysfunction,
acute or chronic bronchospastic disease, or clinically significant drug allergy; were positive for
HIV or hepatitis B or C infection; had a history of drug or alcohol abuse or use of tobacco; or had
any clinically significant laboratory abnormality or clinically significant illness within 4 weeks
before dosing. Female subjects were excluded if they were pregnant or lactating. Cardiac-specific
exclusion criteria included previous or current clinically significant ECG abnormalities (defined as
PR &#x0003e;220 milliseconds, QRS &#x0003e;110 milliseconds, corrected QT interval
[QTcF] &#x0003e;470 milliseconds for females and &#x0003e;450 milliseconds for males;
any cardiac conduction abnormality; use of concomitant medications that could prolong QT interval
and/or induce torsades de pointes and ventricular arrhythmia); significant heart disease (e.g.,
atherosclerosis, heart failure); or risk factors for torsades de pointes.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>ECG data</title><p>ECG recordings were collected using Holter monitoring over 24 hours at baseline (study days
&#x02212;1, 15, 30, and 45) and at steady state on day 5 of each treatment period (study days 5, 20,
35, and 50). During these specific recordings, the subjects lay quietly supine for 10 minutes,
ensuring that the heart rate (HR) had been stable for 2 minutes prior to the defined ECG time point
recording. Triplicate ECGs were then extracted at the pre-specified time points of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1,
1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (on day 5, 0 hour was pre-dose and all subsequent time points were
post-dose). In addition, Holter monitoring was performed for 12 hours on day 1 of treatment period
1, and ECGs were extracted at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 hours to accurately capture
the time course of the ECG (QT and HR) effect of pasireotide and the detection of any early
asymptomatic arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling for full PK profiles and analysis was performed after the
morning dose on day 1 of treatment period 1, and on day 5 of each treatment period (study days 5,
20, 35, and 50) at 0 hour (pre-dose) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (treatment
day 5 only) post-dose. A single PK blood sample was collected pre-dose for each treatment period to
assess potential drug residue (carryover) from the previous crossover treatment period. Blood
samples for PK evaluation were collected in K2EDTA tubes after vital sign and ECG measurements at
each time point; samples were stored frozen at &#x0003c;&#x02212;18&#x000b0;C until analysis. Duplicate
PK samples were shipped to two locations: for pasireotide analysis, one full set was sent to
Atlanbio, France, and for moxifloxacin analysis, the second set was sent to WuXi App Tex Co Ltd,
China.</p><p>Pasireotide plasma concentrations were measured using a validated radioimmunoassay with a lower
limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.15 ng/mL and upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) of 2.5 ng/mL.
The radioimmunoassay is based on the competition between <sup>125</sup>I-pasireotide and pasireotide
for a fixed number of antibody binding sites. Samples or standards were incubated with
<sup>125</sup>I-pasireotide tracer and anti-serum and the complexes captured using coated magnetic
beads. After elimination of the unbound fraction by washing, the bound radioactivity was determined
in a gamma counter. All samples were analyzed in duplicate along with daily prepared calibration
standards and quality control samples (QCs). Duplicate QCs at four concentrations spanning the
quantifiable range were included in each batch and results were accepted when at least six of the
eight QCs, including at least one at each QC concentration, were within 30% of the nominal
concentration. In addition, results for individual samples were accepted when the coefficient of
variation between duplicates was less than 30%. Moxifloxacin plasma samples underwent
solid-phase extraction followed by dilution and analysis by electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry performed using an API4000 instrument (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Massachusetts, USA)
with a LLOQ of 50 ng/mL and ULOQ of 10,000 ng/mL. PK parameters of pasireotide and moxifloxacin were
estimated by Phoenix WinNonlin (v5.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Safety assessments consisted of physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs and recording of
all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), ECG effects (rhythm, ectopy, conduction defects, ST
segment changes and morphological changes in U waves and T waves) and laboratory evaluations
(hematology, coagulation, and standard biochemistry parameters, including liver, renal, and thyroid
function tests).</p></sec><sec><title>Categorical analyses</title><p>Categorical analyses were performed to summarize the frequency and percentage of subjects in each
treatment arm who had a maximum increase from baseline exceeding the following thresholds using the
average of the replicate ECGs at each post-dose time point:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>QT</italic>: QT/QTc time-matched change from baseline &#x0003e;30, &#x0003e;60

placebo-controlled change from baseline in QTcI (&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI) on active treatments
(pasireotide sc 600/1,950 &#x000b5;g bid, moxifloxacin). QTcI was derived using the estimated slope b
from the model log(QT) = a + b &#x000d7; log(RR) for each individual (QTcI =
QT/RR<sup>b</sup>), using their study day &#x02212;1 QT-RR data. QTcB was calculated as
([QT(ms)]/[RR(s)]/[1,000<sup>1/2</sup>]); QTcF was
calculated as ([QT(ms)]/[RR(s)]/[1,000<sup>1/3</sup>]),
considering that RR was measured in seconds.</p><p>&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI was analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model that included the terms of
sequence, treatment, period, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and the term
of subject as the random effect, where time was a categorical variable. The baseline QTcI was also
included as a covariate. Baseline was period specific and time point specific and defined as the
average of triplicates at each of the pre-specified time points. Day &#x02212;1 data and day 5 data
from each of the four periods were used for analysis. Point estimates and 90% confidence
intervals (CIs; two sided) were generated at each time point on each day for &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI. A
lack of QT effect for pasireotide was established if the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI
for the estimated &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI on day 5 was &#x0003c;10 milliseconds for all 11 pre-defined
time points.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Similar statistical analyses were conducted
for QTcF, QTcB, and HR. A post hoc gender subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the
placebo-corrected changes from baseline in QTcF, QTcI, PR, and HR by gender (males, n = 70
and females, n = 35) in subjects treated with pasireotide 600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid up to 8
hours post-dose.</p><p>Analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between plasma concentrations of
pasireotide and moxifloxacin with changes in cardiac intervals to assist the interpretation of the
study results. To examine the relationship between pasireotide plasma concentration and QT/QTc
intervals, the following three models were used.</p><sec><title>Linear model</title><p>This analysis was performed for both pasireotide and moxifloxacin. A linear model
(&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI = &#x003b1; + &#x003b2; &#x000d7; concentration) was fitted to the
&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI, where the concentration was measured at the same time as the QTcI was
observed. Period 1 day 1 data and day 5 data for each of the four periods were used for analysis.
Assuming a linear relationship between drug exposure and &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI, the mean maximum
effect and upper one-sided 95% confidence limit for each dose level (600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g
bid) were computed from the mean maximum plasma concentration using the following equation: mean
maximum effect = &#x003b1;^ + &#x003b2;^ &#x000d7; C<sub>max</sub>, where
C<sub>max</sub> is the observed maximum concentration for each pasireotide dose level (600 and 900
&#x000b5;g bid) or moxifloxacin 400 mg, and &#x003b1;^ and &#x003b2;^ are the estimates
of the population intercept and slope for the relationship between &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI and plasma
concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Time-lag model</title><p>This analysis was performed only for pasireotide and assumed a constant time lag between the PK
and QTc (QTcI, QTcF, and QTcB) time profiles. A simple open one-compartment PK model with
first-order absorption was used to predict individual PK profiles. The use of the one-compartment
model is an approximation, given the fact that the time lag is evident after the peak concentration.
The assumption of a constant time lag between peak PK exposure and maximum placebo-corrected change
from baseline QTc is based on approximation. This approach required calculation of a time-lagged PK
profile C<sub>lag</sub>(t) for a given lag time t<sub>lag</sub>. For time t &#x0003e;
t<sub>lag</sub>, it was calculated as C<sub>lag</sub>(t) = C(t &#x02212; t<sub>lag</sub>),
while for t &#x0003c; t<sub>lag</sub>, it was predicted by the concentration on the same day,
assuming that steady state had been reached. C<sub>lag</sub>(t)s were calculated separately for
t<sub>lag</sub> = 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.5 hours, as in the linear mixed PK/PD model.</p></sec><sec><title>Simultaneous model</title><p>This analysis was based on the assumption that the concentration of pasireotide sc affects QT
intervals and RR simultaneously. This analysis offers an approach for describing and analyzing a
situation whereby a drug changes the QT correction factor for RR, QTc, or both.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The hypothesis of the
simultaneous model is that QT has two components: QT = P1 &#x000d7; P2. One component
describes the effect of concentration on QTc intervals independent of RR that can be expressed as P1
= &#x000e1;1 + &#x000e2;1 &#x000d7; concentration. The other component describes the
effect of concentration on QT through RR intervals that can be expressed as P2 =
RR<sup>&#x003b2;2+&#x003b4;&#x000d7;concentration</sup>. Generally, QTc can be expressed as QTc
= QT/RR<sup>a</sup>, where &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; is either a constant (QTcF, QTcB) or subject
specific (QTcI). This leads to the simultaneous model for the concentration effects on QT: QT
= (&#x003b1;1 + &#x003b2;1 &#x000d7; conc) &#x000d7;
RR<sup>&#x003b2;2+&#x003b4;&#x000d7;concentration</sup>, where the parameters may contain a
fixed and a random component. The model was fitted for both pasireotide and moxifloxacin. Given that
the effect of moxifloxacin concentration on QT and its lack of an effect on the RR correction are
known, this model was fitted for moxifloxacin as a way to validate the model.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject Demographics</title><p>Of the 112 randomized subjects, 103 (92.0%) completed all four treatment periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).

for pasireotide sc 600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid, respectively; these values are in the same order as
the Fridericia correction factor for QTcF (1/3, or &#x0223c;0.3). Similarly, moxifloxacin
concentration does not appear to affect the QT&#x02013;RR relationship and &#x003b2;2 was estimated to
be 0.3. The estimated mean placebo-subtracted change from baseline in QT at median C<sub>max</sub>

higher with pasireotide sc than with moxifloxacin or placebo (Supplementary Table S4).</p><p>The most frequently reported AEs with pasireotide sc 600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid were
injection-site erythema (73% and 90%, respectively) and gastrointestinal disorders;
these AEs were less common with moxifloxacin and placebo.</p><p>Gastrointestinal-related AEs tended to occur more frequently and be of greater severity with the
higher pasireotide dose than with the lower dose. Nausea and diarrhea were reported most frequently
(&#x0003e;50% and &#x0003e;80% in the pasireotide 600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid groups,
respectively, vs. &#x0003c;10% in the moxifloxacin/placebo groups). Headache, dizziness, and
fatigue were also more common with pasireotide than with moxifloxacin or placebo.</p><p>All AEs reported by subjects were grade 1 or 2, with the exception of one subject who developed
syncope (grade 3) and supraventricular arrhythmia (grade 4) associated with hypotension following
the first injection of pasireotide 1,950 &#x000b5;g on day 1 of period 1. These events were
considered SAEs and led to study discontinuation of this subject from the study. The subject
recovered within 24 hours of the events. The events were suspected to be related to study drug, but
were considered to be vasovagal in nature and not related to QT prolongation. No other grade 3 or 4
AEs were reported in the study and no other events leading to discontinuation were reported. No
deaths occurred during the study.</p><p>Laboratory evaluations revealed no clinically significant abnormalities in hematology parameters.
For biochemistry parameters, the most frequent grade 3 abnormality was recorded for elevated lipase,
which occurred in seven subjects receiving the higher dose of pasireotide. Six of these subjects had
normal lipase at baseline, and the grade 3 abnormality was recorded following pasireotide 1,950
&#x000b5;g bid. The seventh subject had grade 3 lipase abnormality at screening and intermittently
increased lipase values both during and after the study. Grade 3 increases in alanine transaminase
(ALT) following administration of pasireotide 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid were observed in one subject. The
subject had normal ALT (20.8 U/L), aspartate transaminase (AST; 20.9 U/L), and bilirubin (4.7
&#x000b5;mol/L) values at baseline, and no abnormally elevated ALT, AST, or bilirubin values were
recorded prior to study end. However, at the end of the study period, ALT was 175.2 U/L (grade 3),
AST was 98.0 U/L (grade 2), and bilirubin was 26.2 &#x000b5;mol/L (grade 2). One subject also met the
biochemical criteria for Hy's law. At baseline, the subject had normal bilirubin (7.5
&#x000b5;mol/L), ALT (17.2 U/L), and AST (17.9 U/L). At study end, bilirubin and ALT were elevated to
68.9 &#x000b5;mol/L (four times the upper limit of normal) and 157.6 U/L (three times the upper limit
of normal), respectively. Elevated AST (147.1 U/L) was also confirmed. Five days after the last dose
of study drug, total bilirubin and AST levels had returned to normal. ALT was still elevated (165.9
U/L) but returned to normal 18 days after the last dose of study drug (39.2 U/L). There were no
clinical sequelae. A grade 3 increased creatine kinase value was recorded for one subject following
administration of moxifloxacin, which decreased before the end of the study (day 31). Thyroxine
(FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were within normal limits for most subjects at
screening and the end of the study. Seven of eight subjects with normal screening TSH and elevated
TSH at the end of the study had pasireotide in their last treatment period (five with 1,950
&#x000b5;g bid, two with 600 &#x000b5;g bid), and one had moxifloxacin in the last period. With the
exception of a slight decrease in pulse rate for subjects who received pasireotide in their last
treatment period before the end of the study, no relevant changes in vital signs were observed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This Phase I study was conducted to provide information on the cardiac safety profile of
pasireotide at steady state (day 5) in healthy volunteers; specifically, to determine the effect of
pasireotide on QT/QTc interval. The study demonstrates a modest effect of subcutaneous pasireotide
on QTcI at both the 600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid doses. The maximal placebo-subtracted change from
baseline in QTcI (&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI) was observed at 2 hours post-dose and was 13.2 and 16.1
milliseconds for the 600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g doses, respectively. The small QTc difference between
the two doses (2.9 milliseconds) in the presence of a 3.25-fold increase in dose and exposure
suggests that the effect of pasireotide on QTcI could reach a plateau at this dose and exposure
range (corresponding to a mean C<sub>max</sub> range of 24.3&#x02013;80.6 ng/mL).</p><p>The cardiovascular safety of pasireotide has previously been examined using in vitro and in vivo
models. An in vitro electrophysiological study did not reveal inhibition of the hERG tail currents
at concentrations up to 10 &#x000b5;M (10,472 ng/mL). In a 39-week toxicity study in monkeys
receiving 3.2 mg/kg pasireotide (n = 4), no ECG or histopathological changes were seen. The
C<sub>max</sub> for the pasireotide concentration of 10 &#x000b5;M (9549 ng/mL) used in the hERG
assay was well above the C<sub>max,ss</sub> (80.6 &#x000b1; 25.2 ng/mL) for pasireotide 1,950
&#x000b5;g sc bid (n = 103) observed in healthy volunteers in the present study (Supplementary
Table S3).</p><p>Our study is fully compliant with the ICHE14 guidance for evaluating the potential QT/QTc
prolongation of drugs,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the use of 24-hour Holter
monitoring allowed continuous ECG collection. The crossover design reduced inter-subject
variability, allowing smaller sample sizes. We conducted this thorough QT study in healthy
volunteers because patients with Cushing's disease and acromegaly display an abnormally
prolonged QT interval, making interpretation of a drug-induced QT effect more difficult.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Prolongation of the corrected absolute QT interval beyond 500 milliseconds is considered to
represent a threshold for increased risk of proarrhythmia. In our study, there were no individuals
with QTc (QTcI, QTcF, or QTcB) intervals &#x0003e;500 milliseconds or a change from baseline
&#x0003e;60 milliseconds following treatment with either dose of pasireotide.</p><p>Both pasireotide doses caused a reduction in HR, with the maximum reduction compared with placebo
observed at 1 hour for pasireotide 600 &#x000b5;g bid (10.4 bpm) and at 0.5 hours for pasireotide
1,950 &#x000b5;g bid (14.9 bpm). Neither placebo nor moxifloxacin had a significant effect on HR.
Findings for QTcF were consistent with those for QTcI for both pasireotide and moxifloxacin. For
QTcB, no pasireotide treatment effect was observed, whereas the results on moxifloxacin were
consistent with those for QTcI and QTcF, illustrating that QTcB overcorrects the QT interval in the
presence of bradycardia, which is well known.</p><p>The results of the PK analysis showed that pasireotide sc was rapidly absorbed, with a
t<sub>max</sub> between 0.5 and 0.6 hours. PK analysis of moxifloxacin demonstrated similar
C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values compared to other TQT studies.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In accordance with ICH guidelines, moxifloxacin
was used as the positive control to verify assay sensitivity as it has been shown to induce QTc
prolongation. Based on the assessment of assay sensitivity, the null hypothesis of no effect of
moxifloxacin on QTcI could not be rejected (<italic>P</italic> = .065) and assay sensitivity
was not formally confirmed. However, the test may have failed because of the inclusion of early time
points in the analysis. The assay sensitivity was actually met (null hypothesis rejected with
<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) after excluding the early time points (0.5 and 1 hours) from the
assessment.</p><p>The predictions based on the linear regression for the estimated mean &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI
moxifloxacin and the maximal placebo-subtracted change in QTcI (11.1 milliseconds [90%
CI: 9.3, 12.9]) were consistent with previously reported values and confirms the sensitivity
of the study for testing the existence of QT effects of pasireotide.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The linear regression of the pasireotide sc concentration versus &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI
resulted in predicted effects on &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI at the median C<sub>max</sub> for pasireotide
600 &#x000b5;g bid (23.4 ng/mL) and 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid (77.8 ng/mL) that were consistent with the
primary analysis (upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI exceeded 10 milliseconds).</p><p>Two additional models were used to further understand the pasireotide concentration&#x02013;time
relationship and the time course of the pasireotide effect on &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI. One of those two
models was used to estimate and take into account the time lag between the peak pasireotide exposure
and the peak effect of pasireotide on QT. The modeling results of the time-lag analysis suggested a
lag of 0.8 hours between the peak exposure of pasireotide and the peak effect on
&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcI. This underestimation (observed time lag was 1.5 hours) could be accounted for
by modeling the PK concentration data in a one-compartment model. Whilst the effects with the
time-lag and linear models were similar at the therapeutic dose of 600 &#x000b5;g bid, the effect was
somewhat larger at the MTD in the time-lag analysis compared with the linear model. Another model
was used to estimate and take into account the effect of pasireotide concentration on HR. This model
under-predicted the pasireotide effect on QT intervals at both doses, perhaps because it did not
take into account the time lag between peak concentration and peak effect on QT.</p><p>No new safety concerns for pasireotide sc were observed in the study.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Most AEs were mild and transient. One subject discontinued because of a SAE that was
considered vasovagal in nature, with no QT prolongation present and which resolved without
treatment. Although most AEs were related to injection-site reactions and the majority were grade 1,
they occurred more frequently with pasireotide than with placebo. Furthermore, an increased
incidence of AEs at the higher dose indicates dose dependence; a similar trend was observed for
gastrointestinal AEs. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of pasireotide
on the baseline- and placebo-corrected QTcI and was not specifically designed to evaluate the safety
of pasireotide treatment. Nevertheless, these findings are consistent with results from other Phase
I studies conducted in healthy volunteers, in which pasireotide demonstrated good tolerability at
single doses up to 1,500 &#x000b5;g or with daily infusion up to 2,050 &#x000b5;g for 7 days, with the
most common treatment-related AEs being gastrointestinal.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Although early studies have indicated that somatostatin analogues may prolong QT interval, a
direct comparison between the effects of pasireotide and other somatostatin analogues is not
possible as there are no ICH E14-compliant TQT studies published on these other agents.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A recent Phase III pasireotide study in patients with
Cushing's disease reported treatment-emergent QTcF prolongation of &#x0003e;480 milliseconds
in only 3/162 (2%) patients.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These QT prolongations
were sporadic and did not require intervention or interruption of pasireotide treatment, and none
were associated with arrhythmic events.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Two patients had
syncope which was not associated with notable ECG changes.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
No cases of torsades de pointes have been reported in the pasireotide clinical experience.
Pasireotide has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines
Agency for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing's disease for whom surgery is not an
option or for whom surgery has failed. Before starting pasireotide therapy, monitoring for an effect
on QTc interval is advised and an ECG should be performed prior to and 1 week after beginning
treatment.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study confirm an effect of pasireotide on QTcI in healthy
volunteers at 600 and 1,950 &#x000b5;g bid doses, with a maximal placebo-subtracted change from
baseline at 2 hours post-dose. Both pasireotide doses also decreased heart rate. Although the
clinical relevance of the effect of pasireotide on cardiac repolarization observed in this study is
not clear, we note that there were no QTc outlier values (&#x0003e;500 milliseconds, or QTc changes
&#x0003e;60 milliseconds) or QT-prolongation-associated AEs in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG. Financial support for medical editorial assistance
