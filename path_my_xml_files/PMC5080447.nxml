Results showed no impact on SF-36 PCS scores between LIPUS and control groups (mean difference 0.55, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.75 to 1.84; P=0.41) or for the interaction between time and treatment (P=0.30); minimal important difference is 3-5 points) or in other functional measures. There was also no difference in time to radiographic healing (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.34; P=0.55). There were no differences in safety outcomes between treatment groups.

Moreover, the limited soft tissue envelope surrounding the bone predisposes tibial fractures to non-union.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is commonly used in North America after fracture surgery to accelerate fracture healing and prevent non-union.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Although randomized trials have suggested that LIPUS improves radiographic healing, inferences are limited because of small sample size, risk of bias, and inconsistent results.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Moreover, radiographic fracture healing represents a surrogate outcome that might not translate into accelerated functional recovery.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>In 2004, global revenues for bone stimulators were about $400m (&#x000a3;234m, &#x020ac;267m).<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Widespread use, however, does not assure effectiveness. Each year, unnecessary interventions are estimated to account for 10-30% of spending on healthcare in the US, or $250bn-$800bn (&#x000a3;154bn-&#x000a3;490bn; &#x020ac;190bn-&#x020ac;610bn).<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Reasons for unnecessary treatment include knowledge gaps, biased research, profit seeking, patient demand, and rapid uptake of unproved technology.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Interest in curtailing unnecessary treatment is growing. For instance, the American Board of Internal Medicine launched its Choosing Wisely campaign in December 2011, and the <italic>BMJ</italic>&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Too Much Medicine&#x0201d; initiative highlights the waste of resources on unnecessary care.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>To resolve the uncertainty regarding the role of LIPUS in operatively managed patients with tibial fractures, we conducted a multicentre, sham controlled, randomized controlled trial that prioritized functional recovery. The design of our trial was informed by a pilot study<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and a survey of 450 orthopedic trauma surgeons<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> that found surgeons were managing almost all tibial fractures operatively and using intramedullary nailing in more than 80% of fractures. Of the respondents, 45% used bone stimulators&#x02014;evenly split between LIPUS and electrical stimulation. Our null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in functional recovery or radiographic healing after surgical repair of a traumatic tibial fracture with intramedullary nailing, whether managed with adjunctive LIPUS or a sham device.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This multicenter, randomized, blinded, sham controlled, parallel group clinical trial was conducted at 43 North American university affiliated academic trauma centres between October 2008 and March 2013. There were no shared patients between the TRUST pilot study<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the TRUST definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Eligible patients were skeletally mature men or women with an open (Gustilo type I-IIIB) or closed (Tscherne grade 0-3) tibial fracture amenable to intramedullary nail fixation who provided written informed consent within 14 days of intramedullary nailing and were willing and able to comply with the study protocol.</p><p>We excluded patients in whom wound care precluded ultrasound-skin contact, pilon fractures, tibial shaft fractures that extended into the knee or ankle joint and required reduction, pathological fractures, bilateral tibial fractures, segmental fractures, spiral fractures &#x0003e;7.5 cm in length, concomitant injuries that, in the opinion of the attending surgeon, were likely to impair function for at least as long as the patient&#x02019;s tibial fracture, and tibial fractures that showed less than 25% cortical contact and &#x0003e;1 cm gap after intramedullary nail fixation. We also excluded patients if there were likely to be problems with maintaining follow-up (such as no fixed address), patients with cognitive impairment or language difficulties that would impede the valid completion of questionnaires, women who were pregnant or nursing or planned to become pregnant during their treatment period, or patients with osteobiologic implants at the site of their tibial fracture or with active implanted devices such as cardiac pacemakers.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>The manufacturer labeled and shipped visually identical active and inactivated (sham) Exogen 4000+ ultrasound device units to investigational sites according to a computer generated randomization plan created by the McMaster University methods center. Randomization was stratified by center and severity of soft tissue injury (open or closed) with randomly varied block sizes ranging from 2 to 4. After fracture fixation with an intramedullary nail, participating investigators randomized patients, in a 1:1 ratio, to LIPUS or a deactivated device (identical in appearance and apparent function) by accessing a 24 hour toll-free remote telephone randomization system that ensured concealment. Patients, surgeons and other clinicians, data collectors, outcome adjudicators, data analysts, and the industry sponsor were blind to treatment allocation until the data analysis was complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Perioperative care</title><p>Trauma fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons administered standardized care before and after surgery. The type of intramedullary nailing (reamed or unreamed), and the number of interlocking screws used, were at the discretion of the attending surgeon. For closed fractures, the protocol specified preoperative antibiotic administration be continued for 24 hours postoperatively, and for open fractures, antibiotic administration (including a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside, if indicated for grade IIIA-IIIB fractures) continued for 72 hours postoperatively. Irrigation and debridement of soft tissues and contaminated bone was repeated as necessary, and delayed wound closure, split thickness skin grafting, or muscle flaps (for grade IIIB only) occurred only after the initial surgery. For both open and closed fractures, cortical contact of the fracture ends guided weight bearing. If cortical contact was achieved, patients were instructed to weight bear as tolerated. Otherwise, patients were instructed to partially weight bear on the affected limb until performance of a definitive procedure to achieve contact.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Each patient received a LIPUS device containing a timer that monitored treatment times and automatically turned the unit off after 20 minutes, verbal instructions in its use, and a booklet containing detailed instructions. The device transmits a low intensity ultrasound signal (30 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) to the fracture site through coupling gel. This is similar to diagnostic ultrasound levels used in sonography (fetal monitoring) procedures. Because of the low intensity, patients feel no sensation during treatment. The active and sham devices had the same visual, tactile, and auditory signals and were therefore indistinguishable. Patients self administered treatment once daily for 20 minutes until their surgeon determined that their fracture showed radiographic evidence of bridging at all four cortices or until the 52 week follow-up visit, whichever occurred first.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>We assessed outcomes at discharge and at follow-up visits at 6, 12, 18, 26, 38, and 52 weeks postoperatively. We submitted our trial protocol to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval with a primary effectiveness outcome of return to function (short form-36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) scores). The FDA, however, requested we change our primary outcome to radiographic healing. After discussion, the FDA agreed to accept a co-primary outcome of SF-36 PCS scores and time to radiographic healing, with the understanding that, in independent analyses, both endpoints had to show a clinically important treatment effect for the results to be considered positive. The primary safety outcome was the difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with adverse events related to the device and unplanned secondary procedures related to bone healing and infection.</p><p>In December 2015 the industry sponsor edited the trial registry data to reflect the co-primary outcome agreed with the FDA (that is, added SF-36 PCS scores) and replaced the secondary outcome of rate of non-union with treatment compliance. The primary and secondary outcomes that we have reported are consistent with the original protocol with the modification requested by the FDA.</p><p>The SF-36 has shown construct validity, test-retest reliability, and acceptable responsiveness in orthopedic populations; evidence suggests that patients consider a difference of 3-5 points or more as important.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Our survey of orthopedic trauma surgeons found that 80% of respondents thought a reduction in healing time of six weeks or more, attributed to a bone stimulator, would be important to patients.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>A central adjudication committee, comprising orthopedic trauma surgeons who were blind to device allocation, independently adjudicated patient eligibility, time to radiographic healing (bridging of three cortices), non-union, secondary procedures, and adverse events related to the fracture. Radiographic non-union was defined as failure of the fracture to progress further towards radiographic healing for at least eight consecutive weeks, after a minimum of six months (26 weeks) after initial intramedullary nailing. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.</p><p>Study centers sent digital photographs of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs to the methods center. The adjudication committee assessed radiographic healing using the radiographic union scale for tibial fractures (RUST) system, which assigns a score to anteroposterior and lateral radiographs based on the assessment of healing at each of the four cortices visible on these projections.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Each cortex receives a score of 1 point if it is deemed to have a fracture line with no callus, 2 points if there is callus present but a fracture line is still visible, and 3 points if there is bridging callus with no evidence of a fracture line. The individual cortical scores were added to give a total for each set of films with 4 being the minimum, indicating the fracture is definitely not healed, and 12 the maximum score, indicating the fracture is fully healed. A cortex was judged as bridged when it achieved a RUST score of 2 or 3. Although they were deemed radiographically healed when, in the opinion of the adjudication committee, three cortices were bridged, to guard against missing data from misclassification by site investigators, patients continued to use their study device and undergo radiographic evaluation until the site investigator determined that all four cortices were bridged. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were standardized, whenever possible, with use of the same x ray machine at each site and the same exposure settings.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were return to work without limitations among those who were employed before their injury; return to household activities without limitations; return to at least 80% of function from before injury; return to leisure activities without limitations; time to full weight bearing; and scores on the health utilities index (mark 3), which is a validated generic utility measure&#x02014;evidence suggests patients consider a difference of &#x02265;0<italic>.</italic>03 points as important.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We evaluated self reported function by having participants indicate at each follow-up visit, on a scale from 0% to 100%, what their overall level of functioning was, with 0% representing no ability to function and 100% representing their level of functioning before injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The smallest difference in score SF-36 PCS that would be important for patients is not well established, and investigators have provided different estimates; however, a 3-5 point change in score on a 0-100 scale is often cited as a minimally important difference, based on the work by Stewart and colleagues.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Based on our previous study of health related quality of life in patients with distal tibial fractures,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the TRUST pilot study,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we anticipated a standard deviation of &#x02264;12 for SF-36 PCS scores. Considering these findings, we estimated that 250 patients per group would be required to have a power of 80% (&#x003b1;=0.05, two tailed) to identify a difference in absolute scores of 3 points between treatment and control groups. Our power calculation was based on detecting an average difference between the groups, rather than the test of the interaction term planned in the analysis, and was therefore conservative. Our sample size calculation is based on SF-36 PCS scores as our co-primary outcome measure, radiographic healing, is a surrogate for functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Interim analysis and guidelines for study discontinuation</title><p>We planned an interim analysis when 300 patients had completed the trial, with review by a data monitoring committee using the O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming stopping rule.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The industry sponsor, however, conducted an unplanned interim analysis of blinded data from 237 TRUST patients with one year follow-up in November 2012 (groups were analyzed as &#x0201c;group A&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;group B&#x0201d;). Based on the finding of no difference in treatment effect between groups, and thus a conclusion of futility, the sponsor discontinued the study. We continued to collect data from patients up to March 2013. Submission was delayed as we dealt with the industry sponsor&#x02019;s many concerns, including requests for many post hoc subgroup analyses. All patients, clinicians, investigators, data analysts, and the industry sponsor remained blinded to allocation until analysis of all data was completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All patients enrolled were analyzed according to their randomized group, regardless of compliance with treatment or any other deviation from protocol (intention to treat principle). All patients without full follow-up, regardless of reason, were censored at their last follow-up. Data analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) with a threshold P&#x02264;0.05. We calculated compliance with treatment by dividing the number of days that patients administered &#x02265;18 minutes of LIPUS/day from the day they received their study device to when they achieved radiographic healing or their 52-week follow-up, by the total number of days within this time period.</p><p>Primary analyses considered only available data without imputation for missing data. We used multi-level linear models to examine SF-36 PCS and scores on the health utilities index over time including time, treatment, the interaction between time and treatment, severity of soft tissue injury (open versus closed), and the interaction between severity and time as independent variables in the model. The multi-level model, which allows for the clustering of repeated measures within patients and the clustering of patients within treatment site, included three levels: site, patient, and follow-up visit. We also performed adjusted analyses that added the following independent variables to our models: age, sex, smoking status, fracture gap, fracture pattern, and fracture grade, but not severity or its interaction with time because open versus closed is part of the fracture grade variable. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for SF-36 PCS scores using non-linear multiple imputation (fully conditional specification approach) to deal with missing observations.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>We evaluated time to radiographic healing, time to full weight bearing, time to return to work without restrictions, time to return to household duties without restrictions, time to return to at least 80% of function before injury, and time to return to leisure activities without restrictions, in LIPUS compared with control groups, using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by severity of soft tissue injury and clinical site. For time to radiographic healing, we also performed an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model including age, sex, smoking status, fracture gap, fracture pattern, and fracture grade as covariates. This model was not stratified by severity of soft tissue injury because open/closed is included in the fracture grade variable. The date on which patients received their study device was used as the starting point for all time to event analyses. In our analyses of binary endpoints, because they would be missing completely at random (uninformed censoring), we included patients who died or who did not continue to one year because the trial was stopped early. Data from patients lost to follow-up were also included up to the point of loss (informed censoring).</p><p>We compared the proportion of adverse events related to the device, deaths, unplanned secondary procedures related to bone healing and infection, and the occurrence of non-union between ultrasound and control groups with Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroup and sensitivity analyses</title><p>We planned one a priori subgroup analysis based on open versus closed fractures, with the anticipation that open fractures would show larger treatment effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient involvement</title><p>No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design or implementation of the study.&#x000a0;We did, however, respond to patient feedback regarding excessive questionnaire burden in the TRUST pilot study.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x000a0;No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of&#x000a0;results.

Most exclusions of potentially eligible patients occurred because fractures were not amenable to an intramedullary nail, patients were aged &#x0003c;18, patients stated they could not comply with the study protocol, or because there was concomitant injury that was likely to impair function for longer than their tibial fracture.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Fig 1</bold>&#x000a0;Recruitment of patients with tibial fractures and follow-up schedule</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="busj032767.f1_default"/></fig><p>Most patients were men who had been injured in a fall resulting in a closed tibial fracture, and 368 (74%) were employed before their injury; patients&#x02019; characteristics were similar in intervention and control groups (table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"/>).

Thus, the compliance found in our trial&#x02014;only 73% of our patients administered &#x02265;50% of all recommended treatments&#x02014;probably reflects patients&#x02019; use in real clinical settings. The level of compliance we observed is high enough that, if effects on time to radiographic healing seen in previous studies were present in our patients, we would have seen a substantial (albeit possibly attenuated) impact of the device.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications</title><p>The FDA approved LIPUS for fracture healing in 1994 on the basis of small trials at high risk of bias that showed that LIPUS accelerated radiographic healing.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Many medical devices, however, are approved for sale without randomized trial evidence of important benefit to patients.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A study published in 2016 found that of 99 medical devices recently approved by the FDA, 43 were cleared or approved before a clinical study was published.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Further, as is the case with LIPUS,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
