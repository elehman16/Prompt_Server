Survival was not significantly different in the two arms. Toxic reactions (WHO grade greater than 3) in the FEM and epirubicin arm respectively included nausea (2), (4), severe alopecia (1) (3) and leucopenia (1), (5), none of these were statistically significant. We therefore suggest that combination chemotherapy should not be used in preference to single agent chemotherapy as standard treatment for locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the pancreas.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="179" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="180" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="181" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
