Thirty patients were randomized to receive sequential HBI and 34 to receive CC. All patients received a local radiation boost to the primary lesion. An overall response rate of 87% was obtained in patients treated with sequential HBI and 88% in patients treated with CC. In patients with early disease, the estimated median survival was 43 weeks when treated with HBI and 42 weeks when treated with CC, but in advanced disease the estimated median survival was 15 weeks and 44 weeks respectively. Of the patients with an initial complete response, the estimated median survival was 51 weeks for HBI and 62 weeks for CC. From these observations we suggest that sequential HBI treatment technique with local radiation boost is an efficient method of tumour control in patients with early small-cell lung cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="228" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="229" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="230" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="231" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="232" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="233" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="234" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00431-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="235" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
