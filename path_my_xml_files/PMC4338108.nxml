We use a web-based, randomized experiment with a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 718) to test hypotheses derived from theory and research on narrative persuasion. Respondents exposed to narratives that acknowledged individual responsibility while emphasizing obesity&#x02019;s social determinants were less likely to engage in counterargument and felt more empathy for the story&#x02019;s main character than those exposed to a message that did not acknowledge individual responsibility. Counterarguing and affective empathy fully mediated the relationship between message condition and support for policies to reduce rates of obesity. Failure to acknowledge individual responsibility in narratives emphasizing social determinants of obesity may undermine the persuasiveness of policy narratives. Omitting information about individual responsibility, a strongly-held American value, invites the public to engage in counterargument about the narratives and reduces feelings of empathy for a character that experiences the challenges and benefits of social determinants of obesity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation via a grant to David Kindig and Pat Remington at the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute entitled, &#x0201c;Mobilizing Action Toward Community Health (MATCH)&#x0201d;.

While genetic predispositions, lifestyle decisions, and the social, physical, and economic environment (social determinants) influence rates of obesity, social determinants have had the largest role in driving the epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Reducing obesity rates will require a broad set of public policies to address these social determinants, but there is limited public support for such policies [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This has led researchers and policy experts to develop and test narratives designed to increase public support for policies that target obesity&#x02019;s social causes. This study tests whether narratives designed to increase support for obesity policy should acknowledge individual responsibility for achieving a healthy weight. We use a web-based, randomized experiment with a nationally representative U.S. sample to test hypotheses derived from research on narrative persuasion on the impact of stories about obesity.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Obesity policy narratives and individual responsibility</title><p>Policy narratives play a significant role in contemporary policy debates and, more recently, have been the focus of quantitative policy studies [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Another effort, however, found greater support for obesity-reducing policies among political conservatives in response to a short narrative (vs. no message) that avoided reference to individual responsibility while emphasizing social determinants [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These authors were cautious about this finding, however, due to the use of a convenience sample and the lack of a theoretical mechanism to explain the pattern of results.</p><p>These mixed results highlight the importance of identifying when acknowledging individual responsibility in narratives about the broader causes of obesity may influence support for efforts to address social determinants. The current study offers the benefits of a nationally representative sample and the ability to test theoretical explanations for differences in policy support in response to narratives that acknowledge (or not) individual responsibility when describing obesity&#x02019;s social causes.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Pathways to policy narrative persuasion</title><p>We propose a set of expected public responses that imply both persuasive advantages and disadvantages for narratives that acknowledge individual responsibility while emphasizing social determinants of obesity, compared to narratives that avoid mention of individual responsibility. Specifically, we modeled the persuasive effects of policy narratives by taking into account their impacts on cognitive responses and character (here, victims of obesity) perceptions.</p><p>One recent analysis found that a short story strongly acknowledging individual responsibility while emphasizing obesity&#x02019;s social causes increased the likelihood of respondents engaging in counterelaboration (i.e., thoughts focused exclusively on individual causes or solutions for obesity, without refuting external ones) [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While a follow-up study did not replicate this result, these authors did find that another story strongly acknowledging individual responsibility produced less simple elaboration (i.e., thoughts focused only on social causes or societal solutions for obesity) than a narrative that avoided reference to individual responsibility [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Combined, these studies suggest that story content about individual responsibility can focus audience thoughts on that content (increasing counterelaboration) at the expense of thoughts about social causes or solutions (reducing simple elaboration). We thus predict that a story strongly acknowledging individual responsibility will produce less simple elaboration (Hypothesis 1; H1) and more counter-elaboration (H2) than a story that does not acknowledge it.</p><p>Individual responsibility is a strongly held American value [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and individuals are often mentioned first in response to questions about who is responsible for causing and addressing obesity [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Respondents seem likely to question the omission of strongly held and accessible beliefs about individual responsibility in a message about obesity&#x02019;s causes [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We thus predict that a story acknowledging individual responsibility will produce less counter-arguing (i.e., thoughts that explicitly refute the intended persuasive theme that broader societal forces cause or bear responsibility for addressing obesity) than a story that does not acknowledge it (H3).</p><p>Affective Disposition Theory argues that morality judgments shape audience members&#x02019; feelings toward story characters [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Audiences want good things to happen to characters that demonstrate strong moral character. Since Americans consider individual responsibility both a value and moral virtue [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], readers of a narrative would appear likely to have more favorable judgments of a character that demonstrates strong individual responsibility than a responsibility without this virtue [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These favorable judgments, in turn, should increase the extent to which readers see themselves as similar to a character and feel for that character and her situation [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We thus predict that a story acknowledging individual responsibility will produce greater perceived similarity (H4) and more empathy (H5) than a story that does not acknowledge it.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Effects on support for obesity policy</title><p>To summarize, predictions about two cognitive responses (simple elaboration and counter-elaboration) suggest a persuasive advantage for a story that avoids mention of individual responsibility while emphasizing social determinants of obesity. Predictions about another cognitive response (counterarguing) and both character perceptions (perceived similarity and empathy), however, suggest a persuasive advantage for a story that acknowledges individual responsibility. On balance, these lead to a prediction that a story acknowledging individual responsibility (and emphasizing social causes) will produce more support for policies to reduce rates of obesity than a story that does not acknowledge individual responsibility (H6). We further suggest that this relationship will be mediated by reduced counterarguing (H7), increased perceived similarity (H8), and increased empathy (H9).</p><p>In a representative democracy like the US where no single party is likely to hold majority support, it will be important to generate support for obesity policy across partisan lines.

GfK panelists are recruited by address-based random sampling, covering 97% of American households and resulting in distributions that approximate US Census results on most major demographic categories (<xref rid="pone.0117565.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). If respondents do not already have home internet access, GfK provides them with a computer and internet access when they agree to participate in the panel. Due to the use of address-based sampling, the panel includes households with listed and unlisted numbers as well as cell phone-only households. Those who agree to participate in the panel complete a demographic profile and then respond periodically to web-based surveys. GfK&#x02019;s panel recruitment rate was 21 percent at the time of the study. GfK invited a random sample of 1,462 panelists to participate in the study. 718 participants actively consented using an electronic form and completed the study, producing a cooperation rate of 49 percent and a response rate (recruitment x cooperation) of 10 percent.

Respondents in non-control conditions read a 1-page story about Michele who struggled with her weight but benefitted from a community intervention to improve her neighborhood. Each story emphasized the high cost and lack of access to healthy foods, widespread availability of unhealthy foods, time constraints from a low-income job, and a lack of safe and affordable places for exercise in Michele&#x02019;s neighborhood.

Conditions that did not acknowledge individual responsibility were identical, except that they offered no indication that Michele took responsibility for her own health or weight loss (e.g., &#x0201c;Many people like Michele don&#x02019;t have the time or energy to adopt major lifestyle changes&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants and manipulation checks</title><p>There were no differences in demographics between the control, no individual responsibility, and high individual responsibility conditions (<xref rid="pone.0117565.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). While GfK calculates statistical weights in an effort to reflect the national population, the analyses reported in this paper did not use them. We made this decision for three reasons: (1) the substantive findings were similar regardless of whether or not weights were applied, (2) in all analyses we controlled for the demographic factors that were used to create the weights, which serves to adjust for possible confounding of these variables, and (3) recommended procedures for formally testing statistical mediation, a key step in the analysis do not permit the use of sampling weights [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Immediately after exposure, we compared narratives that acknowledged (or not) individual responsibility on two measures: perceived emphasis on individual responsibility (3 items, 5-point Likert scale, &#x003b1; = .85; e.g., &#x0201c;This story suggested that Michele is personally responsible for losing weight&#x0201d;) and perceived emphasis on societal responsibility (2 items, same scale, <italic>r</italic> = .32; &#x0201c;This story suggested that society is responsible for helping Michele to lose weight&#x0201d;).

The individual responsibility manipulation was thus deemed successful.</p><p>The empathy and partisan cue manipulations were much shorter, subtler, and designed as exploratory. The empathy manipulation occurred prior to reading the story. In the high empathy condition, we asked respondents &#x0201c;to try to imagine how Michele feels about what has happened and how it has affected her life. Try to feel the full impact of what Michele has been through and how she feels as a result.&#x0201d; In the low empathy condition, we asked respondents &#x0201c;to try to take an objective perspective toward what is described. Try not to get caught up in how Michele feels; just remain objective and detached.&#x0201d; We compared levels of affective empathy (described below) between conditions that asked respondents to read the message with empathy and those that asked respondents to read with detachment.

Coders classified each thought (<italic>N</italic> = 2,154) along three dimensions: whether or not they contained (a) internal attributions (thoughts focused on individual, controllable (not genetic) causes or solutions for obesity), (b) external/social attributions (thoughts focused on causes or solutions for obesity external to the individual), and (c) counterarguments (thoughts that directly refuted external/social attributions).

We used these codes to create four mutually exclusive categories, based on categories developed in previously published research, for each thought: (a) counterarguing (&#x02265; 1 counterargument); (b) complex integration (&#x02265; 1 thought combining external and internal attributions and without counterarguing external attributions); (c) simple elaboration (&#x02265; 1 thought exclusively about external attributions without counterarguing external attributions); and (d) counter-elaboration (&#x02265; 1 thought exclusively about internal attributions without counterarguing external attributions) [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Counterelaboration (not hypothesized; <italic>p</italic> = .11, &#x003b2; = .06) and perceived similarity (rejecting H8; <italic>p</italic> = .59, &#x003b2; = &#x02212;.02) were not associated with policy support and thus cannot be mediators [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The coefficient for the high versus no individual responsibility condition changed from 0.13 (<italic>p</italic> = .03, &#x003b2; = .09) to 0.01 (<italic>p</italic> = .93, &#x003b2; = .00) when both mediators were added to the model, consistent with full mediation.</p><p>We conducted formal tests of mediation using bootstrap methods with the INDIRECT macro for SPSS that estimates the overall indirect (mediated) and remaining direct effects (after accounting for mediators) of randomized condition on support for public policies to reduce rates of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using a 95% confidence interval (CI) and 5,000 bootstrap resamples, CIs for indirect effects of counter-arguing (H7;. 01 to. 05) and affective empathy (H9;. 06 to. 15) did not include zero, providing full support of H7 and H9. In contrast, the CIs for indirect effects of counter-elaboration (&#x02212;.001 to. 03) and perceived similarity (H8; &#x02212;.05 to. 03) included zero and thus are not significant mediators (rejecting H8). Consistent with full mediation, the total indirect effect of message condition on policy support via the mediators was significant (B = .13, <italic>p</italic> = .03) while the remaining direct effect of message condition on support was not (B = .01, <italic>p</italic> = .93).</p><p>While testing relationships between respondent demographics (which were included primarily for the purpose of statistical control) and cognitive response to narrative messages was not the focus of our study&#x02019;s rationale or design, a few noteworthy patterns emerged in the multivariable models presented in <xref rid="pone.0117565.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0117565.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>.

Women were more likely than men to see themselves as similar to the main character (<italic>p</italic> = .01), empathize with her (<italic>p</italic> = .004), and support obesity prevention policies (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;. 001). Finally, obese respondents were more likely than normal weight respondents to counterargue the narratives (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;. 001), and both obese and overweight respondents (<italic>p</italic>s &#x0003c;. 001) felt more similar to the character than normal weight respondents.</p><p>Turning to the possibility that effects of obesity narratives may differ by demographic factors, we tested RQ1 with interaction terms between political party (Republicans as reference group) and randomized condition in predicting obesity policy support. Interactions between political party and condition were not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>s &#x0003e;. 22). We also conducted a series of exploratory analyses (as suggested by a blind reviewer) to test whether the effects of message conditions on policy support differed by age, sex, race, formal education, or weight status. These analyses included 23 different statistical tests since many of these variables had multiple categories. Of these 23 tests, only 2 had <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.10, exactly the number that would be expected by chance alone given. We thus conclude that none of these demographic characteristics significantly influenced the impact of the obesity narratives on policy support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results suggest that failure to acknowledge individual responsibility in a narrative to increase support for obesity policy can undermine the narrative&#x02019;s impact, across the political spectrum. Respondents exposed to stories that explicitly acknowledged individual responsibility, while emphasizing social determinants of obesity, had higher levels of support for obesity policies than those exposed to a narrative that did not acknowledge individual responsibility at all. This occurred because those exposed to the high individual responsibility narrative were less likely to counterargue the story and felt more empathy for the story&#x02019;s protagonist than those exposed to a narrative that did not acknowledge individual responsibility.</p><sec id="sec012"><title>Theoretical implications</title><p>These findings highlight the importance of considering both cognitive responses and character perceptions in response to policy narratives. Relatively few studies have examined how plot, setting, and character features shape responses to policy narratives [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Theorists argue that narratives may be persuasive because they reduce the tendency to counterargue a message [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our results are consistent with this argument and further emphasize that strategic decisions about narrative design shape whether or not counterarguing occurs. Theorizing about narrative persuasion has also focused attention on the roles of empathy and perceived similarity with story characters [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our findings suggest that failure to generate empathetic feelings for the protagonist may be particularly detrimental in efforts to persuade. Empathetic responses to a story appear to vary considerably by the way a character&#x02019;s traits and behavior are described.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Practical implications</title><p>Practically speaking, study results (along with Gollust and Cappella [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) suggest that communicators should consider some degree of acknowledgement of individual responsibility in efforts to promote support for public policies to address health issues like obesity. While one previous study suggested that failure to acknowledge individual responsibility offered a persuasive advantage among conservatives only, albeit without any theoretical explanation, we failed to replicate this finding. [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The current study&#x02019;s results were consistent across political groups and were accompanied by clear theoretical mechanisms to explain the findings. The consistency and theoretical explanation of these findings, combined with the use of a nationally representative sample, lends credence to the reliability and generalizability of these results.</p><p>None of the narratives tested here were successful at increasing support for obesity policies relative to a no-exposure control group. While the current study makes clear that a failure to acknowledge individual responsibility at all is likely to be detrimental, the degree of emphasis to place on individual and societal responsibility in strategic narratives to promote health-related policy remains a difficult challenge. Previous work offers some clues, however.</p><p>A previous study tested three degrees of acknowledging individual responsibility (high, moderate, and none) and found that the moderate acknowledgement condition was also successful at increasing policy support [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This finding was accompanied by support for a proposed theoretical mechanism: increasing the degree to which respondents integrated individual and societal-level determinants of obesity (complex integration). While similar cautions apply to the study sample, the latter finding is on more stable ground due to the presence of a plausible theoretical explanation.</p><p>Obesity results from complex interactions between individual decisions and the environment in which those decisions are made. [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Individuals make decisions every day about what to eat and how active to be, but these decisions are shaped by the social, environmental, economic and physical environment in which they are made. Too much emphasis in strategic messages on individual agency may undermine support for policy interventions, [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] but too little emphasis may also undermine their effectiveness. Messages that underscore the complex relationship between individual decisions and their social context may hold substantial potential for shifting the public toward greater support for policy solutions that target social determinants of obesity. [<xref rid="pone.0117565.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Future research should continue to develop and test messages that successfully strike a balance between acknowledging individual decisions and emphasizing social causes of health issues. In the meantime, results underscore the need to pre-test messages to ensure that they invite cognitions (complex integration over counter-arguments) and character perceptions (affective empathy) that invite favorable responses to an obesity-related narrative.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Study limitations and future directions</title><p>Some of these findings differ from previous (similar) studies, highlighting the importance of further research on effects and mechanisms of narratives to influence health-related policy support. This study&#x02019;s use of the GfK panel was intended to address limitations of convenience samples utilized in previous work, but the GfK panel over-represents some groups relative to US Census estimates. Nevertheless, GfK&#x02019;s use of probability-based sampling and use of statistical controls for demographic characteristics in all tests of study hypotheses reduce these concerns.</p><p>The current study focused on one type of persuasive message (a strategic narrative designed to promote health policy) with a single character (a woman) in a single context (obesity). It is not known whether lessons learned in the current study can generalize to other forms of strategic messaging around obesity or other topics, or whether responses to the narrative might have differed if the story had focused on a male protagonist. Future work should test whether audiences respond differently to characters of different sex, age, race, and/or educational background. Future research should examine the extent to which variations in the degree to which message acknowledge individual responsibility shapes their impact on policy support in other forms of persuasive communication, including public service announcements, news articles, and policy briefs. Future work should also explore the generalizability of these findings to other health domains like tobacco use, alcohol use, and drug abuse, where public discourse and news coverage often frame debates around individual versus societal responsibility.

Failure to acknowledge individual responsibility in narratives emphasizing social determinants of obesity has potential to undermine the persuasiveness of policy narratives. Omitting information about individual responsibility, a strongly-held American value, invites the public to counterargue the narratives and reduces feelings of empathy for a character that experiences the challenges and benefits of social determinants of obesity. Such public reactance, in turn, undermines support for policies to reduce rates of obesity. Future research should develop and test narratives that fruitfully emphasize societal causes of other health and social issues amenable to policy intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117565.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Demographics of Obesity Narrative Attributions Study Participants, United States Adults [N = 718], 2011.</title><p>Abbreviation: N/A = not applicable; N/R = not reported; <italic>n</italic> = sample size; BMI = body mass index; <italic>M</italic> = mean; <italic>SD</italic> = standard deviation. <italic>Note</italic>.
