On admission to the operating room, they were monitored using continuous 12-lead ECG with continuous ST-segment analysis (Datex-Ohmeda, GE Health Care, Helsinki, Finland), pulse oximetry, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, endtidal CO<sub>2</sub>, end-tidal anesthetic gas concentration, arterial line, central venous line, and urinary catheter.</p><p>In the operating room, patients were managed by the same surgical and anesthesia teams. They were randomized using closed sealed envelopes to receive either inhalation anesthesia (sevoflurane group) or TIVA (propofol group). The anesthesia team and postoperative assessors were blinded regarding the study and worked according to the designed protocol of the investigators.</p><p>In sevoflurane group, anesthesia was induced by 8% sevoflurane (Sevorane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Abbott Laboratories SA, USA) with high 100% oxygen; and maintained at 1&#x02013;1.5 minimal alveolar concentration.</p><p>In propofol group, anesthesia was induced by 1&#x02013;2 mg/ kg; and maintained with continuous infusion of 2&#x02013;3 mg/ kg/h of propofol (Diprivan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Fresenius Kabi, Austria). In both groups, fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) was given at induction followed by continuous infusion (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) to provide adequate analgesia. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated with rocuronium (0.6mg/kg). Then, controlled ventilation was established with a tidal volume of 8&#x02013;10 mL/kg, inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2, and ventilatory frequency of 10&#x02013;12/ min aiming at normocapnia.</p><p>In both the groups, additional doses of fentanyl (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ kg) was used in the presence of signs of awareness (e.g., increase arterial pressure greater than the targeted mean arterial pressure, tearing, or sweating) and rocuronium (0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg) were administered as required to maintain neuromuscular blockade, respectively.</p><p>Appropriate amounts of Ringer lactate solution for maintenance, replacement of deficit, and replacement of blood loss were calculated and administered. Hemoglobin was maintained at 10 g/dL or higher and hematocrit at 30% or higher. Anesthetic concentration was adjusted to maintain heart rate and blood pressure within 20% of preoperative ward measurements. Hemodynamic variations were first treated by using anesthetic medications.</p><p>If hemodynamic variation did not begin to correct within 1 min, the following drugs were given: phenylephrine for hypotension, nitroglycerine for hypertension, atropine for bradycardia, and esmolol for tachycardia. Myocardial ischemia defined as a transient ST-segment elevation or depression in at least one lead, measuring &#x02265;0.1 mV, and lasting &#x02265;1 min in the absence of hemodynamic variations was managed with continuous nitroglycerine infusion.</p><p>Ischemic events were treated with adjustment of hemodynamics and intravenous nitroglycerine if persisted. Morphine (0.15 mg/kg) IM and paracetamol (1 g) IV were administered during closure of the surgical incision. Upon completion of surgery, the anesthetic agents were discontinued, muscle relaxant was reversed, and patients were extubated and transferred to the ICU. Management of analgesia and hemodynamics in the ICU was left to the judgment of the ICU physicians who were blinded to the study design.</p><p>ST-segment monitoring was performed continuously during intra- and postoperative 48 h periods. The ST-segment deviation was measured 60 milliseconds after the J point. Ischemic event was defined as a transient ST-segment elevation or depression in at least one lead, measuring &#x02265;0.1 mV, and lasting &#x02265;1 min. ST-segment changes were measured concomitantly in leads II, V<sub>4</sub>, and V<sub>5</sub>. ST-segment changes were confirmed by ECG printouts. After the elimination of artifacts, the trends of ST-segment monitoring, ECG printouts, and the preoperative 12-lead ECG of each patient were examined by a cardiologist blinded to the study design. For each ischemic event, the duration and magnitude of ST-segment deviation were measured. The number of ischemic events and the cumulative duration of ischemia in each patient were also recorded.</p><p>Blood was sampled in all patients for determination of cTnI. Samples were obtained before the induction of anesthesia, on admission to the ICU (T<sub>0</sub>), and at 6 (T<sub>6</sub>), 12 (T<sub>12</sub>), 24 (T<sub>24</sub>), and 48 (T<sub>48</sub>) h after admission to the ICU. cTnI was measured using immunoassay method (Architect stat Troponin-I, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois, USA). Analytic sensitivity of cTnI was &#x02264; 0.01 ng/mL. Myocardial infarction was defined as a rise in cTnI level &#x0003e; 1.5 ng/mL accompanied by at least one of the following: typical ischemic symptoms, ECG changes indicative of ischemia (ST-segment depression or elevation) or new pathologic Q wave.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>After discharge from the ICU, all patients were followed up during their hospital stay.
