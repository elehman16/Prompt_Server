So intubating LMAs like i-gel and Aura-i were not only rescue devices during resuscitation, but also could further secure the airway on account of facilitating tracheal intubation without ventilation interruption.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>Even though the use of LMAs by novice doctors has been studied in several manikin studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> data regarding intubating LMA is limited and skill degeneration without regular training has not been evaluated yet.

Afterward, all subjects were asked to practice on the manikin with each LMA device under guidance of the same senior anesthetist until 3 consecutive successful intubations with both devices were achieved. The participants were not allowed to watch others during insertion attempts, to avoid any learning effect throughout the whole process. Both devices and the manikin were well lubricated according to manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Then each participant was asked to stand at the head of the manikin, inserted each of the 2 LMAs in a randomized sequence.

Although tracheal intubation is the most widely used method for providing and maintaining secure airway, which is difficult to learn for those without airway experience and has unacceptably high failure rate causing substantial morbidity and mortality in novice hands.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> bag mask ventilation (BMV) is associated with high possibility of regurgitation and aspiration.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In addition, both tracheal intubation and BMV have markedly decreased performance at follow-up in inexperienced hands without constant practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> However, LMAs may benefit when establishing airway in emergency situations by novice physicians. It has been proven that LMAs are easy and safe to use after short training period.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>However, the risk of regurgitation or aspiration will increase if the time to use LMAs prolonged, especially for patients with abnormal gastric empty or high airway pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> It would be a wise choice to replace LMAs with endotracheal tube earlier, when prolonged mechanical ventilation needed. So we considered selecting intubating LMAs, which could serve as conduit for intubation. It will be safer and more convenient to conduct endotracheal intubation via LMAs inner lumen without interrupting ventilation or compression in CPR, particularly for difficulty airways.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Up until now limited data were available for which intubating LMA had better learning performance than others, especially in hands of novice. Therefore we designed this study.</p><p>The results from this study concealed with previous studies that LMAs have short insertion time for novice physicians.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Stroumpoulis et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> described the time of intubation for i-gel was 15.2&#x0200a;seconds for novice doctors. In a skill retention study for 3-year medical students, the application time of i-gel was 10&#x0200a;seconds during first attempt, and 12&#x0200a;seconds at follow-up assessment.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> LMAs stand substantially indirect way of airways establishment without visualization of vocal cords and surrounding structures.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> However, there were no studies reporting the insertion time to achieve lung ventilation for Aura-i in novice.</p><p>In our study, TTV with the i-gel was half of that with the Aura-i in both initial and reevaluation after 90 days. The i-gel was applied in less than 30&#x0200a;seconds in both assessments for all participants. The main reason might be that i-gel has a noninflatable cuff, so no further measures have to be taken after insertion. It has not been indicated how much time saving is &#x0201c;clinic significant&#x0201d; for airway establishment in emergency, especially in face of current guidelines emphasizing continuous chest compression.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> But shorter time to establish airways will directly shorten the time to deliver rescue breath, as well as detract less from more critical procedures as compression and defibrillation. So we suggest the i-gel might be more suitable among LMAs for emergency airway management.</p><p>It is of importance to remember that LMAs increase risks of aspiration compared with endotracheal intubation.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> So we considered gastric inflation in our study and found that it happened more frequently for Aura-i than predicted. The main reason was that participants often neglected to inflate the cuff and sometimes air inflated was insufficient. Although we advised 20&#x0200a;mL as ideal volume, difficulties might be met in practice. Sometimes, they ignored that the injector was not pushed into the cuff tightly. The i-gel can seal the laryngopharyngeal space without a cuff, which could reduce errors in handling. Nevertheless, the risk of regurgitation and aspiration remains and more clinical evidence should be gathered before LMAs can be recommended as a safe and effective primary alternative airway device in emergency airway situations such as CPR.</p><p>The high success rate in our study (100% within 2 attempts in initial examination) was consistent with other evidence related to i-gel and Aura-i when performed by novice operators.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Both LMAs had high first-pass success rates, satisficing bronchoscopy view and good LMAs insertion score with little differences in this study. In the initial assessment, 98% novice doctors could complete successful ventilation with both LMAs during first attempt, acquiring bronchoscopy view grade 1 or 2. So we suggest that intubating LMAs could be introduced to general wards with high feasibility, even for physicians not proficient in airway management. They could achieve rapid insertion and effective ventilation with high success rate after short training session. Moreover, the vocal cords were almost fully visible through the LMAs by bronchoscope, which will benefit skilled physicians performing endotracheal intubation later through the LMAs conduit.</p><p>To our surprise, despite intubation performance comparable, there was significant difference in subjective rating of ease-to-use. Participants announced that i-gel was much easier to manipulate than Aura-i during both assessments. The reason for ease assessment was partly speed of insertion. The participants said: &#x0201c;We don&#x02019;t need to inflate the balloon, so i-gel is much faster and easier to use,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;It's more intuitive to place i-gel, because you just pick it up and put into mouth.&#x0201d;</p><p>Airway management is likely to be infrequent for doctors in general wards, so skill acquisition and retention are both important for safe practice. At follow-up, i-gel and Aura-i showed comparable performance levels with the initial results in success rate, first-pass rate, bronchoscopy view, and LMA insertion score. Both LMAs were easier to handle and required less practice for their simple design. But TTV had markedly increased at the second assessment (i-gel increased by 26% and Aura-i 29%). In addition, the novice agreed that the initial intubation was easier both for i-gel or Aura-i, even though similar intubation performance was shown. One possible reason was that the novice doctors were not allowed to make any practice before the reevaluation. Consequently, we suggest that regular learning sessions and retraining may be helpful to improve self-confidence and skill, and further speed the insertion, although the skill retention was acceptable for both devices after 3 months.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, we did not investigate the effectiveness of the 2 intubating LMAs as conduits for tracheal intubation. It is appropriate to perform endotracheal intubation through intubating LMAs utilizing fibrobrochoscope after recovery of spontaneous circulation.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> de Lloyd et al<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> compared Aura-i and i-gel for fibreoptic-guided tracheal intubation in a manikin and showed quicker endotracheal intubation through i-gel and more failures through the Aura-i. Second, it was a manikin-based study that may not be definitively extrapolated to clinical application. The airway scenarios did not accurately simulate real intubation situations in resuscitation, such as blood, secretion, vomit, or trismus. Although the success rates, real time spent, and quality of ventilation may generally not be the same in actual patients,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> the differences between 2 intubating LMAs are likely to be analogous. Taking account of statistical design, the same manikin acted as a constant could allow strict standardization of placement for each LMA and each participant. So our results constitute a potential evidence for the use of intubating LMA for securing emergency airway in novice doctors. Additionally, the 2 missing participants in follow-up assessment might lead to potential bias.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that, in the hands of novice practitioners, both intubating LMAs evaluated could be placed accurately and successfully into manikin's airway after a brief training. The i-gel results in shorter insertion time and lower rate of gastric inflation compared with the Aura-i, and it is preferred as an easier device by participants. And the skill retention is acceptable 3 months later without retraining, except for the prolonged time to ventilation. We suggest i-gel may be a more efficient intubating LMA for novice physicians in managing airway and regular practice would benefit to maintain the skill.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge all the participants in this study to make the project possible.
