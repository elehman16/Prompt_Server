Decreased postural control ability is a
major risk factor for falls<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients
with stroke often show asymmetric standing balance, which affects stability limits, and can
cause difficulty in recovery of functional independence<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impaired postural control ability is a barrier to improvement of
balance and walking ability for independent living in patients with damage to the central
nervous system<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait disruption not only
limits independent living for stroke patients, but also puts them at risk for fall-related
injuries and for development of secondary impairments<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, a primary goal in stroke rehabilitation is to improve walking
ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance ability is a major
factor in improvement of walking ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, many therapeutic approaches that aim
to improve postural control in stroke patients have been investigated. This training can be
provided using different methods and contents, but should have a task-specific approach<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Body awareness training (BAT) is a method for improvement of dynamic balance and postural
control ability. BAT is comprised of simple repetitive movements that maintain ability using
stability limits<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A main component of
BAT is to enhance an individual&#x02019;s awareness of their movement<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Multiple slow repetitive movements may enable the participant to
experience the body and its limits. In other words, BAT generates awareness of one&#x02019;s body
and enables focus on body awareness during movement. Movements are performed in various
positions in order to identify the center line of the body. BAT results in improved postural
control, balance, free breathing, and coordination<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It has been suggested that BAT could be beneficial for improving balance in stroke
patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there are no
reported studies on the effects of BAT on balance and walking ability in chronic stroke
patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of BAT on
balance and walking ability in chronic stroke patients using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS),
Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and 10&#x02005;m walk test (10MWT).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 12 post-stroke patients admitted to the rehabilitation center of a
university hospital in the Republic of Korea. They were randomized into two groups by a
person not involved in the study. The experimental group performed BAT, followed by walking
training; BAT was performed for 20 minutes. The control group performed walking training
only. Randomization was performed by selection of opaque closed envelopes containing the
group assignment. The inclusion criteria were: (1) history and clinical presentation
(hemiparesis) of stroke (first hemorrhage or infarction); (2) event occurring &#x0003e; 6 months
previously; and (3) ability to walk a distance of 100 meters with or without assistance. The
exclusion criteria were: (1) the presence of any comorbidity or disability other than stroke
that would preclude gait training, or (2) any uncontrolled health condition for which
exercise was contraindicated.</p><p>Participation was voluntary, and the subjects fully understood the study. Written informed
consent was obtained from all subject after an explanation of the study purpose and the
experimental method and processes were provided. The study was approved by the institutional
review board of Daejeon University and followed the principles outlined in the Declaration
of Helsinki.</p><p>A four-week training study was designed to evaluate the effect of BAT on balance and
walking ability in chronic stroke patients.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used as a general balance test<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. This scale consisted of 14 balance activities, ranging
from sit-to-stand to standing on one leg.</p><p>The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) was used as a dynamic balance test<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This test records the time taken to rise from a chair
(height: 50&#x02005;cm), walk 3 m, turn around a marker, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</p><p>The 10&#x02005;m walk test (10MWT) was performed by walking 10&#x02005;m for the gait speed<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were asked to walk as
fast and as safely as they could.</p><p>Twelve patients fulfilled the criteria and voluntarily agreed to participate in this study.
The participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 6) or control group (n = 6).
The intervention comprised 4 weeks of inpatient treatment. Both groups received walking
training for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Participants in the experimental
group performed BAT for 20 minutes using the method of Lindvall et al<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects participated with bare feet to ensure contact
with the floor during training. The expectation was that participants would experience
physical awareness of body movement, and would learn how to integrate the movement.
Movements were performed sitting and standing. To practice optimal alignment while sitting,
a pillow wedge was used, and participants were not permitted to lean against the backrest.
The participants were asked to be aware of changes in body tension. Stability limits were
experienced by shifting body weight forward, backward, left, and right, until a sense of
balance was achieved. In standing, the center line was perturbed by twisting around the
center line with the arms lightly swinging.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline data. Categorical variables (gender,
side of stroke) were compared between groups using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Between-group
comparisons of baseline characteristics were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
Within-group comparisons of pre- and post-test values in each group were made using the
Wilcoxon signed rank test, and between-group comparisons for post-test values were performed
using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The significance level used was p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All the participants completed the entire study. There were no significant group

ability in patients with chronic stroke. Both groups showed significant changes after the
intervention, and the experimental group showed more significant changes than the control
group in BBS and TUG results. However, there was no significant change in the 10MWT. The
findings of this study show that BAT improved balance ability in chronic stroke
patients.</p><p>Balance depends on multiple sensory inputs and neuromuscular system interactions, and is
crucial for stroke patient because falls often result from poor body awareness. In our
study, BAT consisted of sensory stimulation and awareness of shifting body weight. As a
result, balance ability improved. However, waking speed is related more to strength than to
sensation. This was demonstrated in our study. Thus, walking speed did not show significant
differences between groups (p&#x0003e;0.05)</p><p>Decreased balance ability may occur through disturbances of walking ability necessary for
independent living in stroke patients<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In our study, the participants in the experimental group received BAT as an add-on to
walking training for 20 sessions. The control group received only usual walking training.
These results showed that BAT may be an effective method for improving balance ability.</p><p>In a study by Gyllensten et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
participants receiving the intervention had improved body awareness, body acceptance, and
self-efficacy. Our study showed similar results. In our study, the experimental group showed
greater improvement in the BBS and TUG than the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). These results
have a positive aspect in chronic stroke patients. For independent living, stroke patients
must be able to improve the ability to perform activities of daily living. These results
seemed to indicate improved body awareness, and affected balance ability.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, only a small number of hospital patients were
recruited, so the data may not be representative of stroke patients as a whole. Second,
there was no follow-up to measure the long-term effect, so the durability of the effect
could not be determined. Thus, the results should be considered with caution.</p><p>In conclusion, this study investigated the effect of BAT on balance and walking ability in
chronic stroke patients using the BBS, TUG, and 10MWT. It revealed that BAT positively
affected the BBS and TUG, which measure balance. Thus, BAT is effective for the improvement
of balance ability win chronic stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial,
