The self-management training involved weekly group sessions for 6 months in which basic self-management skills were discussed and modelled followed by monthly group booster sessions for 24 months in which a community health worker reviewed patients&#x02019; self-management checklist journals. Two psychiatrists who were blind to group assignment evaluated the symptoms and social functioning of participants at baseline and 6 months and 30 months after enrollment using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS), and Morningside Rehabilitation Status Scale (MRSS). A total of 194 individuals (99 from the intervention group and 95 from the control group) completed the 2.5-year follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward method was used for analysis. </p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> Compared to the control group, the intervention group had lower mean scores in the BPRS, SDSS and MRSS at both follow-up points. The scores in the intervention group continued to improve during the maintenance phase of the treatment from 6 months to 30 months after enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Self-management training is an effective method to improve symptoms and social functioning among individuals with chronic schizophrenia living in the community. After six months of weekly training in self-management skills, monthly booster sessions reviewing patients&#x02019; daily checklist of illness-related symptoms events are sufficient to maintain the beneficial effects of the training. Further study of the long-term cost-effectiveness of this method is needed.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="zh"><sec><title>&#x076ee;&#x06807;</title><p>&#x08bc4;&#x04f30;&#x081ea;&#x06211;&#x07ba1;&#x07406;&#x08bad;&#x07ec3;&#x05bf9;&#x0793e;&#x0533a;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x05206;&#x088c2;&#x075c7;&#x06210;&#x05e74;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x07684;&#x06548;&#x0679c;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x065b9;&#x06cd5;</title><p>&#x0603b;&#x05171;&#x062db;&#x052df;&#x04e86;201 &#x04f8b;&#x06162;&#x06027;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x05206;&#x088c2;&#x075c7;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x0ff08;&#x05e73;&#x05747;&#x075c5;&#x07a0b;17.4 &#x05e74;&#x0ff09;&#x0ff0c;&#x05e76;&#x0968f;&#x0673a;&#x05206;&#x04e3a;&#x081ea;&#x06211;&#x07ba1;&#x07406;&#x05e72;&#x09884;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff08;n=103&#x0ff09;&#x0548c;&#x05e38;&#x089c4;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff08;n=98&#x0ff09;&#x03002;&#x081ea;&#x06211;&#x07ba1;&#x07406;&#x08bad;&#x07ec3;&#x05305;&#x062ec;&#x06bcf;&#x05468;&#x04e00;&#x06b21;&#x05c0f;&#x07ec4;&#x04f1a;&#x08bae;&#x0ff0c;&#x04e3a;&#x0671f;6 &#x04e2a;&#x06708;&#x0ff0c;&#x08ba8;&#x08bba;&#x0548c;&#x06a21;&#x062df;&#x057fa;&#x0672c;&#x07684;&#x081ea;&#x06211;&#x07ba1;&#x07406;&#x080fd;&#x0529b;&#x0ff0c;&#x07136;&#x0540e;&#x08fdb;&#x0884c;24 &#x04e2a;&#x06708;&#x07684;&#x06bcf;&#x06708;&#x05c0f;&#x07ec4;&#x052a9;&#x063a8;&#x04f1a;&#x08bae;&#x0ff0c;&#x0793e;&#x0533a;&#x0536b;&#x0751f;&#x05de5;&#x04f5c;&#x04eba;&#x05458;&#x056de;&#x0987e;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x07684;&#x081ea;&#x06211;&#x07ba1;&#x07406;&#x06e05;&#x05355;&#x03002;&#x04e24;&#x0540d;&#x05bf9;&#x05206;&#x07ec4;&#x05355;&#x076f2;&#x07684;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x079d1;&#x0533b;&#x0751f;&#x08bc4;&#x04f30;&#x053c2;&#x04e0e;&#x08005;&#x057fa;&#x07ebf;&#x0548c;&#x0767b;&#x08bb0;&#x0540e;6 &#x04e2a;&#x06708;&#x03001;30 &#x04e2a;&#x06708;&#x07684;&#x075c7;&#x072b6;&#x0548c;&#x0793e;&#x04f1a;&#x0529f;&#x080fd;&#x0ff0c;&#x091c7;&#x07528;&#x07b80;&#x0660e;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x075c5;&#x08bc4;&#x05b9a;&#x091cf;&#x08868;&#x0ff08;BPRS&#x0ff09;

The degree of disability associated with schizophrenia in China is higher than that of any other mental disorder.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> Psychiatric rehabilitation can reduce the severity of disability and, thus, improve social functioning among individuals with schizophrenia, but relatively few individuals with schizophrenia use rehabilitation services, despite their wide availability in urban parts of China. For example, a previous study found that only 2.2% of all individuals with a serious mental disorder who are registered in the monitoring system of persons with mental disorders in Shanghai used rehabilitation services provided by the 245 rehabilitation and community daycare centers across the municipality.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> This low service-utilization makes it difficult to achieve the goal of reducing the disability and disease burden associated with schizophrenia. One approach to addressing this issue is to develop &#x02018;chronic disease self-management&#x02019; (CDSM) programs. These programs promote skills that help individuals with chronic diseases deal with their physical and emotional problems and, thus, improve and maintain their psychological well-being.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> CDSM is a patient-centered intervention strategy requiring few resources that has been shown to achieve sustainable improvements in functioning, making it a feasible community-based chronic disease control method.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> Huang and colleagues<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> found that the integration of self-management training about treatment among 26 inpatients with schizophrenia effectively improved their self-care skills, social interaction skills and overall social functioning; but the effectiveness of CDSM training among community-dwelling individuals with mental disorders in China has not yet been assessed. The randomized controlled trial reported in this paper evaluated the effectiveness of CDSM training among a sample of individuals with schizophrenia living in one of Shanghai&#x02019;s 19 districts. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s6"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s6a"><label>2.1</label><title>Sample</title><p>As shown in Figure 1, participants in this study were from 10 randomly selected communities, including 8 urban neighborhoods and 2 rural villages (out of 41 neighborhoods and 15 villages), in the Sanlin Township of Pudong District in Shanghai.

To limit the number of outlying values, whenever an evaluation resulted in score that was more than 3 standard deviations above or below the group mean for one of the three scales, a re-assessment by the second evaluator was conducted; if the difference between the two assessments was small, the first score was retained, if the difference was large, expert opinion was sought to arrive at a final score. Scores by the first evaluator were outside these 3 standard deviation limits 31 times in the 1,788 evaluations conducted during the study (1.7%) and in only one of these instances was it necessary to request evaluation by an expert because the result of the re-evaluation by the second rater was substantially different from the original result.</p></sec><sec id="s6f"><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data analysis was conducted using SPSS 10.0 statistical software.

Only 4 of the 103 individuals enrolled in the intervention group dropped out of the study over the follow-up &#x02013; a clear indication of the feasibility and acceptability of this self-management training approach among community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia. Blind assessment of the outcome using standardized instruments that assess clinical and social outcomes clearly demonstrated the superiority of this method, both in the initial high-intensity intervention period (six months of weekly training sessions) and during the longer low-intensity follow-up period (24 months of monthly booster sessions to reinforce the use of patients&#x02019; daily self-monitoring checklists).</p><p>These findings are in line with a previous study that reported sustained effect 12 months after self-management training in a sample of individuals with a variety of chronic diseases.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> Our findings also support the social cognitive theory underlying the use of interventions based on self-management of chronic diseases<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> which hypothesizes that better self-care can be achieved by training patients specific self-management skills. </p><p>Over the last several years increased attention has focused on the application of self-management training to individuals with mental disorders. Several studies have found evidence of effectiveness of self-management training among inpatients with schizophrenia.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> This study extended previous evidence to community-dwelling individuals with chronic schizophrenia &#x02013; where the vast majority of persons with schizophrenia reside. In this study, the 24 weekly training sessions covered a wide range of skills aimed at enhancing patients&#x02019; overall quality of life and social integration.</p><p>Another prominent feature of this study is the 24 monthly &#x02018;booster&#x02019; meetings after the more intensive weekly training sessions. We believe that these sessions were crucial to the sustained benefit seen in the study. The use of the journal, the involvement of co-resident family members in encouraging patients to complete the journal daily, and the monthly reports to a clinician about the content of the journal reinforces behaviors that enhance patients&#x02019; well-being and help family members and professional caregivers closely monitor patients&#x02019; condition and make earlier, preemptive interventions when the patient&#x02019;s condition starts to deteriorate. Two other potential values of the journal are: (a) the daily review of the journal by family members promotes interaction between patients&#x02019; and their family members, and (b) The use of the daily journal requires patients to regularly assess their condition and behavior, giving them a greater sense of control.</p></sec><sec id="s8b"><label>4.2</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The sample selected for this study were individuals with schizophrenia with a mean duration of illness of 17 years who were already registered in the municipal monitoring system of persons with severe mental disorder. The very low dropout rate in the study and the very high participation rate of patients enrolled in the intervention training is probably related to their prior registration in the municipal monitoring program. These patients may have a longer course of illness and be more adherent to treatment than community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia who are not registered in the municipal monitoring program. Thus the study would need to be repeated with a more unselected sample to determine its generalizability to all community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia. Similarly, the low-intensity follow-up component of the intervention depended (partly) on the participation of co-resident family members who encouraged patients to complete their daily journals; the intervention may be less effective for individuals with schizophrenia who do not have co-resident family members who can play this important role.</p><p>More detailed information about compliance with medication, about the fidelity with which family members monitored patients&#x02019; journals, about the specific content of the journal, and about how clinicians employed the content of the journal during the follow-up group booster sessions would have provided more details about the mechanism of action of the intervention. In future studies it will also be important to add a cost-effectiveness component to more concretely assess the economic benefits (if any) of the improved functioning and quality of life that occurs after self-management training.</p></sec><sec id="s8c"><label>4.3</label><title>Implications</title><p>Bilsker<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> has pointed out similarities in the rehabilitation process of persons with mental disorders to that of persons with other chronic conditions. Although many require inpatient treatment during the acute phase of the illness due to impaired cognitive functioning, most people with mental disorders are capable of self-care once the acute symptoms subside. This study provides encouraging information about the feasibility and effectiveness of this relatively simple intervention. We found that self-management training with monthly follow-up monitoring of patients&#x02019; daily journals can produce a substantial and sustained improvement in the quality of life and social functioning of community-resident individuals with chronic schizophrenia. In settings like China were mental health personnel and resources are very limited (particularly in rural areas), the development of an effective self-management intervention like this could potentially make a major contribution to the quality of life and social functioning of the large numbers of persons with severe mental illnesses who currently receive inadequate treatment. If confirmed in further studies, the findings of this study would merit widespread application. Supplementary studies with patients who have less chronic forms of schizophrenia, with patients in both urban and rural settings and for even longer follow-up periods should be conducted to determine the potential range of individuals for whom this intervention would be beneficial. Cost-effectiveness studies could show the economic benefits of this low-tech intervention, information that would help attract government support for up-scaling this self-monitoring approach to care.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Conflict of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest related to this manuscript.</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e38"><p><graphic xlink:href="sap-26-02-081-g001.gif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></p><p>Dr. Bin Zhou obtained an associate degree in Preventive Medicine from Tongji University in 2003 and a bachelor&#x02019;s degree in Family Medicine from Fudan University in 2010.
