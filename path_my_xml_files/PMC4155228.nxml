amino acid) and glutamine supplementation on the degree of blood fatigue factor
stimulation and cytokines along with performance of exercise at the maximal intensity.
[Subjects] Five male juvenile elite rowing athletes participated in this study as the
subjects; they took 3 tests and received placebo supplementation (PS), BCAA
supplementation (BS), and glutamine supplementation (GS). [Methods] The exercise applied
in the tests was 2,000&#x02005;m of rowing at the maximal intensity using an indoor rowing
machine, and blood samples were collected 3 times, while resting, at the end of exercise,
and after 30&#x02005;min of recovery, to analyze the blood fatigue factors (lactate, phosphorous,
ammonia, creatine kinase (CK)) and blood cytokines (IL (interleukin)-6, 8, 15). [Results]
The results of the analysis showed that the levels of blood phosphorous in the BS and GS
groups at the recovery stage were decreased significantly compared with at the end of
exercise, and the level of CK appeared lower in the GS group alone at recovery stage than
at the end of exercise. The level of blood IL-15 in the PS and BS groups appeared higher
at the end of exercise compared with the resting stage. [Conclusion] It seemed that
glutamine supplementation had a positive effect on the decrease in fatigue factor
stimulation at the recovery stage after maximal intensity exercise compared with
supplementation with the placebo or BCAA. Besides, pre-exercise glutamine supplementation
seemed to help enhance immune function and the defensive inflammatory reaction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>BCAA</kwd><kwd>Glutamine</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>High-intensity exercise can cause temporary fatigue due to ATP depletion and excessive
production of hydrogen ions and ammonia. Eventually, the accumulation of fatigue factors can
lead to poor exercise performance. In addition, intense exercise causes muscle tissue damage
that gives rise to an inflammation response. In these individuals, a higher frequency of
lesions, chronic inflammatory processes, reports of muscle pain, and discomfort are
observed, and these effects harm athletic performance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise with high energy consumption or a high repetition rate,
such as rowing, can release intracellular proteins in the blood, such as CK, lactate, and
cytokines, independent of the nature of the muscle damage. Activation of the inflammatory
mechanism involves the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as
cytokines<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanisms involved,
however, have not been fully determined and seem to be multifactorial, including such things
as training and nutritional status.</p><p>BCAA is the only amino acid metabolized in skeletal muscles, and its effects as a precursor
for glutamine synthesis have been studied broadly. Regarding the impacts of BCAA
supplementation, studies have been reported with contradistinctive results indicating that
the BCAA acts as a major energy substrate in the muscle along with the increased
contribution of fat as an energy source in accordance with the exhaustion of carbohydrates
during long periods of exercise<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> while
also indicating that the increase in the degree of oxidation of BCAA triggers a gradual
decrease in intermediates in the TCA cycle, which could cause fatigue due to exhaustion of
energy<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, glutamine is a sort of
amino acid found abundantly in human skeletal muscles and blood. It maintains the acid-base
balance while acidosis occurs and acts as a nitrogen precursor to synthesize nucleotides, as
a fuel in muscles, and as a direct controller for the synthesis and decomposition of
protein<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, glutamine has
been reported to be an important fuel for immunostimulatory effects<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The glutamine level, however, is lower after exhaustive
exercise, and its provision as an oral supplement after exercise has beneficial effects on
infections in athletes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore,
athletes experiencing discomfort from overtraining exhibit lower levels of plasma glutamine.
Thus, glutamine supplementation is very important for growing juvenile athletes. However,
several studies of oral supplementation of substantial amounts of glutamine in athletes have
failed to demonstrate enhancements in immune function or performance parameters. Recently,
however, Cruzat et al. demonstrated that a solution containing glutamine represents an
effective means of supplementing rats with glutamine, attenuating inflammation markers and
plasma CK levels induced by intense exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effects of supplementation with BCAA and
glutamine on blood concentrations of lactate, phosphorus, ammonia, CK, and cytokines in
juvenile athletes subjected to maximal intensity rowing exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Five male juvenile athletes (mean age (&#x000b1;SD), height, weight, and percent body fat were
17.2&#x000b1;1.1 y, 176.2&#x000b1;2.9&#x02005;cm, 71.7&#x000b1;12.2&#x02005;kg, and 17.7&#x000b1;5.6%) were included in this study. Prior to
participation, all subjects provided written informed consent in compliance with the
appropriate institutional review board at the university.</p><p>The athletes were allowed to drink and eat normally but received a placebo, BCAA, or
glutamine for 7 days before the test. BCAA (Spomax, Seoul, Republic of Korea) was given
three times a day (25% valine, 50% leucine, 25% isoleucine, 3.15&#x02005;g/day), and L-glutamine
(Optimum Nutrition, Aurora, IL, USA, 6&#x02005;g/day) was given three times a day. Blood samples
were collected from the antecubital vein on the day of testing while resting before the
test, immediately at the end of test, and 30&#x02005;min after the test. All tests were conducted
with a 1-week interval to eliminate the potential effects from remaining dosages.</p><p>The rowing test was conducted with an indoor rowing machine (Concept2, Morrisville, VT,
USA) 3 times each for supplementation with the placebo, BCAA, and glutamine. All the
subjects performed a 2,000&#x02005;m (Olympic single scull race) race at their own individual
maximum paces (42&#x02013;45 pace for 0m~250m, 40 pace for 250m~500m, 36&#x02013;38 pace for 500m~1,500 m,
and over 42 pace for 1,500 m~2,000 m)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The blood lactate concentration was measured using an Accutrend Plus System (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN, USA). Drops of blood were collected from fingertips washed and dried
completely using a blood gathering device. Reagent paper was then inserted into the device
for 60 seconds, and measurements were obtained thereafter. The blood phosphorous
concentration was analyzed using a Hitachi 747 analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) by applying
the UV method. A 0.5Ml sample of centrifuged blood serum was prepared to develop the color
by applying a reagent containing sulfuric acid, 250&#x000b5;l of added surfactant, and ammonium
molybdate for measurement with a dominant wavelength of 340&#x02005;nm and sub-wavelength of 505&#x02005;nm.
The blood ammonia concentration was analyzed using a Shimadzu CL-750 spectrophotometer
(Poli, Milano, Italy) by identifying the reaction. At first, 1Ml of blood was added into 2Ml
of deproteinization solution to remove enzymatic activity, which could create blood ammonia,
and the supernatant was separated after centrifugation. Then 4% of phenol, 0.015% of
nitroprusside salt, and 4.1% of KOH were added to make it alkaline, and the color was
developed using a reagent containing 28% of potassium carbonate and 3% of potassium chlorate
for measurement at a wavelength of 630&#x02005;nm. CK activity was analyzed with a Hitachi 7600-110
chemistry analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) by applying the UV method. Eight microliters of
blood serum was separated to develop the color at 37&#x02005;&#x000b0;C using 75&#x000b5;l of reagent R2 and 300&#x000b5;l
of regent R1, and it was measured at a dominant wavelength of 340&#x02005;nm and sub-wavelength of
405&#x02005;nm.</p><p>The biochemical analyses for IL-6, IL-8, and IL-15 were conducted with the Bio-Plex Pro
Magnetic Cytokine assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and it was directly analyzed using a
human serum cytokine kit. All components were stored at 4&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, and a multichannel pipette,
reagent reservoir, plate shaker, and vacuum manifold were prepared for the test. The
standard, cytokine, and magnetic beads were each diluted, and 50&#x000b5;l of diluted standard and
diluted samples were sprayed into each of the wells and washed 3 times after 30 minutes of
incubation in the shaker. Then, 50&#x000b5;l of prepared detection antibody were sprayed into each
well and washed 3 times after incubation for 30 minutes in the shaker; using the assay
buffer, 50&#x000b5;l of prepared streptavidin-PE were sprayed into each well and washed 3 times
after incubation for 10 minutes in the shaker. Finally, 125&#x000b5;l of assay buffer were sprayed
into each well and shook for 30 seconds and the states of calibration and washing were
analyzed using the Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All samples were
duplicated.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS 18.0 for Windows computer software package (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA). Data are expressed as means&#x000b1;SD. All the data were tested for normal
distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparisons of variables between the groups and
times of the test were analyzed by two-way mixed model repeated measures ANOVA. In the case
of a significant group and time main effect, two-tailed post hoc analysis was performed
using Duncan&#x02019;s test. The alpha level was set a priori to p=0.05 to determine statistically
significant differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The blood lactate concentration varied at each stage (p&#x0003c;0.05) but was not significantly

for the enhancement of exercise performance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>BCAA, an amino acid that can be mobilized in the skeletal muscles, is a nutritive substance
that can supplement the energy and help anabolism. Studies on application of BCAA to
minimize fatigue substances along with supplementation of required energy sources during
long periods of high intensity exercise have been conducted. However, there are
disagreements concerning the results from those studies. Some positive results of studies on
BCAA application showed that enhancement of exercise performance through an increase in the
internal concentration of BCAA led to enhanced ATP resynthesis and that facilitated the
anabolic hormone release to stimulate the synthesis of myoproteins improved the power of the
muscles.</p><p>Glutamine is an amino acid found in abundance in the human muscles and blood plasma, and it
is considered to be essential for proper immune function because it supplies energy for
nucleotide biosynthesis. It was reported that in statuses of fasted or prolonged exercise or
recovery period followed by high intensity exercises the levels of plasma glutamine
dropped<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, the stressed states
caused by exercises demand an increased amount of glutamine for gluconeogenesis, and thus
the amount of plasma glutamine is rapidly exhausted. Furthermore, athletes experiencing
discomfort from overtraining exhibit lower levels of plasma glutamine. Thus, ingesting a
proper amount of glutamine would be critical, especially for juvenile athletes in the
growing stage.</p><p>From the results of analyses conducted in this study, the blood lactate concentration, one
of the fatigue factors, showed differences at each stage; however, those were indifferent to
each group that the glutamine supplementation appeared to be ineffective in reducing the
level of lactate stimulation during the recovery stage. The rate of lactate production
exceeds the rate of removal during high-intensive exercise. The stimulated lactate
facilitates acidosis and suppresses the enzymatic activation related to other metabolism and
glycolysis, which impedes ATP synthesis and eventually leads to fatigue. According to the
results of one study, glutamate transformed into other intermediates in the TCA cycle and
the carbon skeleton of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, and the glutamate concentration decreased rapidly
along with the reduction in glutamine<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Eventually, this would cause trouble in energy supply due to the reduction in intermediates
in the chained TCA cycle<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover,
since the majority of carbon skeletons required for glutamine synthesis are derived from
glycogen or glucose in the muscle, the glycogen saved for glutamine synthesis might be
exhausted rapidly along with the practice of exercise. The link between carbohydrate
metabolism and glutamine formation is closely connected to the level of postexercise plasma
glutamine, so synthesizing and maintaining the intermediates in the TCA cycle by supplying
glutamine would decrease the lactate stimulation, giving positive effects to athletes;
however, such effects were not clearly observed in this study. In the recovery stage, the
level of the glutamine supplementation group was the lowest among the groups, and the
difference was not statistically significant, probably due to an insufficient number of
subjects.</p><p>An increase in phosphorous, which is another fatigue substance, decreases the ratio of
cross-bridges in muscle fibers, and hinders the catalysis of ATPase, and hydrogen ion
stimulation would form an inorganic phosphate (H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>),
which leads to a decrease in power eventually. The results of our analysis showed that the
levels of blood phosphorous in the BS and GS groups in the recovery stage were decreased
significantly compared with at the the end of exercise (p&#x0003c;0.05). The results of the
present study showed that the phosphorous concentrations in the BS and GS groups were
significantly lower than that in the PS group at the end of exercise. As discussed
previously, it was presumed that the BCAA or glutamine could have contributed in maintaining
the intermediate energy substrate in the TCA cycle, which enabled the preservation of ATP
that might have reduced the creation of inorganic phosphates.</p><p>The magnitude of amino acid metabolism may increase due to sharp rise in the level of blood
ammonia during high-intensity exercise, but the majority of the increase in ammonia during
the high-intensity exercise is created in the PNC cycle to maintain the total amount of
adenine nucleotides; thus, the amount of ammonia created by amino acid metabolism is
estimated to be slight<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Glutamine may
discharge NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> through glutaminase catalysis in the oxidative
deamination of protein or may transform itself into glutamine by accepting the
NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> from glutamate, and this role of ammonium ions is crucial in
amino acid metabolism. Problems with internal energy supply could be triggered by conditions
involved with inactive metabolites, hypoxia, stresses and dietary restriction. The level of
glycogen is decreased by high-intensity exercise along with the decrease in the level of
&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate which is the intermediate in the TCA cycle. Glutamate also decreases in
accordance with the decrease in &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, which lowers the creation of glutamine, and
accordingly, the increase in ammonia from by the exercise hinders glutamine transformation
through the glutamine synthetase reaction; eventually the increased level of ammonia would
trigger central fatigue and degrade exercising capability. In this study, it was not
possible to identify the effects of internal BCAA presumed to be decreased by the exercise
and glutamine supplementation because the observed ammonia concentration among the groups
and per stage did not differ significantly from each other.</p><p>The CK, an enzyme decomposing creatine phosphate to generate anaerobic ATP during
high-intensity exercise, is closely related to energy metabolism and is used as a marker for
tissue damage due to exercise stresses. The results of the present study showed that the
levels of CK in the GS group at the end of exercise and in the recovery stage were lower
than those in the PS and BS groups, which might represent the effects of energy
supplementation from glutamine supply, which activated as a fuel in the muscle and as a
nitrogen precursor for nucleotide synthesis; it could also be presumed that there was a
positive effect in protecting against tissue damage due to exercise stresses.</p><p>Intensive exercise not only causes fatigue but also causes tissue damage triggering
inflammatory responses and changes in cytokines. Until now, pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines have been considered part of the acute phase response to an infection or tissue
injury<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, cytokines are released
at the site of inflammation. IL-6 has been classified as a pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokine, and recently, its main anti-inflammatory effects have been a concern. IL-6
directly inhibits the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, and furthermore, IL-6 is a potent
inducer of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), which exerts anti-inflammatory activity by
blocking IL-1 receptors and thereby prevents signal transduction of pro-inflammatory
IL-1<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some studies have shown that
several cytokines can be detected in plasma during and after strenuous exercise<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. That is, as the pro-inflammatory cytokines increase rapidly,
anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 also increase accordingly to bring about balance in
cytokine secretion.</p><p>In this study, the level of IL-6 in each group and in each stage did not appear to differ
significantly from each other. The stagnant level of IL-6 during the intensive exercise
might be regarded as indicating that glutamine supplementation could have prevented the
increase in inflammation induced by exercise; however, it would be difficult to draw a clear
conclusion based on those insignificant results. Besides, it has been reported that IL-6 is
discharged from the muscle to maintain glucose homeostasis and that the IL-6 created in
skeletal muscle activates AMP-kinase, which subsequently stimulates intramuscular glucose
uptake and fat oxidation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the
increase in IL-6 secretion might not occur due to supplementary effects on energy from
glutamine supplementation however, given the insignificant results obtained in the present
study, it would be difficult to insist that there were clear effects related to glutamine
supplementation.</p><p>It is known that IL-8 causes inflammation by activating inflammatory cells and that it is a
chemokine produced by macrophages and other cell types such as epithelial cells. This
chemokine is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. It serves as a
chemical signal that attracts neutrophils at the site of inflammation, and therefore is also
known as neutrophil chemotactic factor. IL-15, a sort of cytokine related to immune
function, is created in the mononuclear phagocyte, macrophage, and muscle to trigger the
creation of natural killer cells<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that there were no significantly differences in
IL-8 among the 3 groups in the resting stage or at the end of exercise; however, in the case
of IL-15, the PS and BS groups showed differences, and the GS group did not. The results
regarding IL-8 obtained in this study turned out to be different from those of another study
reporting that the concentration of the chemokine IL-8 was increased<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this was probably due to the difference in the level
of exercise intensity and duration, which would have been insufficient to stimulate the IL-8
reaction. Fischer reported that the blood chemokine concentrations would increase little or
remain stagnant unless a sufficient muscle mass is not mobilized and maintained at a certain
level of intensity sufficiently<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>; thus,
it seems that changing the blood chemokine concentrations requires performance of exercise
at a comparatively high-intensity for a long duration. Besides, differences in the blood
IL-15 concentration were apparent in the PS and BS groups in the resting stage and at the
end of exercise except in the GS group. This shows that IL-15 has a more sensitive reaction
than IL-8 to exercise, and it seems that the glutamine supplementation caused an effective
increase in the amount of saved glutamine. As the amount of glutamine application decreases,
the cell proliferation rate of lymphocytes decreases, and antioxidants, peptides, oxidative
stress, amino sugars related to cell resistance against and apoptotic processes, purines,
and synthesis of key molecules such as pyrimidines also decrease accordingly<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, along with the decrease in the
saved amount of glutamine, neutrophils and macrophages, which are crucial to immune function
and the inflammatory response, and the protective activity related to apoptosis of
lymphocytes might also decrease<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. So,
the IL-15 concentrations observed in the PS and BS groups were increased as a compensational
effect corresponding to the decrease in the glutamine level, and in the GS group, the IL-15
concentration was not increased because the immune function and inflammatory defense
reaction were not diminished.</p><p>Compared with the group supplemented with the placebo, the groups supplemented with BCAA or
glutamine showed a lower level of blood phosphorous during the recovery stage after maximal
intensity exercise. Regarding blood CK, the groups supplemented with glutamine alone
appeared to have a lower concentration than the other groups, which suggests positive
effects on reduction of fatigue factor stimulation. Differences in measurements of blood
IL-6 and IL-15 were found between the resting stage and the end of exercise in the PS group
and BS group, but not in the GS group. Thus, glutamine supplementation could be helpful for
enhancement of immune function and the defensive inflammatory reaction after exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Dong-A University research fund.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Moreira</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kekkonen</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Delgado</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Nutritional modulation of exercise-induced
