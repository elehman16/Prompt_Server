Some studies have reported favorable immune function-related effects on biological secretions such as blood and breast milk in humans who have ingested a chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement. However, the effects of chlorella-derived supplement on mucosal immune functions remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether chlorella ingestion increases the salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) secretion in humans using a blind, randomized, crossover study design.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifteen men took 30 placebo and 30 chlorella tablets per day for 4 weeks separated by a 12-week washout period.

Undernutrition is not unique to developing nations. Furthermore, in developed countries, the total food energy intake decreases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] because of social [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], psychological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and medical factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The nutritional status of young adults declines because of various factors such as skipping breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], relying on fast food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and dieting to achieve a thin body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One of the most efficient methods to improve the nutritional status is use of dietary supplements. However, it is not easy for the general public to choose suitable supplements for improving their individual nutritional status. For individuals with inadequate eating habits, multicomponent dietary supplements that can improve the overall immune function may be beneficial.</p><p>Chlorella, a unicellular green alga that grows in fresh water, contains high levels of proteins, chlorophylls, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers. This is an important advantage as an ingredient of dietary supplement. It is possible that the multicomponent dietary supplement acts to correct some underlying nutrient/nutrients deficiency and hence gets the positive outcomes such as immunoenhancing effects. Indeed, chlorella-derived supplements are widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and believed to enhance immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A previous study has investigated serum antibody titers against influenza and shown the immunoenhancing effects of chlorella ingestion in middle-aged healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, supplementation with chlorella has been reported to increase the concentration of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies regarding the effects of chlorella supplementation on salivary or intestinal-fluid SIgA have been reported. SIgA plays a crucial role in mucosal immune function and is the first line of defense for the human body against pathogenic microbial invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Previous studies have reported an association between SIgA concentrations and risks of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is of interest whether oral supplementation with chlorella can increase the salivary or intestinal-fluid SIgA secretion.</p><p>We hypothesized that ingestion of a chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement enhances mucosal immune functions. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of 4-week placebo/chlorella supplementation on salivary SIgA secretion in young men using a blind, randomized, crossover study design. In the previous studies regarding the immunoenhancing effects of chlorella-derived dietary supplements, the placebo capsule was made from microcrystalline cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or no restriction was imposed on the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. According to these studies, we attempted to make a large difference in nutritive values between the placebo and chlorella tablets based on the idea that the advantage of chlorella as a dietary supplement is to contain various nutrients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Fifteen men volunteered to participate in this study; none of them used dietary supplements on a regular basis. The participants were asked not to change their regular lifestyles while taking the placebo/chlorella tablets during the experimental periods.

The mean (&#x000b1; SE) age and height values were 20.4 (0.3) y and 1.68 (0.01) m, respectively.</p><p>The present study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Health and Sport Sciences of the University of Tsukuba.

From next day, the participants took 30 placebo or 30 chlorella (SunChlorella A; SunChlorella, Kyoto, Japan) tablets per day for 4 weeks. Saliva samples were collected again on the day following the final ingestion. Compliances with the prescription were documented via ingestion logs. After a washout period of at least 12 weeks, the second trial commenced and the procedures were same as those in the first trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Placebo and chlorella tablets</title><p>The mass of the placebo tablet was 243 mg/tablet and that of the chlorella tablet was 200 mg/tablet. The placebo tablets were made according to following procedures. First, a blend of lactose (82.5%) and colorant (17.5%) was dissolved in purified water and dried. Next, this dry matter (95%) was mixed with sucrose fatty acid ester (5%) and converted to tablets. The chlorella tablets contained dried chlorella pyrenoidosa powder as the main ingredient.

Briefly, participants rinsed their mouths with distilled water (30 s &#x000d7; 3 times) and then rested for at least 5 min. Saliva production was stimulated by chewing sterilized cotton (Salivette; Sarstedt, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany) at a frequency of 60 chews/60 s.

This is a first study to evaluate the effects of chlorella-derived supplement on mucosal immune functions in humans. The salient finding of this study is that both salivary SIgA concentration and secretion rate increased after 4-week chlorella supplementation compared to baseline. Similar changes were not identified in the placebo trial. We therefore concluded that oral supplementation with a chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement enhances mucosal immune function.</p><p>Salivary SIgA secretion was used to investigate the immunoenhancing effect of ingestion of a chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement. Salivary SIgA is the first line of defense against respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Klentrou <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported that an increase in salivary SIgA concentration following 12 weeks of moderate exercise was related to a decrease in a number of sick days. Furthermore, Gleeson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] reported that a mean salivary SIgA concentration during a 7-month training period of elite swimmers was associated with a number of infections contracted during this period. Therefore, we believe that salivary SIgA concentrations and secretion rates are valid indices of mucosal immune function.</p><p>Several factors are responsible for reductions in nutrients and calorie intakes. Many studies have pointed out that a diminished sense of smell and taste, increased cytokine activity, altered gastrointestinal function, and altered hormone secretion may induce anorexia even in healthy older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Further, adverse social factors such as loneliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], psychological factors such as depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and medical factors such as poor dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] may also cause undernutrition in older adults. In young adults, contributing factors include skipping breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], relying on fast food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and dieting to achieve a thin body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In particular, university students living away from home and those who have a sedentary lifestyle are at a higher risk of poor nutrition than students who live at home and participate in sporting activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The majority of the participants in this study were university students. There exists a possibility that the participants had inadequate nutritional status and the nutrients in the chlorella-derived supplement attenuated their health problems. We can speculate, from lean body weight, body fat, and body mass index, that total calorie and protein intakes in the subjects were not insufficient. However, we could not investigate their eating habits and perform any blood chemical analysis. One of the next steps is to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the chlorella ingestion-induced increase in salivary SIgA secretion.</p><p>This study has following limitations. First, we could not investigate eating habits and perform any blood chemical analysis as mentioned above. Second, we have no data describing clinical significance of change in salivary SIgA secretion. Although it is possible that the dietary supplement-related additional antibodies in healthy young humans elevate a reserve of immune function, it may not improve their infection rate at normal condition. Intervention studies in humans with reduced salivary SIgA level like athletes during training camp and older humans are needed. This study is an initial step to elucidate the effects of chlorella-derived supplement on mucosal immune functions. Recently, Yamauchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported an expression of Epstein-Barr virus-DNA in saliva and an increase in a number of upper respiratory symptoms occurred on the following day of approximately 23 percent reduction in salivary SIgA secretion rate, although this reduction was smaller than the increase by the chlorella supplementation in our study (41%). Again, the salivary SIgA secretion rate after the chlorella ingestion was 37 percent greater than that after the placebo intake. Therefore, we consider the elevation of salivary SIgA secretion rate in the chlorella trial was clinically significant. Third, we obtained saliva in the morning to equalize the conditions of subject among four sampling points (placebo or chlorella trials &#x000d7; before and after ingestions) although salivary SIgA level is not stable in the morning especially during 10 min after awakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The saliva collection in this study was performed at least 1 hour after awakening, however, we can not rule out the effect of diurnal cycle in salivary SIgA secretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We concluded that ingestion of a chlorella-derived multicomponent supplement increases salivary SIgA secretion and possibly enhances mucosal immune function.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SunChlorella Co., Ltd. provided funding for the study and supplied the test supplements used in the study.
