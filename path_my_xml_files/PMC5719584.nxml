The ratio of alpha to beta, one to seven, is used to control and treat high blood pressure and is applied for the initiation of the effect which has the duration of 5 h. The initial dose of 10&#x02013;20 mg and then 40&#x02013;80 mg at 10 min up to the total dose of 300 mg are infused.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Labetalol is usually used in patients undergoing neurosurgery since it does not increase intracranial pressure (ICP).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Beta-blockers such as labetalol are not cerebral vasodilator and can be used as a prophylaxis in the reduction of supraventricular tachycardia and changes of ST-segment and T-wave in electrocardiogram.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Since the drug has mild side effects and can be used in craniotomy surgeries, it can be used as a drug for blood pressure control after extubation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Lidocaine is one of the drugs commonly used to reduce postoperative complications including postoperative pain in all health centers. In addition to control and pain relief for patients, the drug also causes to decrease the blood pressure in patients.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, to prevent unwanted complications, there is disagreement on the type of drug used after craniotomy operation. Therefore, according to the stated contents and the importance of the subject, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of intraoperative labetalol and lidocaine on postoperative blood pressure and heart rate in brain surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This is a simple double-blind randomized clinical trial study conducted in Al-Zahra and Kashani Medical Centers of Isfahan University of medical sciences in central part of Iran.

It was also decided that patient was excluded from the study in the case of the incidence of bradicardia (heart rate [HR] &#x0003c;40) intra-anesthesia, excessive hemodynamic changes (changes of more than 25%), heart block, extubation in the operating room and patient death before the intervention and need for massive transfusion (bleeding more than 100 cc per min or more than 2.5 L).</p><p>Using the formula of estimating the sample size, the sample size required for the study was estimated as 43 patients per group in order to compare means and by considering the confidence level of 95%, test power of 80%, variance of changes in postoperative blood pressure estimated as 1.33 in a similar study and also the least significant difference between two groups was considered as 0.8 that in order to increase the reliability, 45 patients were studied in each group.</p><p>The study was done in a way that after obtaining permission from the Department Research Committee and Medicine Ethics Committee and the written consent, 90 patients candidate for craniotomy operation were divided into two groups of 45 individuals in the random allocation method. Randomization method was in a way that patient was first placed in the labetalol group in the lucky draw and the next patients were sequentially distributed in the order of entering in the study and until the sample size reached to the sufficient number. For all patients, the preoperative visit was done and after receiving premedication of midazolam 2 mg, they were sent to the operating room. To start anesthesia, fentanil 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of body weight, midazolam 5 mg, propofol 2 mg/kg and then, atracurium 0.15 mg/kg and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg were used. Using propofol 100 mg, anesthesia maintenance was per 1 kg of body weight per hour. Propofol was administered according to the Miller instruction and based on the patient age [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-6-145-g001"/></fig><p>On the fluid therapy, the maintenance fluid of normal saline and ringer lactate was given as liter to liter.

In each patient, insensible water loss was also compensated using isotonic crystalloid. However, hypotension and bradycardia of patients were compensated by phenylephrine 0.1 mg/kg every 1&#x02013;2 h as needed and atropine 0.4 mg/kg, respectively. HTN and tachycardia were also compensated by labetolol 0.25 mg/kg. Extubation time was determined and the patient's blood pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP], systolic pressure and diastolic pressure) and HR were measured and recorded at the onset of the operation and then, every 5&#x02013;15 min. The rate of patients&#x02019; bucking and blood pressure were checked at GCS time after operation and in patients&#x02019; recovery in terms of 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min after arrival in the recovery room and 1 h later.</p><p>Blinding was in the way that patients were not aware of the types of drug used.

In this study, two groups of 45 patients undergoing craniotomy operation were studied that two groups had no significant difference in terms of age- and sex distribution, duration of operation and anesthesia, operation type, weight and ASA and sine the confounding effect of the above factors was neutralized in the study, the obtained results are more likely related to the effect of the used drug type.</p><p>Patients in both groups had no significant difference in terms of hemodynamic parameters during the period of operation and recovery and at the time of extubation and during the study, no case of bradicardia, hypotension, tachycardia or HTN was observed in the patients of both groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that using labetalol in craniotomy operation had no bad effect on hemodynamic in patients and it can be considered as a safe drug in the anesthesia for neurosurgery.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] So far, the effect of labetalol on hemodynamic has been assessed in several studies and in most studies, no bad effects have been observed from this drug.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the study by Kross <italic>et al</italic>., (2000) the combined effect of enalapril and labetalol with enalapril and nicardipine was compared to prevent HTN after craniotomy surgery. In the study, for 42 patients, intravenous enalapril with the dose of 1.25 mg and nicardipine of 2 mg were administered and in the other group, labetalol of 5 mg and nicardipine were used with the aim of systolic pressure below 140 that the result of systolic pressure in both groups was similar.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Also, in the study conducted by Do <italic>et al</italic>. in 2012, 54 patients aged between 20 and 60 years undergoing anesthesia with desflurane were randomly divided into two groups. Normal saline of 5 ml was injected to a group and labetalol 0.3 mg/kg was injected to other group. HR, MAP and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at 5 min after the injection of saline and labetalol and then, every 1 min for 5 min after inhalation of dose of florent and 2 min after intubation. The result was that in group that saline was injected, inhalation of florent caused to increase HR and blood pressure while in labetalol group, HR and blood pressure dropped. In this study, it has been concluded that labetalol injection is effective in reducing hemodynamic responses in intubation and administration of desflurane.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In his study, Owens showed that given that sub-arachnoid hemorrhage is associated with aneurysm rupture, it can be prevented by keeping the systolic pressure &#x0003c;15 that nicardipine and labetalol have been proposed to treat the blood pressure during cerebrovascular accidents.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Preventing increase or decrease in ICP is a common anesthesia requirement in neurosurgery. In an adult and healthy human, ICP is H<sub>2</sub>O 120 mm that is fixed in internal space of skull and spine. When the skull is closed, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is obtained by the formula of (CPP = MAP &#x02212; ICP) and ICP is to the extent preventing brain herniation in intracranial spaces or through foramen magnum.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] When the skull is opened, due to the relaxation of the intracranial contents, it is easily assessable for surgery; however, if the pressure is high, brain herniation may occur from craniotomy site. Cases considered for opened or closed skull is the same. Symptoms from increasing ICP include headache (especially headaches creating with changes in status or causing awakening from sleep at night), nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and drowsiness.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In disease conditions, a slight increase in intracranial volume will cause a huge increase in ICP. Increasing ICP causes herniation of brain tissue from one part to the other.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This causes the mechanical damage or disorder in perfusion to brain tissue and as a result, ischemic brain[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and physician should reduce the ICP for dealing with ICP increase and reducing it and after surgery, the control of postoperative ICP has a crucial importance. In order to achieve this objective, diuretics are usually and widely used in neurosurgery to reduce intra- and extra-cellular fluid.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In this respect, using labetalol is very helpful because of the proper control of blood pressure in patients. However, other studies have emphasized on the usefulness of lidocaine in the control of ICP. For example, in a study conducted by Messerer <italic>et al</italic>. in 2012, cerebral edema, increasing intracranial HTN, brain hypoxia and ischemia and tension are created as a result of failure to control ICP after brain surgery and doing a series of initial measures such as avoiding straining by patient, keeping the patient in Intensive Care Unit, taking antihypertensive medications and etc., are preventive measures that can be done in this field.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Also, in the study conducted by Samaha <italic>et al</italic>., the effect of esmolol and lidocaine on reducing MAP and ICP was assessed. Twenty-two patients with ASA I, II undergoing brain surgery were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned into two groups treated with esmolol and lidocaine. The obtained results revealed that the MAP was similar in both groups. Although the ICP was less in the group receiving esmolol, it became more in the group receiving lidocaine at the end of operation and after intubation. Beta-blockers are both tranquillizer and anti-HTN and cause to reduce brain ICP and as a result, backing by decreasing the blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Based on the results of our study, patients receiving labetalol had less postoperative complications that the difference was more visible in the incidence of postoperative cough so that 8.9% and 33.3% of patients suffered from postoperative cough in the labetalol and lidocaine, respectively. In craniotomy operations, extubation from anesthesia should be smooth and without straining or coughing. Increasing blood pressure causes bleeding.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] If after extubation, the patient coughs, dura mater of skull space will open and there will be the possibility of entering air into brain and creating pneumocephalus. Cough also raises intra-thoracic, CSF and ICP and in the case of the incidence of HTN at the end of the operation, using labetalol is quite helpful and necessary. Also, coughing and vomiting cause CSF leakage and has a risk of meningitis.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] On the other hand, suctioning into airway and ednotrachel tube and exubition cause to raise the blood pressure and increase the pressure into thorax. High blood pressure causes bleeding from ruptured arteries in the brain and raising pressure into thorax causes bleeding from ruptured brain venues during surgery and so, anesthesia should be continued until the end of the bandage and patient should not cough and strain during bandage.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Straining and bronchospasm are two serious respiratory disorders in existing from anesthesia. Straining is the contraction of skeletal muscles and bronchospasm results from the spasm of smooth muscles of brushing tree and both respond to chemical and physical stimulation and endotracheal tube and both can be prevented during the general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, cough is dangerous hyperdinamic response in the postoperative course and can cause HTN and tachycardia and dysrhythmia and increase intracerebral hemorrhage and dehisens wound and bronchospasm that endanger the health of the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Therefore, according to the results obtained from this study and compariing them with those of the other studies, using labetalol in craniotomy surgery is helpful for two main reasons that is the proper control of intraoperative and postoperative blood pressure and prevention of postoperative reactions, especially cough and if there is no contraindication for using it, it is recommended.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
