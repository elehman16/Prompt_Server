In addition we examined correlation between LTL and the insulin resistance (IR) status in these subjects. Forty-two medically stable men and women ages 23&#x02013;71 with non-remitted depression participated in double-blind placebo-controlled add-on of Pioglitazone to treatment-as-usual. Oral glucose tolerance tests were administered at baseline and at 12 weeks. Diagnostic evaluation of psychiatric disorders was performed at baseline and mood severity was followed weekly throughout the duration of the trial. At baseline, no differences in LTL were detected by depression severity, duration or chronicity. LTL was also not significantly different between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive subjects at baseline. Subjects with longer telomeres exhibited greater declines in depression severity in the active arm, but not in a placebo arm, <italic>P</italic>=0.005, <italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.63, 95&#x00025; confidence interval (95&#x00025; CI)=(&#x02212;0.84,&#x02212;0.21). In addition, LTL predicted improvement in insulin sensitivity in the group overall and did not differ between intervention arms, <italic>P</italic>=0.036, <italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.44, 95&#x00025; CI=(&#x02212;0.74,0.02) for the active arm, and <italic>P</italic>=0.026, <italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.50, 95&#x00025; CI=(&#x02212;0.78,&#x02212;0.03) for the placebo arm. LTL may emerge as a viable predictor of antidepressant response. An association between insulin sensitization and LTL regardless of the baseline IR status points to potential role of LTL as a non-specific moderator of metabolic improvement in these patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) provides an index of cellular aging that can predict incidence of age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Insulin resistance (IR), a highly prevalent metabolic abnormality, significantly increases risk for CVD and type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Previous studies have described associations between shortened telomeres and depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> as well as chronic mood and anxiety disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> although not all studies support the possibility that LTL is a predictor of depression.</p><p>Depressive disorders are among most prevalent psychiatric illnesses and are highly co-morbid with CVDs, diabetes among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> While individual prevalence for both IR and depression are rapidly increasing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> the non-random co-occurrence of IR and depression is striking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"><sup>14</sup></xref> Yet the understanding of this relationship is limited.

All participants provided informed consent prior to study enrollment after they received detailed information regarding all study procedures, potential side effects of study medication, risks and benefits of participation, and contact personnel in case of questions or concerns. Study participants were recruited through collaboration with established investigators in the area of adult depression within the Department of Psychiatry &#x00026; Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, as well as community health providers. In addition, participants were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers and clinical trial recruitment websites.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included being between 21 and 75-years-old, having a body mass index of 18.5 to 40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, having at least 12 years of education, having a history of depression with at least 8 weeks of stable treatment-as-usual for depression.

Mean education of the whole group was 16.07 years, 15.91 for the active arm and 16.25 for the placebo arm. Five participants withdrew from the study; two moved, one withdrew due to a side effect (edema) of treatment with Pioglitazone and two did not specify a reason for withdrawal.</p><sec><title>Randomized controlled trial design and randomization</title><p>This randomized controlled trail consisted of a parallel design in which 50&#x00025; of participants were allocated to 12 weeks of treatment with 30&#x02009;mg per day of Pioglitazone and 50&#x00025; of participants were randomized to 12 weeks treatment with placebo pill. Random allocation was generated by use of a random number generator that assigned half of the subjects' identification numbers to each study condition. A staff member of the Stanford University Department of Psychiatry and who did not participate in the implementation of the study performed randomization and maintenance of the unblinded study list. Active and placebo medication were bottled and labeled with participant identification numbers by this unblinded staff person according to randomized assignment.

While there were no differences in LTL between IR and IS subjects at baseline, LTL strongly predicted change in insulin sensitivity in both active and placebo arm. While the correlation between LTL and change in depression severity, as well as correlation with baseline IR was significant, the strength of correlation was stronger between LTL and antidepressant response. The lack of differences between active and placebo arms for changes in IR suggests that LTL predicts an improvement not specific to the insulin-sensitizing mechanism, but possibly another, for example, anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist. Contrary to our non-significant findings, a significant negative correlation was reported between LTL and HOMA-IR in patients with impaired glucose tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> It is possible that this difference is accounted for by the fact that our subjects were at earlier stages of IR, and that negative correlation becomes apparent when glucose dysregulation becomes more advanced.</p><p>Two independent risk factors for accelerated aging telomere shortening and IR have been associated with chronic depressive illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> The role of LTL in relation to depressive disorders has been reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref> with some<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> but not all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> studies suggesting reduced LTL in treated and untreated depressed patients. Unlike some larger studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> but similar to some other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> we did not find an association between depression severity and LTL. Unlike Wolkowitz <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> and Verhoeven <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> we did not find a negative association between LTL and chronicity of depressive disorder. However, our sample was smaller, and while Verhoeven <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> assessed chronicity via duration of depressive episode, this study assessed number of episodes longer than 6 months in duration.</p><p>Similar to our results, Wolkowitz <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> found an association between telomerase and antidepressant response to psychotropic agents. We observed an inverse association between baseline LTL and change in HDRS-21 score in the active (PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist), but not in placebo arm. To the contrary, Hartmann <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> found no correlation between LTL and response to treatment of depression. The difference between the Hartmann study and ours may be due to the choice of treatment agents (antidepressants vs PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist), duration of treatment and study design (open label vs placebo controlled).</p><p>Understanding the role of biomarkers in accelerated aging for prediction of response to treatment of depression is based on a fundamental biological premise of shortened life span as a result of environmental insults such as stress, major somatic and psychiatric illnesses. Among the most common mediators of accelerated aging in depressive disorders is metabolic dysfunction, for example, IR, inflammation and oxidative stress. Chronic exposure to inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and glucocorticoids may also accelerate telomere shortening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> IR is a proinflammatory state and is in turn associated with oxidative stress. Our results suggest that both IR and inflammation may mediate an antidepressant response to PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist, as both IR and IS at baseline subjects exhibited improvement in depression severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p><p>A major limitation was the small sample size, rendering these findings preliminary. The innovative choice of therapeutic agent, placebo-controlled design and well-described IR are among unique features of this study. Our results augment current understanding of the mechanisms of antidepressant response, and, if replicated in larger samples, will aid in predicting treatment outcome in a depressive disorder.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Mental Health (R21 AG22008).
