Rapid destruction of the periodontium results with loss of teeth through attachment and bone loss. Specific bacteria as <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, and <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic> have been strongly associated with GAgP.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although immunological and microbiological etiology of AgP differ from that of chronic periodontitis (CP), treatment strategies are largely similar. Mechanical therapy using non-surgical and surgical techniques is the primary approach. However, AgP has more severe progression, and adjunctive tools may be necessary to control rapid tissue destruction through minimizing pathogenic microflora. Metronidazole plus amoxicillin combination presents a good choice with its increased bactericidal efficacy and larger spectra compared with monotherapy with each drug and other antimicrobials.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>During the pathologic process of periodontitis, microbiological factors and host-mediated inflammation trigger cells of the periodontal tissues to release enzymes responsible of tissue turnover.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of 28 known endopeptidases with activities against extracellular matrix macromolecules such as type I collagen, which is the main structural protein in connective tissues including the periodontium are closely associated with periodontal disease activity. MMPs share a number of structural and functional features while differ in substrate specificity.

As GAgP has a larger age profile compared to localized type AgP, young individuals and adults were among the subjects. Subjects recruited from patients referred to the Department of Periodontology at Istanbul University Faculty of Dentistry. A detailed oral and systemic anamnesis form was fulfilled asking a series of questions to decide if the patients were meeting criteria of the study. Included patients were diagnosed with GAgP according to criteria of the American Academy of Periodontology.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Inclusion criteria were as follows: At least 20 teeth, at least two teeth in each quadrant with a pocket depth of at least 5 mm around, and attachment and bone loss around at least three teeth other than incisors and first molars. Exclusion criteria included having restorations on teeth to be sampled; being pregnant, lactating or allergic to the drugs used in the study; smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day; having systemic conditions that could interfere with periodontal tissues, disease progression or response to periodontal therapy; having previous periodontal treatment. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Istanbul University. All patients were informed about the nature of the study and signed informed consent was obtained from all individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Clinical measurements and treatment protocol</title><p>Study patients were randomly assigned to test and control groups by the flipping of a coin by one of the investigators (SC) who was not involved in the clinical procedures. All indices were recorded at baseline and repeated at 3 and 6 months after therapy by one of the investigators who was blinded to the randomization. Clinical parameters included plaque index (PI) (Silness-L&#x000f6;e),[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] gingival index (GI) (L&#x000f6;e-Silness),[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] periodontal probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). CAL was calculated by measuring the distance between cemento-enamel junction and bottom of the sulcus. Measurements were performed at six sites/tooth, excluding the third molars, using a UNC-15 periodontal probe (PCP-UNC-15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL). An intraclass correlation coefficiency of 0.85 for PD measurements indicated that the examiner reliability was high. Subjects in the test group received scaling and root planning (SRP) and metronidazole (Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals, Istanbul, Turkey) (500 mg, 3 &#x000d7; 1)-amoxicillin (Eczacibasi Pharmaceuticals, Istanbul, Turkey) (500 mg, 3 &#x000d7; 1) combination while the control group received SRP alone. SRP was performed in two consecutive visits in 1 week. Systemic antibiotics were administered during the first session and continued for 7 days. All patients were treated by another investigator (EC) who was blinded to the group designations and to which subjects were receiving the medication. This investigator also provided clinical measurements and sampling. The treatment codes of the study were not available to the treating investigator until the data had been analyzed by a statistician (HI). After recruitment, clinical evaluations were carried out and sample sites determined. All patients were instructed on oral hygiene and monitored throughout the study period. All subjects were followed-up monthly for oral hygiene instructions and supragingival scaling as necessary.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Gingival crevicular fluid sampling</title><p>Gingival crevicular fluid sampling were conducted at baseline and repeated after 3 and 6 months. GCF samples were collected from the mesiobuccal aspect of the deepest single-rooted tooth of each patient with a PD of at least 5 mm. One sample was collected at each appointment. A total of three samples were collected from each patient through the study period. The same site was sampled at each time-point. Sample collections were performed 1 week after the clinical measurements. Prior to GCF sampling, the supragingival plaque was removed from the interproximal surfaces with a sterile curette. These surfaces were dried gently by an air syringe and were isolated by cotton rolls. GCF was sampled with a filter paper. Harco Electronics, Winnipeg, Canada paper strips were carefully inserted into the crevice until mild resistance was felt and left there for 30 s.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Care was taken to avoid mechanical injury.

The outcome of treatment was evaluated over a period of 6 months. The findings indicate that both treatment modalities resulted in significant and stable improvements in clinical parameters with reduced clinical inflammation, pocket depth and a gain in CAL. Deeper pockets benefited from the adjunctive use of the antibiotic combination and with a more stable healing compared to the shallow and moderately deep pockets. The clinical data were supported by the restoration of a more favorable balance between TIMP-1 and MMP-1 collectively suggesting that adjunctive use of amoxicillin and metronidazole facilitates the healing in areas where SRP alone may have a limited access and efficacy.</p><p>Treatment of AgP is a challenge for clinicians. As the disease progression is severe and rapid, adjunctive treatment is usually necessary to improve the outcomes of the therapy. In view of the specific bacterial etiology, systemic antibiotics can be a valuable choice of adjunctive therapy of AgP. As there is a specific bacterial biofilm in the etiology, this pathological structure should first be disrupted mechanically. Hence, mechanical therapy must precede systemic antibiotic therapy as biofilm can protect bacteria from the effects of antibiotic.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Among the antibiotics that have been studied for the treatment of AgP,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] metronidazole plus amoxicilline presents comparatively a better choice for the improvement of clinical parameters as reported by Sgolastra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Recently, Emingil <italic>et al</italic>. used azithromycin for the management AgP, however they found no additional benefit over non-surgical periodontal treatment on either clinical and microbiological parameters or in gingival crevicular fluid biochemical markers investigated in patients with GAgP.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In periodontitis, the degradation of extracellular matrix is thought to be induced by an imbalancement between MMPs and their specific inhibitors TIMPs.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] To the best of our knowledge this is the only study evaluating the effects of the amoxicilline and metronidazole combination therapy as an adjunct to SRP on MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels in GCF of GAgP patients. Up to date there is a very limited number of studies reporting the effects of different treatment choices as adjunct to SRP for AgP or chronic periodontitis on MMP levels. In these limited number of studies authors have reported a decrease in MMP-1 levels after SRP with or without any other kind of adjunctive therapy (SDD, ozonotherapy, laser, combined antibiotics).[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Recently, Emingil <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that MMP-8 levels in the GCF significantly decreased over a 6-month period after periodontal treatment, along with clinical and microbiological improvements.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the authors utilized either SRP or adjunctive azithromycin therapy in a population of generalized GAgP patients. Another study by Skurska <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated salivary MMP levels after SRP alone or with ozonotherapy in patients with AgP and CP.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Adjunctive treatment in this study in AgP group did not result in better healing either in a clinical situation or MMP levels contrary to our study that used combined antibiotic therapy as adjunctive treatment.</p><p>Very recently, the same combination therapy was reported by Gon&#x000e7;alves <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] to substantially decrease MMP levels after SRP at 3 and 6 months parallel to our findings. However, in that study the subject population consisted of Localized AgP patients. All these studies reported different amount of decrease or no decrease at different time points in MMP levels. In another recent study by Saglam <italic>et al</italic>., diode laser was applied as adjunct to SRP and GCF levels of MMP-1, MMP-8, TIMP-1.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] The total amounts of MMP-1, MMP-8, and TIMP-1 decreased after treatment in SRP alone and SRP plus laser groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This study was carried out in a group with CP. In our study, TIMP-1 levels were not affected by SRP or adjunctive therapy contrary to the findings of this study. The differences in the amount of reductions in MMP levels may be related to different treatment approaches, different methods of detection and disease severity.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis, for which the balance between MMPs and TIMPs is important. Various periodontal pathogens such as <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>T. forsythia</italic>, and <italic>F. nucleate</italic> are known to induce secretion of MMPs by host cells.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is also known to secrete MMPs, albeit in quantities much less than that produced by host cells; promotes the activity of the host-derived MMP-2 and MMP-1, suggesting a pathological role in the progression of periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] In our previous study on the same patient group, we have reported that <italic>T. forsythia</italic>, <italic>T. denticola</italic>, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> were the most prevalent bacteria isolated from all sites at baseline.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Reductions in these bacterial species taken together with the current findings, suggest that host-mediated resolution of the inflammation and restoration of the homeostasis is critical for tissue healing. These observations are in parallel with the literature on the SDD and chemically modified tetracyclines.</p><p>In summary, SRP procedure has an impact on good healing of the periodontal situation in clinical and biochemical level in patients with AgP. Combination of the selected antibiotics caused further improvement in clinical periodontal parameters in deeper pockets and the levels of MMP-1 and TIMP-1/MMP-1 ratio. Our data also suggest that the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole is a valuable approach to both eliminations of the bacteria and stabilizing the MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio during treatment of the GAgP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Weakness and strength of the study</title><p>We were able to measure the volume of the strips; therefore, we could calculate the concentrations as well as the total amounts. In the present study, only a single combination of TIMP/MMP was assessed, and this could indicate the tissue response only in part. Other related members and their specific indicators should be investigated to be able to evaluate the exact role of systemic antibiotics on soft tissue response to mechanical therapy. GCF was used as a tool to assess MMP and TIMP as the content of this unique fluid is accepted as an accurate representation of tissue response. The difference observed in the clinical parameters of the deeper sites related to adjunctive antibiotics as confirmed by the change in MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio as the main finding of the present study can in part be attributed to the hawthorn effect, as the control group did not use placebo pills as a limitation of the present study. Sample size of the study is comparatively limited and could be expanded to increase power of the study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was supported by the Research Fund of Istanbul University (project no.
