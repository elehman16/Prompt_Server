Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intervention studies on prevention of overweight and obesity among 0&#x02013;5 year old children have suggested that the effectiveness of the interventions on primary outcomes, typically body mass index (BMI), seems limited [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For instance, the meta-analysis from Yavuz and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that among mixed weight children at age 0&#x02013;6 years, and in both short and long-term interventions, the effects were marginal and not of clinical relevance (short-term interventions: Cohens d: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.13; long-term interventions: Cohens d: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.01). It has been suggested that future primary prevention programmes may be more successful if behavioural change interventions are targeted towards high-risk groups biologically or socially predisposed to obesity [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, even though there may be little or no intervention effects related to change in BMI, the intervention may have induced favorable behavioral changes such as increases in physical activity (PA) or healthy dietary changes [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that also are considered as important factors in obesity prevention. Indeed, an active lifestyle in children has been linked to other positive health outcomes such as body composition (including smaller waist circumference and lower BMI), cardiovascular indicators and bone health [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both favorable and unfavorable PA behaviors, may track from young age into adolescence and adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], thus such early changes can be of potential long-term importance on health. Objective measures, such as those taken by accelerometers, are widely used to assess intensity and time spent being physical active, also among young children. However, apart from the structured activities most likely to be directed by an adult, the characterization of PA among preschool children generally differs from that of older children and adults, by being carried out as mainly unstructured self-selected free playing that can occur at any time or place [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, to provide recommendations that can contribute to future development of effective obesity interventions, obtaining information of the habitual PA in regards to types, setting, and frequency may add important information to better understand what specific parts of the activity behavior among young children that are modifiable.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate if the Healthy Start randomized primary prevention intervention study improved overall moderate to vigorous activity (proxy) and individual PA categories among 2&#x02013;6 year old normal weight children, who were all predisposed to later overweight and obesity. Specifically, the outcomes selected were overall activity, sports participation, outside playing time, television and computer use, and commuting choices.</p><p>The hypothesis was that during the 15 months of intervention, the intervention group would (a) increase their sports and outdoor activities (proxy variable of moderate to vigorous activity) (b) increase their sports participation, (c) play more outside (min/week), (d) decrease their television and computer use (min/week), and (e) use a more active type of transportation to and from day care (frequency/week) compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>The Healthy Start project was a primary randomized controlled intervention study as it targeted normal weight children, only. The intervention was conducted between May 1<sup>st</sup> 2009 and August 31<sup>st</sup> 2011 (participants in the intervention- and control groups were recruited from May to December 2009, and were followed-up from January to August 2011).The overall aim of the intervention was to prevent excessive weight gain among normal weight Danish preschool children who were all predisposed to future overweight and obesity. The Healthy Start intervention project has been described in detail in a previous publication [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, the study was conducted in 11 selected municipalities from the greater Copenhagen area, among children born in the area between January 1<sup>st</sup> 2004 and December 31<sup>st</sup> 2007. Through the Danish Medical Birth Registry, all children (n = 22,388) born in the 11 municipalities from 2004 to 2007 were selected. Afterwards, based on the information retrieved from the Danish Medical Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, at least one or more of the following inclusion criteria had to be fulfilled for a child to be invited for enrolment into the study: the child had had a high birth weight (&#x0003e; 4,000 g), and mothers with a pre-pregnancy BMI &#x0003e; 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.Furthermore, a subgroup from the municipality of H&#x000f8;je Taastrup was selected based on low maternal educational level (less than 10 years of schooling). Children who had either moved away from the municipality where they were born, had no current permanent address, had died, emigrated, lived at a children's home or were protected from being contacted by researchers were not included in the study. All eligible children living within each municipality strata were randomized (computer-based) into either the intervention or the control group. The children allocated to the intervention group were invited to see a health consultant on a regular basis over a 15 months period with a maximum of 10 visits, and most families received 4 to 5 consultations. The children allocated to the control group met with a health consultant twice; at the beginning of the study and at follow-up on average 15 months after their first visit.</p><p>The content of the consultations in the intervention were based around four main themes: optimizing diet and PA, in accordance with the official national recommendations, together with sleep and stress management. For PA among children aged 5 years or older, the official national recommendation is a minimum of 60 minutes activity of moderate to vigorous intensity [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The intervention was a non-standardized package and focused on the entire participating family&#x02019;s individual needs and resources, and hence not only on the child. The theoretical foundation for the health behavior change in the intervention was <italic>Stages of Change</italic> as well as <italic>Motivational Interviewing</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to improve the family&#x000b4;s knowledge and action. Each of the four consultation themes had selected key points. The most relevant key points related to this study were to: increase the time the child spend outdoor, reduce the child&#x02019;s television viewing and promote an active type of transport (walking or biking) [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The families in the intervention group were also invited to participate in optional monthly play events as a supplement to the consultations. The purpose of the play events was to convert theory obtained from the consultations into practice and to encourage the families to be more physically active together. Examples of different games that could be played at home were tennis with a balloon, dance freeze, and imitate an animal, e.g. jump like a frog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sundstart.nu">www.sundstart.nu</ext-link>).</p><p>Invitations to participate were send out to 3,058 individuals, and in total 635 families accepted the invitation to participate. No incentives were offered for participation. Because the intervention targeted the whole family, siblings to the included children were allocated to the same group (n = 15). Children who at their first meeting with the health consultant (baseline) were found to be overweight according to cutoff values for BMI proposed by Cole et al. [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], were excluded from the current analyses (n = 92), as all children enrolled had to be normal weight at baseline. Moreover, children with missing information on one or more of the PA outcomes at baseline and follow-up were excluded in the per protocol (PP) analyses (n = 236), leaving a study population of 307 individuals with complete information on PA at both the baseline and the follow-up examinations (intervention group: n = 127, control group: n = 180) (flowchart presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185266.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0185266.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0185266.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of the study population.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0185266.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Physical activity assessment</title><p>At baseline and follow-up, a parental questionnaire holding information on several individual and family related topics was completed.</p><p>To obtain information about the PA categories, the Children&#x02019;s Physical Activity Questionnaire (C-PAQ), consisting of a 7-day recording of sports, games and leisure time activities in the time outside of day care [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], was used.

Possible gender interaction was explored in all analyses by adding a product term to the models. Significant interactions were further examined in stratified analyses. Moreover, in order to assess whether intervention effects were modified by maternal baseline risk factors for overweight and obesity (i.e. maternal BMI, maternal educational level and maternal PA), statistical interaction was tested in all analyses by adding product terms the model, and significant interactions were examined using stratified analyses.</p><p>A total of 15 participants took part in the study together with at least one sibling. Given the small number of siblings, we chose not to perform cluster analyses. However, sensitivity analyses were conducted where all siblings were excluded. Also, as sensitivity analysis, we compared the completers of the intervention to the non-completers based on the inclusion criteria of the intervention (birthweight, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and maternal education level).

this randomised family-based primary intervention among 2&#x02013;6 years old normal weight Danish children who were biologically or socially predisposed to future overweight and obesity, we found that normal weight children in the intervention group obtained a higher level of sports and outdoor activities combined after the 15 months of intervention, compared to the control group. When examining time used on the individual types of activities, e.g. sports activities, outdoor playing activities, screen time and frequency of active transport separately, the change during the intervention in the estimates were all pointing in the same direction, favoring a higher activity level in the intervention group, however without being statistically significant, potentially due to lack of statistical power.</p><p>At present, no official recommendations for PA for children younger than 5 years exist in Denmark, but the current Danish national recommendations for the PAL among children older than 5 years are among other things to engage in a minimum of 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per day [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is equivalent to 420 minutes per week. At follow-up, the intervention group was only slightly below this recommendation, with an estimated adjusted mean of sports and outdoor activities combined of 400 minutes per week (&#x02248; 95%) versus the 325 minutes per week (&#x02248; 76%) in the control group (ITT p = 0.02). These estimates are based on leisure time only, while the remaining activity performed in day care during week days could not be taken into account, since this information was not obtained in the Healthy Start study. However, a Danish report from SFI&#x02014;The Danish National Centre for Social Research from 2014 showed that 65% of the children spend 6 to 8 hours/day in day care, while 22% spend less than 6 hours/day and 13% more than 8 hours/day in daycare [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. If we assume that the randomization was successful, and the distribution of other variables would suggest that it was, the distribution of hours spent in day care would be expected to be similar in the intervention and control groups. Furthermore, the hours spent in day care are likely to influence how parents answer the questionnaire, but the potential misclassification error associated with this, is expected to be non-differential in the two groups. This could have led to attenuation of our results and hence made it harder to observe real effects of the intervention.</p><p>Although we cannot rule out compensation approaches at leisure time to the activity spend in day care, or whether parents to intervention children may in particular have over-reported moderate to vigorous activities or under-reported sedentary activities at the end of the interventions compared to parents of control children, as has been reported before [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the intervention effect relying on self-report should be interpreted with cautious. On the other hand, all sub-categories of the PA pointed to a more favorable activity level among the children in the intervention group, also for the categories not related to day care participation, suggesting the observed differences between the intervention and control group were real.</p><p>Several obesity prevention intervention among young children (0&#x02013;5 years) that examined changes in activity, found a difference between the intervention and control group in regards to reducing television viewing and computer use [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, a few studies found differences between the intervention and control groups in respect to changes in total PAL measured with accelerometers [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although, one study among young children reported that intervention children had a higher performance in movement skills tests than children in the control group at six-month follow-up after adjustment for baseline performance [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Previous research in active commuting has primarily been performed among school children, but a systematic review including 14 interventions focusing on active transportation to and from primary school found small effect sizes, only, or non-significant effect [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which is similar to our results. On the other hand, the vast majority of the previous intervention studies were performed among groups of children of mixed weight classes, e.g. not restricted to normal weight individuals, and may therefore have been confounded by intervention effects related to weight class induced changes on PA. Comparison to previous studies may not therefore be meaningful, and the intervention results for PA effects among normal weight young children are the first to be presented.</p><p>Also, the reported lack of intervention effect shown in studies using objective methods (accelerometer or double labelled water), compared observed effects when using subjective methods (questionnaire), may be explained by reporting bias. Indeed, previous studies have shown that parents of young children generally tend to overestimate the PAL of their children, when using self-report [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Even though the C-PAQ used in our study has been validated in the age group of interest [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and has shown to be weakly to moderately correlated to accelerometer measures [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as well as provide reliable estimates for ranking the children&#x02019;s PA at a group level [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], there are well-known concerns. On the other hand, accelerometers or doubly labeled water method do not give information on the type, categories, and frequency of habitual PA during a typical week. Generally, previous obesity prevention studies have targeted mixed groups of normal, overweight and obese children, and a recent review of results from available interventions concluded that surprisingly no previous obesity prevention studies had targeted normal weight children, only [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>A strength to the Healthy Start primary randomized controlled intervention study is therefore the inclusion of a large sample of children who were all normal weight at baseline, selected based on having a high risk profile in relation to future overweight and obesity. Furthermore, compared to previous interventions [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the duration of the present intervention was relatively long. Moreover, the pioneering components of the intervention, by means of attempts to reduce stress in the family and improve sleep quantity and quality in the children, in addition to the more traditional components such as improvement in diet and PA can also be considered a strength. Certainly, the randomized design is a strength, as the risk of potential confounding is eliminated. However, due to the study design, health consultants were aware of the group allocation of the children, which may have increased the risk of observer bias. A priori, we accommodated this by providing detailed manuals and guidelines on how the consultations with the families in both the intervention group and the control group were to be carried out. Moreover, we cannot exclude that selection bias may have occurred, since the well-known phenomenon that socioeconomic background influences the willingness to participate, also applied for this study, as also evidenced by the higher maternal education level among the participating children than those that dropped out. On the other hand, the results were essentially similar in PP and ITT analyses, which suggest that this bias was of minor importance. In combination, these factors influence the generalizability, so the results may not be applicable to non-obesity-risk normal weight children or children from low socioeconomic families.</p><p>From a public health perspective, our results may contribute to future interventions and policy making, as the difference of approximately 10 minutes per day between the intervention and control group may be considered to be of physiological relevance, bearing in mind the overall beneficial health effects of PA [<xref rid="pone.0185266.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Among young children who were normal weight, but at high risk of becoming overweight and obese later in life, the Healthy Start primary intervention increased the total estimated, parent-reported, time spent on sports and outdoor activities combined (proxy of moderate to vigorous PA level).
