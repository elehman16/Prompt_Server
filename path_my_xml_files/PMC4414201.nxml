RCC patients in the phase 2/3 trial were randomized 1:1 in an open label study to receive Nap+IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b1;. In this study, we analyzed the UK patients for their immunological response in relation to prolonged overall survival (OS). We found that Nap-specific T cells were reduced after 3 treatment days in patients' peripheral blood. Levels of both Nap-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly higher 8 days after the first treatment. Patients with such pattern of reduction and expansion of Nap-binding T cells also showed increased levels of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; in plasma 3 hours after the first Nap treatment. In addition, Nap caused an increase of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1;. The patients in the UK subset showed a tendency of OS benefit after Nap treatment. Most Nap treated patients with long OS had low baseline IL-6 and normal levels of anti-SEA/E-120 antibodies. Furthermore, patients with pronounced Nap induced IL-2 and T cell expansion had long OS. In conclusion, patients with low baseline IL-6 and normal anti-SEA/E-120 may respond well to Nap by T cell activation and expansion paving the way for anti-tumour effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Renal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>naptumomab estafenatox</kwd><kwd>ABR-217620</kwd><kwd>immune analysis</kwd><kwd>overall survival</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2&#x02013;3% of all new cancer cases [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The clear cell RCC is the most common subtype and accounts for 70&#x02013;80% of all renal cancers. Although RCC is resistant to classic chemotherapy, development of new therapies including tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved the median survival period of patients with advanced RCC to about 26 months. Improvement of therapy of RCC by introducing new concepts is still urgent though [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Immunotherapy is well on the way to becoming an established tool in the cancer treatment armory and RCC is regarded as a sensitive tumour type.</p><p>Antibody targeting of superantigens to tumour cells combines powerful T cell activation and cytotoxicity with a targeted approach to eradicate tumour cells [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Tumour targeted superantigens (TTS) are recombinant fusion proteins that consist of an anti-tumour Fab moiety genetically fused to a superantigen [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TTS treat tumours via the local activation of the patient's cytotoxic T cells through a process termed Superantigen Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (SADCC) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Using this approach, 5T4 tumour-associated antigen was targeted by genetically fusing murine Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody 5T4 to a mutated superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), and maximum tolerated dose and safety established in a trial in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A phase II study of RCC patients receiving at least two four-day cycles of doses of anatumomab mafenatox (ABR-214936) treatment approximately one month apart was completed. When stratified by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) prognostic criteria, a prolonged survival compared to published expectation was observed. The group of patients receiving the highest drug exposure lived almost twice as long as expected, while the low dose group lived as expected from their MSKCC risk scores [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The increase in circulating interleukin (IL)-2 levels after treatment provides a useful biomarker for clinical effect since patients with the highest increase in IL-2 at the second treatment day lived significantly longer [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The next generation of drug, Naptumomab estafenatox/ABR-217620/ANYARA (Nap), was then developed. Nap, as anatumomab mafenatox, contains the 5T4 antibody but uses the mutated SEE SEA/E-120 superantigen [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The 5T4 antibody recognizes an oncofoetal antigen, a transmembrane glycoprotein which is expressed by different cancers; it is expressed at high levels in 95% of RCC [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Restricted expression of 5T4 on tumour tissues as well as its association with tumour progression and poor prognosis has driven the development of 5T4 vaccine- and antibody targeted immunotherapies [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The fusion protein 5T4 antibody moiety has an affinity in the order of 1 nM. Nap induces T cell mediated killing of tumour cells, SADCC, at concentrations around 10 pM and the SEA/E-120 superantigen moiety has been engineered to have low binding to human antibodies and MHC class II [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>After phase 1 studies [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] a prospective, randomized phase 2/3 trial was conducted. Patients with RCC were randomized 1:1 in an open label study to receive Nap+IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b1;: 15 &#x003bc;g/kg Nap was given intravenously in three cycles of four once daily injections plus IFN-&#x003b1; (9 MU subcutaneously three times weekly) or the same dose and schedule of IFN-&#x003b1; monotherapy. We have previously presented the final results (ASCO annual meeting 2013 abstract ID 3073, European Cancer Congress (ECCO) 2013 abstract ID 2710 and manuscript submitted for publication). Although the study did not meet the primary endpoint, addition of Nap to IFN-&#x003b1; might improve OS and PFS in a subgroup of patients with low IL-6 and normal levels of anti-SEA/E-120 antibodies. Furthermore it was shown that patients from certain territories had increased levels of baseline anti-SEA/E-120 and low Nap exposure. Patients in the United Kingdom (UK) had expected levels of anti-SEA/E-120 and Nap exposure. During the study in the UK, we extended sampling in association to Nap treatment to include also peripheral blood mononuclear cells and analyzed Nap induced changes in different lymphocyte subsets. In this paper we analyzed the UK patients for their immunological response to the Nap treatment in relation to their potential benefit and prolonged overall survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Patients</title><p>Eighteen of the 40 UK patients with RCC received Nap (15 &#x003bc;g/kg given intravenously in three cycles of four once-daily injections) plus IFN-&#x003b1; (9 MU subcutaneously three times weekly) and 22 UK patients received the same dose and schedule of IFN-&#x003b1; monotherapy except for weeks with Nap treatment.

donated blood for lymphocyte subset analysis during Nap treatment. Four-color flow cytometric assays were performed to measure the level of Nap-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of patients prior to and after treatment with Nap. T lymphocytes expressing T cell receptors containing TRBV7&#x02013;9 bind Nap and can be activated by Nap [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An example of flow cytometric analysis during the three Nap treatment cycles is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. Levels of Nap-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for all patients at all analyzed time points are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D and 1E</xref>, respectively. At baseline, Nap-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell level (0.86%) was significantly higher than Nap-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (0.35%) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The frequency of Nap-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood was reduced after 3 treatment days in samples collected pre-dose on day 4 (C1D4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09). However, levels of both Nap-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly higher 8 days after the first treatment (C1D8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02 and 0.04), as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The total number of T lymphocytes, Nap-specific as well as non-specific (data not shown), were reduced in peripheral blood after 3 days of treatment and expanded on day 8, 4 days after the last Nap injection.

In this paper we have analysed the Nap induced immune response in a cohort of the UK patients to characterize baseline biomarkers and immune response patterns in relation to potential benefit from Nap treatment.</p><p>The superantigen moiety of Nap has been engineered to have low binding to baseline human antibodies [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite this fact increased anti-SEA/E-120 antibody levels may affect drug activity and anti-tumour efficacy. In the phase 2/3 study the baseline concentration of anti-SEA/E-120 antibodies was unexpectedly higher in certain territories and exposure accordingly lower. Most patients in the phase 1 studies, all having low anti-SEA/E-120 antibody titres, were from the US, the UK and Scandinavia and as expected most patients in this study from the UK had also low concentrations of baseline anti-SEA/E-120.</p><p>IL-6 is implicated in the pathophysiology of various solid tumours. High IL-6 levels are prognostic and correlate with tumour metastasis, disease stage, and short survival in several cancers including RCC [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The IL-6/Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway is one of the most important signaling pathways associated with tumour development and induction of tumour induced immune suppression [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. IL-6 is therefore a biomarker for immune status of the tumour microenvironment and for a patient's chronic inflammation/immune suppression status in general. At normal and low levels of IL-6, disease has not yet tipped the immune status into suppression. Accordingly patients with non-elevated systemic IL-6 levels would be expected to have the best chance of responding to immunotherapy. Indeed baseline plasma IL-6 was predictive of benefit with tumour vaccines [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] but also for pazopanib [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the phase 2/3 study IL-6 was shown to be both prognostic as well as predictive for Nap activity since the subgroup and a trend analysis clearly supported that low baseline anti-SEA/E-120 and IL-6 plasma levels independently predict anti-tumour efficacy after Nap+IFN-&#x003b1; treatment.</p><p>Generally in the patients from the UK cohort, the expansion of Nap<sup>+</sup> T cells was detected in peripheral blood during first cycle of treatment, usually at day 8. The baseline biomarkers for Nap exposure and/or low tumour induced immune suppression coincided with IL-2 production after Nap treatment as well as the expansion of Nap<sup>+</sup> T cells. Interestingly, the expansion of Nap-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was detected in Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and not Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, confirming that Nap expands Nap-specific T effector cells but not Nap-specific Tregs.</p><p>The subset of patients with low levels of antibodies towards Nap and low IL-6, indicating that tumour induced immune suppression has not yet been established, and having relatively early disease (i.e. good MSKCC risk score), seems to have the best benefit, as evaluated by OS, of the Nap immunotherapy. The immune cells of this subset of patients can be activated to pronounced IL-2 production resulting Nap-specific expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells which probably is a prerequisite for optimal Nap induced anti-tumour effects. In previous studies we have shown that T cells infiltrate tumours after Nap treatment in responding patients [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, it may be speculated that Nap acts in two phases; 1) Induction of T cell activation, proliferation and maturation into effector cells, 2) Recruitment to and T cell killing (SADCC) of the tumour.</p><p>IL-2 may serve as a surrogate marker for T cell expansion. Hypothetically, Nap treatment induced anti-tumour effects require T cell activation and expansion in advance to that the T effectors infiltrate the tumour to cause tumour cell elimination. The patients in the UK subset of this phase 2/3 study showed a tendency of OS benefit after Nap treatment. Most Nap treated patients with long OS had low baseline plasma IL-6 and normal levels of anti-SEA/E-120. Furthermore, patients with pronounced Nap induced IL-2 in plasma and verified T cell expansion on day 8 after initiation of Nap treatment had long OS. In conclusion, patients with low baseline IL-6 and anti-SEA/E-120 may respond well to Nap by triggering T cell activation and expansion (IL-2) paving the way for anti-tumour effects documented as prolonged OS. Being a very efficient T cell trigger and stimulator of tumour infiltrating T cells, Nap may also represent an optimal combo to checkpoint immunotherapy such as anti-PD-1 therapy [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patients</title><p>From May 2007 to October 2010, 513 RCC patients in Bulgaria (76), Romania (56), Russia (188), Ukraine (153) and UK (40) were randomized 1:1 and treated with Nap+IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b1; in a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, phase 2/3 study in patients with confirmed metastatic or inoperable locally advanced RCC eligible for standard therapy with IFN-&#x003b1;.

Blood samples were collected pre-dose, at dosing Day 1 and Day 4 of Weeks 1, 9 and 17 (Day 1, Day 4, Day 57, Day 60, Day 113 and Day 116 respectively), at Day 8, at Day 64, at Day 120 and at week 25, which represent cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1, baseline), C1D4, C1D8, C2D1, C2D4, C2D8, C3D1, C3D4, C3D8 and week 25.</p><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by Ficoll Hypaque density centrifugation and cells were collected from the interface, washed twice in PBS then frozen at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>/ml in freezing media (90% FCS and 10% DMSO) and stored in Liquid Nitrogen until required. A reagent, the Nap/strep-PE complex, was used to detect SEA/E-120 binding T cells [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Nap/strep-PE complex was used in combination with CD3-PerCP, CD4-FITC and CD8-APC antibodies to measure the percentage of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for SEA/E-120. CD62L and CD45RO were used to measure the frequency of na&#x000ef;ve and memory Nap<sup>+</sup> and Nap<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells within CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells before and after treatment. Frozen PBMCs were thawed and stained with Nap/strep-PE conjugate in addition to different monoclonal antibodies before flow cytometric analysis using FACSCalibur or FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometers. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo version 7.5.5 software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA). T regulatory cells (Tregs) were determined by their expression of CD4 and Foxp3. For detection of Nap<sup>+</sup> and Nap<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells within CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, cells were first stained for extracellular CD4 and Nap markers using anti-human CD4-PerCP and anti-human Nap/strep-PE. Following fixation and permeabilization using eBioscience fix/perm buffers, the cells were washed and blocked for non-specific binding sites using normal rat serum. Then anti-human Foxp3-APC or rat IgG2a-APC isotype negative control (eBioscience) were added for 30 minutes before washing twice and flow cytometric analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Statistical methods and analysis</title><p>The statistics in this paper should be seen as descriptive as the sample size in this sub-study is not high enough to detect differences in OS. Furthermore, statistical tests are presented and no adjustment for multiplicity has been done. Testing of OS versus treatment arms was done with the log-rank test and the hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals was calculated with the Cox Regression methods, both stratified for MSKCC risk score (SAS, version 9.3, PROC LIFETEST and PHREG). Tests of biomarkers were done with Student's paired and un-paired t-test. Test of Biomarker level for patients with OS with short versus long survival was done with Spearman's Correlation. Two-sided tests with <italic>p</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.05 were regarded as significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful for patients for their participation in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of interest</bold></p><p>Anette Sundstedt, &#x000d6;rjan Nordle and Gunnar Hedlund are employees and hold shares in Active Biotech AB.
