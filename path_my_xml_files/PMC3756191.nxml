Its effective component is believed to be gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Some authors have proposed that delta-6-desaturase is defective in AD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. This defect has been found to cause lower serum concentrations of GLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin E1/E2 (PGE1, PGE2) in AD patients, compared to normal controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. It has also been claimed that low concentrations of PGE1 and PGE2 play a major role in the pathogenesis of atopic disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>.</p><p>Essential fatty acids are necessary for normal epithelial permeability and are important constituents of all cellular membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. They are essential for survival in humans and cannot be synthesized in the human body. Common plant sources of commercially available GLA include borage (<italic>Borago officinalis</italic>), evening primrose (<italic>Oenothera biennis</italic>) and blackcurrant (<italic>Ribes nigrum</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>.</p><p>Although some previous clinical trials have shown that EPO intake is effective in improving AD and diabetic neuropathy, other studies have not supported this conclusion; as such its use in AD remains controversial. Furthermore, the optimal EPO dose and treatment duration for AD patients have not yet been established. Likewise, trials to establish the dose-dependent effects have shown varying results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. There have been few studies on EPO's effects on AD, especially its dose-dependent effects on clinical symptoms and serum fatty acid levels.</p><p>The aim of this study was thus to investigate the dose-dependent effects of EPO in AD patients, in terms of both disease severity and serum fatty acid concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study included 40 children and adolescents (24 males and 16 females) who visited the Department of Dermatology at Hallym University between June 2008 and May 2009. Their ages ranged between 2 and 15 years (mean&#x000b1;standard deviation [SD], 5.6&#x000b1;5.5 years) and they met the Hanifin and Rajka criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. Patients ranged in weight between 7.5 and 61 kg (mean&#x000b1;SD, 18.3&#x000b1;2.4 kg). The mean duration of eczema was 8.6&#x000b1;4.8 months. The mean Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> was 6.1&#x000b1;1.6 (range, 3.0 to 9.0). We excluded patients who had any congenital disorders, asthma or any other chronic disorders. Consent was obtained from the guardians of each patient. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups: those receiving two capsules of Evoprim (Dalim, Seoul, Korea) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), containing 40 mg of EPO per capsule, twice daily for eight weeks (160 mg group, n=20), and those who received four of the same capsules twice daily (320 mg group, n=20). There were no significant differences between the two groups in their demographic and clinical characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Patients were instructed not to change their diet during the study period. Younger patients who were unable to swallow capsules were advised to cut the capsules open. To check for compliance, each patient's remaining capsules were counted at each visit.</p><p>During the study period, patients were prohibited from receiving ultraviolet-ray treatment, nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents (e.g., cyclosporine, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), topical immunomodulators (e.g., tacrolimus and pimecrolimus), topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids or any other investigational drugs. The washout phase for these treatments ranged from a minimum of three days (for topical corticosteroids and immunomodulators) to a maximum of six weeks (for ultraviolet treatment). The washout period was two weeks for systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressants and five days for systemic corticosteroids and antihistamines. Patients were permitted to use bath oils and non-medicated emollients during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation</title><p>In all patients, medication compliance and adverse events were evaluated, and their EASI scores were checked at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8. Fasting blood was taken at weeks 0 and 8. The serum levels of C16 : 0 (palmitic acid), C18 : 2n (linoleic acid), C18 : 3n (linolenic acid) and C20:4 (AA) were measured by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Peaks were identified by comparison with known standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data were expressed as the mean&#x000b1;SD. Student t-test was used for comparison of the demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Changes in EASI scores and fatty acid concentrations were also tested using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. Significant correlations were analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation test. A <italic>p</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Estimates of treatment differences were given with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Changes in serum fatty acid levels</title><p>The serum fatty acid levels of C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18 : 2n (linoleic acid), C18 : 3n (linolenic acid) and C20 : 4 (AA) were measured by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies) at weeks 0 (first visit) and 8 (last visit).</p><p>In the 160 mg group, the serum levels of C16:0 (palmitic acid) changed from 0.242&#x000b1;0.026 nmol/L to 0.251&#x000b1;0.125 nmol/L.

The evening primrose (<italic>O. biennis</italic>) is a plant with yellow flowers that bloom in the evening and is related to the rosebay willow herb family. Native Americans have used its mucilaginous stem and leaf juices as topical remedies to soothe cutaneous inflammations and a poultice of the plant has been used to treat bruises and minor wounds. Other sources of GLA include plant oils, such as borage seed oil, black currant seed oil, hempseed oil and spirulina (a <italic>Cyanobacterium</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>.</p><p>AD may be a minor inherited abnormality of the essential fatty acid metabolism. Research in the mid-twentieth century (1930~1960) established that a deficiency of omega-6-essential fatty acids leads to an inflammatory skin condition in both animals and humans. Linoleic acid concentrations tend to be elevated in the blood, milk and adipose tissue of AD patients, whereas the concentrations of linoleic acid metabolites are substantially reduced. This suggests a reduced conversion of linoleic acid to GLA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>.</p><p>Linoleic acid is converted to GLA (18 : 3, n-6) by the action of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase, and GLA is elongated into the DGLA form (20 : 3, n-3), the precursor of prostaglandin H1 (PGH1), which in turn forms PGE1 and thromboxane A1 (TXA1). DGLA is also converted to AA (20 : 4, n-6) by the action of the enzyme delta-5-desaturase. AA forms the precursor of PGE2, thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. Delta-6-desaturase production, which catalyzes linoleic acid to produce GLA, DGLA and AA, has been reported to be defective in AD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>.</p><p>In this study, the clinical symptoms of AD patients improved after EPO treatment, and their EASI scores decreased after eight weeks of EPO administration in both the 160 mg and 320 mg groups. Many studies have found beneficial effects of EPO on AD in the pediatric age group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. Fiocchi et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> have demonstrated that fourweek GLA administration is a safe and effective adjuvant therapy for infants and children with AD. Kerscher and Korting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> have also documented that pediatric AD patients treated with GLA showed lower levels of inflammation, dryness, scaling and overall severity compared to controls. Some other studies have also confirmed the beneficial role of EPO in adult AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>. Andreassi et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref> reported that adult patients receiving GLA show gradual improvement in pruritus, erythema, vesiculation and oozing. Likewise, Yoon et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> found that the extent of skin lesions and pruritus was markedly reduced in 14 adult patients after treatment with EPO.</p><p>Our study showed that the concentrations of C18 : 3n (linolenic) and C20 : 4 (AA) significantly increased after administration of EPO across both study groups. Previous studies have shown the effects of EPO administration on the plasma lipid profiles of AD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. Daily administration of 2, 4 and 6 g of EPO (Efamol; Efamol Ltd., Guildford, UK) produced a significant dose-related rise in plasma phospholipid DGLA in adult AD patients but a less consistent rise in AA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. In Japanese AD children, administration of GLA corrected the previously abnormal plasma phospholipid essential fatty acid profile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. EPO also caused dose-related increases in DGLA and AA in blood neutrophils as well as in epidermal phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>. Taken together, these works show that administration of GLA exhibits significant and demonstrable effects on fatty acid profiles in AD patients.</p><p>GLA plays an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory role. The human body forms DGLA from GLA. DGLA is the precursor of PGH1, which in turn forms PGE 1 and TXA1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. Of these, PGE1 plays a role in the regulation of immune functions and TXA1 modulates the proinflammatory properties of TXA2. Unlike other eicosanoids, DGLA cannot yield leukotrienes; however, it can inhibit the formation of proinflammatory leukotrienes from AA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Interestingly, GLA also has an antibacterial effect. In particular, it shows bactericidal activity against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> colonization on the skin, which is a common problem in AD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>.</p><p>AA derivatives, such as PGE2, TXA2 and LTB4, have proinflammatory activity. However, AA-derived prostaglandin D2 and possibly prostaglandin F2a have anti-inflammatory activity. The AA derivative of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid also has anti-inflammatory activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. Likewise, AA also has important biological functions related to the skin and is an essential constituent of membranes. The balance between DGLA and its products or between AA and its products may be a key factor in determining whether GLA supplementation produces pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory actions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. Besides being converted to anti-inflammatory products, DGLA seems to play a role in maintaining the AA in membranes in which it has a specific activity. Furthermore, the presence of high DGLA levels prevents the conversion of AA to potentially harmful metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>.</p><p>In our study, serum DGLA level data would have helped to evaluate the effects of GLA administration. However, DGLA was difficult to measure due to the absence of the standardized material. That being said, judging from the increases in GLA and AA levels, it is conceivable that DGLA, as an intermediate metabolite of omega-6-essential fatty acid metabolism, may also have increased.</p><p>No side effects were observed in our study. EPO is generally well tolerated, with only minor reported adverse effects, including gastrointestinal upset (e.g., abdominal pain, indigestion, nausea and softening of stools) and headaches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>.</p><p>The optimal dose and administration duration of EPO have not yet been determined. In addition, the recommended dose of EPO varies among products. According to the prescribing information for the EPO (Evoprim) used in this study, the optimum oral dosage of GLA should range from 160 to 320 mg per day in pediatric AD patients and from 320 to 480 mg per day in adult AD patients. In previous clinical trials, the oral dosage of EPO in adult AD patients ranged from 160 to 640 mg per day in divided doses, with treatment durations ranging from 3 to 16 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. The oral dosage of EPO in pediatric AD patients in such studies ranged from 80 to 320 mg per day in divided doses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. The results of our study showed that EPO had dose-related positive effects on clinical symptoms and serum fatty acid levels. Changes in the serum levels of C18 : 3n (linolenic acid) and C20 : 4 (AA) as well as in EASI scores were greater in the 320 mg group than in the 160 mg group. The results of this study may as such help to establish an appropriate dosing regimen for EPO and support the development of effective therapeutic methods for the treatment of AD.</p><p>After treatment with EPO, serum fatty acid levels increased, especially those of C18 : 3n (linolenic acid) and C20 : 4 (AA), whereas EASI scores decreased. In addition, changes in serum C18 : 3n (linolenic acid) and C20 : 4 (AA) levels as well as in EASI scores were greater in the 320 mg group than in the 160 mg group. It is concluded that EPO may be useful for treating AD patients in a dose-dependent manner.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (No. 2011-0013003 and No. 2011-0004436) and by a grant from Amore Pacific Co.
