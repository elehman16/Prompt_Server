These are generally progressive and become increasingly debilitating as the disease worsens. The presence of respiratory symptoms is associated with poor health outcomes, including reduced health status and an increased exacerbation risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although the primary outcomes in clinical trials of bronchodilators are typically post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) endpoints, symptomatic outcomes may better reflect the impact of treatment on patients&#x02019; daily lives. It is therefore important to have validated, reliable tools to assess the effect of treatment on symptoms in clinical trials.</p><p>Whilst other patient-reported outcomes, such as the St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; a measure of health status) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and the transition dyspnea index (TDI; a measure of the impact of breathlessness on daily activities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], are commonly assessed in COPD clinical trials, until recently there has been no standardized method for quantifying daily respiratory symptoms. The EXAcerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Tool (EXACT) is a daily diary which is completed by the patient in the evening, with a recall period of &#x02018;today&#x02019; to assess acute exacerbations of COPD and chronic bronchitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recently, the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS&#x02122;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>: COPD) tool, a derivative of the EXACT and previously referred to as EXACT-RS, was developed to meet the need for a standardized respiratory symptom diary. The E-RS uses the 11 respiratory symptom items from the 14-item EXACT and assesses both overall daily respiratory COPD symptoms (RS-Total score) and specific respiratory symptoms using three subscales (RS-Breathlessness, RS-Cough &#x00026; Sputum and RS-Chest Symptoms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Aclidinium bromide 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g twice daily (BID) is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist approved as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment in patients with COPD. In this <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis, we pool data from the aclidinium 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and placebo arms of two 24-week, double-blind, randomized Phase III studies of aclidinium monotherapy (ATTAIN) or combination therapy (AUGMENT COPD I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to evaluate the effect of aclidinium on respiratory symptoms, assessed using the E-RS.

In both studies, following screening and a 2&#x02013;3-week run-in period, patients were randomized to 24&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; treatment with: aclidinium 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID, aclidinium 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID (metered dose; equivalent to aclidinium 322&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g delivered dose) or placebo BID in ATTAIN (1:1:1); and aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate (AB/FF) 400/12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID, AB/FF 400/6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID, aclidinium 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID, formoterol 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID or placebo BID (1:1:1:1:1) in AUGMENT COPD I. The ACLIFORM COPD study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01462942), which was of similar design to AUGMENT COPD I, was not included in this pooled analysis due to a large and unexplained placebo effect in health status assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; given the significant correlation between health status and the E-RS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it is not clear how the placebo effect impacted E-RS assessments in this study, therefore a decision was made prospectively not to include these data in this analysis.</p><p>All treatments were administered via the Genuair<sup>TM</sup>/Pressair&#x000ae;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> inhaler.

The RS-Total score is the sum of 11 items that relate specifically to respiratory symptoms (score range, 0&#x02013;40), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The RS-Breathlessness domain is the sum of five items related to breathlessness (score range, 0&#x02013;17); the RS-Cough &#x00026; Sputum domain score is the sum of three items that relate to cough and sputum symptoms (score range, 0&#x02013;11); and the RS-Chest Symptoms domain score is the sum of three items related to chest congestion/discomfort (score range, 0&#x02013;12). RS-Total and domain scores were assessed at baseline and over the 24-week study duration. Responder definitions for the E-RS have been proposed and are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

The primary analysis was performed on patients randomized to treatment, but a secondary analysis tested the effect of treatment versus placebo in patients stratified into GOLD Groups A&#x02013;D based on airflow obstruction, exacerbation risk, and SGRQ total score. GOLD recommends use of the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, or the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea grade, but as neither CAT score nor mMRC grades were assessed in ATTAIN or AUGMENT, the SGRQ total score was used as a surrogate to stratify patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Pooling data from two studies made available sufficient data for sub-analysis by GOLD group, which demonstrated that aclidinium can improve respiratory symptoms in patients with both low symptoms (GOLD Group A&#x02009;+&#x02009;C) or high symptoms (GOLD Group B&#x02009;+&#x02009;D).</p><p>Symptoms are usually assessed in clinical trials by asking patients to recall their symptoms over a specified period (e.g. since the last visit, past month, previous week), but periodic assessment may be subject to recall bias, with patients tending to report more precisely symptoms that they experienced in the most recent past. The E-RS was designed to meet the need for a daily respiratory symptoms diary and, whilst its validity and reliability has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], this is the first test of its ability to capture treatment effects.</p><p>Criteria for defining RS-Total and domain score responders have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and in the overall patient population, and in patients in GOLD Group B&#x02009;+&#x02009;D, improvements from baseline in RS-Total and domain scores with aclidinium met or exceeded the thresholds for defining responders. Aclidinium improved daily respiratory symptoms in all groups irrespective of baseline symptom severity. However, although the largest changes were seen in those with more severe symptoms at baseline, it should be noted that the number of patients in the low symptom group was relatively small. After 6&#x000a0;months, there was also a net benefit of aclidinium on RS-Total score in both Groups A&#x02009;+&#x02009;C and B&#x02009;+&#x02009;D, taking into account both those who responded compared with no change, and no change compared with those who deteriorated. Taken together, these results suggest aclidinium improves daily respiratory symptoms, regardless of symptom severity at baseline, although results for the RS-Cough &#x00026; Sputum domain for GOLD Group A&#x02009;+&#x02009;C need to be interpreted with caution because of the imbalance between treatment groups at baseline. In GOLD Groups A and C, the domain in which most patients scored highest was Cough &#x00026; Sputum, suggesting that this may represent the major cause of respiratory symptoms in these patients. However, it should be noted that there may be a bias introduced here by the method of patient attribution to GOLD group. Whilst the SGRQ does have items concerning cough and sputum, more of them are related to breathlessness and activity, therefore people diagnosed with COPD who have low SGRQ scores are likely to have some respiratory symptoms (otherwise they may not have been diagnosed) and a higher level of cough and sputum may be more apparent in that subgroup.</p><p>This analysis also provides further data concerning the validity of E-RS scores. A strong association was seen between E-RS Total score responder status and SGRQ total responder status. Most patients with symptomatic improvement also experienced improvements in health status, although further study of E-RS responders who did not experience meaningful improvements in health status and E-RS non-responders who reported improvements in health status is warranted.</p><p>These data also offer insight into the symptomatic manifestations of GOLD Groups A&#x02013;D when health status is the grouping criterion. RS-Total and domain scores were higher in patients with poorer health status (Group B&#x02009;+&#x02009;D), indicating that these patients had more severe respiratory symptoms, including breathlessness, cough and sputum, and chest symptoms, although this does not necessarily mean that all of these patients experienced severe symptoms, or that those with better health status (Group A&#x02009;+&#x02009;C) were symptom free. Approximately 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of patients in GOLD Group B&#x02009;+&#x02009;D had an RS-Total score &#x02264;10, and 13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;% of those in Group A&#x02009;+&#x02009;C had an RS-Total score &#x02265;10. Previous studies have shown that, whilst there is a good degree of concordance between patients categorized into GOLD groups based on breathlessness (mMRC score &#x02265;1) or health status (CAT score &#x02265;10), the distribution of patients is not identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The results reported here are consistent with these studies and also suggest that groupings based on the cardinal symptoms of COPD (i.e. breathlessness, cough and sputum, and chest symptoms) may be more effective than either dyspnea alone or the broader construct of health status. It is also important to note that the E-RS thresholds used here to designate &#x02018;high&#x02019; or &#x02018;low&#x02019; symptoms were exploratory and were based on historical score distributions, with further study warranted.</p><p>Our findings confirm those of an earlier study, which demonstrated that E-RS scores were significantly correlated with other clinical outcomes, including health status, relief-medication use and alternate measures of symptom severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The strongest correlations were between baseline E-RS scores and SGRQ total score, consistent with several previous studies that have also shown an association between COPD symptoms and health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast, the relationship between FEV<sub>1</sub> and respiratory symptoms was weak, consistent with previous research, including a recent observational study which demonstrated that, in patients in clinical practice, the presence of respiratory symptoms was similar in patients across all severities of airflow obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Together, these results highlight the importance of broad assessment of patients&#x02019; FEV<sub>1</sub> and symptoms, consistent with the GOLD strategy document [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this pooled <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis of two randomized controlled trials, E-RS scores detected statistically significant and meaningful improvements in daily respiratory symptoms with aclidinium 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe COPD. This benefit appears to be irrespective of symptom severity at baseline. Total and domain scores also provided interesting insight into the symptomatic manifestations of GOLD Groups A&#x02013;D. Results support the use of the E-RS: COPD as a measure of respiratory symptoms in clinical trials of COPD.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12931_2016_372_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Supplementary information.
