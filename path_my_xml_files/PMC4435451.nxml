One group of poor readers (<italic>N</italic> = 41) did 8 weeks of phonics training (i.e., phonological decoding) and then 8 weeks of sight word training (i.e., whole-word recognition). A second group did the reverse order of training. Sight word and phonics training each had a large and significant valid treatment effect on trained irregular words and word reading fluency. In addition, combined sight word and phonics training had a moderate and significant valid treatment effect on nonword reading accuracy and fluency. These findings demonstrate the reliability of both phonics and sight word training in treating poor readers in an era where the importance of scientific reliability is under close scrutiny.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Reading</kwd><kwd>Poor readers</kwd><kwd>Dyslexia</kwd><kwd>Sight words</kwd><kwd>Phonics</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>NHMRC</funding-source><award-id>488518</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>ARC</funding-source><award-id>DP0879556</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by NHMRC Project 488518 and ARC DP0879556.

This condition&#x02014;often called developmental dyslexia (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Hulme &#x00026; Snowling, 2009</xref>)&#x02014;not only affects a child&#x02019;s academic achievements, but increases their risk for anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, and hyperactivity (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is critical to discover how to treat poor readers as early and effectively as possible.</p><p>To date, most treatment trials done with poor readers have looked at the effects of &#x0201c;phonics&#x0201d; reading programs, which teach children to learn to explicitly &#x0201c;phonologically decode&#x0201d; words by converting graphemes (i.e., letters or letter clusters; e.g., SH, I, P) into sounds (e.g., sh as in <italic>cash</italic>, i as in <italic>in</italic>, and p as in <italic>pin</italic>) and then blend those sounds into a word (<italic>ship</italic>). Since the turn of the century, at least three systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined the effect of phonics training in poor readers. In 2001, <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ehri et al. (2001)</xref> reported that phonics training, administered either alone or in combination with other types of training (e.g., phoneme awareness), had a moderate effect on poor readers&#x02019; explicit phonological decoding, but a small effect on their word reading. In 2012, <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2012)</xref> reported that &#x0201c;specific&#x0201d; phonics training, which focused on explicit phonological decoding with minimal training in other skills, had a large effect on poor readers&#x02019; explicit phonological decoding, a moderate effect on their word reading, and a small-to-moderate effect on their grapheme-phoneme correspondence (GPC) knowledge. In 2014, <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Galuschka et al. (2014)</xref> reported that specific phonics training had a small but significant effect on reading measures averaged across different reading tests. Considered together, the outcomes of these reviews suggest that phonics training in poor readers might have significant and large effects on reading measures that depend heavily on explicit phonological decoding, but weaker effects on reading measures that depend on other skills, such as &#x0201c;sight word reading&#x0201d; (i.e., recognizing whole words from orthographic memory) and &#x0201c;reading comprehension&#x0201d; (i.e., understanding the meaning of written texts).</p><p>The outcomes of these systematic reviews align with the two widely used cognitive models of word reading: the dual route model and the triangle model (e.g., <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Coltheart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Plaut et al., 1996</xref>). According to both models, printed letters trigger cognitive processes relating to letter identification, the outputs of which are fed through to two pathways: (1) a &#x0201c;sublexical route&#x0201d; (dual route model)/ &#x0201c;phonological pathway&#x0201d; (triangle model); and (2) a &#x0201c;lexical route&#x0201d; (dual route model)/&#x0201c;semantic pathway&#x0201d; (triangle model). The sublexical/phonological pathway, which includes links between orthography and phonology, makes a greater contribution to reading &#x0201c;regular&#x0201d; words (i.e., real words that can be read correctly via explicit phonological decoding, e.g., <italic>ship</italic>) and &#x0201c;nonwords&#x0201d; (i.e., nonsense words that can be read accurately via explicit phonological decoding, e.g., <italic>shap</italic>). In contrast, the lexical/semantic pathway, which has links between orthography, phonology, and semantics, makes a greater contribution to reading &#x0201c;irregular&#x0201d; words (i.e., words that cannot be read accurately via explicit phonological decoding alone, e.g., <italic>yacht</italic>).</p><p>Both the dual route and triangle models predict that phonics training should have its largest impact on the sublexical/phonological pathway, and hence the ability to read regular words and nonwords. This prediction is supported by the aforementioned systematic reviews by <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ehri et al. (2001)</xref>, <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Galuschka et al. (2014)</xref> that suggest phonics training in poor readers has its largest effect on reading measures that depend most heavily on explicit phonological decoding (e.g., reading regular words and nonwords).</p><p>The dual route and triangle models further predict that training sight word reading (i.e., recognizing whole words from orthographic memory) should have its largest effect on the lexical/semantic pathway, and hence the ability to read irregular words. Unfortunately, there is little empirical data to test this prediction since most studies that examined the effects of sight word training on reading have included both regular and irregular words as training stimuli. The inclusion of regular words is problematic because, as hypothesized by the dual route and triangle models, regular words can be read with the sublexical/lexical pathway. Thus, the inclusion of regular words in sight word training obscures the true effect of training the lexical/semantic pathway. In order to test this effect, it is important to employ &#x0201c;specific sight word training&#x0201d; that focuses training on recognizing written irregular words &#x0201c;by sight&#x0201d; (i.e., from orthographic memory).</p><p>To our knowledge, only one controlled trial has investigated the effect of specific sight word training in poor readers. <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> gave three groups of children with poor reading different orders of sight word and phonics training. Group 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 36) received 8 weeks of &#x0201c;specific phonics training&#x0201d; (i.e., training reading via grapheme-phoneme correspondence (GPC) rules alone) followed by 8 weeks of specific sight word training (training the recognition of irregular words from orthographic memory). Group 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 26) received the same training in reverse order. Group 3 received &#x0201c;mixed&#x0201d; training that comprised the phonics training and sight word training on alternate days for two 8-week periods (<italic>N</italic> = 32). The outcomes revealed that: (1) specific sight word training had large and significant valid treatment effects on trained irregular words, untrained irregular words, word reading fluency, and word reading comprehension, as well as a moderate and significant treatment effect on nonword reading accuracy, and no treatment effect on nonword reading fluency; (2) specific phonics training had large and significant &#x0201c;valid&#x0201d; treatment effects (i.e., significantly larger than test-retest effects) on trained and untrained irregular words, word and nonword reading fluency, and reading comprehension, as well as a moderate-to-large effect on nonword reading accuracy; and (3) order of training (i.e., phonics-then-sight words; sight words-then-phonics; mixed) had an effect on untrained irregular word reading (significantly better after phonics-then-sight word training, than the reverse) but not on trained irregular words, nonword reading accuracy or fluency, word reading fluency, or reading comprehension (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref> for a summary of the effects found by McArthur et al. compared to the current study).</p><table-wrap id="table-1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.922/table-1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Training effects in <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al.

Finding (2) was reassuring since it supported conclusions of the aforementioned meta-analyses that reported moderate to large phonics effects on some reading skills in poor readers. Finding (3) was puzzling since it appears to be often assumed by clinicians and researchers (despite the absence of empirical evidence) that poor readers should be taught explicit phonological decoding prior to sight word reading (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Chall, 1967</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of finding reliably effective treatments for poor readers, paired with growing concern about lack of replication in psychological and cognitive scientific research (e.g., <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Drotar, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Ioannidis, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Pashler &#x00026; Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Wagenmakers et al., 2012</xref>), the aim of the current study was to test the replicability of McArthur et al.&#x02019;s quasi-randomised controlled reading treatment trial. To this end, we used randomised controlled trial (RCT) that closely replicated the methods of McArthur et al. to test the replicability of key findings (1)&#x02013;(3) outlined above.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 5201200852) approved the methods outlined below. All children and their parents gave their informed consent to participate in this RCT. Children were continuously recruited into the study between January 2011 and June 2013 (i.e., children were not all tested and trained at the same point in time). Since it took 6 months for a child to complete the study, the last child completed the last test session (Test 4) in December 2013. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR; 12608000454370).

Group 1 did 8 weeks of phonics training (and then Test 3) followed by 8 weeks of sight word training (and then Test 4). Group 2 did the same training in the reverse order. In the analysis, we controlled for non-treatment gains when comparing phonics training to sight word training, and when comparing phonics-then-sight word training versus sight word-then-phonics training. (Note: unlike <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al.

This resulted in a sample that was very similar in age, nonverbal IQ, and irregular word reading as McArthur et al. (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2">Table 2</xref>). However, the mean CC2 nonword reading scores for groups 1 and 2 in McArthur et al.

The sight word training used an online reading program called Literacy Planet (<uri xlink:href="http://www.literacyplanet.com">www.literacyplanet.com</uri>) to deliver exercises (see below) to teach children to recognise the same irregular words (see below) used by <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> (Note: McArthur et al. used only two exercises to teach irregular words: one administered by computer (DingoBingo by Macroworks) and the other by a parent). Children received immediate feedback on the accuracy of their responses, which earned them points to spend on games or clothing their avatar on the LiteracyPlanet site. LiteracyPlanet also provided online access to the progress of the children in training time and performance level. This allowed the research team to detect when a child was failing to complete the required amount of training, in which case the parents were contacted to discuss how the children could better continue training.</p><p>The irregular words used in the specific sight word training delivered by Literacy Planet were selected using the following procedure: (1) REGCELEX in the CELEX database of children&#x02019;s written words was used to compute the rule-based pronunciations of each word in said database; (2) these pronunciations were compared to each word&#x02019;s dictionary pronunciation; (3) any word with a mismatch between its computer pronunciation and dictionary pronunciation was selected; (4) from this list we removed proper nouns and rude words, low frequency words that would seldom be encountered by children, and words included in CC2; (5) we ordered the words in terms of difficulty based on their written frequency, which ranged from 507073 (for <italic>of</italic>) down to 8 (for <italic>scone</italic>).</p><p>The irregular words were trained across 56 levels in Literacy Planet. Each level used eight or nine exercises to train a list of words. The lists for levels 1&#x02013;30, 31&#x02013;48, and 49&#x02013;56 comprised 8, 14, and 24 words, respectively. The exercises for levels 1&#x02013;9 included: Flash Card, Alphabetical Word Monster, Static Words, Word Snap, Floating Words, Word Finder, Word Builder 2, Spell This Word, and Word Builder 1. Levels 10&#x02013;56 used the same exercises except for Word Finder. For each exercise, children were required to reach an achievement level of 80% before progressing to the next exercise. This was lower than the achievement level required by the phonics training (i.e., 100%, see below) since some of the exercises were more difficult than those in the phonics training, and we wanted the children to be able to achieve pass-rate status at a reasonable rate, and without frustration.</p><p>In the Flash Card exercise, children were asked to spell a written word that was presented on the screen and then covered. In Alphabet Monster, children were instructed to drag words presented in a list into a monster&#x02019;s mouth in alphabetical order. In Static Words, children were shown a static array of written words, and asked to click on a word that they heard. In Floating Words, they did the same thing except that the selection of words floated around the screen. In Word Snap, children were shown two words, and asked to click SNAP when the two words matched. In Word Finder, children were shown a matrix of letters and asked to select the first and last letter of a word that they heard. In the two Word Builder exercises, children were presented with the letters of a spoken word in mixed order, and asked to spell that word. In Spell This Word, children clicked on one of a number of bush flies on the screen, which triggered a spoken word. They were asked to spell the word.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific phonics training</title><p>LiteracyPlanet was also used to deliver phonics training to the children for 30 min per day, 5 days per week, for 8 weeks in their homes. We taught phonics using nine exercises (see below) across 220 levels that increased in difficulty to train the explicit phonological decoding and encoding of consonants, short vowels, long vowels, blends, digraphs, the bossy e rule, plurals, soft &#x02018;c&#x02019; and &#x02018;g,&#x02019; dipthongs, &#x02018;r&#x02019; sounds, and Silent Letters. No exercises included irregular words, sentences, or paragraphs of text (Note: <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> used a similar number of CDROM-based computer games from Lexia Strategies for Older Students to teach children to decode and encode the same stimuli). In line with the sight word training, children received immediate feedback on the accuracy of their responses, which earned them points to spend on games or their avatar; we had online access to children&#x02019;s progress, allowing us to contact parents to discuss motivational strategies if children were failing to complete their training. Children were required to reach an achievement score of 100% on an exercise before moving onto the next exercise. If this was not achieved, the child repeated the exercise until they reached 100%.</p><p>In the introductory exercise&#x02014;the &#x0201c;Movie&#x0201d; exercise&#x02014;children were introduced to letters or letter clusters and taught their corresponding letter sound. In an &#x0201c;I Spy&#x0201d; exercise, children were presented with a number of pictures, a written letter, and a spoken letter sound. They were told that they could click on the letter to hear the letter sound, and were asked to click on the picture that started with the letter sound. In a &#x0201c;Letter-Sound Position&#x0201d; exercise, children were shown a written word and presented a spoken letter sound. They were asked to indicate whether the letter sound occurred at the beginning or end of the written word. In two &#x0201c;Missing Letters&#x0201d; exercises, children were asked to type in the missing letter of a written word. In a &#x0201c;Click On Words&#x0201d; exercise, children were shown a number of regular words, and asked to click on the word that matched a picture. In a &#x0201c;Bingo&#x0201d; exercise, children were shown a number of regular words in a matrix and were presented a spoken word. They were asked to click on the written version of the spoken word. In a &#x0201c;Spelling&#x0201d; exercise, children were asked to type in a regular word indicated by a picture. And in a &#x0201c;Blending&#x0201d; exercise, they were asked to click on letters that represent the sounds in a picture (e.g., they click on &#x0201c;LK&#x0201d; corresponding to a picture of SILK).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Screening tests</title><sec><title>CC2 reading test</title><p>The CC2 comprises 40 nonwords (e.g., GRENTY), 40 irregular words (e.g., YACHT), and 40 regular words (e.g., MARSH) that increase in difficulty. The three types of stimuli were presented in an interleaved fashion on index cards. Testing for any type of item (nonwords, irregular words, regular words) was discontinued when a child made five consecutive errors for a particular type of item, or when the child reached the end of the test. A child was given 5 s to read each word before being prompted to try the next word.

Half of the words were included in the sight word training program (&#x0201c;trained irregular words&#x0201d;) and half were not (&#x0201c;untrained irregular words&#x0201d;). Untrained irregular words were matched to the trained irregular words in terms of their written frequency, length in letters, and relative irregularity (i.e., the proportion of irregular GPCs in a word relative to the total number of GPCs in that word). Scores were total correct trained irregular words (out of 29) and total correct untrained irregular words (out of 29; Note: This is the same test used by <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al.</xref> less two items).</p></sec><sec><title>Nonword reading accuracy</title><p>This was tested using 39 untrained nonwords.

(2013a)</xref>. Regarding sight word training, McArthur et al. found that specific sight word training had (1) large and significant valid treatment effects on trained irregular words (replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 1.0), untrained irregular words (replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 0.9), word reading fluency (replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 1.4), and word reading comprehension (not replicated in this study: non-significant <italic>d</italic> = 0.6); (2) a moderate and significant valid treatment effect on nonword reading accuracy (not replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = &#x02212; 0.1); and (3) no valid treatment effect on nonword reading fluency (replicated in this study: non-significant <italic>d</italic> = 0.2). Thus, the current study replicated all bar two of the sight word training effects found by <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref>.</p><p>In the light of McArthur et al.&#x02019;s significant and valid sight word treatment effects on reading nonwords and reading comprehension, our non-significant sight word training effects on these skills were somewhat puzzling. However, in light of dual route and triangle models of reading, these outcomes made sense. Our specific sight word training used irregular words to maximize training the lexical/semantic pathway, and minimize training the sublexical/phonological pathway. This, in turn, minimized the training of cognitive skills that underpin the ability to read nonwords (i.e., explicit phonological decoding). In addition, our sight word training, which trained the ability to read and spell irregular words by sight, did not train the types of words (typically regular words) that were used as stimuli in the reading comprehension test. Thus, the puzzle is not so much why the current study failed to find a valid sight word training effect on nonword reading and reading comprehension, but why McArthur et al. did, since they used very similar methods.</p><p>Given that <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> and the current study represent the only two group controlled trials of specific sight word training (i.e., using irregular words to train the ability to recognise words from orthographic memory) in poor readers, we must turn to a single case study by <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Broom &#x00026; Doctor (1995)</xref> for insight. This study examined the effect of specific sight word training (i.e., training irregular words) on reading comprehension in an 11-year-old child with developmental surface dyslexia. Like <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> and the current study, specific sight word training had a significant effect on both trained and untrained irregular words. In accord with the current study, but not McArthur et al., it did not have an effect on reading comprehension. The authors suggest, and we concur, that their specific sight word training did not generalise to reading comprehension because their training did not provide the explicit opportunity to apply newfound word reading skills in a reading-comprehension context.</p><p>Moving onto phonics training, which trained explicit phonological decoding (reading) and encoding (spelling), <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> found that specific phonics training had (1) large and significant effects on trained irregular words (replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 0.7), untrained irregular words (replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 0.8), nonword reading fluency (not replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 0.2), word reading fluency (replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 0.9) and reading comprehension (replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 0.9); and (2) a moderate-to-large effect on nonword reading accuracy (not replicated in this study: <italic>d</italic> = 0.3). Thus, like the sight word training, the current study replicated all bar two of the phonics training effects found by <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref>.</p><p>While the current study did not replicate the moderate-to-large phonics training effects on nonword reading found by <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref>, it is not the case that phonics had no effect on nonword reading at all. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figure 3</xref> shows that Group 1 made gains in their nonword accuracy and fluency over their 8 weeks of phonics training that were clearly larger than their non-training gains. However, these gains just failed to reach statistical significance. After a further 8 weeks of training, Group 1&#x02019;s gains became statistically significant due to minor additional gains made over 8 weeks of sight word training. Group 2&#x02019;s data show exactly the same pattern of results but in the reverse order (i.e., because they did phonics training after sight word training). Thus, the outcomes of the current study suggest that phonics training did have an effect on nonword reading accuracy and fluency, but this effect was certainly smaller than the effect found by McArthur et al.</p><p>Why might this be the case? Since the current study used very similar methods to <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref>, the answer most likely lies with our sample. As noted under Participants, groups 1 and 2 in the current study had slightly weaker explicit phonological decoding abilities than groups 1 and 2 in McArthur et al. Such children may respond less well to phonics instruction (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Galuschka et al., 2014</xref>), which would explain why the current study found smaller effects of phonics training on tests that tax phonics-related skills such as nonword reading accuracy and fluency.</p><p>Finally, in terms of order training, <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> found that order of sight word and phonics training only had an effect on untrained irregular word reading, which was significantly better after phonics-then-sight word training than sight word-then-phonics training. This was not observed in the current study. The closest thing we found to an order effect was for word reading fluency, which was markedly higher after phonics-then-sight word training than the reverse. However, this order effect just failed to reach statistical significance. Combined with the outcomes of McArthur et al., this finding suggests that order of phonics and sight word training may not matter in poor readers aged from 7 to 12 years who have some phonics related skills (i.e., who can read at least a few nonwords). To a certain extent, this makes sense in terms of the dual route and triangle models of word reading, which make no predictions about the effect of training one pathway (e.g., the sublexical/phonological pathway) before another (e.g., the lexical/semantic pathway). However, this finding does not align with the assumption that poor readers should be taught explicit phonological decoding prior to sight word reading (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Chall, 1967</xref>). Whether or not an order effect might apply to poor readers with no phonics-related skills at all remains an empirical investigation at this point in time.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Because the current study is a replication of <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref>, it necessarily shares some of its limitations. One was the use of a &#x0201c;within-subjects&#x0201d; control group to index non-treatment gains (i.e., from Test 1 to Test 2) rather than a separate &#x0201c;between-subjects&#x0201d; untrained group (i.e., from Test 1 to Test 2 to Test 3 to Test 4). <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> chose to use a within-samples control group for three reasons. First, children in a between-subjects control group may produce different (e.g., smaller) non-treatment gains than children in a within-subjects control group, which may lead to over-estimations of a treatment effect. Second, recruiting a between-subjects group would delay the administration of potentially effective treatment for poor readers for 6 months during a critical period of their reading development. And third, it is more difficult to recruit poor readers for a study in which there is a high chance of being allocated to an untreated control group.</p><p>The use of a within-subjects control group in both <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> and the current study allowed the explicit measurement of non-training effects from Test 1 to 2 (T1T2), but not from Test 1 to 3 (T1T3), or from Test 1 to 4 (T1T4). Thus, the use of T1T2 gains to represent non-training gains may have underestimated true T1T3 and T1T4 non-training gains. According to previous research, non-training gains on cognitive tests over no-training periods decrease in size across test sessions (e.g., <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Bartels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Collie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Kohnen, Nickels &#x00026; Coltheart, 2010</xref>). Thus, if T1T3 and T1T4 non-training gains were solely responsible for any &#x0201c;valid training gains&#x0201d; found in this study (i.e., gains marked ** in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref> that are both significantly larger than 0 and significantly larger than T1T2 gains) then (1) T1T3 gains should be less than double T1T2 gains, (2) T1T4 gains should be less then triple T1T2 gains, and (3) both groups should show very similar-sized gains (since type of training should have no effect). Examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref> reveals that these criteria did not apply to gains in trained irregular word accuracy, nonword reading accuracy, nonword reading fluency, or word reading fluency. This reinforces the conclusion that these gains reflect valid training gains. However, these criteria did apply to untrained irregular word accuracy and reading comprehension, which questions whether the gains in these outcomes were valid training gains, as defined by the criteria used by <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref>.</p><p>Given the apparently reliable effects of sight word and phonics training on trained irregular word accuracy, nonword reading accuracy, nonword reading fluency, and word reading fluency, but the questionable effects of this training on untrained irregular word accuracy and reading comprehension, it is clear that a randomised controlled trial is now needed to compare the effect of phonics and sight word training to an untrained control group and a trained control group (e.g., maths training). Since McArthur et al. and the current study both found that <italic>order</italic> of training phonics and sight word reading had a limited effect on outcomes in 7- to 12-year-old poor readers, such studies could focus on training phonics and sight words in isolation. This would reduce the length of the experiment from 6 months (i.e., including a test-retest period, and two training periods) down to just 2 months (comprising a single training period). Unlike the current study, such a randomised control trial that included both an untrained control group and a trained control group would allow the explicit tracking of non-training effects across all test sessions. In the case of a trained control group, such non-training effects would include training-related Hawthorne effects, which are improvements in reading and spelling outcomes arising from an awareness of being involved in training. This new randomised controlled study may also benefit from including a passage reading test as an outcome measure to extend our understanding of the effects of phonics and sight word training in poor readers.</p><p>A second limitation of both the current study and <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013b)</xref> was that the reading gains made by poor readers&#x02014;though statistically significant, reliable, and large in effect size&#x02014;did not &#x0201c;propel&#x0201d; children&#x02019;s reading into the average range. This does not represent a failure of phonics or sight word training. Instead, it represents the degree of difficulty of treating reading in children who are, by definition, &#x0201c;reading resistant.&#x0201d; Now that we have established that phonics and sight word training both have reliable effects on heterogeneous groups of children with poor reading we can start to focus on how such effects can be maximised in children with different patterns of reading impairment.</p><p>A third limitation of this study, which was not considered by <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref>, and in some ways may be considered a strength, is the highly mixed educational backgrounds of the poor readers in both studies. The country in which both studies were conducted (i.e., Australia) has a highly unregulated approach to reading. The national curriculum is too vague to provide clear advice to teachers about how much time should be spent on different reading strategies, and the National Inquiry of the Teaching of Reading in Australia revealed that tertiary teaching courses allocate less than 5&#x02013;10% of course time to teaching student teachers how to teach reading (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Rowe, 2005</xref>). Adding to this confusion is the fact that over the last 5&#x02013;10 years, evidence-based schools have been moving away from a strictly &#x0201c;whole language&#x0201d; approach to more mixed approaches that include phonics instruction. This means that the children in this study were receiving very different &#x0201c;mixes&#x0201d; of reading instruction at their various schools. On the one hand, this is problematic because it means that this study cannot provide any insight into how phonics training paired with sight word training might interact with different types of instruction at school. However, on the other hand, the fact that two studies (i.e., the original study and the current study) have found similar effects of phonics and sight training in groups of poor readers from very different educational backgrounds attests to the usefulness of these instructional strategies English-speaking countries where the regulation of the teaching of reading is poor.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In sum, <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et al. (2013a)</xref> conducted the first controlled group trial to measure the effect of specific sight word training in children with poor reading, and compare the effects of specific sight word training to specific phonics training in the same. Given the importance of discovering ways to treat poor readers to minimize their risk of academic failure and poor emotional health, combined with current concerns about the lack of direct replication of important scientific effects (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Asendorpf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Yong, 2012</xref>), the aim of this study was the replicate the methods of McArthur et al. to test the replicability of their findings. The current study replicated the majority of McArthur et al.&#x02019;s effects. Thus, the current study joins McArthur et al. in suggesting that specific sight word training paired with specific phonics training has large and significant valid treatment effects in typical samples of poor readers. It also supports the idea that poor readers should be taught to read via both phonics and sight word strategies (e.g., <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Heilman, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title>Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.922/supp-1</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>Consort checklist for this randomised controlled trial</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-03-922-s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the children and parents for the time and effort they invested in this research.
