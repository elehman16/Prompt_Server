Cycling is recognised as a sport in which there is a high risk of poor bone health, with BMD found to be lower in cyclists compared to other athletes [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and non-athlete controls [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Average reductions in BMD of ~1.5% have been reported over a cycling season [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and increases in biomarkers of bone resorption have been detected during a three-week stage race [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Findings of low BMD have been observed in male adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and in masters cyclists [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as well as in professional female and male cyclists within our own lab (unpublished data). Risk factors that may underlie these phenomena include a lack of weight-bearing activity [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as well as the low energy availability [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that occurs due to weight loss practices and/or the high energy expenditure associated with large volumes of training and racing [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, there has been interest in the contribution of dermal calcium losses (sweat calcium loss) during prolonged training sessions to poor bone health. Even if the athlete&#x02019;s diet meets adequate intake (AI) recommendations for calcium and results in calcium balance over the day, the acute and significant dermal calcium losses during exercise may cause a decline in serum ionised calcium concentrations during exercise. Calcium has a vital role as an ion which moves in and out of the cytoplasm, acting as a signal for many cellular processes including exocytosis, neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction and the proliferation of action potentials through cardiac muscle. Due to these important functions, serum calcium concentration is defended vigorously within the body. Bone is the largest reservoir of calcium in the body and reductions in serum ionized calcium are therefore mitigated by demineralization of bone&#x02014;a process stimulated by increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH). Cross linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) and more recently cross linked C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) have been indicated as sensitive markers of osteoclastic bone resorption while procollagen I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) is indicated as a marker of osteoblastic bone formation [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Monitoring these markers in addition to PTH can give an indication of bone metabolism in response to exercise and dietary interventions that may disrupt eucalcemia.</p><p>Daily calcium supplementation does not appear to provide a clear benefit to BMD per se [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there is some evidence that consuming a calcium supplement in close proximity to or during exercise may reduce the degree to which dermal calcium losses can impair bone health [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, the consumption of a ~1000 mg calcium supplement prior to [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] has been shown to attenuate exercise-induced increases in markers of bone resorption [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The supplementation protocols in these studies required the consumption of relatively high volumes of calcium fortified water; 1 L consumed 20&#x02013;60 min prior to exercise or 250 ml consumed every 15 min during exercise. In practice, consuming such high volumes of fluid may not be possible or well tolerated by many athletes. The consumption of calcium-rich or fortified foods prior to exercise may confer similar benefits to bone health while also allowing athletes to meet other sports nutrition goals.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Project Aims</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of consuming calcium-rich pre-exercise foods on exercise-induced perturbations in calcium homeostasis in elite female road cyclists&#x02014;a population at risk of poor bone health. It was hypothesised that a calcium-rich meal would attenuate exercise induced perturbations of bone turnover. It was also of interest to investigate any relationships between the magnitudes of exercise induced dermal calcium loss and changes in biomarkers of bone turnover with bone mineral density.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0123302.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123302.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-two competitive female cyclists [mean &#x000b1; SD; age 24.3 &#x000b1; 4.1 y, body mass (BM) 60.9 &#x000b1; 7.5 kg, height 169 &#x000b1; 7 cm, maximal aerobic power (MAP) 283 &#x000b1; 28 W, peak oxygen consumption (<inline-formula id="pone.0123302.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0123302.e001.jpg" id="pone.0123302.e001g" position="anchor" mimetype="image" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mi>.</mml:mi></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>2peak</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>) 57.1 &#x000b1; 4.9 ml/kg/min] participated in the study which was held during a 10 d training camp.

Maximal aerobic power was determined using an incremental step test on an iso-power cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport, Groningen, Netherlands) starting at 125 W and increasing 25 W every 3 min until volitional fatigue. Maximal aerobic power was calculated as the highest maximum mean power output for the last 3 min of the test. Respiratory gases were analysed, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], using a custom designed open-circuit indirect calorimetry system with associated in-house software (Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra, Australia). Bone mineral density (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) of the left neck of femur and lumbar spine (L<sub>1</sub>-L<sub>4</sub>) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; narrowed fan-beam; Lunar Prodigy; GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) with analysis performed using GE Encore 12.30 software (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) using standardised techniques developed by Nana et al. [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Experimental trials</title><p>Cyclists presented to the laboratory in a morning-fasted (~9 h) state. Following baseline blood samples (T = -15 min) athletes started the trial (T = 0 min) by consuming a pre-trial breakfast which was either a calcium-rich dairy-based meal (CAL) or low calcium control meal (CON; see <italic>Dietary Standardisation</italic>). Blood was sampled again immediately pre-exercise (T = 115 min); immediately post-exercise (90 min of cycle ergometry; T = 210 min); and at 40 min (T = 250 min), 100 min (T = 310 min) and 190 min (T = 400 min) post-exercise. Sweat samples were also collected after 60 min of exercise to measure sweat calcium concentration.</p><p>Subjects were randomised into one of two groups that were balanced for menstrual phase (luteal or follicular which was confirmed with measures of oestrogen and progesterone on trial day one; ovulation was avoided), menstrual regularity (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea or regular) and use of contraceptives (oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive devices, implants or injections). Allocation concealment was not carried out. The same person who determined eligibility also determined group allocation. Group 1 received the control treatment meal first and group 2 received the treatment (calcium-rich) meal first. Subjects were sorted based on menstrual regularity (irregular or regular) and use of contraceptives. Subjects were then randomised into groups 1 and 2 using a computerised sequence generation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org">www.random.org</ext-link>) so that each group had an equal number of subjects who had a regular menstrual cycle and of those an equal number who were in their follicular or luteal phase; irregular menstrual cycle; or were using a contraceptive device. This was deemed more appropriate than using a random number generator prior to accounting for menstrual status, as menstrual status is known to effect calcium homeostasis and so balancing the groups was prioritised. Trial days began 48 h apart so that changes in the menstrual phase were minimised but allowed for sufficient recovery from exercise and time to standardise the 24 h pre-exercise diets. Both trial days started at the same time of day to avoid diurnal variation of biomarkers within subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Dietary standardisation</title><p>While housed at the AIS, subjects followed a standardised diet for 24 h prior to each experimental trial. Individualised menus were based on body weight and prepared accounting for food preferences and intolerances using FoodWorks Professional Edition (v6.0, Xyris Software, Brisbane, Australia), as previously described by Jeacocke and Burke [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Subjects were provided with all meals and snacks in pre-packaged form for the first 22 h of the standardised period, with the pre-trial meal prepared for subjects upon arrival at the lab 2 h prior to commencing exercise. The standardised diet was designed to provide 5.0 g/kg BM of carbohydrate (CHO); 1.5 g/kg BM of protein; 1.5g/kg BM of fat over the 24 h period. This was inclusive of 2.0 g/kg BM of CHO allocated to the pre-trial meal (see <xref rid="pone.0123302.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the case of gluten sensitivity (n = 2) and lactose-intolerance (n = 1), low lactose and gluten-free versions of foods matched for nutrient composition were used. Subjects refrained from alcohol consumption over the 24 h period but followed (and replicated) usual pre-race caffeine habits for the pre-trial meal. Compliance to the diet, determined from a self-reported checklist, was noted by a dietitian on the morning of the trial. Subjects followed standardised training on both pre-trial days (low intensity 1.5 h cycling).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0123302.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0123302.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Macronutrient composition and calcium content of standardised diets for the control (CON) and calcium-rich (CAL) trials.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0123302.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0123302.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">

Cyclists were instructed to maintain the highest average power possible for 10 min. The pre-load intensity of 60% MAP was chosen to be challenging enough to significantly increase sweat rate and thereby dermal losses of calcium. The time trial was used to determine whether there was any impact of pre-trial meal on cycling performance; which was previously reported by Haakonssen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To increase ecological validity, fans were positioned in the same location facing the athlete at a speed of 167 m/s for each trial.

Therefore, only one patch was used in this study. The chosen site was cleaned with distilled water and dried with sterile gauze. An absorbent patch (Tegaderm+Pad, 3M Health Care, Minnesota, USA) was then applied 20 min prior to the start of exercise and removed 60 min into the exercise trial using aseptic techniques and placed into clean filtered centrifuge tubes (Salivette, Sarstedt AG &#x00026; Co, Germany). After removal, sweat patches were immediately centrifuged at 10&#x000b0;C for 5 min at 3850 G to obtain a sweat sample.

Calculations were performed using a one-sample T-test (two-sided), assuming a SD of the difference of 30 pg/mL, with 95% power at the 0.05 level. The effects of different pre-trial meals on Hct, iCa, PTH, CTX-I, CTX-II and PINP were investigated using linear mixed-effects modelling fit by restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) with pre-trial meal, time and their interaction as fixed effects and with subject nested within trial as random effects (variance component model). All response variables were log-transformed except iCa and Hct which had constant variance. Tukey&#x02019;s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post-hoc analysis was used to identify differences. Unless stated otherwise, estimated means and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] are reported. Differences between means and 95% CI&#x02019;s for log-transformed data were back transformed to obtain estimates of the ratio of medians.</p><p>Student&#x02019;s paired t-tests were used to compare total fluid loss and sweat calcium concentration between the two meal conditions. Using data from the control trial, a Spearman&#x02019;s correlation matrix was created to investigate the relationship between dermal calcium loss, total sweat loss and BMD. The relationship between BMD and biomarkers of turnover (post-exercise and pre- to post-exercise change in PTH, CTX-I, CTX-II, PINP and iCa) were investigated similarly. Spearman&#x02019;s correlations between biomarkers of bone turnover (PTH, CTX-I, CTX-II, PINP and iCa) were also calculated.

Specifically, a high (~1350 mg) calcium meal consumed 90 min before undertaking a 90 min bout of stationary cycling was associated with better maintained serum ionised calcium and an attenuation of the increase in markers of bone resorption (PTH and CTX-I) seen in a control trial. In contrast, markers of bone formation (PINP) were not affected by the calcium content of the pre-exercise meal. With cycling, we observed an increase in markers of resorption over ~2 h, with no change in formation markers placing the cyclist in a relatively greater resorptive state. If this occurs for several hours on most days, then bone accrual must be reduced and peak bone mass may be compromised. Elite cyclists train and compete over years in a sport with additional risk factors for poor bone mineral density [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The observations in this study suggest a practical strategy that may reduce the risk of impaired bone health frequently seen among cyclists and other endurance athletes [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Although it sounds counter-intuitive that athletes could suffer from poor bone health given the positive association between bone loading physical activity and bone mineral density (BMD) [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], many studies report low BMD in male and female endurance athletes arising as a direct consequence of their sports participation [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This has been attributed to low energy availability [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and is further complicated by the non-weight bearing nature of sports such as cycling and swimming [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In cyclists where BMD values are either low [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or continuing to decrease during active participation in high level cycling [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], it is of importance to identify risk factors for impaired bone health that are potentially modifiable. This has created interest in the role of increased bone resorption secondary to acute changes in serum ionic calcium concentrations arising from the dermal loss of calcium through sweat [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to the limited available literature, there are indications of an increase in bone resorption during exercise involving significant sweat calcium loss, with an apparent attenuation of that negative outcome when calcium supplements are consumed before or during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In one investigation, the intake of calcium fortified (1000 mg) water prior to and during exercise was considered to reduce the potential perturbations to bone calcium, as seen by an attenuation of the significant increase in PTH associated with 60 min of cycling. In this study, the exercise-associated changes in CTX-I during and immediately after exercise were not significantly different as a result of calcium intake [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, Guillemant et al. [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that 30 min following completion of ~60 min of stationary cycling, the rise in CTX-I was lower as a result of calcium supplementation. Our study supports and extends these findings.</p><p>Our results provide evidence that markers of bone resorption can remain elevated for approximately 2 h following 60&#x02013;90 min of cycling. Furthermore, we show that a high calcium meal sustains attenuation of the rise in CTX-I seen with exercise, with clear reductions in blood concentrations immediately and 40 min following a 90 min bout of cycling. Although CTX-II was originally proposed to be a marker of cartilage degradation [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], recent evidence suggests it is more strongly correlated with other markers of bone resorption [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and it therefore might have been expected to mirror the movements of CTX-I. In contrast, CTX-II was not affected by the pre-exercise meal in our study, but was strongly correlated with PINP, a proposed marker of bone formation. We established a stronger relationship than has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which suggests that further investigations into what aspect of bone or cartilage turnover CTX-II represents may be warranted. Differences between our results and those from previous investigations may be attributed to differences in duration and intensity of the exercise protocols previously used and differences in the time course of blood sampling. In the present study we did not sample blood during exercise; this needs to be considered when interpreting the results. However, given that Guillemant et al. [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed a somewhat linear increase in PTH and CTX-I during exercise it was believed that blood sampled prior to and at several time-points following exercise would be sufficient to capture exercise-induced changes in these variables and the effects of meal type.</p><p>The premise and design of our study was based on general recommendations for calcium intake for bone health as well as the specific results of two earlier investigations on calcium intake in relation to exercise [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An intake of 1000 mg of calcium per day has been indicated through meta-analysis as a threshold intake required to confer beneficial effects on BMD in combination with physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, 1000 mg is described as an adequate daily intake for males and females older than 19 y in the Dietary Guidelines for Australian Adults [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It has been suggested that a daily intake of 1500 mg would be required by male cyclists to maintain a positive calcium balance after accounting for absorption rates and sweat losses [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies utilising a calcium fortified beverage specifically around a cycling bout provided a 1000 mg calcium dose, with cyclists consuming this immediately before and/or during the exercise session [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, this strategy requires athletes to consume 1 L of fluid, 20&#x02013;60 min before exercise and 250 ml every 15 min during, which is substantially more than athletes would typically be advised to consume [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The meal utilised in this study was designed to include &#x0003e;1300 mg of calcium to ensure sufficient biologically-available dietary calcium in the pre-exercise meal. We found that it confers benefits to bone metabolism similar to calcium fortified water, does not impair gut comfort or time trial performance [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and may be more practical to integrate into the athlete&#x02019;s daily routine. Further work may be necessary to establish more accurately how the source, amount and timing of calcium intake interact. The necessary threshold for the described effects may be lower and may have individual variability.</p><p>Future studies should use a higher frequency of blood sampling to more accurately determine the duration at which markers of bone resorption cease to increase. Using exercise protocols with a longer duration that more accurately reflects an elite cyclist&#x02019;s training load may also affect the time taken for markers of bone resorption to return to baseline. A typical training week for an elite cyclist often exceeds 20 h on the bike, with individual training sessions lasting anywhere between ~2&#x02013;6 h. It is of interest to establish whether the findings from studies using comparatively short bouts of cycling (&#x0003c; 90 min) can be extrapolated to longer exercise periods with potentially larger dermal calcium losses. If so, this factor may well contribute to the well documented reduction of BMD reported for male and female cyclists but have a potential solution to reduce its impact. Additional work should also consider the bone turnover effects of high sweat calcium losses that occur independent of exercise or large losses that occur in conjunction with weight-bearing physical activity that is bone loading. For example, O&#x02019;Toole et al. [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] showed that fire fighter recruits had no changes in BMD after 4 mo of training which included frequent bouts of high work rates lasting 3&#x02013;4 h and resulting in substantial fluid losses of ~2.5 L; more than double the loss observed in the current study. It is of interest to ascertain whether weight-bearing activities are able to offset the potential effect of dermal calcium losses on bone turnover.</p><p>We also failed to find any correlations between the magnitude of exercise-induced sweat calcium losses, absolute and relative measures of biomarkers of bone turnover and BMD in the current cohort of subjects. This is in contrast to the observations of Barry and Kohrt [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] who found an inverse relationship between their estimates of dermal calcium losses and BMD in a group of male cyclists. It should be noted that these cyclists were on average 10 y older and possibly had a longer training and racing history than our subjects, potentially making a relationship between sweat calcium loss and BMD easier to identify. However, given the complex interplay between mechanical loading, nutrition and endocrine function, it could be expected that calcium sweat concentration would explain only a small proportion of the variance in BMD and indeed change in BMD over time. Clearly, long-term, prospective studies are still required to determine whether pre-exercise calcium intake (dairy or supplement) can attenuate long term reductions in BMD previously described in cyclists, particularly when other factors that contribute to bone health are difficult to alter. One known study [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found no difference in BMD when a calcium carbonate supplement was consumed by cyclists prior to exercise for a 5 mo period. Given the subtle changes in BMD that occur over the competitive season (1.5%) [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], longer periods (&#x0003e; 1 y) of observation may be required.</p><p>Finally, the dairy-based pre-exercise meal used as the intervention in this study, may help athletes to achieve a number of guidelines related to health and sports nutrition goals. An increase in dairy foods in the general diet is a key recommendation of population dietary guidelines, with the recommended dietary intake (RDI) of dairy in Australia for females aged 18&#x02013;60 y being 2.5 serves per day (where one serve = 1 cup milk, 200 g yoghurt or 40 g cheese) [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As well as the importance of dairy-derived calcium to bone health, dairy intake has been promoted, albeit controversially [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as having a beneficial effect on body composition [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Indeed, consuming a high calcium diet in a hypoenergetic state has been shown to accelerate weight loss, with augmented effects and a greater proportion of body fat loss when dairy is the calcium source [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This may be important for cyclists for whom producing a relatively high power output relies on having a low body mass while maintaining sufficient functional lean mass. Guidelines for protein intake to enhance muscle protein synthesis now recommend an even spread of high quality protein sources every ~3 h over the day, and it is noted that typical food choices included in Western breakfast patterns are unlikely to meet the target of 20&#x02013;25 g of protein per meal [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is even more likely if dairy foods are excluded from breakfast/pre-training choices. Our dairy-rich meal provided ~36 g of protein (based on a 60 kg athlete) including a rich source of whey protein which is particularly valuable for muscle protein synthetic needs [<xref rid="pone.0123302.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>While the interest in nutrition and training with elite athletes is most commonly focused directly on performance, bone health has implications for long term function and may also reduce the risk of fracture; a common outcome of accidents in road cycling races. The present study shows that a high-calcium dairy based pre-exercise meal can reduce the exercise-induced rise in markers of bone resorption. This practice can easily be incorporated into the dietary routine of endurance cyclists and may help the athlete meet other sports nutrition recommendations. Future studies should use a long-term prospective design to confirm the efficacy of pre-exercise calcium intake for improving bone health in endurance cyclists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0123302.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0123302.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0123302.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Ethics approval form.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0123302.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0123302.s003"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Ethics application form.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0123302.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0123302.s004"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>Notification of study design amendment to AIS Ethics Committee.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0123302.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0123302.s005"><label>S4 Text</label><caption><title>Subject information sheet.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0123302.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0123302.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0123302.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0123302.s007"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Serum concentrations of biomarkers for bone turn over, calcium homeostasis and haematocrit before and after control (CON) and calcium-rich (CAL) meal conditions and exercise.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0123302.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank their colleagues from the AIS Sports Nutrition and Physiology teams for their enthusiastic contributions&#x02014;intellectual and physical&#x02014;to this ambitious project.
