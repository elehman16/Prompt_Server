The most common symptoms include painful mouth ulcer, genital ulcer, skin lesions, inflammation of parts of the eye, and arthritis. If the activity of the disease was not been well controlled, the inflammatory reaction may progress to the brain or spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, blood clots, aneurysms, or blindness. Although the events of vital organs involvement is less frequent but can be life threatening.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>There is no cure available currently. Treatment is aiming at easing the symptoms, reducing inflammation, and controlling the immune system. Drugs may include immunosuppressive medication such as corticosteroids, colchicine, and thalidomide, etc.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> However, the quality of the evidence for treating the symptoms such as oral ulcers associated with BD is poor.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>BD was named after Hulusi Behcet (1889&#x02013;1948), a Turkish dermatologist in 1937. BD is also known as the name &#x0201c;Silk Road Disease&#x0201d; as it is observed with a higher incidence rate among populations living along the historic Silk Road that from Japan and China in the Far East to the Mediterranean Sea, including countries such as Turkey and Iran.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, a historical Chinese doctor called Zhang Zhongjing (Chinese: Zhang Zhongjing; 150&#x02013;219) recorded the similar manifestations as Huhuo disease in his work Synopsis of Golden Chamber, dated from more than 1800 years ago. And the syndrome was treated by <italic>Glycyrrhizae</italic> Decoction for Purging Stomach-Fire (GDPSF, Chinese: Gancao Xiexin Tang).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> GDPSF is investigated to be effective for BD and many other diseases especially gastrointestinal related.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>GDPSF is a formula comprised of multiple herbs, such as, <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch, <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> CA Mey, <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> Georgi, and jujube ect. Due to the complexity of the ingredients, few researches investigated the mechanism of its action. Extractive from <italic>Glycyrrhizae</italic>, which plays sovereign role in the decoction, was reported with antiviral activity<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> while BD is regarded to be induced by various pathogenic microorganisms especially herpes simplex virus-1.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup><italic>P ginseng</italic> has favorable impacts to body metabolism and immune function.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Massive researches in this way may be considering the underline mechanisms of GDPSFs action.</p><p>Some clinical studies published in China reported the effect of GDPSF for BD with high remission rate. However, there have been few high quality trials. There has been no trial that combine GDPSF and chemical drugs as an integrative medical method for BD. This study aims to check the effectiveness and safety of GDPSF in BD patients according to strict, high-quality methodology and follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trails (CONSORT) statement for randomized controlled trials of herbal medicine.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> The results of this trial hopefully to be published in an authorized publication to be accessed to health providers and BD patients worldwide.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Objective</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the potential curative or improvement effects and safety of GDPSF for BD patients with mucocutaneous involvement only. The secondary objective is to determine whether combination application of GDPSF and thalidomide could possibly reduce the side effects caused by thalidomide and increase effectiveness for BD management.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title><p>This is a single center, double-blinded, randomized, and controlled, parallel-group study.

The symptoms caused by the disease especially recurrent oral and genital ulceration cause pain and decrease quality of life in BD patients, lead them suffer physically and psychologically.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> As a result, it is not proper to give a BD patient placebo treatment as a control. Thalidomide is one of the most common options to erase symptoms in adult BD patients. It provided a useful therapeutic option in severe oral and genital ulceration, which had not responded to other therapies.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Therefore, besides of historical control, thalidomide treatment group will set as a control.</p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) gained afflatus from war that similar principles dominate in both military and medicine, which is to prescribe drugs as monarch, minister, assistant, and guide in a formula according to military action strategies or country governance. In the formula of GDPSF, the <italic>G uralensis</italic> plays the role of monarch, which targets the disease or main symptoms suffered. There has been numerous of in vivo and in vitro researches on antiinflammatory activity from <italic>G uralensis</italic>.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Extracts from <italic>S baicalensis</italic> also showed activity of antiinflammation, antitumor, and attenuates oxidant stress.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Researches on <italic>P ternate</italic> shows antidepression, gastrointestinal regulation,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> and effects on blood pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup><italic>C chinensis</italic> shows activity of antimicrobial,<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> while mycobacterial such as <italic>Streptococcus</italic> were though as one of the risks to induce the onset of oral ulcers in BD.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> The multiple functions of <italic>S baicalensis</italic>, <italic>C chinensis</italic>, and <italic>P ternate</italic> can be used to assistant monarch to enhance the effectiveness for the main disease or symptoms, play a role of minister. Potential side effects in the formula based on TCM would relieve by <italic>P ginseng</italic>, which has been richly investigated. As the chemical elements are extremely complex in n herb formula, and considering the relation between parts and whole, it is impossible to illustrate the GDPSF pharmaceutical actions through current researches on extractives. Good news is the compound formula is gaining attention.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup></p><p>There is extensive literature on the chemical constituents and bioactivities of <italic>P ginseng</italic>. The chemical constituents isolated and detected from ginseng show the biological activities of immunoregulatory activity, neuroregulation activity, wound and ulcer healing activity, etc.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Thus, we hypothesize, GDPF may reduce the events like leukopenia, peripheral neuropathy caused by thalidomide. Therefore, in this research, we set an integrative group to combine the application of GDPSF and thalidomide, hopefully to enhance the treatment outcomes and reduce side effects.</p><p>The Silk Road is an ancient trading route that were for centuries central to cultural interaction originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West and stretching from the Korean peninsula and Japan to the Mediterranean Sea. Underling the guideline of One Belt and One Road policy of Chinese government, we hope TCM can serve more people in the world. Through this ROTs, we hope to provide a new evidence-based treatment option for BD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Y.
