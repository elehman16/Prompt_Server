Central to the diagnosis, planning of treatment and management of cerebrovascular diseases is the cerebral angiography,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] a procedure to image blood vessels in the brain. Children are rarely able to complete the exam under local anesthesia because of anxiety, agitation, pain and discomfort from the femoral artery puncture and injection of contrast agent, and brain dysfunction caused by hemorrhage or ischemia. Deep sedation or general anesthesia is therefore warranted, but general endotracheal anesthesia may prolong postoperative recovery. Provision of motionless sedation with rapid recovery and acceptably low risk of adverse events may be challenging.</p><p>Propofol is widely used for anesthesia and sedation in pediatric patients, but adverse side effects include hypotension, respiratory depression and hypertriglyceridemia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] An alternative option is dexmedetomidine, a highly selective &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptor agonist that provides sedation, analgesia, and anxiolytic effects.

A parent or legal guardian of each patient provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Children between the ages of 6 and 15 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of I or II were eligible for inclusion in the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

The anesthesiologists and data collectors in the radiology procedure room were not blinded to the treatment. The subjects, their parents or legal guardians, and observers in the recovery room and follow-up were blinded to the study group.</p><p>The preoperative fasting period was 2 h for clear fluids and 6 h for solid food. No premedication was given. All patients received an intravenous infusion of 5 mL/kg/h lactated Ringer's solution. Monitoring by pulse oximetry (blood oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>]) and electrocardiography was conducted throughout the procedure. Arterial blood pressure was monitored noninvasively at 3-min intervals.</p><p>Patients in the propofol group received an initial bolus of intravenous propofol, 1 mg/kg (Diprivan; Astra Zeneca Pharma, Cheshire, UK) over 30 s and then a maintenance infusion of 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. Patients in the dexmedetomidine group received an initial bolus of intravenous dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg (Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride Injection; Jiangsu HengRui Medicine, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China) over 10 min, and then a maintenance infusion of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h (dexmedetomidine was diluted in normal saline to a dose of 4 &#x003bc;g/mL). Local anesthesia was performed with 1% lidocaine before the femoral artery puncture. Additional boluses of propofol (0.5 mg/kg) or dexmedetomidine (0.25 &#x003bc;g/kg) were administered if needed to maintain sedation.</p><p>Oxygen was administered at 3 L/min via nasal cannula throughout the procedure. Ephedrine boluses of 3&#x02013;5 mg administered intravenously were allowed in addition to fluid infusion to treat hypotension (systolic arterial pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure &#x0003c;65 mmHg). Atropine boluses of 0.3-0.5 mg were administered intravenously to treat bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;60 bpm).</p><p>Clinical signs of airway obstruction or desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%) were managed with airway manipulations (jaw thrust, chin lift, or shoulder roll) to relieve obstruction. If this was not effective, an artificial airway (oral or nasal airway, or face mask) was used. Endotracheal intubation was used as the last resort. All the above respiratory events were recorded.</p><p>All the angiography procedures were performed by the same radiologist. Once the imaging was complete, the propofol or dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued. All patients were transferred to a recovery room and observed continuously by observers blinded to the study group. Oxygen administration was continued until discharge from the recovery room. A total modified Aldrete score of &#x02265;18 indicated the patient's readiness for discharge [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Adverse events in the recovery room and the time required to meet the discharge criterion were recorded.

Many pediatric patients with cerebrovascular diseases suffer from brain dysfunction caused by hemorrhage or ischemia. Intracranial hypertension and epilepsy are the most common symptoms. Provision of anesthesia or sedation for these patients can often be challenging. For critically ill patients, general anesthesia by endotracheal intubation is the only choice. Nevertheless, most cases are relatively mild, and it is possible to complete the procedure under sedation.</p><p>An ideal sedative should cause rapid onset, adequate maintenance of the sedative state to allow completion of the procedure, and rapid recovery. It should also be safe with few adverse events. Respiratory depression is the most important risk and predictor of sedation-related morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Propofol is one of the most widely used anesthetics in anesthesia and sedation for adult and pediatric patients. It has been used to induce deep sedation for CT and MRI in pediatric patients,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] mainly because it has a rapid onset and recovery time, an absence of nausea or vomiting, and less respiratory depression. However, in the present study, we demonstrated that the incidence of airway events and the subsequent need for airway intervention to relieve airway obstruction were significantly greater in the propofol group than in the dexmedetomidine group. Similar to our findings, Zgleszewski <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed that propofol is associated with a significantly greater incidence of adverse respiratory events compared with pentobarbital.</p><p>The changes in the configuration that cause obstruction in the upper airway during anesthesia with propofol in pediatrics have been studied. Litman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that the dimensions of the upper airways of children change significantly on awakening from propofol anesthesia, and in most children the narrowest point in the pharynx was at the level of the soft palate. In their study Evans <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] they found that increasing the depth of propofol anesthesia in children was associated with upper airway narrowing throughout the upper airway, and was most pronounced in the hypopharynx at the level of the epiglottis. Our results are consistent with the imaging findings of these studies.</p><p>Pharmacologically, propofol induces anesthesia through the inhibitory neurotransmitter &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid, while dexmedetomidine acts by stimulation of &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic receptors in the locus coeruleus. Propofol may cause more intense rapid-eye-movement sleep, which is associated with central inhibition of ventilation,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] whereas dexmedetomidine has been shown to induce sedation similar to natural sleep.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Another important finding of the present study was that the cerebral angiography took significantly longer for the propofol group than for patients who received dexmedetomidine. This can be explained by the significantly greater number of airway events in the propofol group, which required the radiologist to hold the procedure to allow for correction of the problem.</p><p>In this study, other adverse events were infrequent and incidence did not differ between the groups. Both propofol and dexmedetomidine sedation allowed completion of the cerebral angiography for all subjects. Dexmedetomidine caused significant reductions in heart rate, and propofol caused significant reductions in mean arterial blood pressure. These hemodynamic reductions were statistically, but not clinically, significant. Although there was one patient who required pharmacologic intervention in each group, the changes in hemodynamics were relatively mild and transient.</p><p>It is known that the most significant adverse reactions associated with dexmedetomidine are hypotension and bradycardia, resulting from its sympatholytic activity; both have been reported in several pediatric studies,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] although rarely do either require clinical intervention. We found that dexmedetomidine caused significant reductions in heart rate, but did not change the mean arterial pressure significantly in this pediatric population. However, despite the high affinity of dexmedetomidine for the &#x003b1;-2 rather than the &#x003b1;-1 adrenergic receptor (1620:1),[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] it should be used cautiously in patients at risk of bradycardia or hemodynamic instability.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First is the absence of blinding for the anesthesiologist administering sedation. However, this was not possible in view of the nature of drugs and the need to manage complications efficiently if they arose. Second, although our results showed a significant difference in the incidence of airway events it did not show differences in other adverse events. However, our study was not statistically designed to analyze differences in other adverse events. A larger sample size may be required to find the true incidence of adverse events in this population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine was associated with fewer respiratory adverse events, and therefore may be better alternative as a sedative for cerebral angiography in pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Peng K and Li J helped performing the research and data analysis and writing the manuscript.
