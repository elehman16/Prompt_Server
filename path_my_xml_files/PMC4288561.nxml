These interventions have been applied in both university and general population settings, and in a growing number of countries.</p><p>Personalized feedback interventions often have several recognizable components. Most obvious of these are summaries of the amount participants drank, as well as other personalized feedback thought to be relevant, such as amount spent on alcohol, calories consumed, and reports of severity of use according to participants&#x02019; scores on a validated scale (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Distinct from this personalized feedback is normative feedback&#x02014;comparisons of how much the person drank (or spent, etc.) to others of a relevant comparison group (e.g., males of the same age group, from the same country; students at the same university). In addition, personalized feedback interventions often also contain sections outlining the dangers of heavy drinking and advice on safe levels of consumption.</p><p>Given the evidence base regarding the impact of normative feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the efficacy of personalized feedback interventions have often been ascribed to this component of the intervention. However, no dismantling trials have been conducted to discern if the normative feedback, the personalized feedback, or a combination of both is the active component of these interventions. Research exploring the active mechanisms of change has been identified as a priority, based on the assumption that understanding the active components of different interventions will allow us to target these interventions more efficiently and increase their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The Check Your Drinking intervention (CYD; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.checkyourdrinking.net">www.CheckYourDrinking.net</ext-link>) is a personalized feedback intervention that has its roots in the Drinkers Check-up developed by Miller and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The CYD has been subjected to four randomized controlled trials in different settings and has fairly consistent evidence of impact on hazardous alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The intervention is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and contains a variety of personalized feedback elements as well as normative feedback elements. This study tested whether it is the personalized feedback or the normative feedback component of the CYD that motivates change among hazardous drinking participants.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Potential participants were recruited via free online classified advertising (Kijiji) in cities across Canada using the following advertisement: &#x0201c;CAMH Internet Study: Drinkers Needed.

The CYD is well established and has research supporting its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The CYD also could be divided easily into two components&#x02014;the personalized feedback component and the normative feedback component. The results of this trial, though weak, would appear to indicate that it is the personalized feedback component that is the active component of the intervention. There were main effects of personalized feedback for two of the three outcome measures &#x02013; number of drinks in a typical week and the AUDIT-C. However, post-hoc tests exploring these main effects yielded more ambiguous findings, with mixed effects in the cell-by-cell comparisons. These ambiguous findings make it inappropriate to whole-heartedly interpret the results of this trial as clear evidence of the personalized feedback component as the sole active component of the CYD intervention.</p><p>An additional challenging element in interpreting the results of this trial is that the impact of the full CYD intervention as compared to those receiving nothing was fairly weak. As an example, our previous trial comparing the CYD to a no-intervention control group found that providing hazardous drinkers access to the CYD resulted in a six-drink-per-week reduction in drinking over and above the reduction observed by participants in the no-intervention control condition at 3-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In comparison, the current trial found a two-drink reduction, which, while still statistically significant, is a minimal reduction in alcohol consumption. We speculate that the recruitment method in the current trial resulted in participants who were less concerned about their drinking than they were in receiving an honorarium for completing the trial. Whatever the reason for this small observed impact in the current trial, it does limit the scope within which any impact of the different components of the CYD intervention could display their separate impact.</p><p>Given that there is a fairly extensive literature on the impact of personalized norms feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the fact that there was no clear evidence of the impact of the normative feedback component of the CYD in the current trial was unexpected. Interestingly, a trial of personalized feedback for gambling presented with and without norms also found no impact for the version containing normative information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While one possible interpretation is that the normative feedback is not an active component of the intervention, there are several other factors that lead to difficulties with this conclusion. First, it is challenging to create a pure normative feedback component that does not also include some element of personalized feedback. The appendices included with this paper show examples of the normative feedback-only and the personalized feedback-only interventions. While they &#x02018;hold together&#x02019; as an intervention for the reader, the full CYD intervention certainly feels like a more convincing document. This means that the lack of normative feedback component impact observed in the trial could be purely the result of the materials we used, rather than being a generalizable effect. Second, the personalized feedback-only intervention contained more pieces of information (that could act as motivators for change) than the normative feedback-only intervention. A replication of this pilot trial might benefit from starting with the goal of designing separate norms-only and personal feedback-only interventions. The CYD was chosen for convenience and because it had an existing evidence base, but its limitation for the current study is that it was designed as one report, with norms and personalized feedback intermingled. Developing these component interventions anew could also allow for an examination of whether there are higher quality norms and personalized feedback elements evaluated in the extant literature, as the CYD is largely unchanged (baring updating general population norms) since its original version developed in the 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A replication trial would also benefit from concentrating on methods for improving follow-up rates, as the extent of missing data in the current trial makes its interpretation difficult.</p><p>One final issue of interest is to consider whether any differences between groups reflect real changes in drinking as opposed to changes in reporting of amount consumed. Our previous work has explored the possibility that normative data could have an impact on amount of drinking reported because of the potential social desirability effects associated with communicating how much others drinks (particularly if that drinking is less than the participants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This alternate explanation, if true, would argue against the lack of impact of the normative feedback observed in the current trial. However, there is also the possibility that personalized feedback, separate from the presentation of norms, could have a social desirability effect on self-reported alcohol consumption. This alternate explanation of the results cannot be ruled out in the current pilot trial.</p><p>Irrespective of these challenges to interpretation of the results in this trial, the fact that the personalized feedback-only intervention showed an independent impact is encouraging from a practical implementation standpoint. That is, normative feedback data is population-specific (whether to the population of a country or of a university). However, Internet interventions are internationally accessible. Demonstrating that a personalized feedback-only intervention can have an impact allows for the possibility that the CYD, or other interventions of this type, can be set up such that, when normative data is not available for a particular participant, a version of feedback without the norms can be provided with the assurance that an active intervention is being offered to the participant.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec5"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13722_2014_22_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>
