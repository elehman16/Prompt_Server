A total of 115 patients were randomized into 2 treatment groups.</p><p>In Group I, patients were assigned to once-daily subcutaneous injections of 2.5 mg fondaparinux 6 hours before surgery. The first injection of fondaparinux took place a mean of 12 hours after the operation and subsequent injections of 2.5 mg fondaparinux was given once daily.</p><p>In Group II, the first subcutaneous injection of nadroparin calcium was given 12 hours before surgery, the second 12 hours after completion of surgery, and subsequent injections once daily in the morning. The dose of the nadroparin was arranged in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendation.</p><p>The day of surgery was defined as Day 1 and the efficacy outcome was assessed on Day 5 and Day 21. During follow-up, patients were instructed to report any symptoms or signs of venous thromboembolism or bleeding, and any other clinical event that arose after treatment had been completed. If VTE arose during the study, treatment was left to the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>Intra- and postoperative bleeding was assessed, first according to the clinical impression of the surgeon (recorded as normal, greater than normal, or less than normal), and then by recording the blood loss collected by suction and swabs, drainage volume, and the number and amount of blood transfusions.</p><p>Throughout the treatment period, intermittent pneumatic compression, dextran, thrombolytic treatment, and any other anticoagulant agents were prohibited. The patients were advised to avoid taking aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs whenever possible. Use of graduated compression stockings and physiotherapy was recommended.</p><p>Measurements, including blood counts, clinical biochemical tests, and coagulation tests were done before the surgical procedure and on the fifth and 21st days after surgery. Blood counts included hemoglobin and heamatocrit levels and platelet counts; clinical biochemical tests included alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and direct and indirect bilirubin. Coagulation tests included thrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, prothrombin time-International Normalized Ratio, antithrombin III activity, anti-factor Xa activity, and anti-IIa activity.</p><p>Bruising of the wound area was assessed by the same observer with use of a subjective visual analog scale described by Warwick et al<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> on the fifth and 21st postoperative days. With regard to bruising, a score of 0 points indicated no discoloration, 1 point indicated light-yellow discoloration, 2 points indicated dark-yellow discoloration, 3 points indicated yellow discoloration greater than the area of 3 palms, 4 points indicated yellow-and-black discoloration, and 5 points indicated yellow-and-black discoloration greater than the area of 3 palms.</p><p>The study was done in accordance with the ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki.

In our study, we followed patients for 3 weeks, which included the period over which patients are at high risk.</p><p>A meta-analysis of fondaparinux Phase III data in 5385 patients showed that, in patients who have had major orthopedic surgery, fondaparinux reduced the incidence of VTE to 6.8% and this result was better than the results of enoxaparin (13.7%).<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>Nadroparin thromboprophylaxis is known to reduce the incidence of DVT by 87%.

Fatal bleeding and bleeding in a critical organ was observed in 0.1% of patients. Bleeding at the surgical site leading to reoperation occurred in 0.5% of patients and bleeding at a nonsurgical site necessitating the transfusion of &#x0003e;2 units of blood occurred in 0.1% of patients. In our small study group, bleeding at the surgical site leading to drainage due to postoperative hematoma occured in 8.3% of patients in the fondaparinux group and 3.6% in the nadroparin group. Although the percentage was high in the fondaparinux group there was not a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. None of the patients in the 2 groups had bleeding that was fatal or involved a critical organ.</p><p>In a Phase III, long-term prophylactic study in hip fracture surgery, it was reported that there were no differences in the overall incidence of adverse events and in platelet count between the fondaparinux and placebo groups. However, until the safety of fondaparinux concerning immune thrombocytopenia is firmly established by clinical experience, periodic blood platelet count monitoring is recommended during the course of fondaparinux therapy.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Similarly, an increase in serum transaminases was rare in both groups.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>In our study, there were no differences between fondaparinux and nadroparin groups in the blood counts, including hemoglobin and platelet counts. When we evaluated the serum transaminases, although there was a slight increase in the mean value of AST on the fifth and 21st day in both groups, the difference showed no significance.</p><p>It is known that LMWH does not usually elevate activated partial thromboplastin time; it is valued for its antithrombotic rather than its anticoagulant effect.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> None of the coagulation tests showed significant changes in either group of our study. In general, antifactor Xa assays are more sensitive to the effects of LMWHs and are therefore more useful in this respect than anti-IIa assays.<xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,17</sup></xref> Differences were also observed in the antifactor Xa activities of the LMWHs. All the LMWHs studied had weaker antifactor Xa potency than standard heparin. We found that antifactor Xa activities were increased significantly on the fifth and 21st day in our both study groups.</p><p>Regarding the subjective visual analog scale, there was significantly less bruising and oozing on the 21st day in the nadroparin group than in the fondapainux group. The clinical importance of these differences is unclear because it is not known how they are related to the cost of the dressings, the duration of hospitalization, the formation of hematomas, or the rate of infection. Furthermore, the scales for the measurement of bruising and oozing were subjective and the examination depends on the observer. Unless these side effects were not to be associated with the disastrous complication of infection, it would not be viewed as a disadvantage.</p><p>In our prospective study, symptomatic VTE events were rare, during both the treatment and follow-up periods. Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of both fondaparinux and nadroparin for prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities and showed that neither drug is associated with a risk of major bleeding complications.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frostick</surname><given-names>S.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Death after joint replacement</article-title><source>Haemostasis</source><volume>30</volume><year>2000</year><fpage>84</fpage><lpage>87</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11251348</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>R.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Romano</surname><given-names>P.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Incidence and time course of thromboembolic outcomes following total hip or knee arthroplasty</article-title><source>Arch Intern Med</source><volume>158</volume><year>1998</year><fpage>1525</fpage><lpage>1531</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9679793</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nicolaides</surname><given-names>A.N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevention of venous thromboembolism: international consensus statement, guidelines compiled in accordance with the scientific evidence</article-title><source>Int Angiol</source><volume>20</volume><year>2001</year><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>37</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11342993</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McMillan</surname><given-names>W.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>W.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>S.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Perioperative low molecular weight heparin for infrageniculate bypass</article-title><source>J Vasc Surg</source><volume>25</volume><year>1997</year><fpage>796</fpage><lpage>802</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9152306</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Turpie</surname><given-names>A.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallus</surname><given-names>A.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoek</surname><given-names>J.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pentasaccharide Investigators.
