This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Patients were included if they had no dementia or cognitive dysfunctions and no history of opioid or psychotic drugs use. Patients with hypersensitivity to blood transfusion, sever reaction to cement implantation, sever bleeding, hypotension needed interventions, prolonged operation changed surgical plan which impressed the study goals, were excluded.</p><p>An anesthesiologist visited all the patients a night before surgery and any known history of hematologic, endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous system diseases were noted. Also, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were recorded.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned into two groups using random-number table: GA (general anesthesia) and NA (neuraxial anesthesia). All patients were infused Ringer's lactate solution (4 ml/kg) on arrival in the operating room and also received low dose of heparin as a DVT prophylaxis. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were recorded before induction of anesthesia by anesthesiologist.</p><p>In the GA group, patients were given Ringer's lactate solution (10 ml/kg) to oppose the vasodilatation and hypotension resulting from intravenous anesthetics during induction of anesthesia. Patients were not pre-medicated. They received a standardized general anesthesia involving pre-oxygenation and induction with fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) followed by thiopental (5 mg/kg) until loss of consciousness; then lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) and pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg) were administered. Anesthesia was maintained using halothane (0.5-1.5%) in oxygen and nitrous oxide (ratio 1:1). Mechanical ventilation with a constant tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 12 per minute was maintained throughout the study. At the end of the operation, the volatile anesthetic agents were discontinued and residual neuro-muscular block was antagonized with intravenous prostigmin (0.04 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg). The lungs were ventilated manually with 100% oxygen until spontaneous ventilation resumed. Extubation was performed when the patient was judged to be awake.</p><p>In the NA group, patients were given Ringer's lactate solution (15 ml/kg) prior to the induction of anesthesia and received either spinal or epidural anesthesia. After sterile preparation and draping, in spinal anesthesia group, plain bupivacaine 0.5% (3 ml) was injected over 10 seconds into the subarachnoid space at the L3-L4 interspace via 23-G Withacre needle placed midline approach. In the epidural group, anesthesia was performed using an 18-G-Touhy needle at the L3-L4 interspace and after an initial test dose of plain bupivacaine 0.5% (5 ml) with epinephrine (1:200000) was injected followed 5 minutes later by a further 20 ml.</p><p>All patients were monitored by non-invasive electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and pulse oxymetry. Additionally, end-tidal carbon dioxide (Etco2) was monitored and maintained within 35-40 mmhg during operation in the GA group.</p><p>In both groups, preloading with Ringer's lactate solution prevented sever reduction in blood pressure and kept mean of arterial pressure above 70% of baseline levels in hypertensive patients and above 65 mmhg in normotensive patients.3 Blood pressure was measured every 15 minutes and if it fell to below these limits, halothane was reduced gradually in the GA group and an additional 10 ml/kg Ringer's lactate solution was infused in a period of 10 minutes in the NA group to reestablish the acceptable blood pressure.11 If the blood pressure did not respond after these interventions, 5-10 mg bolus of intravenous ephedrine, according to the degree of hypotension, was administered. The second dose was repeated after 5 minutes if the blood pressure was not normalized. Five minutes after the second dose of ephedrine, if the mean arterial pressure was still less than 70% of its baseline value, further ephedrine boluses were administered, and the case regarded as a failure in the study.</p><p>Hemoglobin level was measured before surgery (baseline), 6 hours, and 2, 3, and 5 days after the end of it. The total estimated intraoperative blood loss was recorded at the end of each surgery with bloody gauze counting and measuring volume of suction bottles; also, the amount of postoperative hemorrhage was measured according to its volume in hemovac drain.</p><p>The time interval between the induction of anesthesia (GA or NA) and dressing of the site of operation was recorded as the duration of surgery.</p><p>Postoperative pain severity was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The VAS was evaluated by a nurse at the time of discharge from recovery room and by a second nurse on the ward at the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> day after surgery. Observers were not aware of group assignment. Intravenous morphine (5 mg) was administered to the patients re-quested analgesia and its total amounts were recorded till 5 days after the end of surgery. Cognitive dysfunctions were noted before discharge from recovery room, and at 24 and 48 hours after the end of the surgery based on time, person, and place disorientation.</p><p>Postoperative complications such as deep veins thrombosis, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, atelectasis, pulmonary infection, and cerebrovascular accidents are diagnosed by the consultant specialist. The number of patients who died over one month period in the hospital or after discharge from it was recorded.</p><p>The data were analyzed using SPSS statistical package (version 12, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Frequencies were compared by Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests, as appropriate, and t-test was used to compare the averages. Significance level was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>During the study period, 400 consecutive patients with the required surgical indication were included. Three patients of the GA group and 10 of the NA group were excluded because of change in anesthetic or surgical plan.

One hundred and ninety-seven (50.9%) patients were allocated to the GA group, whereas 190 (49.1%) patients constituted the NA group.

In two previous separate meta-analysis assessing the patients undergoing different surgical procedures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> and the candidates of hip and spinal column surgeries, the researchers demonstrated that general anesthesia is accompanied by more hemorrhage compared with neuraxial anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p><p>In a review article, Macfarlane et al reported that in four out of ten studies, patients receiving GA had significantly more bleeding, and in the other six there was no significant difference between groups considering blood loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> They reported that the mean of reduction of blood loss was different from 118 ml to 595 ml, but in our study this value was 238 ml.</p><p>In a prospective controlled study, patients undergoing hip surgery under spinal anesthesia had less blood loss than patients receiving general anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></p><p>Neuraxial anesthesia blocks alpha and beta adrenergic receptors, leads to reduction of heart rates, vascular tone, and blood pressure. The decreased blood pressure acts like controlled hypotension which results in less blood loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> In this study, the amount of intraoperative ephedrine consumption to oppose hypotension was significantly more in neuraxial method than in general anesthesia. Thus the established intraoperative hypotension is in an accepted limitation, it can explain the less blood loss in neuraxial anesthesia patients. The other justifying reason can be an increase in venous blood pressure in patients receiving general anesthesia especially with mechanical ventilation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> In this study there was no difference between the groups regarding postoperative blood loss amount and the hemoglobin changes until the 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day; but in both groups the mean of hemoglobin changes was statistically lower on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative days compared to preoperative values.</p><p>In our study, the mean of duration of hospitalization was significantly more in patients receiving general anesthesia. M&#x000f8;iniche et al surveyed 42 volunteers of hip surgery undergoing general or continuous epidural anesthesia and found that the duration of hospitalization was similar in both groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> The difference may be attributed to their smaller studied population and applying only one method of neuraxial anesthesia which was continuous epidural anesthesia. Sutcliffe and Parker in a retrospective study found no difference in factors of hospitalization in 1333 patients receiving either general or neuraxial anesthesia for hip surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> This contradiction can be due to the different kind of studies. They studied retrospectively while our study was a prospective one.</p><p>Vaida et al declared that the beneficial effects of neuraxial analgesia are reduction of stress hormones, inhibition of central hyper sensitization and ultimately shortening the duration of hospitalization. They believed that increase in pain severity and cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving general anesthesia resulted in longer hospitalization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> Our findings demonstrated that the pain severity, especially at recovery room and on the 3<sup>rd</sup> aostoperative day was lower in neuraxial group.</p><p>Moreover, Gonano et al studied 40 volunteers of hip and knee surgeries and reported that spinal anesthesia accompanied by less postoperative pain compared to general anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> Furthermore, a meta-analysis on 1362 patients reported that neuraxial anesthesia or peripheral nerve block leads to less postoperative pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> Additionally, a review article reported that in ten of eleven studies, patients receiving epidural anesthesia significantly suffered less pain than general anesthesia groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> The reduction in pain severity at recovery room can be attributed to the residual effects of sensory block of neuraxial anesthesia. Also, the lower pain on postoperative days may be due to the beneficial effects of preemptive analgesia in neuraxial anesthesia application.</p><p>In our study, the frequency of postoperative events, including cardiovascular and respiratory complications, were similar in both groups. In fact, there was no statistically deference in the incidence of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, atelectasia, and pulmonary infection between groups. Our results were different from the results of Urwin et al study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>; in their study, incidence of DVT and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing correction of fractured hip surgery under neuraxial anesthesia was lower than general anesthesia patients. Meanwhile, the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents and intraoperative hypotension were lower in patients receiving general anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The reasons for differences in findings might be due to the difference in sample size and the kind of the study. In other words, they evaluated 2161 patients retrospectively while we studied 387 patients prospectively.</p><p>In a meta-analysis, a lower incidence of DVT and pulmonary emboli in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia for hip surgery was showed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> However, O&#x02019;Hara et al reported no significant difference in incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), and mental dysfunction between both groups receiving either general or neuraxial anesthesia in a retrospective study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> This finding was similar to the present study. We also found no statistical difference in mental dysfunction on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative days between the groups. This was in similarity to the findings of some previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></p><p>Our results revealed that patients receiving general anesthesia had more mental dysfunction in recovery room. This difference might be due to the remaining effect of anesthetic drugs at recovery room.</p><p>In our study, there was no difference in the abundance of death during hospital stay and out of hospital till 30 days after surgery. In one study on 425 patients in a primary investigation, they reported that the anesthetic technique has a role in morbidity and mortality of patients. But, after controlling the differences of the studied groups, they revealed that there is no difference in morbidity and mortality rate between the groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Thus, the authors concluded that the major reasons for morbidity and mortality of these patients are their coexisting disease (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc), elderly, and undesirable physical condition and not an anesthetic technique. In limited studies, the difference in the incidence of mortality and morbidity after neuraxial and general anesthesia was reported. For example, in one study, 53 high risk patients were evaluated and the results showed a lower incidence of morbidity and mortality after epidural anesthesia compared to general anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> In another clinical trial, the effect of anesthetic techniques was not proved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> But in another study, the effect of neuraxial anesthesia on short term mortality was drawn but it had not differ from general anesthesia considering long term mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> In fact, in a majority of the studies, we may not be able to rely on the results due to the small sample size and a low study power.</p><p>As in our study, the sample size was calculated according to the major postoperative complications, the absence of significant difference in mortality might be attributed to small sample size. This would be possibly considered as a weakness of this study. Moreover, due to the limitation in performance of some specific diagnostic tests or the mildness of some clinical signs of diseases, there is a possibility that some postoperative complications might be undiagnosed. Therefore, this issue might be considered as a limitation of this study. Also, one of the limitations of our study was lack of some predictors such as sickness at admission scale or acute physiologic score from the APPACHE I and ASA; so we cannot conclude that mortality is due to anesthetic techniques or coexisting diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this clinical investigation demonstrated that general and neuraxial anesthesia have a similar incidence of postoperative complications and mortality in candidates of hip surgery. We believe that because of the less intraoperative hemorrhage, shorter hospital stay, and lower postoperative pain in patients undergoing neuraxial anesthesia for hip surgery, this technique is superior as compared to general anesthesia.</p><p>In a summary, the results suggest that more controlled studies with larger sample size and more precise diagnostic tests, in multiple centers are needed to eliminate the limitations of our study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>SMH collected the data and helped to write the manuscript.
