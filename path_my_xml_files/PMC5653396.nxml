Self&#x02010;beliefs are thought to predict academic success and influence career choices and self&#x02010;efficacy may be a better predictor of performance than actual ability (Pajares &#x00026; Valiante, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). In nursing, scholars are only beginning to discuss the role of writing self&#x02010;efficacy and its relation to student success (Miller, Russell, Cheng, &#x00026; Skarbek, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Mitchell, Harrigan, Stefansson, &#x00026; Setlack, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and more research is required to inform this important educational discussion.</p><p>Writing self&#x02010;efficacy (WSE) can be defined as a writer's belief about their ability to write in a specific context. Bandura's self&#x02010;efficacy theory, emphasizes that context critically influences self&#x02010;efficacy perceptions (Bandura, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Discipline&#x02010;specific writing instruction has been acknowledged as the preferred method for introducing students to nursing's unique discourse through allowing opportunities to practice higher level thinking strategies such as critical analysis. (Andre &#x00026; Graves, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Luthy, Peterson, Lassetter, &#x00026; Callister, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Oermann et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) However, empirical testing of this relationship is lacking likely because so few discipline&#x02010;specific writing courses are offered in nursing curriculums. Andre and Graves (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), who investigated the nature of writing instruction in nursing programmes in Canada, identified that only 6% of programmes included a discipline&#x02010;specific course. Close to half of programmes had no required writing course and the remainder required a generic writing course, an English literature course, or both. Thus, research evidence is required to establish the benefits of discipline&#x02010;specific writing.</p><p>The purpose of the present investigation was to explore, via quasi&#x02010;experimental methods, if WSE improved among first&#x02010;year nursing students in the context of discipline&#x02010;specific writing in one college baccalaureate nursing programme. The relationship between WSE, anxiety and student grades are also explored with respect to various learner characteristics including, past postsecondary educational experience, writing history, English as a second language (ESL) status and online versus classroom instructional environment.</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>BACKGROUND</title><p>Nursing student populations have been the focus of inquiry in two studies: Miller et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), who explored writing in a cohort of post&#x02010;RN students near the end of their programme in a discipline&#x02010;specific environment and Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), who described WSE and anxiety in first&#x02010;year nursing students pre and post a discipline&#x02010;specific writing course. Thus, given the limited research in nursing on discipline&#x02010;specific writing, this literature review will take the approach of an interdisciplinary examination of writing self&#x02010;efficacy as it relates to writing performance assessment, improvement in WSE pre&#x02010; to post intervention or course specific strategy and the relationship between WSE and anxiety.</p><sec id="nop290-sec-0007"><label>2.1</label><title>Writing performance</title><p>WSE's relationship with writing performance has received attention from various researchers as it correlates with or predicts student grades. A variety of writing activities have been used to define writing performance including on&#x02010;demand essays of 30&#x02010;minutes or less (Pajares &#x00026; Johnson, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Shell, Murphy, &#x00026; Bruning, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>; Woody et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), final grades or grade point average (Goodman &#x00026; Cirka, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Martinez, Kock, &#x00026; Cass, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Williams &#x00026; Takaku, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Zimmerman &#x00026; Bandura, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>), computer scored essays (Jones, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), scaffolded writing assignments and/or papers across a term (Miller et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Woodrow, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and complete essays (MacArthur, Philippakos, &#x00026; Graham, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Prat&#x02010;Sala &#x00026; Redford, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Sanders&#x02010;Reio, Alexander, Reio, &#x00026; Newmann, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).</p><p>WSE, using various measurement instruments, has only partially been able to predict writing performance in most studies, usually predicting less than 10% of variance in grades (Prat&#x02010;Sala &#x00026; Redford, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Shell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>), with some studies finding a negligible relationship (Jones, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; MacArthur et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and only one researcher identifying a &#x0201c;powerful effect&#x0201d; in a population of Chinese students learning to write in English (Woodrow, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Differences in findings may be due to inconsistent methods of assessing performance or to the remote proximity of the WSE measurement to the evaluation of the writing outcome (Pajares &#x00026; Johnson, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>).</p><p>The study by Williams and Takaku (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) compared ESL and non&#x02010;ESL students in terms of help seeking and writing performance. These authors found that ESL students scored lower than domestic students at the beginning of their freshman year but eventually outperformed domestic students by the end of their sophomore year. Higher self&#x02010;efficacy predicted writing centre use and writing centre use became the mediator between WSE and the grade the student ultimately achieved.</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0008"><label>2.2</label><title>Writing self&#x02010;efficacy improvement from pre&#x02010; to postwriting course</title><p>Among researchers who assessed change in WSE from pre&#x02010; to postwriting course (Goodman &#x00026; Cirka, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Jones, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; MacArthur et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Miller et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Van de Poel &#x00026; Gasiorek, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Woody et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Xu, Park, &#x00026; Baek, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) all identified a statistically significant improvement in WSE. Given that each of these studies explored different populations using a variety of instructional strategies and different instruments to measure WSE, the consistency of this finding is evidence that WSE can be successfully influenced with positive instruction. Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), providing a course design example, described the role of the instructor in the scaffolding process as including but not limited to anxiety control, simplifying the task demand, providing feedback, ensuring students stay on task and on the specific focus of the assignment, reviewing outlines or drafts of papers and providing models of successful student past writing efforts for current students to follow. Literature describing scaffolding as an instructional model also emphasizes the importance of an instructor &#x0201c;stance&#x0201d; that supports a collaborative instructor&#x02013;student relationship (Benko, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0009"><label>2.3</label><title>The relationship between writing self&#x02010;efficacy and anxiety</title><p>One instructor role in writing instruction would be to normalize and alleviate writing anxiety. Writing anxiety is a common emotional response to writing tasks no matter the experience level of the writer (Zimmerman &#x00026; Bandura, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). Anxiety, assessed using various measures (Martinez et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Woodrow, 2010) and writing apprehension, assessed using Daly and Miller's writing apprehension scale (Goodman &#x00026; Cirka, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Pajares &#x00026; Johnson, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Sanders&#x02010;Reio et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) were the most common methods of assessing the emotional arousal component of self&#x02010;efficacy theory. Pajares and Johnson described writing apprehension as a form of writing anxiety. Correlations between apprehension or anxiety and WSE are consistently negative regardless of measurement tool used (Martinez et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Pajares &#x00026; Johnson, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Sanders&#x02010;Reio et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Through use of statistical modelling, researchers have demonstrated that anxiety's role in influencing academic performance is mediated through self&#x02010;efficacy (Goodman &#x00026; Cirka, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Martinez et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Woodrow, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Evaluation of change in apprehension from pre&#x02010; to post writing course has been inconsistent with some authors identifying a statistically significant improvement in apprehension in pre&#x02010; to post course methods (Goodman &#x00026; Cirka) and others finding that apprehension remains constant even when self&#x02010;efficacy shows improvement (Pajares &#x00026; Johnson).</p></sec></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0010"><label>3</label><title>THE STUDY</title><sec id="nop290-sec-0011"><label>3.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in this study either directly enrolled in the Baccalaureate nursing programme (minimum entry requirement: 60% average in prerequisite courses) or entered through a college preparation programme designed to help mature students update their educational prerequisites.

This timing was chosen to avoid having student's knowledge of grading and feedback as an influencing factor on their internalized perception of their WSE. Students who did not return the post course questionnaire were included as &#x0201c;time&#x02010;control only&#x0201d; participants (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>36). The main analysis was performed on students who completed all three questionnaires, referred to as &#x0201c;full participants&#x0201d; (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>66). Online or classroom course section enrolment was self&#x02010;selected, however, students in the second term groups were given the general advice to choose the online section only if they felt confident with their writing skills. Students in the first term online section were required to have completed course credits in at least two other first term courses as this section was only added to decrease the class size for second term.</p><sec id="nop290-sec-0014"><label>3.3.1</label><title>Scholarly writing course description and environment</title><p>The course was developed using scaffolding strategies (Benko, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Gazza &#x00026; Hunker, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Vanderburg, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>).

The main outcome of the course required students to produce a final academic paper worth 60% of their final grade. The instructor provided three to five topic choices. First term students chose from topics such as binge drinking, victim blaming and energy drinks. The second term groups chose from narcotics addiction in health care workers, immunizations, kids and electronic devices, cyber bullying and healthy relationships.</p></sec></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0015"><label>3.4</label><title>Measures</title><sec id="nop290-sec-0016"><label>3.4.1</label><title>Self&#x02010;efficacy scale for academic writing</title><p>The Self&#x02010;Efficacy Scale for Academic Writing (SESAW) was designed by the first author of this study. The SESAW is a 10&#x02010;item 4&#x02010;point Likert scale with response options ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Scale items are presented in Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Cronbach's alpha for the SESAW was assessed as .82&#x02013;.85 for this study and .85&#x02013;.90 for a previous cohort. Concurrent comparisons with the General Self&#x02010;Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer &#x00026; Jerusalem, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>) were .50 and .53 at pre&#x02010;test and posttest, respectively, in previous use.</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0017"><label>3.4.2</label><title>State&#x02010;trait anxiety inventory</title><p>The STAI is a two&#x02010;part questionnaire measuring anxiety as a stable personality trait (trait anxiety) and as a result of transitory anxiety producing circumstances (state anxiety) (Spielberger, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1983</xref>). The STAI has demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity in nursing and education populations. In college students, the test&#x02010;retest scores for the trait scale are reported to be .73&#x02013;.86 but proved less stable in the state scale ranging from .16&#x02013;.62, which, according to Spielberger, was expected because the state scale should be sensitive to situational factors on a given day.

The 10 questions were formatted as written statements that contained one error, or no errors. Errors in punctuation and spelling were not included. Error types included: use of &#x00026; rather than &#x0201c;and&#x0201d; in an unbracketed APA citation with two authors; two examples where no page number or paragraph number was included with a direct quotation; a then/than grammar error; a sentence fragment; a date separated from its author in citation; two examples involving a word misuse of your/you're or its/it's; and two correct statements. Risk taking was rewarded in the scoring strategy. An unanswered question scored 0, a correct answer scored 2 and an incorrect or partially correct answer scored 1, for a total possible test score of 20. Participants were not informed of the scoring process for this knowledge test.</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0019"><label>3.4.4</label><title>Assessment of writing</title><p>The two course instructors graded the scholarly paper assignments in the first term students.

First, it examines WSE both pre and post a course with efficacy&#x02010;building scaffolded instructional methods and rules out the possibility of a maturation effect during a control time period where no academic writing was required. Second, it compares online and classroom instructional environments. Third, it examines WSE in self&#x02010;identified ESL and non&#x02010;ESL students, which has important implications for the instruction of writing in diverse student groups including international students. Fourth, it contributes valuable information for consideration when establishing admission policies, because nursing students direct out of high school struggle with the academic writing demands required to achieve passing grades.</p><p>As expected, WSE remained stable during the time control period when no writing was required and improved from pre&#x02010; to postcourse in full study participants. In the experimental&#x02010;only group WSE improved but was not statistically significant. Failure to find significance in this latter group may have occurred for two possible reasons. First, the sample size was small with only 30 students in this portion of the analysis. Second, the initial WSE measure on this group was taken without a time control preceding their student experience. This group would have been responding to the first questionnaire, unaware of the nursing writing context and academic rigour of nursing education and this may have contributed to an over inflation of their initial self&#x02010;reported WSE giving little room for statistical improvement. Prat&#x02010;Sala and Redford (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) made a similar observation in their first&#x02010;year psychology cohort. However, given that term one online students ultimately demonstrated a high degree of academic skill achieving the highest course final grades, their high WSE may have been justified.</p><p>Anxiety and WSE were negatively correlated as expected matching the findings of others when using writing apprehension or anxiety as the emotional arousal factor (Martinez et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Pajares &#x00026; Johnson, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Sanders&#x02010;Reio et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Surprisingly, anxiety did not change as a result of participating in the scholarly writing course. This finding is similar to the resilience in writing apprehension observed by Pajares and Johnson (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). In this study, because anxiety was measured with the STAI, the STAI may have not been specific enough to writing anxiety and students may have answered the questions while envisioning their more general academic anxieties.</p><p>The APA/Grammar knowledge test produced some interesting trends in student knowledge of these writing tasks because participants demonstrated improvement of their knowledge during the control period (unexpected) as well as pre&#x02010; to post course (expected). The improvement in scores from the beginning to the end of the control period was unexpected because students were not taking any writing instruction, completing formalized writing assignments, or being asked to apply APA style during the control phase. The noted improvement during the control period is more likely due to scoring the test by rewarding risk taking responses. By the end of their first term of study, students were more likely to guess at questions they were unsure of answers for&#x02014;a trait related to learning effective test taking strategies. In addition, course readings in nursing may have exposed them to the patterns of APA in published textbooks and journals.</p><p>The most concerning but, perhaps, not surprising finding with respect to writing performance was that students who entered the programme without any previous postsecondary experience achieved the lowest writing course and paper grades while reporting similar WSE and anxiety at all measurement periods. Walsh, Prokos, and Bird (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) noted that it is not unusual for inexperienced students to overestimate their capabilities in contexts where writing complexity and the demands of evaluators are unknown. This explanation also rationalizes the failure to find significance between students who self&#x02010;reported extensive past writing experience compared with those with little or remote past writing experience. Those who reported little writing experience likely had overestimated their WSE. Self&#x02010;evaluation is not likely to be accurate when little frame of reference is present for the experience. Context of writing is critical to accurate WSE measurements (Pajares &#x00026; Johnson, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>).</p><sec id="nop290-sec-0029"><label>5.1</label><title>Online writing instruction</title><p>This study provides preliminary evidence that writing can be successfully taught in an online environment to generic baccalaureate nursing students. The online and classroom sections in second term only differed in terms of WSE at T1 with the online group reporting higher WSE. This difference is likely an indication that students heeded advice in section selection to choose the online version of the course only if they felt comfortable with their writing ability. Paradoxically, the second term online group ultimately achieved the lowest average final percent grades in the course indicating there may have been a mismatch between their self&#x02010;reported WSE and their writing ability. An overinflated sense of self&#x02010;efficacy in relation to grades, in some students, has also been observed by other authors (Williams &#x00026; Takaku, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The second term online students may have found themselves weaker in self&#x02010;regulatory skills to independently stay on pace with course materials (e.g. avoidance of the course in face of a heavy second term course load). However, because paper percentage grades did not differ significantly in this group when compared with the other sections, this is an indication that their final grades were lower as a result of poor quality of or failure to submit the other weekly assignments that contributed to their final grade. This pattern may be evidence that the second term online students did not attend to the course materials all that closely without having weekly class attendance to keep them accountable. By contrast, the first term online group had the highest final grades. This pattern may be an indication that student self&#x02010;selection of course section and previous college course credits prior to admission (required for admission to the first term online course) had a greater impact on grades in these online environments than WSE or anxiety levels. Some authors have suggested WSE instruments may be useful tools to guide course placement (Zimmerman &#x00026; Bandura, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>), however, if beginning students are prone to overinflate their sense of WSE, using the tool to place students in sections may not have the desired effect of appropriately grouping students by writing ability when disciplinary requirements and rigour are unknown to the student.</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0030"><label>5.2</label><title>ESL status, WSE and writing performance</title><p>Identifying no differences between self&#x02010;declared ESL students and non&#x02010;ESL student in writing self&#x02010;efficacy, anxiety and grades was an important finding and similar to the results reported in Williams and Takaku (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Nursing instructors must be careful to not assume that ESL students are worse writers than their domestic counterparts, or overly scrutinize their work for errors because they are known ESL students.</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0031"><label>5.3</label><title>Practical implications for teaching writing</title><sec id="nop290-sec-0032"><label>5.3.1</label><title>Scaffolding</title><p>Similar to an earlier study in this population (Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), the results of this study contribute additional knowledge that scaffolding writing assignments in an introductory discipline&#x02010;specific writing course can enhance writing ability and WSE. Miller et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), in the only other published study examining WSE in nursing students, also used a scaffolding method of structuring their writing assignments. Their population was different from this study and from Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) in that they explored nurse&#x02010;to&#x02010;degree students late in their nursing programme. Scaffolding combines two parallel processes: (i) structuring assignments so that they are completed in progressive stages over a term (Walsh et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and, (ii) instructor involvement, where the instructor or the tutor act as the scaffold in the writing process, slowly withdrawing support as writers become more independent (Benko, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Gazza &#x00026; Hunker, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Mackiewicz &#x00026; Thompson, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).</p><p>Leveling assignments within a course and across a curriculum is achieved by increasing the complexity of written assignments. This approach requires the student to progressively demonstrate abilities in Bloom's taxonomy to first, summarize and describe and then synthesize, critically analyze and evaluate topics they are investigating (Gazza &#x00026; Hunker, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). This process of reducing a major writing project into manageable relevant pieces may contribute to students being able to advance their thinking to higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy (Luthy et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In the course described here, this process involved short writing assignments which began with reflection and then requested students summarize one source, followed by two more writing exercises where they were asked to synthesize two and then three sources on the same topic. Scaffolding also occurred in the scholarly paper assignment. The course prescripted a schedule which had students complete the major elements of the assignment in stages, first choosing their topic, searching for supporting research, learning to make notes from their sources and develop an outline and then writing and editing a rough draft in preparation for submission for grading (Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="nop290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0033"><label>5.3.2</label><title>Instructor influence</title><p>While scholars who discuss writing instruction in nursing agree that writing is important to critical thinking skills, reasoning and career trajectories, we agree with Miller et&#x000a0;al.'s (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) conclusion that writing competency in many nursing programmes is assumed rather than taught. But because writing skills develop slowly, a single discipline&#x02010;specific course is not sufficient to develop proficient writers. All instructors who include a writing assignment as an evaluation criterion in a course must consider themselves writing instructors. Instructor involvement includes teaching course content in such a way that it connects the writing assignment to prior learning and future needs (Benko, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).</p><p>The scholarly writing course requires a tremendous number of instructor hours to implement successfully with large classes. Instructors must be comfortable with their knowledge of the writing process and their ability to give advice and feedback to students in a writing process framework for benefits to be observed. Scaffolding in courses is effective for any type of writing assignment but must include the critical elements of ensuring an appropriate challenge, allowing for student choice to increase engagement with writing and providing students with the opportunity to say something of their own, all contained in a caring classroom environment where instructors can show interest in student's writing ideas (Benko, <xref rid="nop290-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0034"><label>5.4</label><title>Study limitations</title><p>While this study successfully demonstrated that a discipline&#x02010;specific scholarly writing course using scaffolding as an instructional method can improve WSE in first year nursing students, the study does have some limitations. First, the original proposal for this study intended to compare this cohort of nursing students to another group of students in the college environment who were required to complete a significant academic writing assignment without the benefit of writing instruction, however, discussions with instructors in other programmes identified that all courses were providing too much writing support to function as a true control. While the time control period enhances confidence that the scholarly writing course positively affected WSE levels, a comparison group would have been an additional strength. Second, the bonus marks for participation were included in an attempt to curb attrition from the study, however, attrition remained high and was concentrated among students who achieved the lowest grades. Thus these results cannot be generalized to students who demonstrate poor writing performance.</p></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0035"><label>5.5</label><title>Areas for future research</title><p>While this study successfully demonstrated that WSE can improve early in a nursing programme when assessed in the context of discipline&#x02010;specific writing, the empirical relationship between WSE and its role in student performance remains tenuous. In part, this is due to the difficulty in consistently assessing and scoring writing performance. The successful measurement of writing performance and detecting improvements in writing performance over time, requires similar writing assessment activities in a given course. For example, in this study, a second three&#x02010;page academic paper would have needed to be assigned early in the study&#x02014;a requirement that would have put tremendous burden on both the students and the course instructors/graders. In addition, requiring a second intensive writing assignment early in a course prior to writing instruction would have likely produced high anxiety and some academically disastrous results for some students. One possible solution would be to explore the changes in drafts of the same assignment over a term.</p><p>This study used a brief grammar and APA test which was not to be considered an assessment of writing performance. It is generally well accepted among writing experts and theorists that good grammar (and application of APA format) does not equate to good writing as it is far too limiting a criterion to be a parallel assessment for performance. It may be argued that using a substitute writing assessment such as an in&#x02010;class essay is also not an adequate assessment of writing performance as it denies the student the opportunity to research, reflect, polish and be creative in their writing approach. These spontaneous essays are not a mirror for the kinds of assignments we require of students with the goal toward improving critical thinking, learning the discourse of a discipline, or creating a synthesis of knowing.</p><p>Miller et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) were likely correct in exploring changes in different sub&#x02010;components of writing performance (e.g. organization, sentence fluency, voice, or ideas), rather than exploring performance in a more global fashion such as grades or GPA, in their search for improvement over time. Williams and Takaku (<xref rid="nop290-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) have suggested that the relationship between WSE and performance is likely mediated by student choices in help seeking for their writing. This study provides support for the idea that past writing experience (and more specifically, previous postsecondary experience) likely has a strong influence on writing performance in the form of grade earned in an assignment or course. But given that both experienced and inexperienced students reported similar WSE levels, this study also provided preliminary evidence that levels of WSE may bear little connection to past experiences of writing as WSE is not a stable construct and will fluctuate according to context, expectations and task requirements. Even expert writers will experience bouts of low self&#x02010;efficacy under conditions of changing expectations, challenging evaluators (sometimes external and sometimes self&#x02010;imposed) and disciplinary circumstances. However, improving writing self&#x02010;efficacy may play a role in shutting down negative self&#x02010;regulatory behaviours that lead to writing avoidance, stop students from writing, prevent them from making career choices that require writing such as advanced degrees, or keep them from writing to advocate for policy changes that may influence the nursing profession as a whole. Intervening in writing self&#x02010;efficacy could be what keeps students and nurses writing. These proposed relationships require further study.</p><p>The exploration of writing self&#x02010;efficacy and how it influences writing performance is a research area in its infancy. It is unlikely that writing self&#x02010;efficacy will dramatically improve performance across a single term as writing development is a lifelong endeavor. The only way writing performance can improve is through ongoing progressively more challenging writing. Currently a long&#x02010;term follow up of the same cohort of students is being conducted examining WSE and anxiety in terms of stability or growth over a curriculum. Help seeking, engagement with instructors, revision practices, response to feedback and progression through the programme will be investigated for their WSE connections. An exploration of the relationship between writing self&#x02010;efficacy and clinical practice success is being included. In addition to this active study, a revision of the WSE questionnaire is required to assess its discipline specific elements. Qualitative research examining the writing experiences of undergraduate nursing students are also necessary for establishing targeted interventions in this population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="nop290-sec-0036"><label>6</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study has demonstrated that discipline&#x02010;specific writing instruction can influence writing self&#x02010;efficacy in first year nursing students. A paucity of research exists in nursing populations to address the &#x0201c;problem&#x0201d; of student writing. Scaffolding as an instructional method is a promising solution to improving student writing but requires intense instructor involvement from instructors who are confident with their own writing and confident assessing the writing of undergraduate students.
