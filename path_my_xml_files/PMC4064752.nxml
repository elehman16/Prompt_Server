Women were divided into two groups. First group of women received a single oral dose of 200mg mifepristone, and after 24 hours, 100ug of intravaginal misoprostol was administered, followed by intravaginal 100&#x000b5;g misoprostol at four hourly intervals if required.

This describes greatness of motherhood. To achieve motherhood women are ready to go through labor pain which is described often as more severe than the pain of angina.</p><p>Scenario is different in intrauterine death cases. As in IUFD journey of labor pain will be fruitless. So, it is of utmost important to search for the method which can reduce hour of pain in labor of IUFD cases, Oral misoprostol administration for labor induction with an IUFD was first described in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1987. Since that time, misoprostol use for obstetrical purposes has grown widely. Repeated dose requirement and side effects such as uterine over activity (hyper stimulation, hyper tonus and tachysystole) and systemic response (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and shivering) always remains issue of concerns. Mifepristone is a steroid compound, which competes with progesterone at the receptor level and is widely used for first and second trimester termination of pregnancy (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Mifepristone, administered before misoprostol, increases the sensitivity of the uterus to prostaglandins and ripens the cervix, thereby allowing lower doses of misoprostol to induce expulsion of the fetus. Aim of my study is to evaluate safety, tolerance and efficacy of combination regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol with conventional use of misoprostol alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This prospective study included a consecutive series of 52 women with IUFD after 28 weeks of gestation attending to Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Neigrihms, India, between January 2008 and June 2011.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) gravid up to fourth, (ii) without previous lower segment cesarean section (LSCS), (iii) not in labor (no regular contractions or unfavorable cervix) and (vi) willing for medical management..</p><p>Exclusion criteria were assigned as abnormal coagulation profile and allergy to prostaglandin.</p><p>Period of gestation was assessed by last menstrual period. The diagnosis of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) was confirmed through an ultrasound by the absence of a fetal heart pulsation. After giving informed consent, first cohort of 26 cases were managed with 100&#x000b5;g of misoprostol inserted in posterior fornix every four hourly (maximum 600&#x000b5;g in 24 hours).</p><p>Subsequently, second cohort of 26 women was managed using following regimen. The women received a single dose of 200mg mifepristone orally, following which a 24-hour-interval was recommended before administration of misoprostol. After 24 hour, 100&#x000b5;g of misoprostol was inserted into the posterior vaginal fornix by a resident doctor. Following administration of the first dose, a further four doses of misoprostol 100&#x000b5;g were given per vaginum every four hourly if required. Although 24 hours was recommended, but misoprostol inserted in 3 cases earlier as mild bleeding started before 24 hours. Subsequent to misoprostol administration, uterine contractions, pulse, blood pressure, temperature and systemic symptoms were monitored hourly. Oxytocin was used for augmentation of labor in active labor if required. Cases having hyperthermia more than 100 degree Fahrenheit were treated with paracetamol. Analgesic as per patient's requirement orally or parentral pentazocine (50 mg) maximum every six hours was administrated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0003"><title>Results</title><p>Obstetrical parameters of both groups were comparable with no significant difference. Patient characteristics and obstetric parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. Efficacy of combined regimen was compared by following parameter. The induction to delivery interval reflects the time interval between first-dose of misoprostol to expulsion of the fetus. Dose of misoprostol required were compared between two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">3</xref>). Induction to delivery interval ranging from 4-14 hours in mifepristone plus misoprostol group was compared to induction to delivery interval ranging from11 -22 hours in misoprostol group.

Induction delivery interval depends on parity and period of gestation, but confounding effect of these can be ruled out as both groups was comparable in these parameters. As clearly evident from the study results that mifepristone and misoprostol combination had shorter induction delivery interval. This is in agreement with study done by Wagaarachchi et al. (2002) and Varynen et al. (2007) (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Dose of misoprostol required was significantly higher in misoprostol group which can be explained on the basis pharmacodynamics of mifepristione as mentioned earlier.</p><p>More cases required analgesia in misoprostol group as compared to combination group which can be directly correlated with length of contraction or duration of labor. Although there is possibility of confounding factor of patient's perception of pain, we decided to give analgesia as per patient's need not as routine protocol.</p><p>Incident rate of retained placenta was 11.5% in misporostol group as compared to 3.8% in combination group. of Incident rate of retained placenta in misoprostol group was in agreement with earlier study St done by De Heus R et al (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Although we preferred to keep all patient admitted in hospital after administration of mifepristone for observation, no adverse event was found. Only in 3 cases mild bleeding started between 18 and 20 hours, so patient could spend this time at home with proper counseling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In intrauterine fetal death case, mifepristone plus misoprostol is an effective regimen to cut short the fruitless journey of labor pain. It is equally safe, easily, tolerable, and more efficacious than conventional regimen of misoprostol alone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>There is no financial support from any institution or company for this study.
