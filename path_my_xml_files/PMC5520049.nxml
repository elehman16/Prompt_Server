Here, using pharmacological fMRI, we show that intranasal insulin (INI) changes the value of food cues through modulation of mesolimbic pathways. Overnight fasted participants rated the palatability of food pictures and attractiveness of non-food items (control) after receiving INI or placebo. We report that INI reduces ratings of food palatability and value signals in mesolimbic regions in individuals with normal insulin sensitivity. Connectivity analyses reveal insulinergic inhibition of forward projections from the ventral tegmentum to the nucleus accumbens. Importantly, the strength of this modulation predicts decrease of palatability ratings, directly linking neural findings to behaviour. In insulin-resistant participants however, we observe reduced food values and aberrant central insulin action. These data demonstrate how central insulin modulates the cross-talk between homeostatic and non-homeostatic feeding systems, suggesting that dysfunctions of these neural interactions may promote metabolic disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>The influence of insulin on food preference and the corresponding underlying neural circuits are unknown in humans. Here, the authors show that increasing insulin changes food preference by modulating mesolimbic neural circuits, and that this pattern is changed in insulin-resistant individuals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In light of the dramatically rising incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), both of which are related to the overeating of highly palatable foods, it is critical to understand the neural control of ingestive behaviour. Metabolic and hedonic feeding is driven by specific homeostatic and non-homeostatic neurocircuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and insulin, which is a key effector hormone of energy balance, signals in both systems. Overeating creates a continuous supply of energy that in turn leads to perpetually elevated circulating levels of insulin and insulin resistance (IR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Thus, investigating how baseline measures of central insulin can change the neural control of food processing in non-homeostatic pathways may substantially enhance our understanding of the neural cross-talk between homeostatic and reward-related feeding systems and how dysfunctions in this cross-talk may promote pathological eating behaviour.</p><p>Findings in rodents indicate that, apart from signalling in hypothalamic neurocircuits regulating energy homeostasis, central insulin mediates non-homeostatic feeding for pleasure by signalling within mesolimbic reward circuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The mesolimbic pathway is thought to critically mediate different aspects of reward processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and insulin receptors are expressed throughout these brain regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Accordingly, direct injections of insulin into the ventral tegmental area (VTA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> impact dopamine (DA) release. For example, direct administration of insulin into the VTA reduces hedonic feeding under sated conditions and depresses somatodendritic DA in the VTA. Insulin-induced depression of somatodendritic DA has been attributed to the upregulation of the number or function of DA transporter in the VTA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Moreover, insulin injection decreases glutamatergic synaptic transmission (long-term depression, LTD) onto VTA DA neurons, which in turn may reduce DA burst activity and subsequent DA release in mesocorticolimbic regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Given strong reciprocal connections between the VTA and the NAc, which encodes the subjective value of rewards<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, insulin-mediated depression of DA activity in the VTA might suppress salience of food through reduced DA release in the NAc. According to this hypothesis, central insulin action has been connected to depressed hedonic feeding, reduced food anticipatory behaviour and lower preference for food cues in animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, even though direct food-related responses in the NAc following VTA modulation have not been recorded and findings are restricted to rodents.</p><p>Over time, overconsumption of energy-dense diets and the associated gain in body weight result in decreased peripheral and central insulin sensitivity, and elevated concentrations of circulating insulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Selective effects of aberrant central insulin action in humans, however, are under debate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and even unstudied when it comes to reward-related networks. Neuroimaging studies in obese individuals have reported conflicting findings, ranging from hyper- to hypoactive neural responses to food stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. One reason for this apparent controversy might be the uncontrolled impact of neuroendocrine signals, such as insulin, on food processing. For example, the frequently discussed reward deficiency theory in obesity is based on observations of decreased striatal signals in obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Such a hypofunction has predominantly been attributed to pre-existing vulnerability in the dopaminergic system as well as to adaptive neuroplasticity following perpetual overeating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The potential role of elevated central insulin levels on the regulation of food processing in hyperinsulinemic humans, however, has not yet been studied. In this context, interesting findings in rodents have demonstrated that exposure to sweetened, high-fat food induces synaptic depression onto DA neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and that insulin-mediated LTD of VTA DA neurons is reduced in hyperinsulinemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>To elucidate the direct impact of central insulin on the preference for food-related cues and VTA-NAc circuits in humans, we combined pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a food/non-food valuation paradigm done by participants who fasted the previous night. We studied participants with normal insulin sensitivity as well as non-diabetic individuals with IR, who are at risk for T2D<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, to investigate central insulin effects under physiological and pathological circumstances. Using a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design, we investigated the effects of central insulin by making use of the intranasal route of insulin administration (INI). INI application in humans has been shown to bypass the blood&#x02013;brain&#x02013;barrier and effectively deliver insulin to the central nervous system (CNS) within 30&#x02009;min after administration in the absence of relevant systemic absorption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This approach allows us to ensure that our findings in individuals with reduced whole-body insulin sensitivity are not confounded by potentially attenuated transport of the hormone across the blood&#x02013;brain&#x02013;barrier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Our findings show that INI specifically reduces preference ratings for food-cues and suppresses food-value signals in the NAc by negatively modulating projections from the VTA in individuals with normal insulin sensitivity. In contrast, insulin-resistant participants (at risk for T2D) show reduced neurobehavioural food valuation at baseline as well as after INI, indicating a critical role of central insulin action in mesolimbic pathways for the processing of food value and salience in the human brain.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Task overview</title><p>After an overnight fast of at least 10&#x02009;h (12.8&#x000b1;1.2&#x02009;h), all participants underwent a 2-day fMRI scanning procedure, separated by at least 1 week (8.7&#x000b1;3.8 days) that was combined with 160&#x02009;IU INI or placebo in a double-blind, randomized crossover design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

We next analysed central insulin effects on food-specific valuation responses (food&#x0003e;non-food) and found a significant group interaction in the NAc (peak left: &#x02212;12, 8, &#x02212;8, <italic>P</italic>=0.014 FWE corrected and peak right: 10, 8, &#x02212;7, <italic>P</italic>=0.046 FWE corrected, <italic>n</italic><sub>NIR</sub>=28, <italic>n</italic><sub>IR</sub>=20, factorial design; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and the left VTA (peak left: &#x02212;4, &#x02212;12, &#x02212;14, <italic>P</italic>=0.042 FWE corrected and peak right: 4, &#x02212;12, &#x02212;14, <italic>P</italic>=.078 FWE corrected; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This indicates that although INI reduced the food-specific valuation signal in NIR individuals in these regions, this signal increased in IR individuals.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dynamic causal modelling</title><p>Building upon these results, we wanted to know whether the observed functional neural changes could be explained by changes in connectivity. Based on recent rodent data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, we were especially interested in whether central insulin modulates forward, backward or both (that is, bidirectional) projections between the VTA and the NAc. To this end, we used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) on adjusted BOLD time series from the VTA and the NAc. As the general linear model (GLM) results were particularly pronounced in the left hemisphere, we initially focused on the left VTA and the left NAc. Results for the right hemisphere were very similar and are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>. Using model selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (see Methods), a full model was defined and inverted for each participant that included all potential modulatory insulin inputs on VTA-NAc connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p><p>Bayesian model reduction identified the model with the best evidence by comparing the evidence for all possible 2,048 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). The winning model included reciprocal positive connections between the VTA and the NAc, as well as negative intrinsic connections of both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). Most importantly, the model also included negative modulation by insulin of the forward projections from the VTA to the NAc but no modulatory effect on backward projections. The model also indicated a negative modulation of the self-connection of both regions by insulin. Using one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, we confirmed that each of the four parameters quantifying (self-)connections was significantly different from zero, which is consistent with the expectation that these two mesolimbic subregions are strongly connected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Similarly, parameters reflecting insulinergic modulation were significantly different from zero (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.007 Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons).</p><p>Next, we tested whether behavioural effects (preference ratings) are mediated by mesolimbic connectivity. Therefore, we tested whether individual modulatory parameters of the winning model are directly associated with food-specific value reduction under insulin ((food&#x02013;non-food)<sub>placebo</sub>&#x02212;(food&#x02013;non-food)<sub>insulin</sub>). This correlational analysis revealed a significant negative association (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.38; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.008, <italic>n</italic>=48, Pearson&#x02019;s correlation), indicating that negative modulation of the forward connection from the VTA to the NAc predicted food-specific value reduction under INI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Behavioural findings did not correlate with pharmacological effects on intrinsic connections (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.33, <italic>n</italic>=48, Pearson&#x02019;s correlation). These results suggest that a decrease in food value was related to a reduced NAc drive from the VTA by stimulation of insulin receptors.</p><p>Finally, we were interested in whether the results from the Bayesian model selection differ between NIR and IR individuals. For that purpose, we re-ran <italic>post-hoc</italic> model selection for the two groups separately. The identified winning model for the NIR group was identical to the selected model across all participants. In the IR group, however, modulation of extrinsic connections by insulin was no longer selected to explain neural activity in mesolimbic ROIs during our task. Nevertheless, intrinsic self-connections of both regions were still negatively modulated by INI in IR individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p><p>For the sake of completeness, we repeated all analyses for the right hemisphere.

In healthy volunteers with normal fasting insulin levels, INI specifically decreases food palatability ratings. Reduced valuation of food palatability is directly associated with decreased food-value signals in the VTA and the NAc. These findings validate and extend work in animal models that demonstrated insulin-mediated depression of DA activity in the VTA paralleled by decreased salience of food stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. For example, insulin injection in rodents induced LTD of excitatory synapses onto VTA DA neurons, most likely attenuating DA release in the mesocorticolimbic DA system and selectively reducing the preference for contextual cues associated with food reinforcement, as measured by conditioned place preference<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Insulin-mediated behavioural changes, as described in these studies, rely on alterations in the subjective valuation of stimuli; this valuation is encoded in striatal subregions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Insulin effects on the cross-talk between midbrain and ventral striatal systems, however, have not yet been studied until now. Here, we demonstrate that INI reduces NAc food-value signals. Moreover, using DCM, we can show that variation in the NAc BOLD signal is mediated by insulinergic modulation of the extrinsic forward connection from the VTA to the NAc. As the positive connection from the VTA to the NAc is inhibited under INI, dopaminergic drivers of NAc value signals probably decrease in the insulin condition. Accordingly, the individual degree of insulinergic inhibition of VTA-NAc connections directly predicts the degree of behavioural food devaluation, following INI across all participants. Recent optogenetic findings identified reward and feeding-specific circuits in which metabolic signals from the lateral hypothalamus disinhibit VTA DA neurons, which then release DA into the NAc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Integrating these results with the aforementioned findings about insulin-mediated depression of excitatory synaptic transmission of VTA DA neurons in rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, our data suggest that the peptide hormone insulin is a critical signal within this circuit in the human brain and suppresses salience response to food cues in the NAc as a consequence of inhibited drives from the VTA.</p><p>The palatability of food is decreased in fed compared to fasted states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Insulin release from the pancreas following food intake and its subsequent action in the CNS appears to be an important modulator of this effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and&#x02014;in healthy individuals&#x02014;might prevent short-term overconsumption of palatable food in environments in which food cues are ever-present. Interestingly, in individuals with normal fasting insulin levels, plasma insulin at baseline predicts food preference scores in the present study. This indicates that even though there is a large gradient between insulin concentrations in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, peripheral insulin is a good proxy for central insulin action under normal conditions.</p><p>Importantly, we also studied a group of non-diabetic, but insulin-resistant, individuals as identified by an established homeostatic model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Insulin transport into the cerebrospinal fluid is thought to be attenuated in individuals with reduced whole-body insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> even though exact mechanisms are unknown and further factors can modulate insulin signalling in the brain (for example, genetic background)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Investigating central insulin action might therefore be confounded by impaired transport of the hormone into the brain in individuals at risk for diabetes. Our approach of INI application overcomes this issue by delivering insulin rapidly along the olfactory nerves directly into the CNS, ensuring that only small amounts reach the systemic circulation and so do not acutely induce hypoglycaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p><p>Our results from the baseline condition show lower food preference ratings in insulin-resistant individuals compared to participants with normal fasting insulin levels. This behavioural finding is mirrored by the specific decrease of food value signals in the NAc. According to the reward deficiency theory of obesity, individuals with lower sensitivity in DA-based reward regions tend to overeat as a means to compensate for decreased activation of these circuits. This theory is based on evidence that blocking DA D2 receptors increases appetite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, findings that obese versus lean humans showed lower DA D2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) and <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-opioid receptor availability in the striatum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and data demonstrating decreased striatal responses to food stimuli in obese individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, recent prospective findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> indicate that repeated overeating itself results in reduced striatal DA signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and reduced food preference<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Our neurobehavioural results converge with these findings by demonstrating specifically reduced responses to food-cues in individuals with IR, who have repeatedly eaten to excess in the past. Intriguingly, mice fed with a sweet high-fat meal demonstrate depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in the VTA similar to effects observed after insulin induction and probably linked to elevated plasma insulin levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. One may speculate that perpetually elevated levels of insulin in our insulin-resistant sample have led to chronically reduced modulation of mesolimbic pathways.</p><p>In contrast to insulin-sensitive individuals, insulin-resistant participants do not demonstrate decreased food value ratings after INI application, which is in accordance with central IR. Interestingly, this finding cannot be explained by body mass, which strengthens the validity of our grouping procedure and demonstrates that IR, but not necessarily obesity, is associated with insulin-induced changes in food valuation.</p><p>In line with behavioural findings, the optimal connectivity model in insulin-resistant individuals&#x02014;but not in individuals with normal insulin levels&#x02014;does not include an inhibitory modulatory input of INI on forward projections from the VTA to the NAc. This is in agreement with findings in a hyperinsulinemic mouse model suggesting that reduced insulin receptor efficacy in hyperinsulinemia reduces the capacity to cause a synaptic depression of VTA DA neurons by exogenous insulin induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Although insulin action in the brain of insulin-resistant participants is different to participants with normal insulin sensitivity, INI application induces some neurobehavioural changes in this group as well. Specifically, signals in the NAc increase and the optimal connectivity model in the IR group reveals a significant negative modulation of intrinsic self-connection by insulin in mesolimbic regions. Interestingly, neural patterns after INI together with observed trends in behaviour suggest that some reward signals tend to return to normal values, that is, those observed in the normal insulin-sensitive group at placebo. Thus, one may speculate that INI in these resistant individuals restores some reward deficits observed at baseline.</p><p>We observe complex group interactions in plasma insulin concentrations following the placebo compared to the insulin session. Although a slight dose-dependent permeation of INI into the circulation has been described before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, differential spill-over effects between groups are unlikely given that no insulin-sensitive transporter/receptor is involved in the potential permeation of insulin into circulation. A more plausible explanation of this finding may be a complex interaction between our food paradigm and endogenous insulin metabolism in the insulin condition. This highly interesting question could be addressed in future studies, for example, by assessing c-peptide-levels after stimulation; this could provide information about endogenous insulin production.</p><p>Our modelling data suggest that the insulin-effects observed in the NAc are driven by insulin-action in the VTA; this extends the findings from animal research on insulin-mediated effects in the VTA to humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, it is important to note that the effects of insulin on the striatum are probably more complex than what we have shown here. This is indicated by previous reports describing how insulin increases DA signalling via cholinergic interneurons in the NAc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, which suggests regionally dependent roles of insulin (but also see<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Non-invasive fMRI data in humans only allow for indirect physiological conclusions and are strongly related to behavioural stimulation. The striking overlap of our behavioural and neural insulin findings with previous animal work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, however, suggests that the underlying mechanisms are similarly comparable.</p><p>Of course, food-related behaviour involves a complex set of processes that include not only the evaluation of food palatability but also consummatory behaviour as well as the propensity to exert effort to obtain food. Interestingly, previous data in mice demonstrate that insulin decreased the salience for food-related cues only and did not mediate motivated behaviour, that is, insulin did not alter the effort exerted to obtain palatable food<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In line with these results, hunger ratings in our study do not specifically change under insulin. Future experiments exploring motivated behaviour in more detail (for example, by using handgrip force as a motivational measure) may be able to further elucidate this aspect. In this context, there is ongoing debate over the precise role of the mesolimbic DA system for food-related reward aspects with more evidence indicating that DA does contribute to the incentive salience and valuation of stimuli but is less involved in the objective hedonic liking (for example, orofacial affective expression) for sensory pleasures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. In our study, we only obtained subjective preferences for food cues and the underlying process most likely reflects the salience and valuation of presented stimuli that typically is encoded in dopaminergic pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and that is an essential component within the reward circuitry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, an insulinergic modulation of the opioidergic pleasure system of the brain is possible given the intricate interconnections between the dopaminergic and opioidergic system in the NAc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Combining objective hedonic liking assessments with opioidergic stimulation and recently established parcellation protocols on high resolution functional connectivity data in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> might help to further disentangle multiple neurochemical modes within different NAc reward mechanisms.</p><p>The neural regulation of feeding behaviour in addition is thought to be modulated by other peptides, including leptin and ghrelin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, as well as by prefrontally mediated self-control, which in turn seems to be sensitive to central insulin action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. It would also be interesting to investigate whether insulin has a more general effect on neurobehavioural responses to other primary reinforcers like sexual stimulation. The present approach offers a solid basis for targeting these aspects in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide data demonstrating that central insulin influences the valuation of food stimuli in humans, a finding that can be explained by the insulinergic modulation of mesolimbic pathways. Moreover, our results in insulin-resistant participants demonstrate the clinical relevance of an intranasal approach for assessing central insulin sensitivity and treating reward dysfunctions in individuals at risk for metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-eight volunteers (20&#x02013;34 years, <italic>M</italic>=25.8, s.d.=3.3; 25 female) participated in the present study after three individuals had been excluded since their fasting blood glucose levels (118, 113 and 122&#x02009;md&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and eating protocols revealed that they did not follow the 10&#x02009;h-fasting instruction.
