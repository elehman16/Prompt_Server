Therefore, we hypothesized that diffusion tensor imaging could be used to evaluate the effect of mild hypothermia on diffuse axonal injury. A total of 102 patients with diffuse axonal injury were randomly divided into two groups: normothermic and mild hypothermic treatment groups. Patient's modified Rankin scale scores 2 months after mild hypothermia were significantly lower than those for the normothermia group. The difference in average fractional anisotropy value for each region of interest before and after mild hypothermia was 1.32-1.36 times higher than the value in the normothermia group.

Currently, diffuse axonal injury is diagnosed by the presence of clinical symptoms and CT performance. However, clinical symptoms and imaging findings are often controversial, and some invasive examinations (such as pathology and intraoperative observations) are not always possible. Thus, a noninvasive, accurate, and objective technique is urgently required for quick and timely assessment of diffuse axonal injury severity and postoperative recovery. Diffusion tensor imaging detects the microstructure of the brain <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in particular, the white matter[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Based on diffusion-weighted imaging techniques, diffusion tensor imaging allows biopsy analysis and images molecular diffusion characteristics of the organ, thus achieving a qualitative and quantitative assessment of anatomy and function associated with white matter fiber bundles[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A previous study showed that changes in fractional anisotropy values obtained by diffusion tensor imaging were positively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale scores in the acute phase, and modified Rankin scale score at discharge, in the internal capsule and corpus callosum after diffuse axonal injury[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, growing evidence has established the diagnostic value of diffusion tensor imaging in traumatic brain injury, including diffuse axonal injury.</p><p>Mild hypothermia (32&#x02013;35&#x000b0;C) is a current focus of treatment of brain injury. Mild hypothermia exerted apparent neuroprotective effects in animal models of diffuse axonal injury[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the clinical efficacy of mild hypothermia is controversial. The majority of clinical studies reported that therapeutic hypothermia improved severe brain injury prognosis[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but this improvement was not observed in other studies[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Currently, there is no accurate, objective, and non-invasive means to verify the effect of mild hypothermia in diffuse axonal injury and its prognosis. In comparison with animal models, the lack of an objective assessment method hinders the assessment of clinical efficacy, and clinical symptom scores often suffer from errors because such symptoms are evaluated by investigators.</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that diffusion tensor imaging could be applied to evaluate mild hypothermia therapy in diffuse axonal injury. The efficacy of mild hypothermia and normothermia therapy in patients with diffuse axonal injury was quantitatively assessed using diffusion tensor imaging and modified Rankin scale scores. The modified Rankin scale scores and fractional anisotropy values were compared to investigate the efficacy of mild hypothermia therapy for treatment of diffuse axonal injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Quantitative analysis of participants</title><p>A total of 102 patients with diffuse axonal injury were randomly and equally divided into mild hypothermia and normothermia groups.

In the fractional anisotropy color image of healthy controls, the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum transitioned from the middle red area to the yellow-green area, and the color was relatively uniform. In the fiber bundle image, nerve fibers in the corpus callosum distributed in an orderly manner, presenting uniform direction and complete structure.

Diffuse axonal injury mainly refers to structural damage to white matter fibers. Thus, we used diffusion tensor imaging to assess the severity and monitor the therapeutic effect of hypothermia in patients with diffuse axonal injury. This was a randomized controlled study concerning the role of diffusion tensor imaging in the diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury. It is worth noting that the experimental data were strictly selected (comparability of baseline data and consistency of lesion severity before treatment) to ensure an objective study.</p><p>The results of this study showed that changes in fractional anisotropy values were consistent with the Glasgow Coma Scale score before treatment and modified Rankin scale score after treatment. Our findings indicate that diffusion tensor imaging can be used to assess injury severity before treatment and the effect of treatment itself.</p><p>In addition, this technique simultaneously provides radiographic evidence, thus assisting the assessment of nerve fibers at lesion locations.</p><p>Accumulating evidence has shown a positive correlation between the changes in fractional anisotropy values and the severity of damage to white matter fiber structure in diffuse axonal injury. As a basis for clinical outcomes, the assessment of white matter fiber structure damage helps to specify the patient's condition, turnover, treatment, and prognosis[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ljungqvist et al.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that changes in fractional anisotropy values were highly associated with Glasgow Coma Scale score and modified Rankin scale score, suggesting a potential indicator of clinical prognosis, and especially in predicting the location of brain injury[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, assessing the severity of injury in patients with diffuse axonal injury should be based on the patient's history, signs, rating scores, and diffusion tensor imaging.</p><p>The modified Rankin scale is mainly used to assess functional disability after treatment[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and higher scores are correlated with lower functional recovery[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, modified Rankin scale scores in the mild hypothermia group were significantly lower than those in the normothermia group, while fractional anisotropy values were significantly higher than those in the normothermia group. These findings indicate that mild hypothermia is more effective than normothermia for treatment of diffuse axonal injury, and is associated with significantly lower disability score and significantly higher fractional anisotropy values after treatment.</p><p>The protective mechanisms of mild hypothermia are likley mediated by a variety of factors, such as delaying energy consumption, promoting glucose use, and reducing cell metabolic rate[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moderate hypothermia (33&#x000b0;C) significantly decreases the oxygen delivery threshold of brain cells[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], thus improving brain cell tolerance to hypoxia and enhancing protection against secondary brain injury. Hypothermia inhibits the action of glutamate and glycine, suppresses calcium ion influx, and antagonizes glutamate excitotoxicity[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, hypothermia reduces free radical generation, regulates oxidative stress, and maintains normal permeability of the blood-brain barrier, thus reducing cerebral edema. Hypothermia also reduces matrix metalloproteinase production and inhibits activity, further enhancing blood-brain barrier permeability and reducing cerebral edema[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>It is known that the prognosis of neurological functioning is highly linked with primary and secondary brain injury within 72 hours[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In animal experiments, the optimal window of opportunity for hypothermia is within 1 hour[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 32&#x02013;34&#x000b0;C is the current optimal temperature range[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, mild hypothermia in this study was scheduled for 72 hours, and initiated as soon as possible after injury, within a temperature range of 32&#x02013;34&#x000b0;C.</p><p>There are some controversies concerning the efficacy of mild hypothermia for brain injury (including diffuse axonal injury). McIntyre et al.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] established the efficacy of hypothermia in a multicenter meta-analysis. However, no significant difference was found between hypothermia and normothermia for treatment of severe brain injury in a multi-center study by Clifton et al.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The results of the current study showed that mild hypothermia significantly reduced modified Rankin scale scores. Diffusion tensor imaging showed that fractional anisotropy values were significantly increased after treatment, lesions were reduced, the structure and integrity of fiber bundles were improved, and these changes were more apparent after mild hypothermia. Thus, our findings are similar to the results of McIntyre et al.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In summary, mild hypothermia protected the brain, restored neurological function, and improved the prognosis of patients with diffuse axonal injury, and can be considered an effective treatment for diffuse axonal injury. DTI can be used to quantitatively assess the severity of diffuse axonal injury. Finally, the difference in average fractional anisotropy value for each region of interest before and after mild hypothermia was 1.32&#x02013;1.36 times higher than the value in the normothermia group.</p><p>Some limitations of the study deserve to be mentioned, such as the lack of a stratified analysis of case characteristics, hypothermia time course, treatment time window, rewarming, and complications.

Two months after mild hypothermia or normothermia therapy, patients were checked by MR scan and diffusion tensor imaging.

Regions of interest for diffusion tensor imaging scanning included the genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum, a 50-mm<sup>2</sup> area in each region of interest was measured by radiologists, to obtain average fractional anisotropy values. To avoid subjective bias, the double-blind objects were patients or their families and physicians who were responsible for the collected data.</p><p>Quantitative outcome measure: The difference in fractional anisotropy values before and after treatment was considered the indicator of efficacy assessment in each group, as previously described[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
