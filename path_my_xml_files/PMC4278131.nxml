They are gaining more importance and becoming acceptable to the public as well as scientific community. [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>As a deep breathing technique, pranayama reduces dead space ventilation and decreases work of breathing. It also refreshes the air throughout the lungs, in contrast with shallow breathing that refreshes the air only at the base of the lungs. [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Regular practice of pranayama improves cardiovascular and respiratory functions, improves autonomic tone toward the parasympathetic system, decreases the effect of stress and strain on the body and improves physical and mental health. [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Pulmonary function parameters (PFT) provide important clinical information to identify and quantify the defects and abnormalities in the functioning of the respiratory system.

[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study, which compared the effect of slow and fast pranayama training on PFT. In view of the above background, this study was planned to study the effect of 12 weeks of slow and fast pranayama training on PFT in young healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted at Puducherry in 2011.

Among these 91 volunteers, 72 were females and the remaining 19 were males.</p><p>The subjects were advised to come at least 2 h after light breakfast and with light clothing. They were instructed to avoid drinking beverages and performing a vigorous exercise 30 min before the recording of parameters. PFT such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), ratio between FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC (FEV<sub>1</sub> /FVC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), and forced expiratory flow<sub>25-75</sub> (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>) were recorded at baseline and after 12 weeks of pranayama training by using the computerized spirometer (Micro laboratory, V1.32, England).Supervised pranayama training (SPG: <italic>Nadisodhana, Pranav</italic> pranayama and <italic>Savitri</italic> pranayama; FPG: <italic>Kapalabhati, Bhastrika</italic> and <italic>Kukkriya</italic> pranayama) was given for 30 min/day, thrice/week for the duration of 12 weeks to SPG and FPG by the certified yoga trainer as per the guidelines of Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi<sup>(<xref ref-type="app" rid="APP1">Appendix</xref>)</sup>.

It consists of three phases: <italic>Purak</italic> (inhalation), <italic>Kumbhak</italic> (retention), and <italic>Rechak</italic> (exhalation) that can be practiced in either slow or fast manner. [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Results of our study demonstrate that there was no significant difference in the baseline values of PFT. Therefore, all the three groups can be considered comparable for this study. Our results indicate that both pranayama practices had beneficial effect on PFT except respiratory pressure parameters, and the effect of fast pranayama was significantly more on FEF<sub>25-75</sub>, which is in the effort dependent area of a flow-volume curve. Our results are in agreement with previous studies who have reported that yogic practices, including pranayama training produce statistically significant improvement in the commonly measured PFT. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A study by Joshi <italic>et al</italic>. has demonstrated that 6 weeks of exclusive pranayama training improves the ventilatory functions in the form of the increase in FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, MVV, and PEFR in healthy subjects. [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Sivakumar <italic>et al</italic>. studied the acute effect of deep breathing (2-10 min) and observed an improvement in the PFT parameters in healthy volunteers. [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Yadav and Das attributed that improvement in the PFT parameters by yogic practices due to increased respiratory muscle strength, clearing of respiratory secretions and using the diaphragmatic and abdominal muscles for filling the respiratory apparatus more efficiently and completely. Furthermore, the improvement in the PFT parameters may be due to rise in thoracic - pulmonary compliances and broncho dilatation by training in <italic>Nadisodhana</italic> pranayama. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Stimulation of pulmonary stretch receptors by inflation of the lung reflexely relaxes smooth muscles of larynx and tracheo bronchial tree. Probably, this modulates the airway caliber and reduces airway resistance. [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Previous investigators demonstrated the effect of pranayama on enhancement of the respiratory muscle efficiency and lung compliance due to reduction in elastic and viscous resistance of lung. [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Furthermore, pranayama acts as stimulus for release of lung surfactant and prostaglandins into alveolar spaces, which increases the lung compliances. [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Significantly higher improvement in PFT parameter (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>) in FPG can be hypothesized to the reason that breathing during fast pranayama requires breath coordination at higher rate and hence, higher rate of respiratory muscle activity. This produces strengthening of the respiratory muscles and therefore, improvement in the effort produced by the subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our results demonstrate that both slow and fast pranayamas are beneficial on most of the tested PFT parameters, and fast pranayama was more effective than slow pranayama. These changes by both pranayama techniques can be attributed to improved autonomic tone toward parasympathodominance resulting in a relaxed state of mind, better subjective well-being and concentration on the task, improved lung ventilation and strength of respiratory muscles.
