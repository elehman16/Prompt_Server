magnetic field therapy. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients who diagnosed with knee
arthritis by a specialist in the rehabilitation department were divided into three groups
using the random allocation method. The control group received 15&#x02005;min general
physiotherapy. For the experimental group 1, non-elastic taping was applied to the medial
side of the knee after general physiotherapy, followed by a 15&#x02005;min magnetic field therapy.
For the experimental group 2, elastic taping was applied to the medial side of the knee
after general physiotherapy, followed by a 15&#x02005;min magnetic field therapy. This study used
visual analog scale to evaluate pain. This study used Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities to evaluate the knee function. [Results] Experimental group 1 and
experimental group 2 showed a significant difference visual analog scale and Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities from the control group. However, no significant
difference was observed between experimental group 1 and experimental group 2.
[Conclusion] Choosing the applicable taping method according to the condition of the
patients and applying it to therapy is necessary to reduce pain and improve the function
of the patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Magnetic field therapy</kwd><kwd>Taping</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis is a disease in which the joint facet is irregularly changed because of
repeated use and damage to the cartilage, which protects the part between joints<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, daily activities seem
unnatural and the resultant friction on the joint facet changes the joint facet and damages
the bone, ligament, tendon, and surrounding tissue, thus further causing inflammation or
pain around the joint. The current therapy strategy is aimed at reducing joint pain,
ameliorating physical impairment, and restricting the progress of joint damage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients with knee osteoarthritis experience frequent pain, and their physical function and
independence in daily life decrease because of pain and stiffness. Moreover, those with knee
osteoarthritis have a short stance phase and exhibit a painful walking pattern<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therapy schemes for patients with knee osteoarthritis include non-invasive therapy (e.g.,
taping application, exercise therapy, and electronic therapy), medicine therapy (e.g.,
painkiller and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), and surgical method (e.g., Total Knee
Replacement)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study that examined the
application of magnetic field therapy to patients with knee osteoarthritis reported
increased visual analogue scale (VAS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC)
scores<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Taping therapy schemes for patients with knee arthritis are divided into non-elastic taping
and Kinesio taping. Non-elastic taping is mainly used to support the appropriate functional
use of the body and increase dynamic stability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kinesio taping uses the principal of increasing proprioceptive
sense, and it is widely used in orthopedics, sports medicine, and nerve root rehabilitation.
A previous study that applied Kinesio taping to patients with knee osteoarthritis based on
the concept of stimulation of the mechanical receptor of the skin reported increased balance
and motor control and decreased VAS<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Another study reported that non-elastic taping increases the activity of the vastus medialis
muscle at the time of standing after sitting among patients with patellofemoral pain
syndrome<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As shown in previous studies, taping is a direct stimulation on the muscles and is used as
an intervention method that activates the muscles and increases joint stability. Most of the
recent studies examining patients with knee arthritis compared the effects of each of
non-elastic taping and elastic taping. Studies examining the effects of applying each taping
after magnetic field therapy are scarce. This study attempts to examine not only the overlap
effects of a magnetic field according to the joint fixing non-elastic taping and the
proprioceptor stimulation elastic taping but also the effects of each taping application
method on pain and function of patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients who visited the hospital after being diagnosed with knee arthritis by a
specialist in the rehabilitation department were divided into three groups using the random
allocation method: 10 in the control group, 10 in the experimental group 1, and 10 in the
experimental group 2. The control group received 15&#x02005;min general physiotherapy using a hot
pack and a 20&#x02005;min Interferential Current Therapy on the medial side of the knee. For the
experimental group 1, non-elastic taping was applied to the medial side of the knee after
general physiotherapy, followed by a 15&#x02005;min magnetic field therapy. For the experimental
group 2, elastic taping was applied to the medial side of the knee after general
physiotherapy, followed by a 15&#x02005;min magnetic field therapy. Intervention was implemented
three times a week for six weeks for 18 sessions in total.</p><p>The inclusion criteria in this study were as follows: patients who can follow the
intervention method according to the researcher&#x02019;s instruction, patients who feel pain around
the knee joint, patients who are capable of walking without an assistive device, patients
without neurological damage, and patients whose Kellgren-Lawrence grade of the knee joint is
greater than level two on the radiograph. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients
older than 80, those who received total knee arthroplasty or joint endoscope in the past one
year, those who performed knee joint strengthening exercise before the implementation of the
intervention, those who had damage or surgery in the lower limb or lower back in the past
one year, those who were diagnosed with rheumatic arthritis, those who had mental disease or
were taking psychotropic medicine, and those who had skin allergic reaction to taping. We
sufficiently explained the purpose and method of this study to all the research subjects
before the experiment. The experiment was implemented after receiving the voluntary consent
of the patients. The participants were provided a written informed consent form in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>This study used VAS to evaluate pain. We scored pain so that it ranges between the maximum
value of 100 and the minimum value of 0 by using VAS, through which the participants in the
experiment directly marked their subjective level of pain. As for the measurement method,
the subjects marked the level of pain that they felt at that time on a straight line and
divided the number by 100 to obtain the pain score. Pain evaluation was conducted before the
magnetic field application and after the six-week magnetic field application.</p><p>This study used WOMAC to evaluate the knee function. WOMAC is a questionnaire that measures
extraordinary diseases, self-control, and physical conditions. It is a clinically important
tool for functional evaluation used for assessing pain, ankylosis, and physical function of
patients with hip arthritis and knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>In this study, non-elastic taping was applied while the subjects were slightly bending
their knee joint. We used the taping application method devised by McConnell. A horizontal
tape on top was attached from the lateral patella toward the medial semitendinosus in the
back by stretching the tape. A V-shaped tape on the bottom was applied from the tibial
tuberosity to the gap between the lateral and medial knee joints. Before applying the
non-elastic taping, we attached protection tape to the knee joint in the same way as the
non-elastic tape to prevent the subjects from contracting skin allergy. The non-elastic tape
was detached right after the magnetic field application.</p><p>In this study, a 5&#x02005;cm-width Kinesio tape was used as the elastic tape, one side of which
was divided into two from the tibial tuberosity point below the knee joint. The uncut side
was attached to the inferior anterior iliac spine, and the other side was slightly attached
above the patella for temporary use. Then, the subjects performed hip joint extension and
maximum knee joint flexion. The side that was divided into two was attached to the tibial
tuberosity along the boundary of the patella. The tape was stretched for 25% tension. The
elastic tape was considered properly attached when the patella was embraced by the two
divided tapes in a straight knee position. I-shape taping was applied to the patella by
stretching for 75% tension.</p><p>Magnetic field therapy was applied to the medial side of the knee. Magnetic field was
applied at a 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;Hz frequency at an intensity of 80 for 30&#x02005;min while the subjects were
lying on one side with a 90&#x000b0; flexion of the hip joint and 90&#x000b0; flexion of the knee joint.</p><p>For the data treatment, this study used the Shapiro-Wilk test for the normality test and
the paired-t test for the within-group significance of pain and function. One-way ANOVA was
implemented to examine the between-group difference of therapy effects, and Least
Significant Difference (LSD) was used as the post-hoc test. The PASW/WIN 18.0 program was
used for statistical treatment, and the statistically significant level was set to
&#x003b1;&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All groups showed a statistically significant within-group change in VAS (p&#x0003c;0.05). A

representative symptoms are pain and functional disorder. Therefore, knee osteoarthritis
therapy should stress on reducing pain and improving function rather than on the process of
arthritis progress. How pain and functional disorder is caused by knee osteoarthritis is a
complicated process<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pain mechanism
due to knee osteoarthritis has been theoretically suggested by some researchers from the
biomechanical aspect. Osteoarthritis usually develops in the joint that mainly receives a
weight load, and the knee and hip joints have the highest frequency of occurrence<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Osteoarthritis causes pain and decreases muscle strength, range of motion of joint, joint
stability, and physical function. It diminishes physical function in daily activities and
quality of life. Moreover, patients with knee osteoarthritis develop painful walking with
decreased duration of the mid-stance phase. Therefore, balance of the body trunk collapses
during walking, thus causing secondary damage. As time passes, abnormal walking puts
excessive stress on the knee. If this accumulates over a long period, arthritis symptoms in
the knee can worsen<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pulsatory magnetic field is a safe and non-invasive method that can be applied for joint
therapy. This method is segregated into two frequency bands: the wireless frequency band,
which acts in the&#x02005;MHz domain that uses a capacitive or inductive combination of energy, and
the low-frequency magnetic field, which acts in the range of 1&#x02005;Hz&#x02013;10 kHz<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The capacitive combination requires the
allocation of a counter electrode that directly touches the skin surface surrounding the
relevant tissue. Conversely, the electrode does not directly touch the skin in the case of
inductive combination. The application of a magnetic field increases the ion penetrability
of the protein channel and causes the initiation of the secondary transfer factor, which
induces biological effects. Therefore, magnetic field therapy accelerates cartilage
protection, anti-inflammatory effects, and bone reformation in degenerative connective
tissue diseases<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The mechanism that takes place in the body when elastic taping is applied is summarized as
follows. First, muscle hypertension decreases, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases
by stimulating the muscle spindles and the golgi tendon organ. Second, weak and delicate
physiological contraction can be induced by the gamma motor reaction due to taping on skin,
following the fusimotor reflex. In a previous study, taping on skin increased muscle
activity and increased joint stability, thus protecting the joint by reducing pressure on
it. Third, taping on skin right on the muscle restricts muscle hypertension by stimulating
the agonist muscles and decreases local pain through neurological and dynamic
stimulation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined the effects of magnetic field therapy after taping therapy on pain and
function of patients with knee osteoarthritis according to the type of taping. According to
the study results, groups that applied non-elastic or elastic taping showed a statistically
significant difference in pain reduction and functional improvement compared with the group
that applied general physiotherapy. However, no difference in therapy effects was observed
according to taping type. Choosing the applicable taping method according to the condition
of the patients and applying it to therapy is necessary to reduce pain and improve the
function of the patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the number of subjects was small and the
application duration of the therapy was short, thus generalizing the results of our study is
difficult. Second, we did not examine the continued effects of the therapy. As we focused
only on the effects on knee osteoarthritis, we also did not explore arthritis in other parts
or other muscular diseases. We expect future studies to investigate the effects of applying
taping on diverse parts of a larger number of research subjects and the overlap effects of
magnetic field over a long period.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>McAlindon</surname><given-names>TE</given-names></name><name><surname>Bannuru</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>OARSI guidelines for the non-surgical management of knee
