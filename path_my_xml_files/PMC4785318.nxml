The number of people living with this condition is set to rise as the UK experiences a rapid ageing of its population. To date, there has been very little research or service development with respect to psychological therapies for this group of people.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A parallel two-arm randomised controlled trial comparing a 14-session, 6-month Recovery-focused Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Older Adults with bipolar disorder (RfCBT-OA) plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU alone. Participants will be recruited in the North-West of England via primary and secondary mental health services and through self-referral. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of RfCBT-OA; therefore, a formal power calculation is not appropriate. It has been estimated that randomising 25 participants per group will be sufficient to be able to reliably determine the primary feasibility outcomes (eg, recruitment and retention rates), in line with recommendations for sample sizes for feasibility/pilot trials. Participants in both arms will complete assessments at baseline and then every 3&#x02005;months, over the 12-month follow-up period. We will gain an estimate of the likely effect size of RfCBT-OA on a range of clinical outcomes and estimate parameters needed to determine the appropriate sample size for a definitive, larger trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RfCBT-OA. Data analysis is discussed further in the Analysis section in the main paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This protocol was approved by the UK National Health Service (NHS) Ethics Committee process (REC ref: 15/NW/0330).

The latest projections indicate that there will be 5&#x000bd; million more older adults in the UK in 20&#x02005;years&#x02019; time, and this number will have nearly doubled to 19 million by 2050.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Consequently the number of older people living with chronic mental health problems is also set to rise substantially, including those with bipolar disorder (BD).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>There is limited research available on the presentation, course and treatment of BD in later life. Reasons cited for this lack of information include the increased mortality of younger individuals with BD, sampling biases in the research studies that are available, changes in the diagnostic criteria over time and differences in research settings where individuals are studied.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Available data indicate that rather than early theory suggestions that BD &#x02018;burns out&#x02019;,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the majority of individuals that experience early onset BD will follow a chronic and relapsing course into older adulthood.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Older adults with BD may face additional challenges such as cognitive impairments<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and a decline in health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> BD in later life is also associated with a high risk of suicide<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and significant service costs. Bartels <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reports that older adults with BD utilise almost four times the total use of mental health services and are four times more likely to be hospitalised and get admitted than older people with unipolar depression.</p><p>Despite this evidence of the importance of BD in older adults, there has been very little research or service development for this group particularly with respect to psychological therapies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) BD guideline<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> recommends that older adults should be offered the same treatment as younger people. However, there are no published studies evaluating psychosocial interventions for older adults with BD,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and a number of reviews have highlighted the relative paucity of knowledge concerning our knowledge in this area.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Although research into psychological therapies for older adults with BD is lacking, there is evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions in adults of working age.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although recovery-informed interventions are now recommended by the UK government,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> much of the available research to date has focused on cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and psychoeducational approaches designed to reduce relapse risk but with little explicit focus on functional outcomes including personal recovery. There is no single definition of &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; in mental health. However, it is based on the principle that it is possible for an individual to gain a meaningful life, while living with a serious mental health problem. Unlike recovery from a physical illness, in mental health, the person may aim for recovery, while still experiencing some of the symptoms of their problem. There is an emphasis on having a set of goals which may focus on re-establishing other areas in a person's life such as their work, relationships or social life.</p><p>A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) study has shown that a recovery-focused CBT intervention (Recovery-focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, RfCBT) for individuals with BD (below 65&#x02005;years) is beneficial in terms of both functional and symptomatic outcomes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The present trial builds on this work and has adapted RfCBT, so that it specifically meets the needs of an older adult population (RfCBT-OA). Details of how these adaptations were achieved can be found in the intervention section.</p><p>We therefore intend to perform a RCT to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RfCBT-OA plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU. However, there are a number of uncertainties that we need to address prior to initiating that trial. Therefore, in this feasibility study, we plan to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the RfCBT-OA intervention and whether a full RCT is feasible. We will evaluate recruitment into the study (both self-referral and clinician referral), consent to participate and participant attrition rates (overall and each study arm separately) during assessment, intervention and follow-up periods and completion of outcome measures. We will also be measuring adherence to the intervention (number of therapy sessions attended, therapy drop out and feedback from qualitative interviews at the end of therapy). This will allow us to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention to the individuals taking part in the study. The trial will also provide initial data on the potential impact of the intervention (compared with current routine care) on a number of clinical outcomes and help to identify the most appropriate primary outcome (eg, perceived recovery, time to relapse and mood symptoms) for a definitive clinical RCT in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This protocol is guided by the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 Guidelines.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The study is registered with the ISRCTN registry: ISRCTN13875321.

The recruitment target has been set at 50 participants in line with recommendations for sample sizes for feasibility/pilot trials<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and to allow for expected attrition rates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010590TB1">table 1</xref>). This number will also allow us to evaluate the other objectives of the trial; to assess the impact of the intervention on each of the outcome measures; to estimate parameter necessary to design a main trial; and will enable estimation of recruitment and retention parameters with sufficient precision. For example, recruiting 50 participants will enable estimation of the percentage attrition to within &#x000b1;10% if attrition is 15% or less and, if the consent rate is 80%, approaching 63 participants and recruiting 50 will enable estimation of the consent rate to within &#x000b1;10%.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015010590TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Feasibility outcomes thresholds</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010590ileq01.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010590ileq02.jpg"/></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Red&#x02014;stop&#x02014;main study not feasible.</p></fn><fn><p>Amber&#x02014;continue but modify protocol&#x02014;feasible with modifications.</p></fn><fn><p>Green&#x02014;continue without modifications&#x02014;feasible as is.</p></fn><fn><p>*Based on the percentage of drop out of older adults (33&#x02013;37%) in comparable studies investigating psychotherapeutic treatment for depression in later life<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;39</xref> psychotherapeutic treatment trials.</p></fn><fn><p>BD, bipolar disorder; RfCBT-OA, Recovery-focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Older Adults with BD.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>

This is a publicly funded national workforce that supports the recruitment of participants to nationally funded research studies. The lead researcher will contact managers in older adult community mental health teams, outpatient clinics, general practitioner (GP) surgeries and primary care mental health teams. They will request to attend any planned team meetings and send the participant information sheet and referral information for distribution within the team. The researcher will follow-up any visits with a phone call and ask the health professional (eg, psychiatrist, GP, care coordinators) to complete the referral information sheet and send it via email or post to the research team. All referrals received will be recorded on a confidential database and participants will then be approached to book a screening interview. The researcher will also visit service user groups (such as Bipolar UK, MIND and Rethink) in the local area. The researcher will take the study self-referral form and ask any interested participants to either complete the form in the group or send it back to the research team by post or email. Any self-referrals received will be recorded on a confidential database. The study will also be advertised through a well-established, confidential volunteering database at the Spectrum Centre which has contact details for over 500 individuals that have either lived experience or an interest in BD as well as through social media such as Facebook and Twitter and in the media. Posters and leaflets will be distributed in both NHS and non-NHS sites to maximise participant access.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Screening, baseline and randomisation</title><p>Once participants have expressed an interest in participating, they will be contacted by a member of the research team to complete a brief screening interview. The screening interview will be conducted over the telephone and will consist of questions targeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> will also be administered. This is a brief self-report screening instrument that identifies individuals likely to have BD. At this stage, all participants will be asked to provide consent for the researcher to contact a nominated healthcare professional to obtain risk-related information (eg, GP, care coordinator). Individuals who meet both the eligibility criteria and screen likely on the MDQ<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> will then be booked in for an initial assessment.</p><p>Assessments will take place at the Spectrum Centre or the participant's home, according to preference. If required, private space for appointments may also be negotiated at willing primary, secondary and/or voluntary organisations. At the initial visit, the study will be described to potential participants in full. The voluntary nature of participation will be emphasised, including the right to withdraw at any time.</p><p>Information collected during the initial assessment will be used to confirm eligibility. Once informed consent is obtained, the baseline assessment will be conducted by the researcher. The MoCA<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> will be used as the first screening tool for eligibility as it is the least time consuming. The MoCA<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> assesses for cognitive impairment via multiple cognitive domains including attention, concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuospatial skills, abstraction, calculation and orientation. If the participant scores 22 or above on the MoCA,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> then the SCID<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> interview will be carried out to confirm a diagnosis of BD. This will also identify whether they have had an episode in the past month, to provide demographic information and assess the number of previous episodes. Individuals who score below 22 on the MoCA<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> or do not meet the research criteria for BD will be thanked for their time and informed that they do not meet the research criteria required to participate. They will be offered the option of joining Spectrum Connect (our participant panel), so that they can find out about future research/activities that may be of greater relevance. If the participant meets criteria and wishes to take part, they will complete the baseline clinical outcome measures that are detailed below.</p><p>After baseline, the participant will be randomly allocated to either RfCBT-OA or TAU using an independent web-based computer-generated randomised procedure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sealedenvelope.com/">http://www.sealedenvelope.com/</ext-link>) to aid allocation concealment. The randomisation process will be set up by Lancashire Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). After randomisation, the researcher will contact the nominated healthcare professional to inform them that the participant is taking part in the study. Intentional unblinding will only be allowed if necessary for patient safety; any unintentional unblinding will be recorded (including reason) and subsequent assessments conducted by another blind researcher. Data entry procedures and storage will be overseen by the CTU. All personal information will be securely stored in line with NHS ethical approval.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The recovery-focused CBT intervention</title><p>The original RfCBT manual was developed from key components of effective CBT interventions which include mood monitoring and awareness, regularisation of routines, enhancing prodromal coping and problem-solving training<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;31</xref> and refined by qualitative research to capture experiences of recovery in BD and through service user focus groups to ensure that the content, focus and delivery of the intervention was in tune with service user recovery priorities. The intervention places emphasis on maintaining a very flexible engagement approach with respect to initial rapport building and consideration of timing, duration and frequency of sessions. It is focused on helping individuals work towards goals that are of personal value to them, whether symptom related or about other areas of their lives such as work or social support. Initially, the client and therapist develop a shared understanding of recovery and how working towards the recovery goals may have a significant impact on the individual's life. The intervention includes a significant formulation component, ensuring that any therapeutic approaches are consistent with the client's current needs.</p><p>Recovery-focused therapy<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> has the following phases:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Introducing the recovery approach to clients;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Collection of information about current and historical mood and functioning;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Meaning and relevance of diagnosis;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identification of recovery-informed therapy goals;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Initial formulation of relationships between mood experiences and progress towards recovery goals;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identification and application of CBT techniques to address and facilitate positive coping;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consideration of wider functioning issues in relation to recovery;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Development and completion of early warning signs (EWS) plan;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Development and completion of recovery plan;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sharing lessons from therapy with key stakeholders.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Although it is likely that most clients will engage with most of these elements, the relative emphasis will depend on the individual goals and formulation of the particular client. An additional chapter has been developed for the manual, so that it specifically meets the needs of an older adult population. This has been achieved by a review of current evidence for adapting psychological interventions for older adults with mental health problems. There has also been extensive consultation (focus groups and one-to-one) with service users with lived experience of BD in later life, their relatives and experts in the field.</p><p>Data from the focus group have identified that individuals living with BD in later life still experience episodes, however to varying degrees. Some find their episodes are more manageable and the symptoms are less intense, some feel that they are worse than when they were younger and are harder to control. Individuals taking part in the focus group felt that therapy in later life should focus on psychoeducation, symptom management and also to consider wider areas of functioning such as achieving meaningful activity. This fits with the flexible, idiosyncratic approach that the recovery-focused therapy offers. The older adults identified additional difficulties in later life such as physical health problems, memory difficulties key themes such as loneliness, losses and changes in role.

The data from the trial will allow us to determine rates of recruitment and retention and identify factors which may help improve these rates if a future trial is feasible. The acceptability of the therapeutic intervention will be assessed by evaluating the therapy attendance rates, drop outs and feedback from the qualitative interviews. We will also be able to gain an estimate of the likely effect size of RfCBT-OA on a range of clinical outcomes. All of these data are essential to inform the design of a large-scale trial. Detailed feasibility outcome thresholds have been set in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010590TB1">table 1</xref>. These will need to be met in order to progress to a further, definitive evaluation trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of RfCBT-OA.</p><p>The original recovery intervention, RfCBT,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> was developed in collaboration partnership with individuals with lived experience of BD. This included service user involvement in qualitative work on recovery experiences and a structure and format of the RfCBT intervention. As highlighted by Jones <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> engaging individuals with personal experience of BD at this level fits with the model of recovery approaches as being empowering, individualised and grounded in the individual's own priorities and needs. The current RfCBT-OA intervention has been further refined by a group of older adults living with BD and experts in the ageing field.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the development of an intervention for a group of people who currently have no evidence-based care. The Department of Health<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> states that older adults with mental health problems should have access to the same range of therapies as those people under the age of 65. This is not the case for people with BD. There are currently no published studies evaluating psychological interventions for older adults with BD and there is a clear need to develop an evidence base for this population.</p><p>The rapid ageing of the population will make significant demands on healthcare services, especially if the current lack of evidence-based treatments continues. The development of a recovery-focused psychological intervention has the potential to improve outcomes for service users, helping them to develop a range of coping strategies and putting them more in control of managing their mental health problems. This would save the NHS money through a reduction in use of mental health services. The intervention also offers a flexibility to work on a range of outcomes. Focus group work with this population has identified that individuals are still experiencing episodes in later life and want the flexibility to work on both symptom management and other areas of their life. The recruitment for the study will take place across primary and secondary mental health services and through self-referral. There is the hope that not restricting recruitment to specialist mental health services will allow a more representative sample.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to the study. First, there is no active treatment control arm, so any indications that the intervention is effective may not be specifically related to the recovery-focused intervention per se. Second, the scale of the study allows a follow-up period of only 6&#x02005;months following therapy. A longer follow-up period might have been more helpful to assess the impact of the intervention and whether individuals would complete assessment measures over a longer time period. However, the primary aim of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention; therefore, the 6-month follow-up window is a first appropriate step to help to assess whether a further, definitive RCT is feasible in the future. Third, as this is the first intervention study for older adults with BD, there are no well-validated measures for this population. The bipolar-related measures have not yet been specifically validated for use with an older adult population. However, the samples for the development papers for the BRQ<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and the QoL.BD<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> included people over the age of 60. Additionally, focus group data indicate that outcomes such as personal recovery and quality of life are still important over the age of 60.</p><p>Despite these limitations, if this intervention is feasible to deliver, it offers a promising step for a group of people that currently does not have access to evidence-based psychological care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Fiona Lobban at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/fionalobban">@fionalobban</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ET, SHJ, FL and CS contributed towards the design of the study.
