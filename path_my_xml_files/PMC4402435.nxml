The aim of our prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of intra-operative CS in this kind of surgery.

After filtrated, centrifugated, washed and concentrated, the recovered blood became autologous blood (autologous RBC) <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, and was then transfused back to the patients immediately. All autologous RBC was transfused back before the end of surgery.

To achieve a 25% (1U) reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusion, based on a two-sided significance level of 5%, we calculated that a sample size of 96 patients (48 in each group) would provide 90% power to detect statistical difference <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p><p>The data are presented as mean (SD) for continuous parametric values, or as numbers with percentage for categorical data. For continuous data, the two-sample two-sided Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum two-sample two-sided test were used. For categorical data, the Chi-square-test and Fisher's exact-test were used. Considering some variables may influence relevant clinical outcomes potentially, the logistic regression model was used to verify the relationship of CS with 7 perioperative impairment of blood coagulative function and postoperative adverse events, including residual heparin, hypocoagulability for low PLT, hypocoagulability for low FIB, hypocoagulability for low clotting factors, excessive bleeding, myocardial infarction and cognitive decline.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective, randomized and controlled trial to evaluate intra-operative CS in this kind of surgery. Among 1.25 million patients undergoing cardiac surgery all over the world each year, a large proportion is with high-bleeding-risk <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Our study has a positive effect on this kind of surgery for reducing the requirement of the allogeneic RBC transfusion, decreasing the incidence of postoperative adverse events associated with anemia and allogeneic RBC transfusion, and reducing the medical costs in developed countries <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>In our study, intra-operative CS decreased the quantity and proportion of allogeneic RBC transfusion, which indicated that CS is effective in high-bleeding-risk cardiac surgery. The mechanism is that this kind of surgery has characteristics including higher risk of impairment of blood coagulation function, higher proportion of reoperation and longer time of CPB, so that the volume of intraoperative blood loss is much larger than low-bleeding-risk cardiac surgery <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>TEG is particularly suitable for the diagnosis of impairment of blood coagulative function in cardiac surgery <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In our study it revealed that CS increased the incidence of perioperative residual heparin and total impairment of blood coagulative function. In addition, the incidence of postoperative excessive bleeding was higher in Group CS. These results indicated that intra-operative CS in high-bleeding-risk cardiac surgery impaired blood coagulative. The main mechanism is that the larger volume of intraoperative blood loss resulting in the larger volume of autologous blood transfusion, and the concentration of heparin in autologous blood was high while the platelet and coagulation factor was deficient. Another mechanism is that the long CPB time aggravates the hyperfibrinolysis <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. However, we also found that CS did not increase the quantity and proportion of the allogeneic FFP and PLT transfusion, not increase the incidence of postoperative resternotomy and total adverse events. These results indicated that although CS could impair blood coagulation function to a certain degree, it was safe in general. The reason is that the impairment of blood coagulative function and postoperative excessive bleeding mainly result from the residual heparin which can be neutralized easily with protamine, while dilutional coagulopathy and hyperfibrinolysis also existed in Group C. The incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction and cognitive decline in Group CS did not decrease, which is inconsistent with George and colleagues' report <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, and the reason may be our relatively small sample size.</p><p>There are few studies that have analyzed the cost-effectiveness of intra-operative CS in cardiac surgery <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Weltert and colleagues reported that it was cost-effective if either of the following two conditions are satisfied: partial patients were with high-bleeding-risk or the quantity of intraoperative blood loss was larger than 800 ml <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, which is inconsistent with ours. In our study, all the patients were with high-bleeding-risk and the quantity of intraoperative blood loss was 1425.6 ml but CS was still not cost-effective. It is the low price of allogeneic RBC in China that the reason is. Because the price in developed countries is 8.9 times as much as that in China (203/22.8), intra-operative CS in high-bleeding-risk cardiac surgery is cost-effective.</p><p>The primary limitation of our study was the evaluation standard of high-bleeding- risk cardiac surgery. Because there is no unified standard until now, the standard we employed may need some improvement. Another limitation was the relatively small sample size. Although it was sufficient for detecting the difference in quantity of allogeneic RBC transfusion between groups, a larger sample size is necessary to detect possible differences in safety.</p><p>In summary, our preliminary data support a proposal that intra-operative CS in high-risk-bleeding cardiac surgery with CPB can reduce the proportion and quantity of perioperative allergenic RBC transfusion without adding the incidence of total postoperative adverse event, while impair the blood coagulation function to a certain degree and increase the incidence of postoperative excessive bleeding. The cost-effectiveness of intra-operative CS in this kind of surgery mainly depends on the price of allogeneic RBC. Thus, intra-operative CS in this kind of surgery is effective, generally safe and cost-effective in developed countries but not cost-effective in China. Future studies should be performed to further evaluate the safety in a larger sample size.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for the study was provided by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LY12H08005).
