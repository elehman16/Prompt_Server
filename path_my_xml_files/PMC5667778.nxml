Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single dose, that is, 4,000 IU, of the test or comparator epoetin alfa. After 4 weeks, all subjects received the alternative formulation. The primary PK parameters, maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>), were calculated with the serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations from blood samples collected for 144 h after dosing. The reticulocyte, hematocrit, hemoglobin and red blood cell counts were measured up to 312 h as PD markers. The primary PD parameters, maximum observed effect (E<sub>max</sub>) and area under the effect curve (AUEC), were obtained from the baseline-corrected reticulocyte count. The serum EPO concentration and the reticulocyte count were used to assess the concentration&#x02013;response relationship. The tolerability and immunogenicity profiles were assessed together.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty-two subjects completed the study. The mean EPO concentration&#x02013;time profiles were comparable between the two formulations. The geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> were 0.908 (0.843&#x02013;0.978) and 1.049 (0.999&#x02013;1.101), respectively, both of which were within the regulatory range of 0.80&#x02013;1.25. Additionally, the PD and tolerability profiles were similar between the two formulations. The time-matched serum EPO concentration and PD markers presented a counterclockwise hysteresis, suggesting a time delay between the measured concentration and the response. Both formulations were well tolerated, and production of anti-drug antibodies was not observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The two epoetin alfa formulations had similar PK, PD and tolerability profiles. Furthermore, both formulations had a similar time-matched serum EPO concentration and erythropoietic response profile. Thus, the two formulations are expected to be used interchangeably in clinical settings.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>epoetin alfa</kwd><kwd>erythropoietin</kwd><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone which has a pivotal role in red blood cell (RBC) production. In adult humans, EPO is mainly produced in the peritubular cells of the kidney and secreted into the systemic circulation. EPO binds to the EPO receptor expressed on the erythroid progenitor cells of the bone marrow, and this binding triggers RBC production.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In patients with chronic kidney disease, EPO production is commonly reduced, which eventually leads to normocytic and normochromic anemia.<xref rid="b2-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> An erythropoiesis stimulating agent, such as recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO), is one of the key medications for chronic kidney disease-related anemia, which reduces the need for blood transfusions and increases the quality of life.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>rHuEPO has been developed by the aid of revolutionary recombinant DNA technology. The first rHuEPO which was approved by the regulatory authorities was epoetin alfa (Epogen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA).<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Epoetin alfa is synthesized in genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells. Epoetin beta follows next, which differs in the glycosylation site.<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> While epoetin alfa and beta have the same amino acid sequence with human EPO, the second-generation rHuEPO, darbepoetin alfa, has a different amino acid sequence and two additional glycosylation sites. Darbepoetin alfa has a longer elimination half-life than that of the previously developed rHuEPO, thereby enabling therapy with an administered dose only once every 1 or 2 weeks.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A number of generic formulations have been developed for the aforementioned rHuEPO, and they are widely prescribed up to the present day.</p><p>Eporon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is another epoetin alfa formulation which is produced from an EPO high-yield Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The safety and effectiveness of Eporon were evaluated in a previously conducted Phase III study in anemic patients with end-stage chronic failure.<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The effectiveness of the drug was defined as having a statistically equal response rate of 90%, while the response was defined as an increase in hemoglobin (HB) by at least 2 g/dL or reaching 10 g/dL. As a result, the safety and effectiveness with a response rate of 87.5% (42/48 patients) were established. Accordingly, Eporon got its marketing approval with an indication for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Eporon is currently being marketed internationally, including in the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Turkey.</p><p>The general pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of epoetin alfa have already been reported in previous studies.<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Subcutaneously injected epoetin alfa has a slow absorption and reaches its peak concentration at 5&#x02013;24 h after dosing.<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The volume of distribution is close to the human plasma volume at 3&#x02013;7 L. Epoetin alfa has a nonlinear clearance at a high dose, while a linear clearance is observed at a lower dose.<xref rid="b11-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Its elimination half-life is prolonged by ~20% in chronic kidney disease patients.<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> On the other hand, the PK properties of Eporon have not been assessed and compared with the original epoetin alfa formulation. In addition, due to the complex nature and heterogeneity of biologic products, the concentration&#x02013;response relationship between formulations may differ. Thus, a pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment is recommended for a similarity assessment of the two biologic products.<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Based on this understanding, this study primarily assessed the PK and PD properties of a single subcutaneous injection of the test epoetin alfa (Eporon) and compared those properties with the properties of the comparator epoetin alfa (Eprex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in healthy male subjects. Furthermore, the concentration&#x02013;response relationships of the two formulations were assessed and compared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, single-dose, two-sequence, crossover study was conducted in healthy Korean volunteers.

Considering an approximate drop-out rate of 20%, the total number of subjects was 42.</p><p>The enrolled subjects were randomly allocated to one of the two sequences and received a single subcutaneous injection of 4,000 IU of either the test drug (Eporon injectable solution in a prefilled syringe [4,000 IU/0.4 mL rHuEPO; Dong-A ST Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea]) or the comparator drug (Eprex injectable solution in a prefilled syringe [4,000 IU/0.4 mL rHuEPO; Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd., Beerse, Belgium]) in the abdomen, according to the allocated sequences with a 28-day washout period: sequence A, given the test drug in period 1 followed by the comparator drug in period 2; sequence B, given the comparator drug in period 1 followed by the test drug in period 2. During the study period, a single iron tablet (Ferroba-U SR tablet<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, dry ferrous sulfate; Bukwang Pharm. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) per day was provided to each subject as a concomitant drug from the day following the drug administration to the last visit of each period to supplement iron. Blood samples for the PK assessment were obtained at predose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 36,48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h postdose. For the PD assessment, the RET count (%), hematocrit (HCT; %), HB (g/L) and RBC count (10<sup>6</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>) were measured at predose and 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 216 and 312 h postdose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Bioanalytical methods</title><p>Serum EPO concentrations were quantified by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Quantikine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> IVD<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ELISA, a human EPO immunoassay kit (R&#x00026;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), was used to measure the serum EPO concentrations. Exogenous EPO from rHuEPO and endogenous EPO were quantified together without distinction. The calibration curve was constructed with calibration standard samples using seven different concentrations (excluding the blank sample). For the quality control, samples of low, medium and high concentration (15.031, 82.531 and 147.531 mIU/mL, respectively) were prepared. Calibration curves of the test and comparator drugs showed linearity within a concentration range of 5.000&#x02013;400.000 mIU/mL (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.99 for both test and comparator). The inter- and intra-assay precision was &#x0003c;5.9% and &#x0003c;3.0%, respectively, for the test and &#x0003c;6.9% and &#x0003c;2.4%, respectively, for the comparator epoetin alfa.

The analyses of the hematologic parameters for PD assessment (RET, HCT, HB and RBC count) were carried out in the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, which is accredited by the College of American Pathologists. The RET count, HCT, HB and RBC count were determined by the flow cytometry method with the Sysmex XE-2100 Hematology Autoanalyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>PK and PD analyses</title><p>The PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis using Phoenix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Version 6.4; Certara, L.P., Princeton, NJ, USA). The maximum observed serum EPO concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the time of C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) were directly obtained from the data. The AUC<sub>last</sub> was calculated by the linear trapezoidal method up to T<sub>max</sub> and by the log trapezoidal method after T<sub>max</sub>. The area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) was obtained with the following formula: AUC<sub>inf</sub> = AUC<sub>last</sub> + C<sub>last</sub>/&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>, where C<sub>last</sub> is the last observed serum EPO concentration and &#x003bb;<sub>z</sub> is an estimated terminal elimination rate constant. The terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was calculated by dividing natural-log 2 by &#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>. The total clearance (CL/F) was calculated with the following formula: CL/F = dose/AUC<sub>last</sub>, where F denotes the bioavailability. The mean residence time (MRT<sub>last</sub>) was calculated by dividing the area under the first moment curve by the AUC<sub>last</sub>.</p><p>The time courses of the RET count, HB, HCT and RBC count were investigated and compared between the test and comparator drugs as PD markers. Among the PD markers, the RET count was considered as the primary PD marker for the erythropoietic response. As PD parameters, maximum effect change (&#x00394;E<sub>max</sub>) and the area under the baseline-adjusted effect curve (&#x00394;AUEC) were calculated by the linear trapezoidal method for the RET count, HB, HCT and RBC count using the baseline-adjusted values. In addition, the time-matched PK/PD data (ie, serum EPO concentration and each PD marker) were visualized on a scatter plot to investigate the time delay between the PK and PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Safety and tolerability analysis</title><p>Safety and tolerability profiles of the drug were assessed with subjects who received at least a single dose of the study drug.

The geometric mean ratio of the test to the comparator with its 90% CI for each PK parameter was calculated.

As a result, the PK and PD profiles and parameters of the test epoetin alfa were similar to those of the comparator epoetin alfa in healthy male subjects.</p><p>EPO is eliminated from the systemic circulation by binding to its receptor in the bone marrow. The binding process has a low capacity and high affinity.<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It has been reported that the PK of epoetin alfa may be affected by the aforementioned binding characteristics showing nonlinear disposition profiles.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Accordingly, a typical nonlinear behavior of elimination was observed for both formulations in this study.

Among the nine PD measurement time points, 12th hour was the only time point for which the RET count, HB, HCT and RBC count were measured in the evening (around 9:00 PM). The circadian rhythm of hematologic parameters could be one possible explanation for these transient decreases. In a previous study, decreased hematologic parameter levels were observed in the evening when compared with those taken in the morning.<xref rid="b26-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Furthermore, the decrement of the hematologic parameter levels in that study was comparable with the results of this study.</p><p>During the study period, subjects were instructed to take a single iron tablet daily, starting 1 day after the dosing until the last visit. Several studies, which have assessed the PD properties of epoetin alfa in healthy volunteers, have also provided daily oral iron supplementation.<xref rid="b27-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Exogenous EPO in healthy volunteers increases the iron demand and eventually depletes the circulating iron, causing a relative iron deficiency state.<xref rid="b30-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For this reason, the iron supplementation provided was expected to prevent a relative iron deficiency state and enable assessment of the net PD changes induced by the exogenous EPO.<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The time-matched serum EPO concentrations and PD marker levels were further assessed and counterclockwise hysteresis was observed for both treatments. A counterclockwise hysteresis implies that there is a time delay between the measured concentration and the PD response. Possible causes of this indirect relationship include the duration of the exogenous EPO moving from systemic circulation to its binding site in the bone marrow and the delayed observation of the response.<xref rid="b31-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> More specifically, for the latter, the maturation of normoblasts into RET takes 5&#x02013;7 days, for which EPO plays a pivotal role.<xref rid="b33-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>In this study, no ADA was developed during the study period for either formulation. It has been reported that ADA formation is rare with subcutaneous injection of epoetin alfa. Despite the low incidence, patients who develop ADAs from exogenous EPO may have a serious AE called pure red-cell aplasia (PRCA).<xref rid="b34-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> PRCA patients become severely anemic with a rapidly decreasing HB level and eventually become dependent on transfusions.<xref rid="b35-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> According to one retrospective study, reported cases of PRCA mostly occurred in hemodialysis patients who received subcutaneous epoetin alfa. Most PRCA cases recovered with the discontinuation of epoetin and immunosuppressive therapy.<xref rid="b36-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Currently, antibody-mediated PRCA has been shown to be related to manufacturing problems, including uncoated rubber stoppers and formulations without human serum albumin. Today, PRCA infrequently occurs in hemodialysis patients who receive epoetin alfa.<xref rid="b35-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b37-dddt-11-3127" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The test epoetin alfa demonstrated similarities with the comparator in terms of the PK and PD profiles. Tolerability, which included immunogenicity profiles, was similar between the two products. The hysteretic relationships between the serum EPO concentration and the erythropoietic response were comparable between the two products. The similarities between the formulations imply that the two epoetin alfa products can be used interchangeably in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-dddt-11-3127"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The time-matched serum EPO concentration and the hematologic parameter levels following a single subcutaneous administration of the test (black circle) or the comparator (gray circle) epoetin alfa.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) Reticulocyte count; (<bold>B</bold>) hemoglobin; (<bold>C</bold>) hematocrit and (<bold>D</bold>) red blood cell count.
