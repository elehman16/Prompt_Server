Both have comparable potency and easy titratability but sevoflurane has lower pungency and results in faster patient recovery. Isoflurane, however, is more affordable. The nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane is undisputed but studies on isoflurane nephrotoxicity are lacking. The objective of this paper is to determine the overall nephrotoxicity profile of sevoflurane and isoflurane in donor nephrectomy patients using the renal function markers &#x02013; nuclear glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, proteinuria, and glucosuria. A randomized comparative study of postoperative renal functions in donor nephrectomy patients who had received either low-flow (&#x0003c; 1 L/min) sevoflurane or isoflurane were analyzed. The renal parameters were repeated 72 hours post anesthesia. Forty-seven subjects (46%) were randomized to receive isoflurane while fifty-five received sevoflurane (54%). Between the two anesthetic groups, there was no significant difference in terms of serum creatinine, total GFR, or nuclear GFR. There was a statistically higher proportion of patients with urine protein-to-creatinine ratios of 0.2 and above in the isoflurane group (64% <italic>vs</italic>. 38%), while more patients in the sevoflurane group had ratios above 0.2 (62% <italic>vs</italic>. 36%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The type of anesthetic agent was not an independent predictor of increasing serum creatinine, total GFR and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and nuclear GFR. In conclusion, the overall nephrotoxicity profile of sevoflurane and isoflurane-treated donor nephrectomy patients is minimal.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sevoflurane</kwd><kwd>isoflurane</kwd><kwd>nephrotoxicity</kwd><kwd>donor nephrectomy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>ntroduction</sc></title><p>There has been widespread use of sevoflurane in clinical practice due to its affordability and unique pharmacokinetic properties. However, its nephrotoxic potential due to compound A (CpA) is concerning.

Other studies utilizing albuminuria, glucosuria, and enzyme markers such as alpha-glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and pi-GST found in tubular injuries failed to predict the presence or absence of renal injury.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>There have been several literatures that looked into the nephrotoxic potential of sevoflurane in patients with renal insufficiency. In a study by Mcgrath et al.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> on the effect of sevoflurane versus isoflurane on renal function in patients with renal insufficiency, they concluded that there was no clinically significant difference in serum creatinine concentrations measured pre- and post-operatively. A similar study done by Nuscheler et al.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> among patients with renal impairment likewise showed no clinically significant change in serum creatinine concentrations.</p><p>In a study done by Higuchi et al.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> on the comparison of low-flow and high-flow sevoflurane with isoflurane, the conclusions expressed that low-flow sevoflurane was associated with mild and transient proteinuria. Furthermore, there were no significant changes noted in BUN, creatinine, or creatinine clearance.</p><p>In a study by Kharasch et al.,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> renal function after long-duration low-flow (&#x0003c; 1 L/min of fresh carrier gas) sevoflurane and isoflurane anesthesia was compared in surgical patients with normal renal function. Results showed that there was no significant difference between anesthetic groups in 24- or 72-hour serum creatinine, BUN, creatinine clearance, or 0- to 24-hour or 48- to 72-hour urinary protein or glucose excretion. Proteinuria and glucosuria were common in both groups. However, there was no correlation between CpA exposure and any renal function measure. There was no evidence of nephrotoxicity observed for low-flow sevoflurane, even at high CpA exposures. Proteinuria and glucosuria were common.</p><p>Tsukamoto et al.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> studied the effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane anesthesia on renal tubular functions in 14 patients with moderately impaired renal function. Results showed that although both the peak plasma inorganic fluoride concentrations and the areas under the curve of plasma inorganic fluoride concentration versus time were significantly greater in the sevoflurane group than in the isoflurane group, urine N-acetyl-&#x003b2;-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and &#x003b2;-2-microglobulin excretions per day did not differ between the two groups. These results proved that sevoflurane and isoflurane have similar effects on the renal tubules in patients with moderately impaired renal function.</p><p>Proteinuria is a hallmark of many renal disorders, and quantification of proteinuria helps the clinician determine if significant renal disease is present, and differentiate between glomerular diseases and tubulo-interstitial diseases. The standard method of measurement of urine protein excretion involves the determination of protein concentration in a timed urine collection. A 24-hour urine collection is typical. This is extremely useful in the clinical setting because it provides enough information to assess the degree of proteinuria and determine if heavy (nephrotic range) proteinuria is present. A ratio of &#x0003c; 0.1 is normal (protein and creatinine are in mg/dL). In general, a protein-to-creatinine ratio &#x0003e; 2.5 suggests the presence of nephrotic range proteinuria. Therefore, the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is used to estimate the degree of proteinuria. Because the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is fully quantitative, it can be used to monitor therapy. In fact, recent studies have shown that persistently high ratios are significantly correlated to poor prognoses.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Conzen et al.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> assessed 116 patients with renal insufficiency who had a stable preoperative serum creatinine concentration 1.5 mg/dL or greater. Renal function (serum creatinine and BUN, urine protein and glucose, creatinine clearance) was measured preoperatively and 24 and 72 hours after induction. Results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in measured parameters of renal function after low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia compared with isoflurane.</p><p>An unpublished meta-analysis done by Bautista<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> on sevoflurane and renal function included a total of 6 relevant clinical trials qualified for critical appraisal. A total pool of 873 patients was acquired with ages ranging from 19 to 67 (mean of 56 &#x000b1; 3) years, with 557 males and 316 females, without co-existing hepato-renal dysfunction and underwent elective surgery ranging from 2.5 hours to 5 hours. Low-flow sevoflurane and low-flow isoflurane were the main comparisons although two studies included a high-flow arm. All studies were comparable in terms of patient profile and techniques of anesthesia administration, anesthesia time, and duration of surgery. All individual studies had values of creatinine within normal range at 24, 48 and 72 hours for both groups. Using a random-effects model, no significant difference in the standard mean difference for creatinine values was noted between sevoflurane and isoflurane at 24 and 72 hours post-anesthesia. Likewise, BUN did not vary significantly between the two arms for 24 and 72 hours.</p><p>The utilization of nuclear glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has not been described in literature as a potential tool to assess renal impairment in patient who had sevoflurane. GFR is defined as the rate (volume per unit of time) at which ultra-filtrate is formed by the glomerulus. It is a direct measure of renal function and is related to the severity of the structural abnormalities in chronic renal disease.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> GFR is conventionally corrected for body surface area, and the normal value is approximately 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. A normal range can be derived to assess renal impairment when corrected for body surface area. The normal corrected GFR is 80&#x02013;120 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Impaired renal function is defined as GFR of 30&#x02013;80 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Corrected GFR is 8% lower in women than in men, and declines with age.</p><p>This study aimed to use nuclear GFR, serum creatinine, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, glucosuria, and albuminuria as parameters in measuring and comparing renal dysfunction caused by sevoflurane and isoflurane in donor nephrectomy patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>ubjects and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was designed as a randomized controlled comparative evaluation of post-operative renal functions of patients who underwent donor nephrectomy and received low flow (&#x02264;1 L flow) sevoflurane and isoflurane.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study participants</title><p>Approval from the National Kidney and Transplant Institute Ethics Committee in Manila, Philippines was secured and written informed consent was taken prior to the enrollment in the study.</p><p>Patients who came for elective donor nephrectomy were recruited.

In this study, we compared the renal responses of donor nephrectomy patients who used either low-flow sevoflurane or isoflurane, and found no compelling difference in nephrotoxic potential between sevoflurane and isoflurane.</p><p>The nephrotoxic potential of sevoflurane is attributed to the formation of CpA.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Making the most of exposure to CpA is done by limiting fresh gas flow to &#x02264; 1 L/min. The lower flows minimize CpA removal from the breathing circuit mandating more CO<sub>2</sub> to be removed by the circuit's absorber system.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This exothermic reaction can increase the temperature of the absorber and result in higher CpA production. The production of CpA increases 2.5-fold when the temperature is increased from 26&#x000b0;C to 46&#x000b0;C.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> CpA production is also directly proportional to the concentration of sevoflurane.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The concentration of sevoflurane used was noted to be at 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.32%. The amount of time spent at low-flow anesthesia has the effect of increasing CpA concentrations for the first 2 hours, after which the level plateaus. In this study, the mean duration of exposure to sevoflurane was 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.76 MAC hours. Frink et al.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> measured a decrease in the production of CpA after 2 hours and a fall in CpA levels after 4 hours, hence the reason the authors did not measure CpA levels in the study.</p><p>Nuclear GFR was used as one of the parameters for renal function. It was found to have 93% sensitivity and 94% specificity in detecting renal impairment.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The fall in total GFR post-operatively can be explained by the impact of unilateral nephrectomy. On the other hand, comparison of the remaining kidney with its preoperative value showed an increase in GFR. This validates the findings that the mean renal volume of the remaining kidney is increased by roughly 15% compared to the preoperative values.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This could be explained by cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia mainly of the proximal convoluted tubules. This concept is supported by the study using lithium clearance for the assessment of salt and water reabsorption by proximal tubules.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It was concluded that the ability of the tubules to increase reabsorptive power represents compensatory hypertrophy of the nephrons. Likewise, the secretory capacity of the proximal tubules had increased up to 75% of the preoperative levels 6 months after unilateral nephrectomy in human kidney donors.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Still, comparison between the sevoflurane and isoflurane group showed no statistical difference hence the aforementioned results are innate effects of the surgery itself and not due to the inhalational agents given.</p><p>Because of their availability in clinical chemistry laboratories and ease of measurement, BUN and creatinine have been widely used as routine markers to depict abnormalities in renal function. However, in the study by Isles and Peterson,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> BUN has been shown to be less reliable a marker and results have been shown to correlate with other variables aside from renal function in comparison with creatinine. Thus, it is for the aforementioned reason why our analysis only included creatinine. Clinical renal function scales/scores utilize creatinine level change to diagnose renal failure and injury. Though there was an increase in the post-operative value which may be attributed as impact of unilateral nephrectomy on the renal function and volume of the remaining kidney<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>; results have shown that exposure to both sevoflurane and isoflurane showed no significant difference in serum creatinine post-operatively upon exposure to both inhalational anesthetics. This finding validated the effect on creatinine from previous studies.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In rats, proteinuria and glucosuria are more sensitive indicators of CpA related nephrotoxicity than of BUN and creatinine.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Hence, the incidence of proteinuria and glucosuria upon exposure to low flow sevoflurane and low flow isoflurane has been included in this study. Proteinuria suggests glomerular injury whereas glucosuria is indicative of proximal tubular injury. Previous studies that have demonstrated transient appearances of these two may be suggestive of a probable renal injury.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, this study showed absence of proteinuria and glucosuria in patients exposed to both sevoflurane and isoflurane.</p><p>Protein-to-creatinine ratio was also utilized in this study to monitor renal impairment. This examination correlates with glomerular function and predicts progression of renal diseases. This parameter is easier to perform, inexpensive, and less time consuming for the patient. This may be of major relevance when large populations must be screened for urinary proteins or when patients are expected to provide urine samples imprecisely collected, or both.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In this study, the post-exposure protein-to-creatinine ratio did not increase to an alarming level. Long term follow-up is advised.</p><p>There are a gamut of factors associated with surgery and anesthesia that have been pointed out as culprits in the development of renal impairment.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Antibiotics, surgical stress, preexisting renal disease, intraoperative blood pressure, site of surgery, and choice of anesthetics to name a few of implicated factors. Ebert et. al.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> however, concluded that the clinical use of approximately 1 MAC sevoflurane in a FGF of only 1 L/min for procedures ranging from 3 to 10 hours did not have clinically significant adverse effects on renal function. Likewise proteinuria, albuminuria, and glucosuria levels were similar after operations with sevoflurane and the comparator group. There were no associations between intraoperative blood pressure, length of surgery, or anesthetic concentration and abnormal renal findings. These data indicate that probable non-anesthetic factors are primary determinants of renal impairment.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of our study show that sevoflurane and isoflurane has no overall difference in effect on the renal functions of donor nephrectomy patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Although, the above studies showed the relatively safe effects of the two anesthetic agents immediately post-anesthetic exposure, serial monitoring in terms of the serum creatinine, total GFR, nuclear GFR, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratios, urine albumin and glucose must be assessed several hours post-operatively. The anticipated nephrotoxic potential of these agents must be taken into consideration for kidney donors who undergo pre-operative evaluation and must be exhaustively assessed, including a carefully analyzed nuclear GFR for each kidney. Although no major changes in renal functions were reported between the two inhalational anesthetic agent groups in this study, we need to mention that our study assessed the short-term renal outcomes only.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to Ernesto Castillo and Jaime Velasquez from Department of Anesthesiology, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, Quezon City, Philippines, and Ozan Akca from Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of Louisville Louisville, KY, USA</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest</bold></p><p>There are no conflicts of interest for all authors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Plagiarism check</bold></p><p>This paper was screened twice using CrossCheck to verify originality before publication.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Peer review</bold></p><p>This paper was double-blinded and stringently reviewed by international expert reviewers.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>eferences</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Conzen</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name><name><surname>Kharasch</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name><name><surname>Czerner</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Low-flow sevoflurane compared with low-flow isoflurane anesthesia in patients with stable renal insufficiency</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2002</year><volume>97</volume><fpage>578</fpage><lpage>584</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12218523</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morio</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujii</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Satoh</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Reaction of sevoflurane and its degradation products with soda lime.
