                2007, states that &#x0201c;the oral intake of solids during labour increases maternal
                complications,&#x0201d; and that &#x0201c;solid foods should be avoided in labouring patients.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> It also recommends that &#x0201c;the oral intake of
                modest amounts of clear liquids (e.g. water, clear tea, black coffee, and sports
                drink) may be allowed for uncomplicated labouring patients.&#x0201d; The policy of fasting
                during labour was adopted after Mendelson published his now classic description of
                acid pulmonary aspiration in 1946.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
                Pulmonary aspiration in obstetrics has declined dramatically in recent years,
                probably as a result of the increased use of regional anaesthesia for operative
                deliveries, the perioperative use of H<sub>2</sub> antagonists and proton pump
                inhibitors, and widespread improvements in the training of obstetric
                    anaesthetists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Consequently, in some countries, the
                policy of routine fasting for all parturients has been challenged.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Relaxation of the rule has been more
                prevalent in Europe than in the United States. In the Netherlands 79% of clinicians
                allow food intake in labour,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> and among
                351 birth units in the United Kingdom 32% allowed food and drink.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Although it has not been formally evaluated,
                many clinicians have observed that women request food in labour. In contrast, in the
                United States oral intake during labour is limited primarily to clear liquids.</p><p>To date five randomised controlled trials, in fewer than 1000 women, have evaluated

                another showed an almost threefold increase in the rate of caesarean delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> These, however, had limited power to
                detect clinically important differences or show the clinical equivalence of
                treatments.</p><p>The current rationale for women fasting during labour is to protect them from
                pulmonary aspiration should general anaesthesia be needed for an emergency operative
                delivery. However, prolonged fasting in labour has never been proved to influence
                the incidence of pulmonary aspiration, and some clinicians and midwives consider
                that preventing food intake can be detrimental to the mother, her baby, and the
                progress of labour.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>

                labour on the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery. Other outcomes measured included
                duration of labour, incidence of vomiting, and neonatal outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We did the trial at Guy&#x02019;s and St Thomas&#x02019; Hospital in London between June 2001 and
                April 2006. </p><sec><title>Selection of patients</title><p>Women were informed of the study during the second or third trimesters of
                    pregnancy. This was to ensure previous knowledge and understanding of the aims
                    of the study before women gave written consent later in the delivery suite. We
                    invited women to participate if they were over 18 years of age, were
                    nulliparous, were more than 36 weeks&#x02019; gestation, did not have diabetes, had a
                    singleton cephalic presenting fetus, and were in labour with a cervical
                    dilatation of less than 6 cm. We included women having induction or augmentation
                    of labour. We did not recruit multiparous women, given their potentially quicker
                    labours and low operative delivery rates&#x02014;that is, less exposure to the
                    intervention and low prevalence of the primary outcome measure.</p><p>We excluded women who had a known obstetric or medical complication that could
                    have increased the likelihood of an operative delivery, were in severe pain,
                    intended to use parenteral opioids for analgesia during labour, or were unable
                    to understand English (and no interpreter was available).</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>After women gave informed, written consent, the attending midwife randomised them
                    either into the &#x0201c;eating&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;water only&#x0201d; group. Entry of a woman&#x02019;s initials,
                    hospital number, and date of birth on to a dedicated computer on the labour ward
                    automatically generated the allocation group together with a study number, which
                    was then recorded on the outcome sheet. These data could, if necessary, be
                    verified against the computer randomisation at a later time.</p></sec><sec><title>Dietary advice</title><p>After randomisation, women in the eating group were advised to consume a low fat,
                    low residue diet at will during their labour. The emphasis was on small regular
                    amounts of food rather than eating set regular meals. Suggested foods included
                    bread, biscuits, vegetables, fruits, low fat yoghurt, soup, isotonic drinks, and
                    fruit juice. All women had free access to water. Women in the water only group
                    were advised to have ice chips and water only. Women were told that eating was
                    not recommended in labour (as was the policy in the hospital at the time), but
                    they were actively encouraged to do so if randomised to the feeding arm. Women
                    were made aware that this is increasingly practised in many units. Women in the
                    water only group were encouraged not to eat if they requested to do so. Light
                    food was made available on the labour ward, or women could bring in their own
                    food.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>The attending midwife was responsible for entering outcome data on to a data
                    sheet. Age, ethnicity, food intake for six hours before labour and during
                    labour, the incidence of vomiting (once and more than once), and the indication
                    for intravenous fluids were recorded. Obstetric outcomes included the mode of
                    delivery (primary outcome), the duration of labour, and use of intravenous
                    oxytocin for the augmentation of labour. We categorised food intake in the six
                    hours before labour as no intake, snacks, a light meal, or a large meal. We
                    categorised food intake during labour as no intake, water only, or calorific
                    drinks/solids. The exact food consumed was at each woman&#x02019;s discretion. The trial
                    coordinator was responsible for training midwives on the study protocol and
                    adherence to the protocol and for the daily collection of data sheets. All data
                    were then entered on to a Microsoft Excel 2000 spreadsheet.</p></sec><sec><title>Obstetric management</title><p>The attending obstetricians and midwives made all the relevant decisions about
                    the woman&#x02019;s obstetric management but obviously could not be blinded to trial
                    allocation. The people deciding on obstetric interventions were generally
                    unaware of the trial intervention allocation and had no vested interest in the
                    study. Vaginal dilatation was assessed at four hourly intervals. Continuous
                    external fetal heart rate monitoring and tocodynamometry were used as indicated.
                    Oxytocin infusion, when indicated, was administered according to the hospital
                    protocol. No routine antacid was administered. The decision to proceed to an
                    operative delivery was made by the duty obstetrician. The attending midwife
                    recorded the Apgar scores at delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Analgesia during labour</title><p>The women had access to a birthing pool for both labour and delivery. They could
                    also choose 50:50 nitrous oxide and oxygen (Entonox) or epidural analgesia. A
                    low dose local anaesthetic and opioid solution (bupivacaine 0.1% with fentanyl 2
                    &#x003bc;g/ml) was used for epidural analgesia. Analgesia was initially achieved with
                    10-15 ml of this solution and maintained with the same solution through a
                    patient controlled epidural analgesia system. This system was maintained by
                    using a bolus dose of 9.9 ml with a lockout time of 20 minutes. The maximum dose
                    of the local anaesthetic and opioid solution was 30 ml/hour.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery, and the
                    secondary outcome was the duration of labour. We defined duration of labour as
                    the time from the onset of the active phase of first stage until the end of the
                    second stage of labour, when the baby was delivered. For women who presented on
                    the labour ward after the establishment of active labour, the duration was
                    recorded as the time from admission until the end of the second stage of labour.
                    We considered the duration of labour to be zero in those women who had a
                    caesarean delivery before the establishment of the active phase of labour. The
                    instrumental delivery rate, the caesarean delivery rate, and the need for
                    augmentation of labour were also recorded.</p><p><italic>Neonatal outcome</italic>&#x02014;One minute and five minute Apgar scores were
                    recorded, as was the fetal weight. The need for admission to the neonatal
                    intensive care unit or special care baby unit was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We determined that 1126 women would give 90% power to detect a clinically
                    important difference in the spontaneous vaginal delivery rate of 6.7% (60%
                        <italic>v</italic> 66.7%; risk ratio 1.11). The clinicians involved in the
                    trial, after discussion of the relevant issues, agreed that evidence of a
                    difference of 6.7% would be clinically important, having the potential to affect
                    clinical practice. Assuming that duration of labour is normally distributed and
                    using a mean duration from a similar but unpublished study of 297 women,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> we calculated that 1212 participants
                    would be needed for a 10% change in the duration of labour. In setting the
                    clinically important differences, we made allowance for a possible substantial
                    non-compliance rate. We did the analysis according to the intention to treat
                    principle, making comparisons between groups as randomised. Results are
                    presented as estimates with 95% confidence intervals, to facilitate
                    determination of clinical equivalence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> We analysed data by using Excel 2000, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>
                    test, and Stata version 9. As we found that duration of labour had a strongly
                    skewed distribution, we used log transformations, and results are reported as
                    geometric means and as ratios of geometric means.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We randomised 2443 nulliparous women to this trial, of whom 17 were excluded from the
                final analysis. The figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/> shows the reasons for
                exclusion. Of the 2426 participants included in the analysis, 1219 were in the
                eating group and 1207 were in the water only group. In view of the round the clock
                recruitment, we were unable to ensure accurate data on the number of women
                approached and their reasons for declining. Women were not approached when midwives
                were untrained in the study protocol. Women generally refused if they definitely
                wanted to eat. During the study period 12 918 nulliparous women laboured with
                singleton babies with cephalic presentation, although not all these women were
                eligible if in advanced labour (&#x0003e;5 cm dilatation). The two randomised groups
                were comparable with respect to age, ethnic group, pre-labour food intake, need for
                intravenous fluids, and use of prostaglandin and oxytocin. The birth weights of the
                neonates were similar in both groups (table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"/>).

                was related only to choking on solid food. In the light of this and the absence of
                evidence to the contrary, women who wish to eat should be discouraged from solid
                food. However, given the current extremely low incidence of pulmonary aspiration in
                the obstetric population, some clinicians may decide, in low risk labouring women,
                that the consumption of a light diet could be left to the woman&#x02019;s discretion.</p><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This randomised controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether the policy of
                    fasting during labour is justified in modern obstetric practice. We found that
                    eating during labour did not influence neonatal or obstetric outcomes, including
                    the rates of spontaneous and operative delivery and the duration of labour. This
                    trial was unable to show evidence of harm as it was not powered to do so given
                    the low prevalence of aspiration, and this question of harm is unlikely to be
                    answered in clinical trials because of the extremely low incidence of acid
                    pulmonary aspiration. The biggest evidence for safety is probably related to the
                    lack of aspiration related morbidity in recent years,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> in spite of an increasing trend to feeding in labour
                    over the past decades.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>

                    anaesthesia, thereby avoiding intubation, rather then fasting regimens that is
                    likely to have reduced mortality from aspiration. Although the National
                    Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended, on the basis of
                    consensus opinion, that women in normal labour may eat/drink in labour, our
                    trial shows that this will not improve their obstetric and neonatal outcomes.</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style3"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>The practice of fasting women during labour was intended to
