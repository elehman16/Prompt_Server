Depression is a major risk for poor adherence <xref rid="pone.0059139-DiMatteo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and, if depression interventions, can also produce improvements in adherence this may translate into benefits in comorbid physical health disorder management. Globally, health systems are trying to identify interventions that can deliver improvements in depression at low cost in people with these comorbid conditions. Internet interventions (e-health) may be well suited to this purpose since they have been shown to deliver efficacious psychological intervention programmes <xref rid="pone.0059139-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> for depression on a large scale in a cost effective manner. <xref rid="pone.0059139-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> They are also able to overcome geographical access and human resources issues involved in face to face therapy, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and do not require the prescription and regulatory monitoring requirements of medication. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) defines such approaches as &#x0201c;low-intensity psychosocial interventions&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0059139-National1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and sees them as part of a stepped care approach to improving current &#x0201c;suboptimal&#x0201d; treatment of depression comorbid with a chronic physical health problem. <xref rid="pone.0059139-National1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> These clinical guidelines recommend that &#x0201c;for persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression and a chronic physical health problem, ehealth interventions, in the form of computerised (or internet) cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) be used.&#x0201d; This recommendation was made on the basis of extrapolation from the iCBT literature in general: <xref rid="pone.0059139-National1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, however there is no evidence to directly support this recommendation in people with depression and physical health comorbidity. There are potential feasibility issues in that people with chronic physical conditions are typically older and thus less likely to be computer literate or comfortable using computers for health interventions. Only one randomised controlled trial <xref rid="pone.0059139-Spek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Spek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> has examined the efficacy of iCBT with adults over 50 years of age. It yielded promising results in group experiencing subclinical levels of depression, with an effect size comparable to group CBT treatment. No mention of comorbidity was made, although serious physical illness was an exclusion criterion.</p><p>We conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a freely accessible iCBT programme (<italic>E-couch</italic>) on depressive symptoms in people with at least mild to moderate depressive and elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or CVD risk factors. The secondary aim was to determine the effectiveness of the same intervention on adherence to treatment for cardiovascular disease and lifestyle advice.

The majority of the participants had existing, treated cardiovascular disease, and more than half another chronic physical problem, with no differential treatment effects between those with or without treated CVD. While the effects are modest in size, the intervention has the potential to be applied as a low intensity psychosocial intervention to large numbers of people. In the UK for instance current NICE guidelines for people with comorbid depression and physical health problems <xref rid="pone.0059139-National1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> recommend iCBT for this purpose by extrapolation from trials in younger people or people in whom health problems are not a key feature. Although by no means a panacea, <italic>E-couch</italic> is freely available and this trial provides the first evidence to confirm the effectiveness of such an approach, supporting these guidelines.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study</title><p>The trial recruited participants from a large health survey who, despite the majority having physical disease, may have health behaviours systematically different to that in the general population. <xref rid="pone.0059139-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, although in this trial no self-sampling bias with respect to outcome could be demonstrated. <xref rid="pone.0059139-Donkin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>The inclusion definitions were based entirely upon self report which could have led to some misclassification but some aspects of the 45 and Up study self report data have been validated <xref rid="pone.0059139-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However there was no differential effect on those being treated for CVD (where self report may be more reliable) and those with only a higher risk profile which makes our results more generalisable. Any end point completion rate was moderately differential for the primary outcome (93% for iCBT and 99% for control) and a lower post test completion rate in the intervention arm (214/280 (76%) vs. 273/282 (97%)) (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50.46, df&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1, p&#x0003c;.001) by three months, with a trend for those who dropped out in the iCBT arm to have had milder depressive symptoms at baseline (Odds ratio&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.92, 95% CI: 0.84&#x02013;1.001). It thus seems unlikely that the improved depression outcome observed for iCBT at follow-up can be ascribed to the differential loss of patients with milder disease at baseline and the true effect of the intervention may be greater than that recorded here. We cannot discount that both interventions hampered improvement. However given that the precursor to E-couch (MoodGym) has been shown to be more effective than a waiting list control <xref rid="pone.0059139-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> this seems unlikely.</p><p>This effect of a higher drop out in the intervention arm of ehealth studies seems common: A review of adherence and persistence to internet treatments for depression <xref rid="pone.0059139-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> found that most studies report lower rates of completion in the experimental intervention group relative to the control, with suggestions that the greater demands of the active programme interaction are less tolerable. Qualitative studies <xref rid="pone.0059139-Donkin2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> attempting to understand this process have highlighted both the obvious barriers e.g. extra time requirements often in the active arm and also the need to enhance the therapeutic relationship perception and provide feedback about progress. However overall, this trial achieved better retention in terms of assessment completion than have almost all previous trials of iCBT <xref rid="pone.0059139-Christensen3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> even though the blinded research assistants provided only technical assistance with no clinical support, as would occur in large scale implementation. There were however several reminders and some personal contact which could have increased the effect of the intervention <xref rid="pone.0059139-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However any such effect would also have been exerted on the attention control arm where the same level of reminders and phone contact was implemented and thus be unlikely to systematically bias the results. We assume that there is some minimal level of adherence to the programme required to achieve the desired outcomes although this level has not yet been established. <xref rid="pone.0059139-Donkin3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> The traditional clinical trial and evidence-based medicine paradigm stipulating that high dropout rates make trials less believable does not necessarily apply to such interventions where there is not necessarily a dose response relationship. <xref rid="pone.0059139-Eysenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> A more nuanced understanding of the poorer persistence in the more demanding active arm, and whether this even needs addressing, is required.</p><p>Many previous studies have shown an effect of iCBT interventions, including the precursor to this programme (MoodGYM) and Beating the Blues, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Lowe2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059139-Donker1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> but only one has done so in people aged over 50 <xref rid="pone.0059139-Spek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Spek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and none have targeted people with comorbid physical health problems. The effect size for the active vs. control arm in improving depression symptom severity in this trial was only small, at 0.15. This does however compare reasonably with the small to moderate effect sizes of psychological interventions for depression in people with cardiovascular disease recruited from hospital settings (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08&#x02013;0.35) observed in the latest systematic review. <xref rid="pone.0059139-Whalley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> In patients with diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) a decrease of five points on the PHQ9 has been suggested as clinically significant <xref rid="pone.0059139-Lowe2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

However only 153/562 (27%) met MDD diagnostic criteria, the rest having milder forms of depressive symptoms which may introduce floor effects in the use of such categories, whereby smaller changes may be meaningful e.g. a reduction of a score from 9 (mild) to 5 is only a change of four points yet results in someone effectively having no meaningful symptom load.</p><p>Observational studies have suggested that improvement in post-MI depression is associated with greater adherence to aspirin <xref rid="pone.0059139-Rieckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and other behavioural interventions, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Ziegelstein1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> the latter study using the same self report measure as here. This study however provides the first trial evidence that an intervention that reduces depression may have additional self reported adherence benefits. There is a potential limitation in relying upon self report which may reflect a reporting bias. Future studies would benefit from objective adherence measures. Of note, those in the control condition reported no change in adherence to health and lifestyle advice such as exercising regularly, cutting down on salt, and following medication recommendations despite the control arm focussing specifically on providing information on the health impacts of such behaviours. This suggests that attempts to enhance the engagement with lifestyle and medical interventions cannot just rely upon information provision. <xref rid="pone.0059139-Donkin2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059139-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>The cognitive behavioural techniques and processes, such as behavioural review and goal setting, embedded in iCBT, seem to provide a more effective approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this trial provides the first evidence that a freely available internet delivered CBT program (<italic>E-Couch</italic>), with minimal personal support, is effective as a low intensity psychological intervention for people with the levels of depressive symptoms seen commonly in primary care and comorbid CVD risks and disease.
