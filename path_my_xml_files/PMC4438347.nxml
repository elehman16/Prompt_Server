The relationship between the level of distress and the degree of the hearing impairment is not unequivocal (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">De &#x00026; Bijl, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Tambs, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Wie et al, 2010</xref>), which indicates the presence of some mediating factors. Within audiology, avoidant coping strategies have been especially focused on and linked to mental distress, non-compliance in rehabilitation, and unsuccessful psychosocial adaptation (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Brennan &#x00026; Bally, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Carlsson et al, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Hallam et al, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hetu et al, 1990</xref>).</p><p>The need for interventions to reduce mental distress and to improve psychosocial functioning is now widely recognized within aural rehabilitation services. Traditional aural rehabilitation includes hearing-aid adjustments, teaching listening strategies, as well as speech-reading, auditory training (recognize speech sounds, patterns, words, phrases, or sentences via audition), and training in various forms of manual communication (finger-spelling and sign language) (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery &#x00026; Houston, 2000</xref>). Adapting to a hearing impairment requires high levels of continuous, cognitive functioning, such as in speech-in-noise recognition tasks, when using spatial cues in speech perception and when overcoming asymmetrical hearing. One intervention study has been conducted among elderly individuals with impaired hearing, but in this study hearing tactics rather than mental distress were targeted as the outcome variable (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Andersson et al, 1997</xref>). At present no evidence-based intervention specifically tailored to alleviate mental distress due to deteriorating hearing is available. Several studies indicate that disorder-specific forms of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are useful not only for mental disorders, but also for somatic ailments (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kroenke 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Sierpina et al, 2007</xref>). Treatment effects of CBT interventions for tinnitus have been investigated and documented (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Baguley et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Langguth et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Vander Ghinst et al, 2013</xref>). CBT manuals in most of these cases are based on models depicting specific clinical phenomena. CBT interventions specifically tailored to reduce mental distress among hearing-impaired individuals have yet to be developed. We wanted to develop a program designed to reduce avoidance and mental distress in this group. The etiology of the hearing impairment was not significant for this purpose, as mental distress among those with congenital hearing impairment will not principally differ from the distress among those with acquired hearing impairment.</p><p>We developed a manual to address mental distress and avoidance among our hearing-impaired participants based on the CBT model for social phobia (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Clark &#x00026; Wells, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Clark &#x00026; Beck, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f6;rtberg et al, 2011</xref>). A central tenet of this model is the suggestion that the disorder is maintained by a predominant use of avoidant coping strategies. Patients suffering from social phobia will adopt such strategies to protect themselves from a self-perceived negative evaluation by others. Characteristic strategies are social withdrawal and self-focus; i.e. direct and fixated monitoring of bodily reactions (blushing, trembling, etc.). Similar strategies have been reported among individuals with impaired hearing (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hallam et al, 2007</xref>). Individuals with social phobia and hearing impairment employ avoidant coping strategies to minimize the risk of ridicule or of being viewed by others as less competent (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Helvik et al, 2007</xref>). Many hearing-impaired individuals will postpone use of hearing aids and hide their hearing impairment from others as long as possible (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Erler &#x00026; Garstecki, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Kochkin, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Some degree of understanding and accommodation from communication partners is beneficial for the hearing-impaired individual. Thus, being open and informing the surroundings about the hearing impairment will assumingly be the most expedient approach in terms of adaptation. But persistently asking for repetitions and proclaiming one's disability will not always be an efficient communication strategy. Firstly, any given number of repetitions will not guarantee the hearing-impaired individual's comprehension. Repetitions of utterances slow down the communication process and make the exchange cumbersome. Secondly, an individual who constantly asks for messages to be repeated risks being perceived as less competent. There is an undeniable stigma (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Erler &#x00026; Garstecki, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hetu, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Southall et al, 2010</xref>) attached to being hearing impaired, and the individual has to find a balance in terms of being sufficiently open in order to achieve efficient communication with others. If the individual considers it hazardous to inform others, successful adaptation will be more difficult to achieve. Correcting faulty appraisals of threat and personal vulnerability is a fundamental approach in cognitive therapy. This may be attained through interventions such as psychoeducation, behavioral experiments, and cognitive restructuring (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Clark &#x00026; Wells 1995</xref>). The workplace is of special interest in this context, as it serves as an arena where various coping strategies are constantly at play.</p><p>The aims of this pilot study were threefold. We wanted to investigate whether the participants presented difficulties that could be dealt with by the use of the CBT model of social phobia, and if these challenges could be addressed within the time frame that was set up, we would consider the intervention <italic>feasible</italic>. We assumed that the drop-out rate would give some indications as to whether the participants found the course <italic>relevant</italic>. The course would be considered <italic>useful</italic> to the extent that the overall aim of the intervention was reached: reduced communicative avoidance (decrease in CONV(AVOID)) scores, and symptoms of mental distress (decrease in HAD scores).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>In a pilot study, pre- and post-intervention levels of mental distress (anxiety and depression) and avoidant communication strategies were measured and compared for participants who completed a CBT program for hearing-impaired employees (n = 15) and a traditional audiological rehabilitation program; the treatment as usual (TAU) group (n = 18).</p><sec id="s4"><title>I<sc>ntervention group</sc></title><p>Hearing-impaired employees experiencing mental distress who were interested in taking part in the research project were invited through advertisements placed in the largest newspaper in Oslo, Norway, and through e-mails that were sent to members of the Norwegian Association of the Hard of Hearing.

The &#x0201c;Keep your job&#x0201d; course is the only rehabilitation program available for hearing-impaired employees in the country. The courses are announced in the membership magazine &#x0201c;Your Hearing&#x0201d; produced by The Norwegian Association of the Hard of Hearing and otherwise passed through word of mouth. Participants personally apply for course admission. Expenses related to absence from work, transport, and lodging are covered by The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Service. The program is held at the Briskeby School and Resource Center, a nationwide facility for the hearing impaired which is owned by The Norwegian Association of the Hard of Hearing. The course lasts for nine days spread over six months and mainly consists of lectures about hearing and hearing loss; psychosocial consequences of hearing loss; information about technical hearing devices and how to use them, and about legislation, support and governmental subsidizing arrangements.</p><p>The program also includes balance training and stress-management methods. The lectures are held by pedagogues, physiotherapists, lawyers, and psychologists, as well as experienced peers. The psychosocial part of the &#x02018;treatment as usual&#x02019; (TAU) course included lectures held by acknowledged specialists on topics including common work-related challenges, well-known reactions to hearing loss, and how to efficiently communicate the hearing impairment to one's surroundings. The course is open for employed people aged between 18&#x02013;67 years with documented hearing impairment.</p><p>Among the TAU sample, seven participants withdrew from the study and 18 (M = 52.6 years) completed the program and the pre-to-post tests. Average pure-tone hearing impairment ranged from 19.4 (unilateral) to 100 dB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). As among the interventional sample, three individuals had unilateral hearing loss.</p><p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Treatment</title><p>The intervention was administered as a weekly two-hour CBT course over eight weeks (16 hours in total). This number of hours corresponds to the amount of mental distress-related content (lectures on psychosocial consequences of hearing impairment) presented in the TAU course. The course was presented in Norwegian, and an inductive hearing loop system was provided for participants using hearing aids. All participants received the course material containing lecture notes in print, with supplementary reading and descriptions of homework to be completed between sessions. The course was facilitated by a psychologist experienced in treating hearing-impaired individuals with special training in CBT.</p><p>Each session was divided into two standard parts. During the first hour each participant gave their report from the between-sessions homework assignments. The second hour was devoted to lectures comprising the rationale behind the upcoming homework assignments. The participants were given a course curriculum containing the consecutive topics to be addressed at each group session. At the end of each session the participants were briefed on how to conduct the homework exercise for the following week.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Manual</title><p>We developed a course manual based on the CBT model for social phobia (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Clark &#x00026; Beck, 2010</xref>), which describes three fundamental features unique to this disorder. First, feelings of embarrassment caused by negative evaluation by others are presented as the dominant, negative emotion (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Barlow &#x00026; Hofmann, 2002</xref>). Second, this emotional reaction will elicit inhibitory behaviors that have the unfortunate effect of disrupting social performance (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Rapee &#x00026; Heimberg, 1997</xref>). This provides the basis for a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the individual ends up actually achieving negative evaluation by others. We find that this model translates to some common challenges reported by several of our patients. A hearing-impaired person who doesn't ask her or his conversation partner to repeat messages, when this is needed, out of a concern that the others will find this bothersome, can end up actually becoming a nuisance due to the resulting misinterpretations. Anxiety then becomes a secondary threat as the individuals believe they have to conceal their distress to avoid negative evaluation from others. In our experience, this translates to those individuals who go to great lengths to conceal their hearing problem. Several authors have reported that hearing impairment is associated with a stigma (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hetu, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Southall et al, 2010</xref>), a factor that might serve to reinforce the need to keep the hearing problem a private matter.</p><p>Correcting faulty appraisals of threat and personal vulnerability is a fundamental approach in CBT and is achieved by interventions such as guided discovery, psychoeducation, and cognitive restructuring. The intervention consisted of traditional CBT interventions adapted to the special case of hearing impairment. In contrast to depression, a hearing impairment cannot be viewed as the result of faulty or biased cognitive processing, but is <italic>de facto</italic> physical damage to the hearing organ. This distinction is important to acknowledge in therapeutic work. Efficient treatment goals are not directly tied to the hearing impairment itself, but rather to the negative <italic>consequences</italic> of impaired hearing. The stated goal of the cognitive restructuring phase was not correcting faulty cognitions as much as exploring costs and benefits of holding on to negative beliefs. Some negative emotions and reactions are unavoidable when hearing is impaired, and the treatment goal of the manual was to attain higher levels of acceptance of negative emotions rather than elimination of these reactions altogether. By this refinement the manual was predominantly based on the CBT model for social phobia, but we also have drawn from other sources.

The degree of hearing impairment (HI) was evaluated according to standards established by the World Health Organization (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2014</xref>). Applied to the better hearing ear&#x02014;averaged across 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz&#x02014;hearing impairment is rated as <italic>slight</italic> (over 26 dB and less than 40 dB), <italic>moderate</italic> (over 41 dB and less than 60 dB), <italic>severe,</italic> (over 61 dB and less than 80 dB) or <italic>profound</italic> (equal to and above 81 dB). Unilateral hearing impairment was categorized as hearing impairment in one ear as classified by the WHO and hearing thresholds in the better ear better than or equal to 20 dB.</p><p>The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD) was used to assess level of mental distress. The HAD scale is self-administered and consists of 14 items; seven related to anxiety (HAD-A) and seven to depression (HAD-D). Each item is scored from 0 to 3. The total sum score ranges from 0 to 42 and the subscale scores range from 0 to 21. The two scales are normally strongly correlated, which accords with the known comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders. A score &#x02265; 8 on one subscale indicates the case level of mental distress. The internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x003b1; = 0.73&#x02013;0.85) of the Norwegian version is satisfactory (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Mykletun et al, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The 54-item self-report questionnaire, conversation tactics checklist (CONV), was originally developed by Hallam et al (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hallam et al, 2007</xref>) to assess how people behave when they find it difficult to communicate with others due to hearing impairment. Items were grouped into eight <italic>a priori</italic> categories based on what is known from the literature about processes of communication when conversations are set up, break down, and are repaired: (1) FACILitate: to what degree the communication partners (CPs) catch each other's attention and optimize the communication environment (four items). (2) ALTernative: CPs use alternative modes of communication (three items). (3) OPTImise: CPs optimize the sensory and contextual information available to them (10 items). (4) META: CPs employ meta-communication skills to organize their thoughts, interpret what has been said, construct what they are about to say, and ensure that the message is conveyed (nine items). (5) HREP: CPs attempt to repair a breakdown of communication by requesting that their CPs repeat, or change their delivery or content of the message (nine items). (6) PREP: CPs repeat or change their delivery or message, in order to repair a breakdown of communication (five items). (7) COERCe: CPs use a non-verbal coercive means of influencing or repairing a conversation (four items). (8) AVOID: CPs avoid communicating, or escape a conversation when difficulties arise, or avoid repairing a conversation breakdown (10 items).

Thus we judge the program and manual to be a feasible intervention. In addition to dealing with problems that each individual participant presented, we believe that the course was a relevant experience for the participants as no participant withdrew once they had started the program.</p><p>Following the assumption made by several authors that avoidance is a maladaptive coping strategy that can be attributed to mental distress among hearing-impaired individuals, we tested whether levels of avoidance and anxiety would be reduced. We found that during participation in the adapted CBT course the extent of avoidant communication and symptoms of anxiety decreased. For the TAU participants, HAD anxiety scores increased but there was no significant change in CONV (AVOID) scores during the program participation. The pre-treatment HAD scores for the TAU group were so low that only minor changes could be expected due to program participation.</p><p>There are several aspects that should be taken into account when interpreting the results. The difference in pre-program level of anxiety between the groups could be attributed to a selection bias. The participants in the intervention group had signed up for a course specifically addressing mental distress, while the TAU sample comprised of individuals attending a regular rehabilitation course. It is natural to assume that the motivation for attendance will differ between the participants in these two programs. Although psychosocial adaptation to some extent was addressed in both courses, only the CBT course specifically addressed avoidance in relation to mental distress.</p><p>As part of the CBT course each participant was instructed to describe what strategies that he or she used at work, which in turn could be related to problem maintenance. There was a large variation in strategies reported. Some participants found it difficult to retreat from activities, even in a state of exhaustion, due to concern of letting others down. Others, however, had an excessive tendency to isolate themselves from their surroundings. Even if the strategies diverged, all of them fitted well with the model. Throughout the course of the program it was possible to do planned, structured, and therapist-supervised explorations of the efficiency of current coping strategies. More importantly, the participants were encouraged by therapist and peers alike to try out new strategies they otherwise would have avoided due to fear of negative evaluation from surroundings. This guided discovery gave the participants access to information and experiences that would otherwise be unavailable to them.</p><p>In contrast to the TAU program, the participants in the intervention group were supervised more consistently and the program structure consisted of a series of inseparable, distinct steps. The TAU program contained a range of topics that were related, but these were not progressively presented so as to guide and supervise the participant in specific, behavioral explorations. Our experience is that when mental distress has developed, and it is apparent that the individual makes use of maladaptive coping strategies, it is critical that the individual is supervised consistently over some time in order to be able to change their coping habits. The CBT manual provides a step by step description on how to conduct interventions that target problem maintaining coping strategies. The intervention was specifically designed so as to train the participants in being more communicatively assertive. Post-test assessments show that levels of avoidant communication strategies decreased significantly in the intervention group, while remaining unchanged among the TAU participants. Our experience is that to be effective, such training has to target avoidance specifically and be supervised by a therapist with special training in CBT.</p><p>According to CBT theory, different forms of avoidance constitute a core feature in various anxiety disorders. This forms the background rationale for targeting communicative avoidance in the program. It is, however, imperative to bear in mind that all behaviors which appear avoidant at first glance are not necessary maladaptive. For example, social withdrawal appears intuitively &#x0201c;avoidant.&#x0201d; But restitution is an important element in successful adaptation, as some level of continuous compensation strain is an inevitable aspect of adequate performance in communication settings, when hearing is impaired (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Andersson &#x00026; H&#x000e4;gnebo, 2003</xref>). Reluctance against revealing to the environment that one has impaired hearing and unwillingness to make use of hearing aids (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hallam et al, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hetu et al, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Kochkin, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), are other coping strategies that are commonly regarded as expressions of unsuccessful adaptation. However, as it has been established that being hard of hearing is a social stigma (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Erler &#x00026; Garstecki, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hetu, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Southall et al, 2010</xref>), this view should be regarded as simplistic. Intuitively, openness should be beneficial, but several of our participants had experienced career-related discrimination and humiliation when being open about their hearing impairment. In regular aural rehabilitation courses it can be difficult to handle this issue, as hearing-aid adjustments are imperative elements. We find that what constitutes &#x0201c;good coping&#x0201d; cannot be evaluated in isolation from contextual factors. In some cases social withdrawal is healthy and adaptive. In others, social isolation represents a core problem for the individual. Avoidance is a well-established element in the development of anxiety disorders, but to our knowledge no previous studies have addressed the assumed negative link between avoidant communicative strategies and mental distress among hearing-impaired persons. Our findings could serve as a starting point for further investigation into how to efficiently address avoidant and related mental distress among hearing-impaired individuals.</p><sec id="s12"><title>Limitations</title><p>Being a pilot study of a novel program, the sample size was small.
