Study subjects had to be on a stable medical regimen for at least one month before enrollment. We excluded those with acute rejection (defined histologically) or active infection within one month before enrollment, a contraindication to IVIG (acute renal failure, severe selective IgA deficiency, known hypersensitivity to IVIG), pregnancy, or a history of a thrombotic event within three months. The initial protocol called for IgG levels &#x0003c;400 mg/dL, which was increased to &#x0003c;500 mg/dL due to slow enrollment. All participants provided written informed consent. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov before the initiation of enrollment (NCT00115778) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00115778">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00115778</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>This was a crossover study with two 12 week treatment periods (separated by a 12 week washout period) comparing immune globulin intravenous (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatolgraphy Purified (Gamunex) (Bayer, Elkhart, IN) (&#x0201c;IVIG&#x0201d;) with 0.1% albumin (&#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d;). The <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life of this form of IVIG is approximately 35 days. The dose of IVIG in this study was 400 mg/kg every 4 weeks, which is a widely used dosage in clinical practice. The initial infusion rate was 0.01 mL/kg/min, titrated to a maximum infusion rate of 0.08 mL/kg/min. Placebo was 0.1% albumin in an equal volume, prepared by the Columbia Research Pharmacy. IVIG and placebo infusion bags had identical color and appearance. All participants were pre-medicated with acetaminophen 650 mg po and diphenhydramine 25 mg po before every study drug infusion.</p><p>The Research Pharmacy at Columbia University randomly assigned the treatment order. Investigators, study personnel, and study participants were blinded to the order and identity of the treatments. IGG levels were not performed during the study; samples were banked and then run after the conclusion of the study. Study drug was prepared by an unblinded research pharmacist and delivered to the infusion suite at our medical center where each dose of study drug was administered.</p><p>Study participants were evaluated at baseline and at Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 28, 32, and 36. The &#x0201c;Period 1&#x0201d; study drug was administered at baseline and at Week 4 and 8 study visits. The &#x0201c;Period 2&#x0201d; study drug was administered at Week 24, 28, and 32. There was a twelve week washout period between the Period 1 and Period 2. Phlebotomy was performed on the morning of each study visit, before infusion of the study drug. Participants maintained a diary of any new medications or symptoms during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome Assessments</title><p>The primary outcome was the number of bacterial infections during the treatment period. Secondary outcomes included viral, fungal and all non-bacterial infections, hospital admissions, antimicrobial use, serious bacterial infections, trough IgG levels, acute rejection, spirometry, and mortality in each period. The definitions of infectious end points were drawn from an FDA draft document. <xref rid="pone.0103908-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> The necessary criteria were collected prospectively and all infectious events were determined with blinding to the treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Generalized estimating equations with a compound symmetry covariance structure and logit link were used to estimate odds ratios. Linear mixed effects modeling with an autoregressive covariance structure were used to assess differences in lung function and IgG levels between treatment arms. Models included fixed effects for drug and period. Subject was included as a random effect. Least squares means and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes are reported. Paired sample analysis was performed secondarily.</p><p>In order to detect a reduction in the mean number of bacterial infections/patient by one standard deviation over three months with 80% power at an &#x003b1; level of 0.05, we estimated that we would need 10 subjects. This effect estimate was similar to the difference between patients with and without HGG in prior studies. <xref rid="pone.0103908-Goldfarb1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> The crossover design of the trial, in which each subject serves as his or her own control, allows sufficient power for the detection of a clinically significant effect of IVIG with only a small number of patients and is the major strength of this design. For example, a sample size of 10 patients in a crossover trial has more power to detect differences than double the sample size using a parallel group design (i.e., randomizing 10 patients to IVIG and 10 patients to placebo). As we did not have multiple bacterial infections per patient (see below), the power of the study was less than anticipated.</p><p>The primary analysis proceeded according to the intent-to-treat principle. All randomized participants were analyzed in their originally assigned group whether or not they discontinued study drug. P values&#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). There were no interim analyses or stopping rules planned <italic>a priori</italic> for the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>We screened 237 lung transplant recipients between January 2005 and July 2008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103908-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

placebo-controlled clinical trial of IVIG for HGG after lung transplantation. In a crossover design, we did not find a significant impact of IVIG on bacterial infections or other infectious episodes, despite observing expected increases in IgG levels following IVIG administration. Adverse events were mild and common during both IVIG and placebo periods.</p><p>Previous studies have shown associations between the presence of HGG after lung transplant and worse outcomes. We previously demonstrated that lung transplant recipients with severe HGG (IgG&#x0003c;400 mg/dl) had a higher cumulative incidence of pneumonia (63%) compared to that of recipients without HGG (18%), (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01), but there was no significant increase in the risk of CMV disease. <xref rid="pone.0103908-Kawut1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> Those with severe HGG also had an increased risk of death. The incidence of severe HGG was about 15% in our prior studies, <xref rid="pone.0103908-Yip1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103908-Kawut1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> however other investigators have demonstrated even higher prevalences of HGG after lung transplantation. <xref rid="pone.0103908-Goldfarb1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> A recent study in pediatric lung transplant recipients found an association between HGG and the risk of infections and hospitalization. <xref rid="pone.0103908-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> More recently, lower post-transplant IgG levels were associated with an increased risk of BOS <xref rid="pone.0103908-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>IVIG is the current standard in clinical practice for replacement therapy of patients with primary immunodeficiency states. <xref rid="pone.0103908-Anonymous1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> Currently, IVIG is FDA approved for treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency, Kawasaki syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and bone marrow transplant recipients with recurrent infections and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While supplementation using IVIG in HGG after solid organ transplantation would be presumed to be effective, there are several reasons why it may not be. Organ transplant recipients receive a medical regimen that not only reduces B cell function (and antibody production), but also T cell function. HGG might be an epiphenomenon of reduced T cell function and merely replacing antibodies might not improve defenses against infection.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is only one other RCT of immunoglobulin replacement for HGG in thoracic organ transplantation. Yamani et al. studied the use of Cytogam in patients with IgG levels between 350 and 500 mg/dl in a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial with 13 patients randomized to Cytogam and 10 patients randomized to placebo (5% dextrose). <xref rid="pone.0103908-Yamani2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> An average of only 1.4 doses were administered per patient, without a standard regimen. The investigators found a decrease in the number of episodes of CMV disease, but no other differences between the groups. These results may not be generalizable as this study 1) used Cytogam in patients who received valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis for only 4 weeks after transplantation, 2) on average only administered 1&#x02013;2 doses of study drug for the entire study period, 3) only showed an effect on CMV infection (defined as a positive CMV PCR with fever, malaise, leukopenia, or other evidence of organ disease), and 4) demonstrated no effect on bacterial infections. These data may be difficult to extrapolate to the chronic use of IVIG in lung transplant patients with HGG receiving more prolonged CMV prophylaxis.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. While the crossover design provided more power than we would have had with &#x0003e;20 subjects studied in a parallel design, there were few outcomes and our findings could very well be attributable to inadequate power. For the crossover design to be valid, we needed to ensure clinical stability over the time of both treatment periods, necessarily limiting the duration of each. Longer studies with greater numbers of patients would be necessary to detect smaller differences in outcomes. The primary statistical analysis may be anti-conservative in small samples, however no differences in the primary end point were seen and paired sample analyses were similar. We recruited patients with low IgG levels documented twice over a short period of time. Even so, some of the patients in the study had IgG levels &#x0003e;500 mg/dl at the time of randomization and during the placebo period. This was not attributable to a carryover effect (i.e., the effect of IVIG treatment during the first period continuing into the second period), but likely reflects the variable nature of IgG levels over time. While reflecting the &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; application of IVIG (i.e., some patients clinically diagnosed with HGG based on two IgG levels in whom IVIG might be prescribed will go on to have IgG levels which are higher), it is possible that IgG levels &#x0003e;500 mg/dl during the placebo period could have led to bias to the null, even though the study subjects had significantly higher levels of IgG at every time point during treatment with IVIG. Finally, one participant dropped out early in the first period, which could have reduced power as well.</p><p>In summary, monthly IVIG therapy did not reduce the incidence of bacterial or other infections compared to placebo over three months in stable adult lung transplant recipients with HGG. Our results do not support the routine clinical use of IVIG in patients with HGG after lung transplant. However, it is unknown whether IVIG may be effective for lung transplant recipients with HGG and repeated or refractory bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0103908.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
