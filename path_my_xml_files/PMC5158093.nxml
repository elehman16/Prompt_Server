This study served as the basis for the recommendation that LDX could be mixed with orange juice or yogurt when administered to any age group. These vehicles were chosen because they are generally appealing to individuals across age groups.

The study consisted of a screening phase that ended at least 28 days before the first treatment dose; 3 single-dose, 5-day treatment periods separated by a 7-day washout between treatments; and a follow-up period. Healthy men or women (18&#x02013;55 years old) were admitted to the clinical research center 1 day before the initiation of each treatment period (day &#x02013;1) and remained at the center through completion of all day 5 assessments for the treatment period.</p><p>The treatments consisted of (1) administration of LDX after the contents of a 70-mg capsule were mixed with 4 ounces of orange juice; (2) administration of LDX after the contents of a 70-mg capsule were mixed with 4 ounces of yogurt; or (3) administration of an intact 70-mg LDX capsule with 240 mL of room temperature water. At the beginning of the first treatment period, participants were randomly assigned to receive each of 3 treatments in 1 of 6 treatment sequences in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Participants were assigned a 4-digit randomization number immediately before dosing on day 1 of the first treatment period after the eligibility had been determined.

The main findings demonstrate that the relative bioavailability of the active moiety, <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine, based on C<sub>max</sub> and AUC, is not different from that of an intact LDX capsule when LDX is mixed with orange juice or yogurt. The pharmacokinetic profile of <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine, including t<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>1/2</sub>, observed when LDX was mixed with yogurt or orange juice in this study was comparable to previous reports in single-dose studies of healthy adults.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Intrasubject variability for <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine was low and within one third to one half of the corresponding intersubject variability. These findings indicated that LDX was suitable for use in adults when swallowed as an intact capsule, when mixed with a soft food such as yogurt, or when mixed with a liquid such as orange juice. Although these data supported a subsequent label change for LDX in the United States,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> this is the first detailed description of these findings.</p><p>The ability to mix the contents of LDX capsules in soft food or liquids for the purpose of administration is consistent with reports for other ADHD medications.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Metadate CD (extended-release methylphenidate HCl capsules; UCB, Inc., Smyrna, GA),<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Adderall XR (extended-release mixed amphetamine salts; Shire US Inc., Wayne, PA),<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and Focalin XR (extended-release dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, NJ)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> are approved to be swallowed whole or sprinkled on applesauce and consumed immediately. Using standard bioequivalence-testing procedures, studies of Adderall XR<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and Metadate CD<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> reported comparable relative bioavailability of the active ingredients under fasting conditions in healthy adults when the contents of a capsule were sprinkled over a small amount of applesauce compared with the intact capsule swallowed whole.</p><p>In contrast to the findings for <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine, relative bioavailability of LDX when mixed with orange juice or yogurt was lower compared with that from an intact LDX capsule, with geometric LSM ratios and 90% CIs for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, and AUC<sub>last</sub> falling below the prespecified bioequivalence range when LDX was mixed with orange juice and the lower CI for C<sub>max</sub> falling below the lower limit of the prespecified bioequivalence range when LDX was mixed with yogurt. The reason for this discrepancy between the bioavailabilities of <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine and LDX is not known. However, as <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine is pharmacologically active whereas LDX is not<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and the reduced bioavailability of LDX when mixed with orange juice or yogurt does not result in reduced <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine bioavailability, the observed changes in overall LDX concentrations may not have clinical significance.</p><p>The safety and tolerability profile of LDX did not substantially differ across treatments, and no unexpected TEAEs or vital sign changes were observed. There were no serious or severe TEAEs; all TEAEs were considered mild in severity. Among the most frequently reported TEAEs (decreased appetite, dry mouth, and headache), dry mouth and headache have been previously reported in healthy adults administered LDX<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>; decreased appetite, dry mouth, and headache have also been reported in clinical studies of LDX in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The patterns of changes in pulse and blood pressure are also consistent with previously published findings in healthy adults.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>These data should be considered in light of several potential limitations. First, findings related to safety and tolerability from this phase 1 study should be interpreted with caution because the sample size was small and participants were predominantly male. Second, data related to the taste acceptability of LDX mixed with orange juice or yogurt were exploratory in nature. Third, because this is a single-dose study, it is not known whether differences in bioavailability would be observed if lower doses of LDX were administered or if LDX was mixed with different foods or liquids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This was the first study to compare the relative bioavailability of LDX when the contents of a capsule were mixed with soft food or liquids with that of an intact LDX capsule when swallowed whole in healthy adults. The relative bioavailability of <sc>d</sc>-amphetamine did not differ when LDX was mixed with orange juice or yogurt compared with LDX being taken as an intact capsule. These results support the administration of LDX in orange juice or soft foods such as yogurt as an appropriate alternative to swallowing intact capsules. Most of the participants rated the taste of LDX in orange juice or yogurt as acceptable, good, or excellent. This suggests that the administration of LDX in these vehicles may not negatively affect LDX use in individuals who require an alternative mode of administration to swallowing an intact LDX capsule.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Under the direction of the authors, writing assistance was provided by Stefan Kolata, PhD (a former employee of CHC), and Craig Slawecki, PhD (a current employee of CHC).
