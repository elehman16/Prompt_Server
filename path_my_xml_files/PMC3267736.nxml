A multi-component program designed to mobilize support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive symptoms in caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet been evaluated. This study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers of community-dwelling dementia patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling dementia patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;96) or usual care (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;96) condition. The intervention consisted of two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures after 12 months were the incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a depressive or anxiety disorder within 12 months. The intervention was not superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted IRR 0.98; 95&#x00025; CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;1.40; 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;3.91 to 1.10) or anxiety symptoms (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.55; 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;1.59 to 0.49). The intervention did not reduce caregiver burden or their health related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study did not demonstrate preventive effects of family meetings on the mental health of family caregivers.

According to one study, almost half of the caregivers developed depression diagnosed according to research diagnostic criteria within one year after the initial assessment <xref rid="pone.0030936-Ballard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Previously, we estimated that spouses of patients with dementia have a fourfold higher risk of depression than spouses of non-demented persons <xref rid="pone.0030936-Joling1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The incidence of anxiety among dementia caregivers has received less attention, but a recent review showed that clinically significant anxiety affects about a quarter of caregivers of people with dementia and was more common than in matched controls <xref rid="pone.0030936-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Given the large number of caregivers who may suffer from clinical depression or anxiety, providing adequate treatment for all of them would place a heavy burden on health care resources and might not be feasible. Alternative strategies, such as prevention, can potentially be a more cost effective approach. Preventive interventions have proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders in non-caregiving populations <xref rid="pone.0030936-Beekman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030936-vantVeerTazelaar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and are most likely to be effective when targeted at those with a high a priori risk of developing the disorder <xref rid="pone.0030936-Chisholm1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This can be achieved by focusing on people exposed to established risk factors for a disorder (selective prevention), as is the case in the population of dementia caregivers. Thus, the literature suggests that a preventive intervention might be an effective strategy for this target group.</p><p>Over the last decades, various strategies for supporting caregivers have been developed. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate mixed results with respect to the effectiveness of these interventions on caregiver mood or burden <xref rid="pone.0030936-Olazaran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Schoenmakers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Information and support alone may be helpful, but appears to address the psychological needs of caregivers only marginally <xref rid="pone.0030936-Brodaty1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Sorensen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Programs that demonstrate beneficial effects involve both patients and their families, are more intensive and are designed to meet each caregiver's individual needs <xref rid="pone.0030936-Brodaty1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Acton1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Results of the NYU Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI), a multi-component intervention that included family counseling, individual counseling sessions, support group participation and continuous availability of ad hoc counseling have demonstrated that counseling and support interventions designed to mobilize support of naturally existing family networks, appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in caregivers <xref rid="pone.0030936-Mittelman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Mittelman2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and in delaying nursing home placement of the dementia patient <xref rid="pone.0030936-Mittelman3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Mittelman4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, it is unclear whether family meetings alone have preventive effects. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether structured family meetings are more effective than usual care in the prevention of depression or anxiety disorders in caregivers. We also evaluated the effects on the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, caregiver burden and quality of life of the caregiver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030936.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and P<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030936.s001">rotocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Caregivers and patients were recruited through memory clinics (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;91), services delivering case management (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;79), general practices, home care settings and meeting centers for people with dementia and their caregivers (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) in the Netherlands. Caregivers were eligible if they were the primary family caregiver of a community dwelling relative with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and had at least one other family member or friend available to participate in the family meetings. If there was more than one family caregiver caring for the patient, the primary caregiver was identified as the person who coordinated the caring process, usually the person who spends most hours on caregiving tasks. Caregivers were excluded when 1) they met the criteria for a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder as measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) <xref rid="pone.0030936-Sheehan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 2) the patient was scheduled to move into a nursing home, 3) they presented with severe somatic or psychiatric co-morbidity which would significantly impair cooperation with the study, and 4) they had insufficient proficiency in the Dutch language thus hampering adequate participation in meetings and interviews.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics</title><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center approved the study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Caregivers randomized to the intervention group were invited to participate in six in-person counseling sessions: one individual preparation session, followed by four structured meetings that included their relatives and/or friends (family meetings), and one additional individual evaluation session. The family meetings were held once every 2 to 3 months in the year following enrollment in the program based on pilot experience with some families prior to the study.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Preparation meeting</title><p>The first individual session was aimed to prepare the caregiver for the family meetings and to propose the idea of seeking help from family and friends.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Family meetings</title><p>The aim was to offer psycho-education, teach problem solving techniques and mobilize the existing family networks of the patient and primary caregiver in order to improve emotional and instrumental support. The content of the sessions was guided by the needs of the caregiver. During the first family meeting the purpose of the meetings, the protocol, ground rules and the counselor's role were explained to the caregiver and the family. Relevant issues were identified (e.g. management of patient behavior problems, coping with feelings of guilt) and the counselor motivated the family to form ideas to help the caregiver and to delegate tasks. The follow up meetings reviewed the previous session, previous commitments and the progress of tasks. Ad hoc telephone counseling from the same counselor was available to caregivers and their families beyond the scheduled sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Evaluation session</title><p>After the final family session, an individual session was held to evaluate the caregiver's satisfaction with the intervention program and to start additional support when requested.</p><p>The counselors who led the family meetings had an advanced degree in nursing, social work, psychology or an allied profession and were trained prior to the study by the research team. One counselor was assigned to each caregiver to establish an ongoing relationship with a person familiar with the situation. The family meetings were audio taped for supervision and reviewed randomly and on request to give feedback to the counselors. To encourage and evaluate protocol adherence, after a family session, the counselor filled in a standardized form and was contacted by the researcher (KJ) individually to monitor and discuss difficulties.

Usual care in the Netherlands may consist of a range of health care and welfare services and can differ across participants. However, family meetings are rarely organized and never in a structured way or with follow-up sessions. They also tend to focus on providing clinical information and not on increasing family support and relieving the caregiver. Usual care participants were free to use all types of care, including community-based mental health services or support resources other than family meetings at any time throughout the 12 months follow-up, therefore reflecting standard care. The participants' use of health care services and their participation in family meetings was recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Objective</title><p>To determine whether a family meetings intervention prevents the development of anxiety and depressive disorders superior to usual care.

The MINI is a short, structured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV mental disorders and can be used for psychiatric evaluation and outcome tracking. The severity of symptoms of depression was measured every 6 months with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale- Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) for anxiety. The CES-D consists of 20 items, with a total score ranging between 0 and 60. Higher scores indicate greater psychological distress, and scores of 16 and above indicate the presence of clinically significant depression <xref rid="pone.0030936-Radloff1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The HADS-A consists of 7 items, with total scores ranging between 0 and 21.

The yearly incidence of disorders among caregivers at risk was estimated at 30&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0030936-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The trial was powered to detect a 20&#x00025; decrease in the incidence. We calculated that 73 participants per group would be needed, assuming a 2-sided test, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80&#x00025;. With a drop out of 20&#x00025;, at least 182 participants would be needed.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomization &#x00026; blinding</title><p>After informed consent and baseline measurement, dyads of patients and their primary family caregiver were randomized by an independent researcher, stratified by recruitment center, in blocks of four to either usual care or the family meetings intervention. The interviewers who measured the outcomes were blinded to randomisation status. The participants and the counselors conducting the family meetings were aware of the intervention assigned.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We investigated if randomization had resulted in a balanced distribution of prognostically important variables across the conditions. In addition, we compared the baseline characteristics of dropouts and those who completed the 12-month measurement by performing logistic regression analysis. Data were primarily analyzed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle (ITT), which means that all participants were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized. This analysis requires imputation of missing observations. The missing values on the outcomes measures were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. In contrast to other imputation techniques, this method minimally alters variance of data, thus providing the best estimates of missing data, at least until 50&#x00025; of the data are missing <xref rid="pone.0030936-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. To estimate to what extent the intervention was more successful in reducing the risk of depressive and anxiety disorders than usual care, we first performed an unadjusted Poisson regression analysis of the clinical depression or anxiety cumulative incidence (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;became disordered and 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;remained disorder free over the last year) on the treatment indicator (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;usual care, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;intervention). In this manner we obtained a crude incidence rate ratio (IRR) which describes the difference in incidence rate in the intervention relative to usual care. The superiority of the intervention would be supported if the IRR falls below 1 and would be significant at P&#x0003c;0.05, 2-tailed. Estimates of the intervention effects on the continuous outcome measures were obtained from linear mixed models. These take into account the repeated measurements for each subject. The randomization status, time of measurement and randomization-by-time interaction were included as fixed effects in the models. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the repeated measurements. The models included a random intercept for each site and a random intercept and slope for each patient. We assessed the overall effect of the intervention by testing the interaction between randomization and time of measurement. To adjust for selection-bias, variables with significant baseline differences and a significant association with outcome (HADS-A baseline score) were incorporated as covariates in all analyses. All analyses were performed while taking into account the hierarchical structure of data, with caregivers nested in recruitment sites. The models were fitted in Stata (version 11) using the xtmixed command. Because placement and death of the patient might affect the outcomes, the ITT analyses were replicated removing the caregivers where the patient either died or was institutionalized during the study. The results of the intention-to-treat analyses were compared with the results of the per protocol analysis. This type of analysis can assess whether protocol violations have caused bias. In the per-protocol analyses, outcomes of the participants who attended at least three family meetings were compared with the outcomes of the usual care group.</p><p>Finally, we performed ancillary analyses to investigate the possible modification of the treatment effect by caregiver gender, dementia severity, initial depressive or anxious symptoms within the caregivers, lack of family support, and recruitment via sites offering intensive support resources. These effect modification analyses were conducted to determine whether caregivers with certain baseline characteristics would benefit (more) from family meetings. The analyses were performed with the SPSS (version 15.0) and Stata (version 11) statistical packages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant flow and recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited from November 2007 to November 2009.

The 44 adherers did not significantly differ on any of the baseline characteristics compared with the non-adherers, despite that for non-adherers the patient's number of ADL dependencies was slightly higher (difference in mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.56, 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;1.11 to &#x02212;0.01, t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;2.04 with 93 df, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.044).

Furthermore, seven caregivers finished the intervention, but not within 12 months after enrollment.</p><p>Of the 73 caregivers who attended at least one family meeting, 64 completed an evaluation form after their last session. Satisfaction among the participating caregivers was high: 53 (83&#x00025;) experienced the family meetings as useful, while 8 caregivers experienced no benefits (data on 3 persons were missing/inconclusive). The satisfied caregivers attended more family meetings (difference in mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.3, 95&#x00025; CI 1.95 to 2.74, t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11.75 with 94 df, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.000) and experienced a higher lack of family support at baseline than the other intervention caregivers (difference in mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;1.67, 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;3.27 to &#x02212;0.08, t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;2.08 with 93 df, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.040). Also, they cared for persons with dementia who were more often diagnosed with Alzheimer Disease (66&#x00025; versus 44&#x00025;) and had less ADL dependencies (difference in mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.62, 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;1.21 to &#x02212;0.04, t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;2.13 with 63.5 df, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.037).</p><p>The family meetings lasted on average 73 minutes (range 47&#x02013;105). The number of family members/friends attending a meeting was 4.4 (range 2&#x02013;14). In 85&#x00025;, the demented person was not present at the meetings or only attended a part of the sessions. Family meetings were organized at the office (57&#x00025;) or at the family's home (43&#x00025;).

The intervention did not prevent the onset of depression or anxiety disorders, nor reduced symptom levels and caregiver burden. The incidence of depression and anxiety disorders was equally substantial in both groups of relatively young caregivers. Within 12 months, almost 40&#x00025; of the caregivers developed a mental disorder according to diagnostic criteria. This incidence is far higher than in the cohort study of Joling et al among spouses of dementia patients <xref rid="pone.0030936-Joling1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and than found in &#x02018;general&#x02019; elderly cohorts and emphasizes the vulnerability of this target group <xref rid="pone.0030936-Luijendijk1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030936-Norton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>Counseling and support interventions that include family meetings were investigated by Mittelman et al., who found small to moderate but significant effects that lasted more than 3 years on depressive symptomatology in caregivers <xref rid="pone.0030936-Mittelman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Mittelman2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Subsequently, a multinational study carried out a similar intervention among spouses of persons with Alzheimer disease taking donepezil and also reported a small but significant reduction in depression scores <xref rid="pone.0030936-Mittelman5" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The lack of effects in our study may be due to the fact that the intervention did not include all components of the multi component NYU Caregiver Intervention. Perhaps the intervention lacked the same time condensed delivery to have an impact on the outcomes compared to the original protocol in which the counseling sessions were delivered within 4 months after the intake assessment, and followed with ad hoc counseling from the same counselor. However, in the Netherlands, there are many supportive services available to caregivers and the provided standard care is already quite intensive in a substantial number of cases. This relatively high level of usual care may have resulted in a limited contrast between the intervention and usual care group and might be a reason for the lack of effects. The non-significant findings are in accordance with recent meta-analytic reviews which demonstrated modest evidence for significant effects of psychosocial interventions <xref rid="pone.0030936-Olazaran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Schoenmakers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Combined intervention programs for both the caregiver and person with dementia were often effective in delaying long stay care admittance, but to a lesser extent in improving caregivers' mental health <xref rid="pone.0030936-Smits1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The most successful interventions used a psycho-educational or psychotherapeutic approach, addressed multiple stressors, were better adapted to the individual needs of the caregivers and provided a higher amount and intensity of support <xref rid="pone.0030936-Brodaty1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Zarit1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Most positive effects were found in the subgroup of female caregivers and caregivers caring for people with a dementia diagnosis &#x02018;not otherwise specified&#x02019;<xref rid="pone.0030936-vanMierlo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>The lack of effectiveness in this study may also be due to the fact that the participants' compliance with the intervention was not optimal. Several strategies were taken to maintain a high level of participation. The sessions were scheduled at the convenience of the family as much as possible and the counselors provided the family meetings in the caregivers' homes if they were unable to leave the patients. Nevertheless, about one-quarter of the intervention caregivers participated in no family meeting at all and about half of them completed the majority of the sessions. However, this could also mean that this type of intervention is not what these relatively young caregivers think that they need.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the lack of protective effect in our study may be that the timing of the intervention was not appropriate. In contrast with some other studies evaluating family meetings, we excluded caregivers with major depression or anxiety at intake to be able to evaluate preventive effects on onset of such a disorder. Almost 30&#x00025; had baseline CES-D scores above the cutoff, indicative of clinically relevant symptoms of depression. This was lower than the 43&#x00025; of the caregivers who had scores at baseline above the cutoff on the Geriatric Depression Scale indicating possible clinical depression at baseline in the NYU Caregiver Intervention study. Current research in noncaregiver populations suggests that prevention is most likely to be effective when targeting people with increased symptoms levels <xref rid="pone.0030936-vantVeerTazelaar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030936-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indicated prevention might also be a promising research strategy for the caregiver population and perhaps family meetings interventions would be most useful to caregivers with more severe symptom levels at baseline. Furthermore, a recent study presenting an overview of successful psychosocial interventions in subgroups of caregivers of people with dementia, showed that the presence of mental health problems was frequently related to positive intervention effects for caregivers <xref rid="pone.0030936-vanMierlo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, evaluation of possible effect modification by increased initial depressive or anxiety symptom severity in our study did not show more benefit of the intervention over usual care.</p><p>Unlike the NYU Caregiver Intervention-model, the two individual and four family counseling sessions were conducted with a frequency of every 2 to 3 months instead of offering all sessions in the first four months after enrollment. This might indicate that, in order to affect change in support for the primary caregiver, family meetings should be conducted with greater frequency in a shorter period of time. A pilot with some families prior to the study was an important reason to choose a larger time span between the session. Also, from the evaluation forms filled in by the intervention caregivers who participated in the trial, we found that most of them were satisfied with the amount of sessions they received. Perhaps caregivers did prefer a relatively low frequency, because a majority of them also used other supportive services. This shows an important dilemma of following the participant's preferences on the one hand, and on the other hand stick to the current evidence that interventions tend to have stronger effects if they involve more frequent interactions <xref rid="pone.0030936-Brodaty1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Pinquart1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>It is also possible that effects might become significant in the long term. In the NYU Caregiver Intervention study, changes in depressive symptoms were significant approximately 6 months after the last counseling session (approximately 10 months after enrollment). The 12 months follow up period after enrollment in our study might be too short to detect significant effects, but this is not very likely in view of the current findings.</p><p>According to the random selection of audiotapes that we listened to, the standardized forms that were completed by the counselors after each session and the contact between the research team and counselors during the intervention period, the counselors mostly carried out the intervention as instructed by the manual and during the training organized prior to the study. Furthermore, all counselors were uniformly trained, used a structured manual and may be assumed to be adequately qualified to lead the family meetings. Therefore, we might assume that the actual quality of the intervention was no reason for the lack of effects in our study. Considering the randomized design, the adjustment for baseline differences associated with the outcomes, the relatively large number of subjects, the low drop out rate (from follow-up) and the adjustment for possible clustering effects, it seems unlikely that the non-significant results were due to methodological flaws.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Generalisability</title><p>We performed a randomized controlled trial with only a few exclusion criteria. A substantial number of caregivers invited for the study were not willing to participate, mainly due to a lack of perceived need for this intervention. Although this limits the feasibility of this intervention for many caregivers, the results reflect the effectiveness in usual routine care for caregivers who were interested in this intervention. Caregivers in our sample were predominantly women caring for a &#x02013;relatively young- demented spouse, while according to population based studies about half of the demented patients in this age group are women <xref rid="pone.0030936-Hofman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030936-Hofman2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. A care setting based study like our study starts with people who asked for care or a diagnostic assessment and therefore the gender distribution could differ from the one reported in population based studies. Participants in our study did not differ significantly from the persons who declined participation with regard to gender, patient-carer relation, and the service they were recruitment from, and therefore, our sample seems to be representative for the population that receives treatment or diagnostic assessment at these services.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study did not show any preventive effects of family meetings compared with usual care. The substantial number of invited caregivers unwilling to participate and poor intervention uptake indicates that family meetings are only acceptable for some of the caregiver population. This also reflects the diversity among caregivers in their need for different types and intensity of support. Although this intervention could not prevent caregivers from developing depression and anxiety, certain family caregivers may feel supported and satisfied about this intervention. Although, from our results no subgroups emerge for whom the intervention could work for, it can be hypothesized that caregivers with certain characteristics we did not take into account (like coping style) might benefit more from family meetings. The finding that caregivers were more satisfied about the family meetings when experiencing a higher lack of family support prior to the intervention might indicate that family meetings better fulfill the needs of the caregiver when a certain lack of family support is experienced.</p><p>Researchers might consider studying the effects of organizing family meetings for specific subgroups of caregivers or with a therapeutic purpose. Further research should determine whether family meetings alone, might then be more beneficial if delivered more intensively over a shorter period of time or whether the intervention's effectiveness may be derived from its multicomponent nature. Other studies should be conducted to evaluate the transportability of evidence-based interventions such as the NYUCI to cultures in which usual care provide substantial support for family caregivers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0030936.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
