Following ethical approval and familiarisation, 44 adolescents (12.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.6 y) completed an exercise (E) and resting (R) trial in a counter-balanced, randomised crossover design. The exercise trial comprised of 10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;s running sprints, interspersed by 50&#x000a0;s active recovery (walking). A battery of cognitive function tests (Stroop, Digit Symbol Substitution (DSST) and Corsi blocks tests) were completed 30&#x000a0;min pre-exercise, immediately post-exercise and 45&#x000a0;min post-exercise. Data were analysed using mixed effect models with repeated measures. Response times on the simple level of the Stroop test were significantly quicker 45&#x000a0;min following sprint-based exercise (R: 818&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;33&#x000a0;ms, E: 772&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;26&#x000a0;ms; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.027) and response times on the complex level of the Stroop test were quicker immediately following the sprint-based exercise (R: 1095&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;36&#x000a0;ms, E: 1043&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;37&#x000a0;ms; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.038), while accuracy was maintained. Sprint-based exercise had no immediate or delayed effects on the number of items recalled on the Corsi blocks test (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.289) or substitutions made during the DSST (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.689). The effect of high intensity sprint-based exercise on adolescents' cognitive function was dependant on the component of cognitive function examined. Executive function was enhanced following exercise, demonstrated by improved response times on the Stroop test, whilst visuo-spatial memory and general psycho-motor speed were unaffected. These data support the inclusion of high-intensity sprint-based exercise for adolescents during the school day to enhance cognition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>First study to examine the effects of high intensity, sprint-based exercise</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Multiple components of cognitive function and time course of the effects examined</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Speed of executive function enhanced immediately and 45&#x000a0;min post-exercise</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>No effect of exercise on visuo-spatial memory or general psychomotor speed</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Opportunities for high intensity activity should be incorporated in the school day</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>High-intensity exercise</kwd><kwd>Executive function</kwd><kwd>Memory</kwd><kwd>Information processing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a substantial body of literature suggesting that exercise has beneficial effects upon cognitive function in adult populations (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lambourne and Tomporowski, 2010</xref>). Although less work has been conducted in adolescents, there is some evidence to suggest that exercise is also beneficial for cognitive function in this population (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Best, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ellemberg and St-Louis-Desch&#x000ea;nes, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hillman et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Stroth et al., 2009</xref>) where it is of particular importance for academic achievement (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Morales et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Tomporowski et al., 2015</xref>). The viewpoint that exercise is beneficial for cognition in young people is also supported by an effect size of 0.32 in the meta-analysis of <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Sibley and Etnier (2003)</xref>.</p><p>However, the literature surrounding the effects of exercise on cognitive function can be difficult to interpret due to the many moderating variables in the exercise-cognition relationship, including the intensity, duration and modality of the exercise, as well as the component of cognitive function examined (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). Of particular interest in young people is the effect of high intensity intermittent activities, given that this is the mode of exercise that young people most frequently engage in (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Welsman, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, it has been suggested that 95% of young people's &#x02018;bouts&#x02019; of physical activity are less than 15&#x000a0;s in duration (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 1995</xref>) and evidence has shown that young people's activity patterns are sporadic and very rarely consist of sustained moderate or vigorous intensity activity (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Welsman, 2006</xref>). Despite this the studies examining the effect of exercise on young people's cognitive function have focussed upon more continuous exercise models such as walking (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hillman et al., 2009</xref>), running (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012b</xref>) and cycling (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ellemberg and St-Louis-Desch&#x000ea;nes, 2010</xref>), with no studies to date examining the effects of high intensity intermittent exercise.</p><p>In adults (27 males), one study has compared the effects of high intensity exercise (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;min running sprints) and moderate intensity exercise (40&#x000a0;min running) on learning performance (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the findings suggest that high intensity exercise was the most beneficial for immediate learning performance, indicative of enhanced cognitive function (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2007</xref>). The authors go on to suggest that these effects may be influenced by higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and catecholamine concentrations following the high intensity exercise (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2007</xref>). However, this study was conducted in an adult population and meta-analyses have suggested that age is a moderating variable in the exercise-cognition relationship (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Sibley and Etnier, 2003</xref>), potentially due to the fact that young people have a larger brain weight relative to their body weight and a greater metabolic rate per unit of brain weight (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hoyland et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the above differences in the BDNF and catecholamine response to high intensity intermittent activity (compared to the more commonly assessed moderate intensity activity), psychological mechanisms such as exercise-induced arousal and mood may also moderate the exercise-cognition relationship. The increase in arousal during and following exercise has been suggested to affect cognitive function (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">McMorris, 2009</xref>), with exercise intensity affecting subsequent changes in arousal (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Kamijo et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, mood has been suggested to affect cognitive function and exercise of differing intensities has been shown to differentially affect mood (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy and Newton, 1997</xref>). Therefore, despite clear scientific rationale, the effect of high intensity exercise on cognition in adolescents has not yet been examined.</p><p>It is also important that a number of domains of cognitive function are examined due to evidence suggesting that exercise differentially affects different domains of cognitive function (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). For example, in the meta-analysis of <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2012)</xref> exercise was shown to enhance executive function but have no effect on memory. Furthermore, it is also important for studies to examine the time-course of the changes in cognitive function following exercise, with much of the literature to date only examining cognitive function immediately following exercise (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ellemberg and St-Louis-Desch&#x000ea;nes, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Stroth et al., 2009</xref>). However, whilst the immediate effects are of interest, the delayed effects (for example, 45&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min post-exercise) are perhaps of greater importance because this is when the young people will be in their next academic lesson following a Physical Education lesson and/or break/recess, and where cognitive function will influence their learning. Interestingly, it has been suggested using a meta-analysis approach that similar effects are seen immediately following exercise and after a delay (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>), but no study to date has examined both the immediate and delayed effects of exercise in young people in the same study.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that a 10&#x000a0;min bout of repeated (~&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;s) high intensity sprint-based running exercise would enhance cognitive function in an adolescent population, both immediately and following a delay. This novel study is important not only because high intensity intermittent activity is commonplace in young people, but also should beneficial effects be demonstrated, this could form the basis of future interventions aimed at increasing both physical activity levels and cognitive function/academic achievement in young people.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Forty-seven schoolchildren aged 12.6 (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.6) years were recruited to participate in the study. However, 3 participants failed to complete the study because they were absent from school for one of the experimental trials, thus 44 participants (21 male, 23 female) completed the study. During familiarisation, simple measures of height, body mass and waist circumference were taken. Height was measured using a Leicester Height Measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany), accurate to 0.1&#x000a0;cm. Body mass was measured using a Seca 770 digital scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany), accurate to 0.1&#x000a0;kg. These measures allowed the determination of Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated by dividing body mass [kg] by the square of the height [m<sup>2</sup>]. Waist circumference was measured at the narrowest point of the torso between the xiphoid process of the sternum and the iliac crest, to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm. For descriptive purposes, the participant's anthropometric characteristics were (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD): height 154.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8.3&#x000a0;cm; body mass: 45.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.0&#x000a0;kg; body mass index: 18.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.2&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (51.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;29.3 percentile); waist circumference: 65.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7.5&#x000a0;cm.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title><p>The study was approved by the institution's ethical advisory committee. Participants were recruited from a local secondary school and in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the British Education Research Authority for school-based research, school-level consent was obtained from head teachers. In addition, written parental informed consent was obtained and a health screen questionnaire completed to ensure all participants were in good health. In addition, participants indicated their assent to take part in the study.</p><p>Each participant undertook a familiarisation session, which preceded the first of two experimental trials by seven days. During familiarisation, the protocol of the study was explained and participants were provided with an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the methods involved, which included completing the battery of cognitive function tests. In addition, participants were provided with an opportunity to ask questions and clarify any part of the tests they did not fully understand.</p><p>The study employed a randomised crossover design, with participants blind until arrival at school on each day of testing. The experimental trials consisted of an exercise trial and a resting trial, thus participants acted as their own controls. During the exercise trial, participants completed 10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;s sprints followed by 50&#x000a0;s active recovery 60&#x000a0;min following breakfast consumption. On the resting trial, participants remained seated in a classroom and continued to rest during this time. Trials were scheduled seven days apart and participants reported to school at the normal time.

Following this meal, participants fasted from 10&#x000a0;pm. In order to maintain euhydration, participants were allowed to drink water ad libitum during this time. In addition, participants avoided any unusually vigorous exercise for 24&#x000a0;h prior to each experimental trial. Prior to each experimental trial a telephone call was made to participants to remind them of this information.</p><p>Following the overnight fast, participants reported to school at the normal time and completed the mood questionnaire. Due to the well documented effect of breakfast consumption (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>) and breakfast composition (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012a</xref>) on adolescents' cognitive function, participants were provided with a standardised breakfast, identical to that used in previous research (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012a</xref>). The breakfast consisted of cornflakes, milk, white bread (toasted) and margarine, and provided 1.5&#x000a0;g carbohydrate per kg body mass. As an example, the breakfast for a participant with a body mass of 50&#x000a0;kg consisted of 55&#x000a0;g cornflakes (Kelloggs, UK), 216&#x000a0;g 1% fat milk (Sainsbury's, UK), 42&#x000a0;g Kingsmill thick slice white bread (Kingsmill, UK) and 6&#x000a0;g margarine (Flora original, Flora, UK), providing a total energy content of 422&#x000a0;kcal and a macronutrient profile of 75&#x000a0;g carbohydrate (71% of energy intake), 14.3&#x000a0;g protein (14% of energy intake) and 7.2&#x000a0;g fat (15% of energy intake).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Exercise protocol</title><p>The exercise component of the study was completed in a school sports hall in groups of 8&#x02013;12 participants. Prior to the main exercise protocol participants completed a standard warm-up, consisting of levels 1 and 2 of the multi-stage fitness test (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Ramsbottom et al., 1988</xref>), followed by lower limb stretches.</p><p>Participants performed high-intensity intermittent running, consisting of 10&#x000a0;s sprints followed by 50&#x000a0;s active recovery (walking). This was repeated 10 times, thus participants performed 10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;s sprints overall, and total exercise time was 10&#x000a0;min. Clear instructions were given to participants as follows:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;The exercise you are going to be doing will involve 10 seconds sprinting followed by 50 seconds active recovery/walking.

The sprint you are going to be completing is a high intensity run. For health and safety reasons, please consider the need to turn at the end of each 20 metre shuttle and be particularly careful to stay in your lane as you turn. Please ensure that you run at a pace that you can maintain for all 10 sprints. This may mean that you run just below your maximum running pace.&#x0201d;</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>Following these instructions, experimenters checked with participants to ensure understanding and there was an opportunity for participants to ask any questions regarding the exercise. At the end of every 10&#x000a0;s sprint, heart rate was recorded (Polar Wearlink heart rate monitor; Polar, Finland), and after sprint 5 and sprint 10, each participant's rating of perceived exertion was taken using the Robertson OMNI scale (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Utter et al., 2002</xref>). Heart rate was also taken at several time points (15&#x000a0;min, 45&#x000a0;min, 90&#x000a0;min and 115&#x000a0;min) during both the exercise and resting trials.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Cognitive function tests</title><p>The battery of cognitive function tests consisted of the Stroop test, digit symbol substitution test and Corsi blocks test. The tests were administered via a laptop computer (Toshiba M750, Toshiba, Japan) and lasted approximately 10&#x000a0;min. Written instructions appeared on the screen at the start of each test, which were repeated verbally by an investigator. Each test was preceded by 3&#x02013;6 practice stimuli, where feedback was provided regarding whether each participant's response was correct or not. Data from these practice stimuli were discarded and once the test started no feedback was provided. The cognitive function tests were administered in a classroom to groups of 8&#x02013;12 participants at any one time, in silence and separated such that participants could not interact with each other during the cognitive testing. Participants were provided with sound cancelling headphones to minimise external disturbances. The same testing procedure has been previously used successfully in a similar study population (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>) and the tests were administered in the order they are described here.</p><sec id="s0040"><label>2.5.1</label><title>Stroop test</title><p>The Stroop test measures the sensitivity to interference and the ability to suppress an automated response (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Stroop, 1935</xref>). The Stroop test consisted of two levels. Both levels involved the test word being placed in the centre of the screen, with the target and distractor presented randomly on the right or left of the test word. The target position was counterbalanced for the left and right side within each test level. The participant was asked to respond as quickly as possible, using the left and right arrow keys, to identify the position of the target word.</p><p>The simple level contained 20 stimuli, where the test word was printed in white on the centre of the screen and the participant had to select the target word, from the target and distractor, which were also printed in white. The colour-interference (complex) level contained 40 stimuli and involved the participant selecting the colour the test word was written in, rather than the actual word (which was an incongruent colour), again using the right and left arrow keys to identify the target. The colour-interference level is a commonly used measure of selective attention and executive function (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Leh et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Miyake et al., 2000</xref>).

During the 12 trials, sequence length increased by 1 block location each time the participant correctly repeated the sequence. Any error in repeating a sequence led to the next sequence being shortened by one location. The variable of interest was mean memory span, calculated as the average length of the three longest correctly repeated sequences.

However, there was no effect of sprint-based exercise on visuo-spatial working memory or general psychomotor speed (as assessed by the Corsi-blocks test and DSST respectively). The only component of mood to be affected by the sprint-based exercise was tiredness, which was significantly higher immediately following the exercise when compared to the resting trial. Therefore, the improvement in response times on the Stroop test immediately following exercise was evident despite a negative change in mood (higher self-report tiredness).</p><p>The present study is the first to examine the effects of sprint-based exercise on cognitive function in an adolescent population. The beneficial effects reported here are of particular interest given that the exercise model used more closely reflects the high-intensity, intermittent nature of physical activity patterns in young people (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that additional opportunities for high intensity physical activity incorporated into the school day could enhance executive function, and subsequently academic achievement (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Duckworth and Seligman, 2005</xref>), in addition to the physical, emotional and social benefits of exercise which have been previously documented (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2013</xref>). This is a key consideration for school policy makers who often reduce the amount of time spent in Physical Education in favour of other &#x02018;academic&#x02019; lessons (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the effects of sprint-based exercise on cognitive function may be specific to the component of cognitive function examined. Specifically, whilst executive function was enhanced (as demonstrated by enhanced response times on the Stroop test with no concurrent decrease in accuracy), there was no effect on general information processing speed or visuo-spatial memory (as assessed by the DSST and Corsi blocks tapping test respectively). The beneficial effects on executive function are of particular interest given that executive function is responsible for more complex cognitive functions and decision making, which has been shown to be particularly important for reading ability (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Savage et al., 2006</xref>) and academic achievement (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Duckworth and Seligman, 2005</xref>) and are similar to the magnitude previously demonstrated following breakfast consumption and exercise (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the findings of the present study (examining sprint-based exercise) and those in the literature (examining moderate intensity exercise, e.g. <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Best (2010)</xref>; <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al.

(2009)</xref>; <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Stroth et al. (2009)</xref>) suggest that an acute bout of exercise enhances subsequent cognitive function in adolescents. However, the present study is the first to examine the effects of sprint-based exercise on adolescent's cognitive function, which may be different to those of more moderate intensity exercise, given the psychological, neuroendocrinological and metabolic mechanisms proposed to be affecting the exercise-cognition relationship (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Audiffren, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Kamijo et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy and Newton, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lambourne and Tomporowski, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">McMorris, 2009</xref>). Specifically, the present study assessed the effect of high intensity sprint-based exercise on mood, with higher self-report tiredness seen immediately following exercise, with no changes in self-report energy, tension or calmness. Therefore, the improvement in executive function is seen despite a negative change in mood state, suggesting that mechanisms other than mood moderate the exercise-cognition relationship. That mechanisms other than mood moderate the exercise-cognition relationship is supported by the only study to directly compare moderate and high intensity on cognition, albeit in an adult population (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, high intensity exercise was found to be more beneficial for cognitive function and it was suggested that this effect may be due to elevated BDNF and catecholamine concentrations (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the enhancement of response times on the Stroop test following high intensity sprint-based exercise is contrary to what would be expected given the suggestion of <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">McMorris et al. (2016)</xref> that the stress of high intensity exercise (and the subsequent catecholamine response) has a negative effect on central executive tasks. However, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">McMorris et al. (2016)</xref> also suggest that the processing of sensory information by the parietal lobe, required for the completion of the Stroop test (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 2000</xref>), is enhanced by the catecholamine response to high intensity exercise. Therefore, it could be that the positive effects on the processing of sensory information outweigh the negative effects on the central executive. However, these suggestions are based upon findings in animal models (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Arnsten, 2011</xref>) and must be inferred cautiously in humans, where the effects warrant further investigation.</p><p>Another possible explanation of the domain specific effects seen in the present study, it is possible that whilst the Stroop test was sensitive enough to elucidate the beneficial effects of sprint-based exercise on adolescent's cognition, this was not the case for the DSST or Corsi blocks test. Upon inspection of <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, it is possible that the interaction effects seen on the simple level of the Stroop test are due to a slowing of response times 45&#x000a0;min post-exercise on the resting trial. However, on the colour-interference level there is a clearer enhancement of response times following the sprint-based exercise. This may suggest that more complex tasks show a greater beneficial effect of exercise, when compared to simpler tasks, in line with the effects of breakfast on cognition in young people (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012b</xref>). However, it is also possible that the effects of sprint-based exercise on cognitive function are domain specific, in line with previous reviews (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Sibley and Etnier, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, a study by <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Budde et al. (2008)</xref> demonstrated that attention (as assessed by the d2 test) was enhanced following a maximal exercise test in young adults. However, the authors also suggested that this effect may be influenced by the habitual physical activity levels of the participants, with individuals who are more active demonstrating a greater exercise-induced improvement in attention. Future research is therefore required to examine both the domain-specific effects of high intensity exercise on cognition and the effect of baseline physical activity (and fitness) levels on this relationship.</p><p>Given the novelty of the present study it is difficult to draw firm conclusions in adolescents, but it would appear that a high intensity sprint-based exercise model has the potential to enhance executive function in this population. Interestingly, the beneficial effects were seen both immediately and 45&#x000a0;min post-exercise. Much of the literature to date has focussed only on the effects on cognitive function immediately post-exercise (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ellemberg and St-Louis-Desch&#x000ea;nes, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Stroth et al., 2009</xref>), but the present study has documented both the immediate and delayed effects. The findings of the present study are however in line with previous reviews in adults, suggesting that exercise enhances cognition both immediately post-exercise and following a delay. The time course of the exercise induced effects on cognition should continue to be examined in future studies, to allow schools and school policy makers to incorporate opportunities for physical activity, such as physically active breaks/recess in to the school day, to optimise learning.</p><p>A particular strength of the present study is the control of breakfast and the meal consumed the previous evening for each experimental trial, an advance on many previous studies that have not controlled diet. It is possible therefore that previous studies have their findings confounded by the well documented acute effects of nutrition on cognition in young people (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hoyland et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, previous research suggests that breakfast and mid-morning exercise may interact to affect cognitive function in both adolescent (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>) and adult (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Veasey et al., 2013</xref>) populations. Future research should continue to examine the combined acute effects of diet and exercise on cognitive function, including the interactive effects of nutrition with exercise of differing intensities and modalities.</p><p>Overall, the findings of the present study demonstrate that high intensity intermittent sprint-based exercise enhances executive function in young people, both immediately and 45&#x000a0;min post-exercise. Future research should continue to examine this relationship, including examining multiple components of cognitive function and the differential effects of exercise of differing intensities on young people's cognition, perhaps with the inclusion of a walking control group to allow direct comparison of differing exercise intensities. Furthermore, mechanistic measures such as BDNF, catecholamines or brain imaging techniques should be included in future research wherever possible, whilst also working within the ethical constraints of conducting research studies in young people.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>American Academy of Pediatrics</surname></name></person-group><article-title>The crucial role of recess in school</article-title><source>Pediatrics</source><volume>131</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>183</fpage><lpage>187</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23277311</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Armstrong</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Welsman</surname><given-names>J.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The physical activity patterns of European youth with reference to methods of assessment</article-title><source>Sports Med.</source><volume>36</volume><year>2006</year><fpage>1067</fpage><lpage>1086</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17123328</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arnsten</surname><given-names>A.F.T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Catecholamine influences on dorsolateral prefrontal cortical networks</article-title><source>Biol.
