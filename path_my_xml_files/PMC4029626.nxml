After an acute myocardial infarction (MI) the risk of being depressed is approximately 3 times increased as compared with the general population <xref rid="pone.0097553-Lichtman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In out-patients the 12-month odds ratio of major depression has been found to be 2.3 times higher in individuals with cardiac disease as compared with those with no medical illness <xref rid="pone.0097553-Egede1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In initially healthy people clinical depression as well as depressive mood is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing IHD <xref rid="pone.0097553-Rugulies1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Further, depression after a MI doubles both the risk of a cardiac re-event during the first 2 years post MI, as well the risk of 2 years mortality <xref rid="pone.0097553-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Depression, quality of life and general well-being is all part of the chronic stress concept <xref rid="pone.0097553-Bech1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Stress is vaguely defined but is generally accepted as a risk factor for a poor outcome in IHD <xref rid="pone.0097553-Rosengren1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Chronic stress is associated with cardiovascular re-events and death from IHD and patients with MI have been shown to have higher stress levels when measured both as stress at work, stress at home, financial stress and major life-event stress <xref rid="pone.0097553-Rosengren1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-Rosengren2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Chronic stress and depression is associated with widespread increased pain sensitivity, leading to both hyperalgesia (pain induced by noxious stimuli) and allodynia (pain induced by non-noxious stimuli) <xref rid="pone.0097553-SpeziaAdachi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-Richebe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The increase in pain sensitivity might be due to the neuroplastic effects of chronic stress on pain circuitry i.e. the diffuse noxious inhibitory control system (DNIC) <xref rid="pone.0097553-SpeziaAdachi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-Reidler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. DNIC is an endogenous pathway mediating inhibition of lamina I neurons in the spinal dorsal root when pain signals ascend from the periphery through sensory C fiber neurons distributed wide spread over the body in the epidermis and up through the spinal cord <xref rid="pone.0097553-Reidler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Patients with hypersensitivity to pain have been shown to have an impaired DNIC modulation <xref rid="pone.0097553-ArendtNielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-ArendtNielsen2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Theoretically an intervention aiming at restoring this afferent-efferent disturbance may be beneficial for treating the increased pain sensitivity and at the same time lowering the stress-level and depressive symptoms. It has previously been theorized that therapies such as acupuncture may exert their effects through activation of DNIC <xref rid="pone.0097553-Reidler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>The gold standard in measuring pain sensitivity is by algometry. Recently a simple and handheld algometric device has been designed to asses pressure pain sensitivity (PPS) <xref rid="pone.0097553-Ballegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The PPS measure has in patients with IHD been found to be significantly correlated to the major depression inventory score (MDI), WHO-5&#x02019;s well-being index as well as to the SF-36 quality of life (QOL) score <xref rid="pone.0097553-Bergmann1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated the effect of various stress-reducing interventions in patients with IHD and some have shown to improve the prognosis and to reduce the risk of new cardiovascular events <xref rid="pone.0097553-Whalley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-Gulliksson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We hypothesize that an intervention built on an increased focus on stress and the ability to perform stress reduction should be beneficial for patients with IHD. In analogy to people with diabetes measuring blood glucose levels, a therapy based on a daily semi-objective stress-measurements based on PPS followed by stress-reducing actions theoretically leads to increased empowerment and may have a positive effect on stress-parameters.</p><p>Acupressure, i.e. applying a continuous pressure for approximately one minute at specific hyperalgesic points at the body, has been shown to reduce both local and spreading pain in chronic low back pain and neck pain syndromes <xref rid="pone.0097553-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and we have observed that acupressure results in an acute reduction in pain sensitivity and PPS <xref rid="pone.0097553-Ballegaard2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Thus we hypothesized that the combination of daily self-measurements of PPS aiming at increased empowerment followed by acupressure aiming to restore DNIC, together would resolve in a reduction of the following elements of chronic stress: Depressive symptoms measured by MDI, general well-being measured by WHO-5, and physically and mentally QOL measured by SF-36 QOL-score.</p><p>Aiming to test this hypothesis we performed an observer blinded randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment over 3 month in which the active group measured PPS twice daily followed by acupressure as mandatory action. Our primary end point was changes in MDI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The original protocols and a CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097553.s001">Protocol S1</xref> (Danish), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097553.s002">Protocol S2</xref> (English), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097553.s003">Checklist S1</xref>).

These subgroup analyses, however, were hampered by a limited sample size.</p><p>The primary endpoint was a reduction in MDI. MDI was chosen as a well validated often used psychometric questionnaire on depressive symptoms. It is well known that patients with IHD as well as other chronic diseases have increased levels of depressive symptoms which leads to a poor outcome <xref rid="pone.0097553-Barth1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The intervention resulted in a reduction in MDI of 22% in the active group while the TAU group only demonstrated a reduction of 12%, resulting in a significant difference between the active and the TAU group at follow up. This corresponded to a small effect size of 0.12. When looking at the subgroups, however, the reduction in MDI was much greater resulting in an effect size of 0.35 in the MDI&#x02265;15 subgroup representing participants with the most depressive symptoms and 0.52 for the high PPS high CSS group representing the participants with an elevated chronic stress level. These effect sizes are clinically significant <xref rid="pone.0097553-Bayer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus our findings point to a greater effect of our intervention among more psychologically vulnerable subjects. These data on effect size should be compared to the effect size of antidepressants found in placebo-controlled clinical trials of treatment resistant patients with overt depression of approximately 0.40, although our patients did not have overt depression <xref rid="pone.0097553-Bech3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Further, a meta-analysis on exercise training, a well-known and beneficial treatment, on depressive symptoms among patients with a chronic illness, demonstrated an effect size of 0.30 in patients with mild-to-moderate depression <xref rid="pone.0097553-Herring1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Similar to a positive effect on MDI we found a beneficial effect of the intervention on general well-being as measured by WHO-5&#x02032;s well-being index. The intervention resulted in an increase in WHO-5 with a small effect size, however subgroup analysis demonstrated a substantially increase in well-being, although the difference at three months between the active and the TAU group, did not reach statistically significance probably due to a limited number of subjects in the subgroup analyses.</p><p>The intervention was based on the concept that self-measurement of pain sensation threshold measured by PPS resulted in an awareness of ones current stress-level, leading to reflection as well as to action i.e. increased empowerment, aiming at improving overall well-being.</p><p>Acupressure was the only mandatory action for reducing pain sensation in the intervention program. General advice about stress reduction was presented for both the active and the TAU group in the form of a booklet on stress-coping <xref rid="pone.0097553-Netterstrm1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Parts of the intervention program have been used with success previously in patients with advanced angina pectoris in a non-randomized fashion <xref rid="pone.0097553-Ballegaard4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-Ballegaard5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The intervention procedure was accepted by the participants of the active group, in terms of repeated PPS measurements reported the website. The participants reported in mean 90 measurements over the three month period. This is probably a lower bound since the participants might have performed PPS measurements without reporting them on the website. The current study serves as proof of concept concerning repeated PPS measurements at home followed by acupressure and reflection in general as a stress-reducing intervention.</p><p>PPS measures pain sensitivity threshold like other algometers within pain research. We have recently demonstrated a close correlation between PPS and another pressure pain algometer <xref rid="pone.0097553-Bergmann1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>An inherent weakness of pressure pain algometry is the fact that there is no objective measure of pain threshold since it is the subject itself that reacts to discomfort and ends the measurement. Therefore a potential bias to repeated measurements is habituation both mentally and physically. If present this could result in a progressive reduction in PPS over time. We have performed validation studies in which we have found a very close association between two measurements performed within 5 seconds as well as with one day between measurements <xref rid="pone.0097553-Ballegaard4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This suggests that a drift towards lowering of the PPS value due to repeated measurements is probably of minor importance.</p><p>In the present study the PPS measure was reduced with 22 units in the active group. The PPS device is constructed such that a reduction of 30 units equals a doubling of the pressure applied to the sternum. This quite robust change also speaks against a drift in PPS sensation due to habituation.</p><p>The instructors measuring PPS at baseline as well as after three months were blinded to the randomization results, the answers of the questionnaires, the results of the PPS home measurements and to the concrete PPS result while measuring at baseline and follow up visits. The latter is due to the construction of the PPS device, which first shows the result of the pressure when ending the pressure, thus revealing only the final result.</p><p>Chronic illness in general is associated with both stress and depressive symptoms which includes IHD <xref rid="pone.0097553-Herring2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Chronic stress and depression are associated with increased pain sensitivity, clinically presenting with widespread hyperalgesia <xref rid="pone.0097553-Richebe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A 28% reduction in pain sensitivity from baseline to follow up as found in the present study may be of clinical relevance.</p><p>Whether the reduction in pain sensitivity is the primary event leading to reduced feeling of depressive symptoms and increased well-being as found by an improvement in MDI and WHO-5 results, or the intervention works primarily by changing depressive symptoms and well-being and thereafter leads to a reduction in pain sensitivity is not clear. Concerning the mandatory intervention, acupressure, it is a well known clinical observation, that acupressure on a distinct sore point of the body leads to pain reduction locally with a spreading effect into the surroundings, which also has been demonstrated in females with chronic neck pain <xref rid="pone.0097553-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Further, the use of acupressure in low back pain has been proven in a RCT setting <xref rid="pone.0097553-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We have observed an acute reduction in PPS due to acupressure over the sternum, and it is postulated that acupressure works by reducing pain sensitivity by restoring DNIC <xref rid="pone.0097553-Reidler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. If this is the primary effect of our intervention, the primary event will be reduced pain sensitivity. On the other hand the reflection on ones stress level based on repeated PPS measurements could also be the leading event resulting in increased empowerment which might result in a reduction of depressive symptoms and increased well-being as the primary effect. Several studies have found that psychological interventions including cognitive, behavioral and educational approaches all aiming at enhanced empowerment has been effective in reducing depression and anxiety in patients with IHD <xref rid="pone.0097553-Whalley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097553-Van1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Cognitive stress-reducing therapy has also been found to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events <xref rid="pone.0097553-Gulliksson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These studies imply that the empowering part of the intervention may be the primary effect.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><sec id="s5a1"><title>Limitations</title><p>We aimed at 300 and included 213 participants. The power analysis was based on an effect size of 0.40, but we only obtained an effect size of 0.12. This means that the study ended up underpowered. However looking at both primary endpoint (MDI) and the other endpoints we found a rather clear tendency towards a beneficial effect on all parameters studied during intervention. This indicates that all bights the effect size was rather small, it seems real and is not a result of a type 1 error. Although the study was underpowered we did find significant changes probably avoiding a rather large risk of a type 2 error.</p><p>The randomization procedure included DM and chronic heart failure yes/no, however, the randomization ended up with significantly more diabetics in the active group and in contrast less patients with chronic heart failure compared with the TAU group. Given the small number of diabetics and patients with heart failure the consequence of this randomization failure is probably mild or absent.</p><p>The study was single blinded. This was intentionally since the intervention was of an open nature i.e. the participants should reflect on the PPS measurements and also because sham PPS measurement giving false values did not seem ethically acceptable. However, the single-blinded design may have caused bias to the results of the intervention and may have affected the responses from the participants regarding the questionnaires. With regard to the PPS measurements they were performed by professionals who did not have knowledge about the allocation to active or control group. Further the PPS device was designed in a way making the measure non-visible before the end of each measurement for both instructor and patient. Thus the results from PPS measurements can be regarded as double blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s5a2"><title>Strengths</title><p>Rather few in- and exclusion criteria make our study representative to most patients with IHD, further the intervention technique used is easy to adapt and use, and without side effects.</p><p>Statistical evaluation was performed by an ITT analysis using all randomized subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;106). This is the most correct, however not always used in RCT <xref rid="pone.0097553-Abraha1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Self-measurements of PPS followed by acupressure as a mandatory action and otherwise individual reflection, in subjects with stable IHD resulted in a reduction in PPS, reduced amounts of depressive symptoms and increased well-being. This effect seemed more pronounced among the most psychologically vulnerable subjects. Due to the study ending up being underpowered further studies which are properly powered should be performed in order to establish the impact of this new type of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Perspectives</title><p>The concept of biofeedback guided stress handling, i.e. increased patient empowerment, based on frequent self-measurement of PPS might be broadened out to other chronic illnesses like diabetes, as well as to otherwise healthy subjects on work places where the employees demonstrate signs of increased stress due to a high psychological stress demand.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097553.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
