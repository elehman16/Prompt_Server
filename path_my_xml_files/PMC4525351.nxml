Pain has persistent and untreated effects on most of the body systems and results in development of complications, chronic pain, and increased length of stay. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the implementation of a pain management program on the length of stay in patients with decreased level of consciousness, admitted in Al-Zahra hospital intensive care units (ICUs) in 2013.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this clinical trial, 50 subjects with decreased level of consciousness were selected by convenient sampling from the ICU wards of Al-Zahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran and were randomly assigned to two groups of study and control.

Therefore, pain assessment in ICUs, especially, assessment of patients&#x02019; response to treatment should be conducted regularly and continuously.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>If pain is not managed appropriately during patients&#x02019; stay in the ICU, their prolonged hospitalization in the ICU and lowered speed of recovery result in dissatisfaction and suffering, as well as confusion of the medical team and increased risk of re-hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] On the other hand, inappropriate pain management, especially in ICUs in which many patients are not capable of expressing their pain is a complicated issue.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Research conducted in this field showed that the financial burden related to inefficient pain management is about US$ 635 billion, i.e. 25% of all medical care costs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Health care organizations that administer evidence-based pain management interventions showed an average reduction of US$ 1500 for each hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Meanwhile, pain assessment and management in mechanically ventilated patients who are mostly hospitalized in ICU is difficult and delayed due to changes in the level of consciousness followed by taking sedatives, head trauma, or the physiological status,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as patients&#x02019; pain is paid little attention by nurses and physicians.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Inadequate knowledge concerning managerial skills and pain assessment[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and wrong understanding of various professional health caregivers, especially the nurses, have been mentioned as efficient managerial barriers in adequate pain management.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Therefore, as pain management is essential for appropriate care of the patients hospitalized in the ICU, a high number of such patients experience a notable suffer.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Nurses&#x02019; and medical team's empowerment in efficient pain management in the patients hospitalized in ICU enables them to potentially reduce the costs and improve the clinical outcomes through development of managerial strategies.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Recent research showed that usage of an appropriate pain assessment tool in the patients with low level of consciousness improves both pain management and its clinical outcomes including proper usage of sedatives and sleep medication, length of ventilation, and the length of stay in ICU.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Few studies have been conducted on the effect of application of pain management program on patients&#x02019; length of stay in ICU among the patients with low level of consciousness, hospitalized in the ICU. On the other hand, in the clinical setting, there is no specific care program for pain management for these patients, and nurses administer analgesic medication, mostly sedatives, merely based on physicians&#x02019; orders, which has been shown not to relieve patients&#x02019; pain but to increase their length of hospitalization and further complications. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of pain management program on the length of stay of patients with decreased level of consciousness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a two-group, multi-stage clinical trial conducted in the ICUs of Al-Zahra hospital in Isfahan in 2013. Fifty subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were selected through convenient sampling from Oct 5, 2013 to Jan 5, 2014, out of the patients hospitalized in Al-Zahra hospital with abdominal and chest surgeries, to complete the sample size, and were randomly allocated to study and control groups. There was no dropping out of the subjects during the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The inclusion criteria were: age over 18 years, no severe injury in the face, ability of moving at least one limb, Glasgow Coma Scale GSC between 5 and 8 (despite being intubated), being connected to the ventilation device from the time of arrival to ICU after surgery, not being under muscular relaxant medication, not consuming sedatives continuously, no injury to spinal cord, no dependency on alcohol or drugs, no history of chest and abdominal surgery, no history of hepatic and renal diseases, and being admitted in ICU for less than 24 h. The subjects were excluded in cases of transfer to another ward or hospital, death, or a change in the level of consciousness (higher or lower that the determined level).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-502-g001"/></fig><p>To collect the demographic data, subjects&#x02019; medical records were collected and to determine the severity of their pain, structured observation through Non-Verbal Pain Scale (NVPS) was adopted.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Data were collected in multiple stages.

Before intervention, pain severity scores of the patients, connected to Raphael ventilation and SADAT monitor, were determined by NVPS, and their BP, pulse, and arterial O<sub>2</sub> and respiration rate were used to score the tool and recorded in the related chart. Then, pain management program was used based on pain severity graded in four levels [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. In addition, the sedative selected, based on physician's order, was fentanyl if patient's systolic pressure was between 90 and 100 mm/Hg and morphine if it was more than 100 mm/Hg.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Pain management algorithm from (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mypainprofile.com/PDF/evergreen/algorithm.pdf">www.mypainprofile.com/PDF/evergreen/algorithm.pdf</ext-link>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-502-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Adult Non-Verbal Pain Scale score algorithm from (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.baccnconference.org.uk/Studio/O30%20Lindsay%20Kirwan.pdf">www.baccnconference.org.uk/Studio/O30%20Lindsay%20Kirwan.pdf</ext-link>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-502-g003"/></fig><p>

This result reveals that administration of analgesics on time and less administration of sedation medication might have caused such an effect and led to earlier discharge of the patients from the ICU. There are controversial studies in this regard. There is limited evidence-based research available in this context, and few studies have been conducted on documentation of pain assessment among ICU patients. Many of these studies, conducted based on patients&#x02019; medical files, are survey studies. Arbour <italic>et al.</italic> showed that although usage of a specific tool such as Critical-care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) had not led to reduction in mean length of patients&#x02019; connection to mechanical ventilation devices in the ICU, in the study group, it had reduced their length of stay in the ward by 50%,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which is in line with the results of the present study. Although a different method and tool had been adopted in the mentioned study, it can be concluded that application of specific methods and protocols to assess pain and for pain management, based on patients&#x02019; conditions, can bring about positive outcomes.</p><p>On the other hand, Tressa <italic>et al.</italic>, in a study to evaluate the obtained results before and after usage of Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) to investigate the level of sedation and Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) to relieve pain and achieve patients&#x02019; sedation, showed no significant difference in mean length of stay in the ICU before and after intervention.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The difference between the results of this study and those of the present study can be due to the different pain management methods adopted. In their study, sedatives and tranquilizers were administered, while in the present study, sedation was mostly used and tranquilizers were avoided as much as possible. In addition, the subjects were different in these two studies, as in their study, the patients had sepsis or trauma, or had undergone cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, and other surgeries. Rose <italic>et al.</italic>, in a study on defining the effect CPOT on the number of recorded pain assessments and prescription of sedatives and tranquilizers for ICU patients, who were not capable of pain self-report, showed that length of stay reduced from 2 to 1.8 days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007) in ICU and from 7 to 5.9 days in general surgery ward after application of pain management program, although the difference was not significant. The controversy in their results with those of the present study can be due to the use of different care program and application of various tools, as well as different subjects studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Pain management program can make the nurses function better and affect their palliative care interventions, which may lead to a reduction in patients&#x02019; length of stay in the ICU as well as in their treatment and hospitalization costs.
