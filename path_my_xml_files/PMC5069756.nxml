Twenty-four healthy subjects participated to a robot-aided assessment of their wrist proprioceptive acuity to investigate if the sensorimotor transformation involved in matching targets located by proprioceptive receptors relies on amplitude or positional cues. A joint position matching test was performed in order to explore such dichotomy. In this test, the wrist of a blindfolded participant is passively moved by a robotic device to a preset target position and, after a removal movement from this position, the participant has to actively replicate and match it as accurately as possible. The test involved two separate conditions: in the first, the matching movements started from the same initial location; in the second one, the initial location was randomly assigned. Target matching accuracy, precision, and bias in the two conditions were then compared. Overall results showed a consistent higher performance in the former condition than in the latter, thus supporting the hypothesis that the joint position sense is based on vectorial or amplitude coding rather than positional.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>joint position sense</kwd><kwd>human wrist</kwd><kwd>robot-aided rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>amplitude coding</kwd><kwd>final position coding</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="3"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="6366"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The process by which people translate sensory impressions into a coherent and unified view of the world around them is called perception. Proprioception is the sensory stream responsible for the unconscious perception of body movements and spatial awareness (McCloskey, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>), and it comes from nerves and organs within limbs (Riemann and Lephart, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2002b</xref>) and the inner ear (Yu Wei et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), involving the entire nervous system (Smith et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The proprioceptive process which underlies the interpretation of body segments&#x02019; position is called joint position sense, and it plays a crucial role in all the processes related to motor control and learning (Schmidt, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). Neuropathies and brain injuries can massively and in some cases permanently deprive the brain of its presumed main sources of dynamogenic information from skin and muscles (Bard et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Langhorne et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), leading to a compromised coding of the proprioceptive information (Debert et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), with negative consequences in motor control and its recovery process (Dukelow et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In particular, it has been observed that in the absence of proprioceptive afferents, gross motor functions are preserved (Schabrun and Hillier, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), but given the importance of peripheral information in movement planning and control (Riemann and Lephart, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002a</xref>), considerable motor deficits might persist (Goble et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, a clear understanding of mechanisms giving rise to proprioceptive perception is needed but, however, the exact contribution of proprioceptive afferences, together with motor efferences, is still debated.</p><p>Reaching out an object nearby placed without looking at it is a common action of many activities of daily living. Such kind of action involves a motor plan, set up on the basis of the sensory information acquired from proprioceptors in the phase of placing (Nougier et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Earlier literature identified two possible motor strategies for this matching movement toward a proprioceptive target (Miall and Wolpert, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The first hypothesis suggests that the movement is the consequence of a prior estimation of the relative position between the limb and the target (Morasso, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Wolpert et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Miall and Wolpert, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), thus assuming a vectorial coding of space representation which requires information on movement amplitude (Bock and Eckmiller, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Meyer et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Ghez et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) (<italic>amplitude coding strategy</italic>: AC). Alternatively, several lines of evidences suggest that the central nervous system (CNS) controls limb movements by setting muscle length&#x02013;tension parameter (Feldman, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>), so that the final equilibrium point corresponds to the position of the target, whatever the initial position of the limb in space (final <italic>position coding strategy</italic>, PC) (Bizzi et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Latash and Gottlieb, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, given that the AC and PC models provide divergent interpretations of the same phenomenon, there is still a lack of agreement about the importance of movement starting position in proprioceptive target perception and aiming.</p><p>In order to verify these contradictory results, we asked twenty-four participants to perform with their wrist a joint position matching task (Goble, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) that consisted of three phases: (1) a passive, i.e., robot driven, <italic>criterion movement</italic> that brought the wrist joint in a preset angular configuration that the blindfolded subjects were asked to memorize; (2) a passive <italic>removal movement</italic> away from the target position to a selected initial position; and (3) a <italic>matching movement</italic> actively performed by the subjects toward the memorized target location.</p><p>With the aim of contrasting the two alternatives formulated above (AC vs. PC), the testing paradigm included two experimental conditions, one with a constant starting position, between the <italic>criterion</italic> and <italic>matching movement</italic>, and another condition in which such position was shifted in space. Performance in the two conditions was then compared in terms of accuracy, precision, and bias. Our results indicate that the difference in starting position strongly biases the process of coding proprioceptive information of the perceived joint position, thus resulting in a lower matching performance as predicted from the amplitude-control model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants and Experimental Setup</title><p>Twenty-four subjects (mean age 29.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.12&#x02009;years, 11 females, 13 males) with no history of sensorimotor disorders were enrolled in the study. All participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>). The study was approved by Ethics Committee of the regional health 61 authority, Azienda Sanitaria Locale Genovese (ASL) N.3 (Protocol number 29/08 62 approved on 10/2/2008), and all the participants signed a written informed consent. Experiments were carried out at the Motor Learning and Robotic Rehabilitation Lab of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Genoa, Italy). The experimental design involved a behavioral task where subjects were seated in front of a three-degree of freedom (DoF) wrist manipulandum (Masia et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) holding its handle with their right hand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). The robotic device allowed movements along the three wrist DoFs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,C): flexion/extension (FE: 70&#x000b0;), radial/ulnar deviation (RUD: 35&#x000b0;), and pronation/supination (PS: 80&#x000b0;), for almost the full range of motion (RoM) of the human wrist. It is powered by four brushless motors chosen in such a way to provide an accurate haptic rendering and compensate for the weight and inertia of the device. Angular rotations on the three axes are acquired by means of 4000 quadrature-counts/revolution incremental encoders, resulting in a resolution of 0.0075. The continuous torque ranges at the different wrist joints are 1.53&#x02009;nm on FE, 1.63&#x02009;nm on RUD, and 2.77&#x02009;nm on PS. Subjects sat beside the robotic device with the frontal plane of their body aligned perpendicularly to the sagittal plane and the PS axis of the robotic device; relative position between the device and each participant was adjusted to have a 90&#x000b0; configuration for the elbow. Particular attention was dedicated to the correct alignment between the axes of the robotic system and the wrists anatomical ones; subjects forearm was firmly strapped to a mechanical support to ensure repeatability of wrist positioning and limit inter-trial variability, to avoid joints misalignment and unwanted relative movements during task execution.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Wrists DoFs and movements involved in the task (flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation, and pronation/supination). <bold>(B)</bold> Blindfolded participant performing the task by means of the wrist robotic device. <bold>(C)</bold> Kinematics of the robotic device which allows for movement along the three DoFs of the wrist.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnbot-10-00013-g001"/></fig><p>The mechanical transparency of device was maximized by a control algorithm for inertia and gravity compensation in such a way to reduce force and effort during the active matching movement and to not involve other muscular activations besides those involved in the task. Furthermore, the handle of the device was carefully designed in order to allow anatomical grasp to minimize fingers stretch may leading to a high activation pattern of flexor/extensor muscles during the active phase of the matching task.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><label>2.2</label><title>Task and Procedure</title><p>The proprioceptive test consisted in an ipsilateral joint position matching task (JPM) (Goble, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) in which a preset wrist configuration was passively presented to a blindfolded participant who was then asked to replicate it, as accurate as possible. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the breakdown of the experimental trial: from the neutral anatomical configuration (0&#x000b0; of FE, 0&#x000b0; of RUD, and 0&#x000b0; of PS), the robot passively moved the wrist in a determined angular position corresponding to the proprioceptive target (<italic>criterion movement</italic>), maintained it there for 3&#x02009;s (Fuentes and Bastian, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and then removed the wrist from that position (<italic>removal movement</italic>) to an appropriately chosen initial position. Thereafter, the subject was required to actively reproduce the previously experienced wrist configuration, as accurately as possible (<italic>matching movement</italic>), and the robot was not actuated but let the subject free to move. An auditory cue (high-frequency beep) sounded to mark the beginning of the <italic>criterion movement</italic> and auditory cue (low-frequency beep) sounded, indicating to the subject that he could start the <italic>matching movement</italic>, aiming to the previously presented proprioceptive target location. The <italic>matching movement</italic> was considered completed when wrists speed was lower than a 2&#x000b0;/s threshold for more than 2&#x02009;s. During the <italic>criterion</italic> and <italic>removal movements</italic>, the robot control was on and provided forces to move the wrist toward the proprioceptive target and then back along a minimum jerk trajectory, in passive way. On the contrary, the <italic>matching movement</italic> had to be performed actively by the subject and neither forces nor torques were provided by the haptic device, apart from those necessary for compensation of weight and inertia. The proprioceptive test involved the three DoFs separately, one at a time: the robot allowed movements only in the DoF involved in the current trial while keeping the other two in the neutral configuration.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The temporal sequence of the experimental paradigm</bold>. An auditory cue marks the beginning of the trial, and the wrist is passively moved by the robotic device from the neutral configuration to the proprioceptive target (<italic>criterion movement</italic>). After a consistent holding time of 3&#x02009;s, the joint is passively removed from the target (<italic>removal movement</italic>) and positioned or in the neutral configuration (<italic>constant starting point condition</italic>, cSP) or in a random one (<italic>variable starting point condition</italic>, vSP). Another auditory cue indicates participants to start moving and actively reproduce, the joint configuration previously experienced (matching movement). In this phase, the robot is inactive. When the end effector speed is below a 2&#x000b0;/s for more than 2&#x02009;s, the robot moves the wrist back to the neutral position and another trial can start.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnbot-10-00013-g002"/></fig><p>Proprioceptive targets were located at a distance chosen as 80% of the total functional wrists RoM. In particular, these positions were: 32&#x000b0; (80% of 40&#x000b0;) for flexion and extension, 16&#x000b0; (80% of 20&#x000b0;) for radial and ulnar deviation, and 24&#x000b0; (80% of 30&#x000b0;) for pronation and supination. Subjects did not receive any feedback about their performance to eliminate the possibility they recalibrate the responses during testing, based on direct knowledge of performance. Vision was occluded for all the duration of the experimental trials.</p><p>In order to ascertain if the matching accuracy depends on information regarding solely the proprioceptive target position (<italic>position coding strategy</italic>, PC), or contrarily it relies also on movement performed to reach the target (<italic>amplitude coding strategy</italic>, AC), the designed protocol consisted of two conditions, differing in the starting positions of the <italic>matching movements</italic> (determined by the robot controller as final positions of the removal movements). In the PC case, the initial position was constant for all matching movements and was chosen as the neutral configuration of the wrist (cSP in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In the AC case, on the contrary, the subjects were not repositioned in the neutral wrist configuration but in a randomly chosen variable position along the tested DoF, shifted away from the neutral one (vSP in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Subjects were instructed to concentrate only on the <italic>criterion movement</italic> end location and ignore all other potential sources of information. In details, the experimenters paid particular attention to the instructions given to each participant who was requested to try to perceive and store the wrist position at the end of the <italic>criterion movement</italic> (passively operated by the robot) and to &#x0201c;repeat&#x0201d; it as accurate as possible. No explicit information was given to them about the existence of the two condition and movements starting location.</p><p>Proprioceptive targets were randomized across the DoFs and conditions, and each trial was repeated 12 for a total of 72 trials lasting about 30&#x02009;min.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><label>2.3</label><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Wrist joint rotations were recorded from the robots incremental encoders, with a microradian resolution; the acquired signals were post-processed by a third-order Savitzky&#x02013;Golay low-pass filter (cut-off frequency of 10&#x02009;Hz) and to angular wrist joint displacements from the kinematics of the robot. To estimate the proprioceptive acuity of the wrist position sense and characterize the overall performance, three indicators were evaluated: the <italic>matching error</italic> (Schmidt, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>), the <italic>error variability</italic> (Dukelow et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and the <italic>error bias</italic> (Schmidt, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>matching error</italic> measures the performance accuracy, and it is computed as the absolute deviation between the proprioceptive target position and the wrist configuration at the end of the matching movement:

In the case of stroke, for example, in addition to motor dysfunctions, a majority of patients are affected by kinesthetic impairments, and there is solid prognostic evidence that an intact position sense strongly correlates with the likelihood of motor recovery of the hemiplegic arm (Kusoffsky et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Smith et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Rand et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). In spite of this, traditional robot and virtual reality training techniques focus on the recovery of motor functions and not on the assessment of proprioceptive deficits, although some preliminary exceptions can be quoted (Taub and Berman, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>; Casadio et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; De Santis et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Hemiparetic patients tend to over-rely on visual feedback in order to surrogate the missing or impaired proprioceptive feedback, and thus, a reasonable goal in robotic rehabilitation can be formulated as follows: how can we enhance the relative importance of proprioceptive information, with respect to vision, during a robotic assisted training protocol? This question motivated a preliminary empirical study (Casadio et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) based on an experimental design that allows to carry out trials of robot assistance with the traditional vision-based feedback and trials performed without vision, with full immersion in a purely proprioceptive virtual world.</p><p>However, in order to go beyond the empirical stage based on some assessment of the degree of sensorimotor and functional improvements in neuromotor impaired subjects, determined by techniques of proprioceptive training, it is necessary to understand in a better and deeper manner the physiological mechanisms of proprioceptive perception. This paper is therefore a step in this direction, although further studies are necessary. We focused indeed on the coding mechanism of proprioceptive information, based on proprioceptive memory but in the absence of visual feedback.</p><p>To understand the mechanism underlying the process of matching proprioceptive targets, we designed an experiment to highlight the differences between position and amplitude cues. Indeed, up-to-date, the type of information which is encoded by the motor system is still under debate. Specifically, in the present study, we sought to investigate if the accuracy in proprioceptive target matching depends only on the target final position or whereas the amplitude of the criterion movement is a relevant factor. In order to address this issue, we compared performance in two conditions: constant starting point, cSP (<italic>criterion</italic> and <italic>matching movements</italic> starting from the same position) and variable starting point, vSP (criterion movement starting from the neutral configuration and <italic>matching movement</italic> starting from a random position).</p><p>Lower performance in the second condition (vSP) indicates that subjects do not rely only on the final position of the proprioceptive target, and information about movement amplitude is fundamental for a better perception (<italic>amplitude coding</italic> strategy). Conversely, an unchanged performance between vSP and cSP condition indicates that sensory signals acquired in the final location are sufficient for an accurate perception (<italic>&#x02009;final position coding</italic> strategy) and no other information is needed.</p><p>Overall, we observed that proprioceptive abilities in target matching depend significantly on the mode of target presentation, and our results support the hypothesis that signals in the brain are coded in terms of amplitude rather than position. The present findings show indeed that when subjects experience a shift in the starting position, a systematic pattern of increasing errors emerged, indicating a tendency to use the <italic>amplitude coding</italic> strategy rather than the <italic>position coding</italic> one. Several interpretations can lay down this phenomenon, ranging from psychophysics to motor control.</p><p>From a psychophysics perspective, a widely recognized approach has conceptualized the movement as a process involving three entities: starting position, distance moved, and terminal location (Walsh et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). If we accept this interpretation, it is licit to consider the proprioceptive information as something beginning to arise as the movement starts and keeps on consolidating until the movement itself reaches the end location. During this time, a complex set of signals is conveyed from the proprioceptors to the central nervous system where they give rise to the perception of target position. Such signals consist in the mechanical interactions existing between them and the surrounding tissues (muscle, tendon, ligament, bones, or skin) but also in position, velocity, and force information that are mixed in a history-dependent manner for the entire movement duration. In line with this idea, our results showed a consistent loss in accuracy and precision when the starting point of the matching movement is shifted, and therefore its amplitude is different, supporting the hypothesis of an amplitude coding interference on position coding.</p><p>Besides this psychophysics interpretation, a neuroscientific explanation can be provided to the decrement in performance emerged when the starting position of the matching movement is randomly shifted in space, and it deals with the source of noise arising in this condition to the motor system. The motor system is the one responsible for computing the sensorimotor transformation, between sensory inputs and motor commands, but the sensory signals it constantly deals with are generally corrupted by noise. Noise permeates every level of the nervous system, from sensory to motor responses generation, posing a fundamental problem for information processing (Faisal et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Recent studies have begun to reveal computational principles by which the central nervous system tries to minimize the sensory uncertainty (Bays and Wolpert, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and movement <italic>variability</italic> arising from this internal noise (Bays and Wolpert, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). It is certain that the most inaccurate and variable (noisy) are the sensory signals that form the input, the higher is the uncertainty in the estimation of the state (Bard et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). The shift in the starting point of the criterion movement can be considered as a noisy information for three main reasons: first, because of the random nature of the shift magnitude from trial to trial; second, because it is an unexpected event the unaware subject has to deal with; and finally, the source of noise in the sensory signal may be introduced by the lack of stable space landmarks, such as the movement starting position, despite to the normal condition in which both the matching and the criterion movement start from the neutral wrist configuration.</p><p>Furthermore, from a biomechanical perspective, we should consider that the inability to properly calibrate the motor response given the sensory input might be associated with the loss of calibration of the central control signals in terms of spatial coordinates (Flanagan et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Indeed, in the cSP condition, the starting positions of both the criterion and matching movements correspond with the neutral wrist configuration (0&#x000b0; FE, 0&#x000b0; RUD, 0&#x000b0; PS), which is likely the one adopted as the center of the reference frame built in the neural processing that involves the transformation from the sensory information to the motor command. It could be reasonable to identify the difficulty in properly coding the target location with variable starting point in the mismatch between the starting position and the reference frame built and adopted by each subject.</p><p>Besides being due to changes in actual kinesthetic signals arising from criterion and matching movements, the systematic pattern of accuracy decrement in end location reproduction could also have a cognitive component. Several authors suggested indeed that the interference between distance and location seems to occur not only at a sensory or perceptual level but also at a more abstract or cognitive level of information processing (Kerr, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Faisal et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) with a consistent influence on the strategy adopted for the sensory encoding and consequent movement planning (Walsh et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; Imanaka and Abernethy, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>).</p><p>Changes in <italic>error bias</italic> uphold the hypothesis of an amplitude-coding strategy preference: when the starting point of the matching moment is shifted away from the one of the criterion movement (vSP), a longer movement is requested to accurately match the end location. If subject could isolate the information about the final position (preference for position rather than amplitude coding), the strong tendency of target overshooting observed in the cSP condition should persist. On the contrary, observed results highlighted how when the requested movement is longer (starting point shifted away), the tendency for overshooting decreases, and in the case of flexion/extension, targets are over and undershot with the same frequency, meaning that subject is not able to dissociate the information about movement extent.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings reduce significantly the plausibility of a pure final position coding hypothesis, at least in experimental situation in which the role of proprioceptive memory is emphasized; in contrast, the results are more compatible with a general qualitative role played by proprioceptive afferents in informing the CNS about the evolving state of the peripheral system as well as of the outcome of motor commands (Rothwell et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Sanes et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Gandevia and Burke, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). A natural evolution of this study is to investigate issues of proprioceptive&#x02013;visual calibration and how they can affect the proprioceptive coding problem.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>FM: substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; and drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content.
