external ear and has been used in multiple painful conditions. Low back pain (LBP)
is highly prevalent in active individuals and causes high economic burden to
health systems worldwide. LBP affects the person&#x02019;s ability to keep balance,
especially in challenging conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of the study was to examine the effects of a single session of EA on pain
intensity and body sway during postural tasks.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Eighty adults with LBP and pain intensity equal to or greater than 4 (0-10 scale)
were randomly allocated (1:1) to EA group (EAG) or placebo group (PG). Initially,
the level of pain intensity was assessed. Next, participants stood still on a
force plate either with feet in parallel or in semi-tandem and with eyes open or
closed. Then, the EAG was treated with EA for 20 min and the PG was treated with
detuned ultrasound. After the treatment, pain intensity was assessed again and the
postural test was repeated. Pain intensity was the primary outcome and center of
pressure sway area and speed were the secondary outcomes measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results revealed that pain intensity decreased in both groups after treatment, but
decreased more in the EAG. For postural control, no effect of treatment and no

acupuncture in which needles or beads are placed in specific points of the outer ear.
The French version of EA is based on the assumption that the human body is represented
in the outer ear as an inverted fetus and that there is a relationship between
distinctive anatomical sites and specific points in the ear<xref rid="B001" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Previous studies showed that EA is effective to reduce pain as a single
treatment<xref rid="B002" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B005" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> or as an adjuvant of other types of treatment<xref rid="B006" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. For instance, EA was better than sham EA to reduce pain in adolescents with
dysmenorrhea<xref rid="B005" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> and in older adults immediately after a hip fracture<xref rid="B003" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. However, in most of EA studies, participants either received several sessions
of EA or kept the needles inserted for hours or even days. To our knowledge, except for
Barker and colleagues&#x02019;, no study investigated the effect of a single session of EA on
pain intensity<xref rid="B003" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. It is important because, when compared to analgesic and anti-inflammatory
drugs, EA has minimal side effects and is relatively inexpensive. Also, EA could be an
alternative to acupuncture because the treated individual does not need to remain lying
down or remove part of his/her clothing and it can be easily applied anywhere (e.g. at
home, office, medical center).</p><p>Low back pain (LBP) is defined as pain or discomfort located below the costal margin and
above the inferior gluteal folds<xref rid="B010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. LBP is highly prevalent and persistent and has become an economic burden to
health systems and companies worldwide<xref rid="B011" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Studies have shown that LBP causes changes in sensorimotor function and,
specifically, in the ability to control body balance and orientation<xref rid="B013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B014" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. Individuals with LBP increase their body sway when compared to individuals
without pain<xref rid="B015" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. It has been suggested that LBP disrupts the ability of the nervous system to
obtain appropriate proprioceptive information from the muscles of the lumbar region<xref rid="B015" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> and it could affect the accurateness of the information about the trunk position
in space. However, the difference between LBP and healthy individuals in postural tasks
is seen mainly in more demanding tasks<xref rid="B013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B016" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a single application of EA in
individuals with chronic LBP would be sufficient to temporarily reduce pain intensity
and improve balance, reducing their body sway, mainly in more complex postural tasks,
when compared to a placebo treatment. Balance improvement would occur because reduction
in pain intensity would improve the quality of proprioceptive information about trunk
position in space and, consequently, the postural control system could function properly
to reduce body sway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Study type</title><p>We performed a two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a blinded assessor.
This trial was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee of Universidade
Cruzeiro do Sul, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil (approval number 142/2013) and was
prospectively registered at<xref rid="B017" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> (Trial registration number NCT01995279).</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>To be included in our sample, male and female participants should be between 18 and
50 years-old, have complaints of non-specific chronic LBP (&#x02265;12 weeks), and report a
minimum of 4 on a pain rating scale of 0 to 10 at the moment of the assessment. The
cut-off of 4 was chosen to allow only participants with some room for improvement, as
patients with very low levels of pain tend not to respond to any therapy<xref rid="B018" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. Individuals were excluded if they reported other musculoskeletal or
neurological conditions. Individuals who underwent spine surgery or had complaints of
dizziness were excluded from the sample. Furthermore, participants should not be
seeking treatment to reduce LBP and should not have taken painkillers and
anti-inflammatory medicine 24 hours prior to the test.</p></sec><sec><title>Source of the participants</title><p>Participants were recruited in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil, by personal invitation by the
researchers to individuals they knew to have LBP. Some individuals responded to
flyers fixed in points close to the data collection sites. They were evaluated at
three different places: at the Motion Analysis Lab of the Universidade Cruzeiro do
Sul, at a fitness center; and at a cookie factory between December 2013 and February
2014. At all places, two quiet rooms were used, one for evaluation of primary and
secondary outcomes and another for treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>The participants were informed about the study procedures and signed the informed
consent form. Next, the assessor recorded the participants&#x02019; demographic and
anthropometric data and asked them to rate their back pain on a scale of 0 to 10<xref rid="B019" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>

<xref rid="B020" ref-type="bibr">

Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) to assess their daily life disability
associated with LBP<xref rid="B021" ref-type="bibr">

barefoot as still as possible on a portable force platform (Kistler, 9286A), with
their arms beside the trunk. They were tested in two visual conditions (eyes open and
closed) and in two base of support conditions: parallel feet (standing in a
comfortable position with feet side-by-side and hip-width apart) and semi-tandem
stance (hallux of the rear foot touching the calcaneus bone of the front foot).
Therefore, the participants&#x02019; balance was assessed in four conditions: parallel feet
with eyes open (PFEO); parallel feet with eyes closed (PFEC); semi-tandem with eyes
open (STEO); and semi-tandem with eyes closed (STEC). During the eyes-open
conditions, participants were asked to fix their gaze on a target placed in front of
them at eye level, and at a distance of 1 meter. In the eyes-closed conditions, they
were instructed to close their eyes and maintain the same position as in the
eyes-open conditions. Three trials were performed per condition. Each trial lasted 35
s and their order was randomized and determined by drawing.</p><p>After the postural assessment, each participant was taken to another room where a
therapist immediately opened the sealed opaque envelope with the kind of treatment
the participant would receive. After the treatment, the participant went back to the
first room and performed the post-treatment evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant allocation and interventions</title><p>Participant allocation was randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a specific website<xref rid="B024" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> by a person not involved in the study. The randomization codes were placed by
this person in consecutively numbered, sealed, and opaque envelopes ensuring
concealed allocation into two groups. Eighty participants were allocated into one of
two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Ear acupuncture</title><p>The first group (EA group) received EA in three points: point 29 (analgesic point),
point 40 (shenmen point), and point 55 (low back point) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). These points were selected because they are commonly
used in individuals with LBP<xref rid="B004" ref-type="bibr">

(0.15&#x000d7;30 mm). The needle application was performed by an experienced therapist. This
therapist had 11 years of experience using EA as treatment for LBP.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Points in the ear where needles were applied to reduce low back pain<xref rid="B004" ref-type="bibr">

III, Ibramed, Brazil). The ultrasound machine was turned on, but not activated
(i.e. no vibration was transmitted to the skin). The head of the ultrasound was
placed in light contact with the skin of the painful lower back region and was
kept in constant circular motion for minimal interference with the painful area.
The placebo therapy was applied by the same therapist. Both sessions lasted 20
minutes, during which the participants remained lying in a therapy bed. The
detuned ultrasound treatment is commonly used as placebo treatment in control
trials and shows high level of credibility<xref rid="B026" ref-type="bibr">

assessed as the assessor wrote down on each participant&#x02019;s data sheet her opinion
about what kind of treatment the participant received and her opinions were compared
with the randomization codes after the end of the study<xref rid="B027" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was the pain intensity which was assessed by the
numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). This is an 11-point numeric pain scale, ranging
from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 meaning &#x0201c;unbearable pain&#x0201d;.</p><p>Two secondary outcomes were obtained from the balance test. Force signals were
recorded at 200 Hz by a customized LabView routine (National Instruments, USA),
digitally filtered by a low-pass, 4<sup>th</sup> order, zero-lag, Butterworth filter
with a 10 Hz cut-off frequency and used to calculate the center of pressure (COP),
which is the point of application of the resultant of vertical forces acting on the
surface of support<xref rid="B028" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>. The changes in the COP position over time are directly related to the body
sway<xref rid="B029" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref>. COP trajectories were calculated in the anterior-posterior (AP) and
medial-lateral (ML) direction. After that, the first and final 2.5 s of the COP AP
and ML time-series were removed and only the central 30 s were used for the outcomes&#x02019;
calculation.</p><p>The secondary outcomes were COP sway area (SA) and COP sway speed (SS). SA estimates
the dispersion of the COP trajectory by using principal component analysis (PCA). In
short, PCA computes two axes of the ellipse based upon the COP signal dispersion.
This ellipse contains 85% of the COP data and its area is considered the COP SA<xref rid="B029" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref>. COP SS is simply the path travelled by the COP divided by the time used in
data processing. Sway path length is calculated by summation of the planar distance
between two consecutive COP positions<xref rid="B029" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was performed using the primary outcome (i.e. NPRS)
according to the following criteria: difference between groups equal to 1 point;
standard deviation of the difference equal to 1.5 points; power of 80%; alpha of 5%;
and possible sample loss of 10%. These estimates for sample size calculation were
derived from previous trials<xref rid="B030" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B031" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref>. The result revealed the need for 40 participants in each group. We are aware
that the minimum clinically important difference in patients with LBP is 2 points.
However, a sample size calculation using 2 points instead of 1 would suggest a very
small sample size, which would cause high statistical imprecision. Consequently, we
decided to estimate our sample using 1 point.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The statistical analyses started with normality tests. The Shapiro-Wilk test showed
that none of the outcomes showed normal distribution. For pain intensity, after we
have unsuccessfully tried data transformation, we decided to run a non-parametric
test. In order to test differences between treatments, we calculated the difference
in pain intensity (DPI) subtracting the individuals&#x02019; NPRS reported at baseline, which
was not different between groups, by the NPRS reported after the treatment
(DPI=NPRS<sub>pre</sub>&#x02013;NPRS<sub>post</sub>). After that, we performed a
Mann-Whitney U test for this variable. For COP SA and SS, we successfully transformed
the data and both variables became normally distributed. COP SA was transformed by
logarithm function [log<sub>10</sub>(SA)] while COP SS was transformed by its inverse
(1/SS). Next, we performed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test the
effect of treatment (EA and placebo), period (pre-treatment and post-treatment), and
postural condition (PFEO, PFEC, STEO, and STEC) on transformed SA and SS values. The
factors period and condition were treated as repeated measures. Univariate analyses
and post-hoc tests were used when necessary. The alpha level was set at .05 and
Bonferroni corrections were employed when needed. For DPI, the effect size was
calculated from the Z value obtained from the Mann-Whitney U test as
[r<sub>ES</sub>=(z/&#x0221a;N)], with r<sub>ES</sub> higher than 0.5 being interpreted as a
large effect, higher than 0.3 being interpreted as medium effect, and higher than 0.1
interpreted as small effect according to Cohen&#x02019;s standards<xref rid="B032" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>. For SA and SS, effect size information was provided by values of partial eta
square (&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>)<xref rid="B032" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (version 19), which
was performed on an intention-to-treat basis (i.e. we analyzed patients in the groups
to which they were originally randomly assigned).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Ninety-one individuals were contacted and came to the testing sites. Eleven did not
report pain equal to or greater than 4 and were not tested. Thus, 80 participants were
randomly assigned to one of the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>). Most of them were female (62.5%), 35 years old on average, and had a
relatively long presence of symptoms (around 43 months). The pain intensity reported at
the beginning of this trial was moderate (5.7). However, the participants presented low
level of disability as shown by the RMDQ (4.2 points from 0 to 24) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). All participants were assessed for pain
intensity and one participant from the EA group was excluded from the balance test after
the treatment because she felt dizzy and was unable to perform the tasks. This
participant was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis for these secondary outcomes by
imputing the data from baseline (last value carried forward). As this participant
reported her level of pain after the intervention, no imputation technique was required.
It is unclear whether this dizziness was related to the treatment or not. No other
adverse event occurred.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Study flow diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1413-3555-rbfis-bjpt-rbf20140158-gf02"/></fig><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participants&#x02019; individual characteristics.

reduce pain and improve balance in individuals with LBP. The results partially confirmed
the hypothesis. While a single session of EA was effective to momentarily reduce pain
intensity, EA did not improve body balance.</p><p>EA has been used by clinicians to reduce pain in different health conditions<xref rid="B003" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B009" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Our results showed that a single session of EA was better than the placebo
treatment to temporarily reduce pain in individuals with LBP. It corroborates the
results of Barker et al.<xref rid="B003" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>, who investigated the effect of the application of EA on older adults who had
just suffered a hip fracture and were being taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Older
adults who received EA felt less pain and anxiety and presented lower heart rate than
the ones who received sham EA<sup>3</sup>. A few studies have already investigated the
effect of EA on individuals with LBP. For instance, Yeh et al.<xref rid="B004" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> found that participants with chronic LBP who received EA felt approximately 70%
less pain than the ones who received sham EA after one month of treatment. In addition,
Sator-Katzenschlager et al.<xref rid="B025" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref> found that the treatment with EA was successful as an adjuvant of a
pharmacological treatment to reduce pain. Unlike other studies, our study assessed the
efficacy of EA in reducing pain temporarily after a single session. Our results showed
that the application of EA could be beneficial even if someone is treated just once. The
reduction in pain intensity shows that the application of EA has an immediate, albeit
small, effect and could be considered as a non-pharmacological alternative for these
patients, especially given that no adverse effects are observed after application.
Furthermore, patients with a lower level of pain after EA may be more likely to improve
with exercises for pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP. However, more
trials with high methodological quality are needed to confirm the results of this
study.</p><p>We also examined the functional result of an intervention with EA. It is known that LBP
negatively influences balance and this effect is more evident in more complex tasks<xref rid="B013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. However, our findings showed no effect of treatment on postural control. Thus,
the reduction in pain intensity was not enough to cause changes in postural control. A
likely explanation could be that what affects the balance system is not the current pain
intensity, but the altered postural control system as a result of prolonged pain.
Findings from previous studies revealed a direct association between existing pain
intensity and postural control<xref rid="B033" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref>. The presence of pain caused by the continuous discharge of the nociceptors
located at the lumbar region would reduce the activation of proprioceptors, mainly the
muscle spindles, thus affecting balance<xref rid="B015" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. However, our results do not confirm this hypothesis given that, despite the
reduction in pain intensity, postural control remained unaffected after the treatment. A
second possibility is that LBP would affect the organization and excitability of
cortical and subcortical areas related to postural control<xref rid="B034" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>34</sup>
</xref>. Consequently, reduction in current pain intensity would not affect postural
control at the moment of the reduction. Our results appear to support this suggestion.
Another possible explanation is that the participants of this study presented low scores
in the RMDQ, which could be indicative of the severity of LBP. In a systematic review,
Mazaheri et al.<xref rid="B013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> associated the severity of LBP with changes in body balance. Therefore, the lack
of treatment effect on postural control could be due to the level of severity of LBP in
the individuals investigated in this study and we are currently investigating this
possibility.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effect of a single session of EA
on pain intensity in individuals with chronic LBP. In addition, the effect of EA on
postural control has yet to be investigated.</p><p>This is a low risk of bias trial with proper randomization procedure, participant
allocation, adequate sample size, and assessor blinding, which can be considered as an
asset. On the other hand, our study has some limitations that need attention. First, we
recruited only individuals who were not seeking treatment, which could explain the low
scores in the RMDQ and subsequent lack of influence of the treatment on body balance.
Thus, a new trial could be conducted to assess individuals with greater disability due
to LBP. Secondly, our study only assessed the immediate effects of EA treatment, and
different results (i.e. stronger effect size in pain intensity and significant
improvement in body balance) may have been observed if more treatment sessions had been
provided. Thirdly, although most textbooks and references on EA advocate the same
protocol used in this study, we acknowledge that there are other possibilities for EA.
Therefore, our results are only generalizable for this type of treatment protocol.
Finally, we did not monitor the level of credibility of the treatments and did not use a
real placebo EA group (i.e. Sham EA) in this study. Both monitoring the level of
credibility of the treatments and using a sham EA group would have strengthened our
findings and provided additional support for the use of EA for temporary pain reduction
in individuals with LBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the findings showed that EA is effective in temporarily reducing pain
intensity, but this is not enough to improve body balance. This knowledge is important
because physicians and therapists could suggest the use of EA to reduce acute pain
momentarily in individuals with LBP in any condition, namely for individuals who are
unable to take traditional painkillers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE Ushinohama A, Cunha BP, Costa LOP, Barela AMF, de Freitas
