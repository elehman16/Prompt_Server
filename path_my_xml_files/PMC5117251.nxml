Its incidence rate continues to rise, and chronic back pain (CBP) remains the most prevalent chronic pain condition. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the CBP is the leading source of disability in the US and the seventh leading source worldwide.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Despite a long list of available pharmacological and management strategies, a significant percentage of CBP patients remains dissatisfied with their levels of pain relief, and the World Health Organization states that no available treatments are superior to each other.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Moreover, the most commonly used pharmacological options (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], gabapentin, duloxetine, and opiates) have important adverse effects and are not tolerated for long periods of use.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel pain management options especially for CBP.</p><p>D-cycloserine (DCS) is an established, FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, recommended to be used at doses up to 1000&#x02009;mg/day for the treatment of tuberculosis in the US and widely used throughout the world as a second-line agent for that disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, it is a partial agonist to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the central nervous system and at high doses can lead to drowsiness, dizziness, and convulsions.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In rodents, oral DCS has been shown to decrease pain-like behaviors in multiple models of chronic pain (spared nerve injury, and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy), in a dose dependent manner, with efficacy increasing with longer duration use.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Moreover, animals already treated with DCS, when re-treated showed larger alleviation and longer duration persistence of alleviation of neuropathic pain, and when treated for about 30 days, post-treatment alleviation of symptoms persists for more than an additional 30 days.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although at the doses tested, DCS in neuropathic rats relieved pain-like symptoms by only about 50%, the emotional impact of the neuropathic condition seemed completely eliminated (i.e., animals behaved as if the remaining pain does not bother them). It seems that in neuropathic rodents DCS does not change stimulus sensitivity for body parts outside of the injury, and acute or single doses of DCS do not alleviate neuropathic pain. Therefore, in the rodent DCS does not act as a short-term analgesic; instead, it reduces neuropathic pain and seems to largely eliminate associated negative affect.</p><p>The initial study of DCS in the rat described above was in fact a reverse translational effort, as it was based on the evidence that brain imaging studies in CBP patients had shown that chronic pain preferentially activates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and DCS administration systemically or centrally (within mPFC or amygdala) in the rodent facilitates fear extinction,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and that mPFC is critical in the rodent extinction of fear.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> More recent studies provide strong additional evidence regarding the role of mPFC in human chronic pain<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr16-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and its interaction with subcortical limbic structures most notably hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="bibr15-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr18-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> as well as rodent evidence showing that direct manipulation of components of this circuitry either disrupts or modulates persistent pain behavior.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr22-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr23-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We have hypothesized that chronification of pain critically depends on brain memory circuitry<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and DCS enhances cognitive and memory processes and especially fear extinction<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> through prefrontal limbic circuitry and reduces persistent pain in the rodent.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> We therefore undertook the present forward translational pilot study to specifically test the efficacy and safety of DCS in reducing back pain in CBP, utilizing dosages that were well below those resulting in significant clinical side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-1744806916678627"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a pilot trial of DCS in subjects with chronic low back pain, designed as a double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00125528). The protocol and informed consent documentation were reviewed and approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. Subjects provided written informed consent before protocol-specified procedure initiation. No external funding was provided for this study.</p><sec id="sec3-1744806916678627"><title>Study population</title><p>Eligible subjects had to be between the ages of 18 and 75 years, have low back pain for a minimum of six months, with or without radiation of pain to buttocks or legs, and be in stable medical health. Subjects had to rate their back pain at baseline as &#x02265;5 out of 10 on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; 0&#x02013;10 scale) and be willing to abstain from alcohol consumption during the course of the study. Females had to be post-menopausal or, if of child-bearing potential, use a highly effective method of contraception or abstinence and plan to continue during the course of the study. Exclusion criteria included low back pain associated with any systemic signs or symptoms; evidence of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute vertebral fractures, fibromyalgia, history of surgery or tumor in the back; involvement in litigation regarding their back pain or having a disability claim or receiving workman&#x02019;s compensation or seeking either; neurologic or major psychiatric disorder; history of, or current, substance abuse/dependence including alcohol; significantly abnormal laboratory values; known sensitivity to DCS; currently taking any of the following medications: ethionamide, dilantin, isoniazid (INH), pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>); any change in medication for back pain in the last 30 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-1744806916678627"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a parallel group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical trial that aimed to enroll 40 participants with low back pain. There were five study visits overall: a screening visit, a baseline assessment and visits every two weeks thereafter for six weeks after initiation of study medication. Randomization occurred at the baseline visit in a 1:1 ratio with assignment to either DCS 50&#x02009;mg bid or matching placebo, respectively. The randomization sequence was generated by computer-generated program, and participants received the next available number and numbered container(s) when they qualified. No study staff had access to the randomization sequence, and medication assignment and labeling were done by non-study staff. All study staff and participants were blinded to medication assignment until database lock. Participants were required to continue their current medications for low back pain throughout the course of the study. After two weeks of study medication, all participants received an increase in their assigned study medication to DCS 100&#x02009;mg bid or matching placebo. All study medication was identical in appearance and formulated by the University of Charleston School of Pharmacy from commercially available DCS (Chao Center for Industrial Pharmacy and Contact Manufacturing, West Lafayette, IN) under IND 71528. This medication regime was continued for two weeks when assigned study medication was again increased to either DCS 200&#x02009;mg or placebo to be taken twice daily. These dosages were based on the preclinical rat studies which demonstrated efficacy at low overall doses of DCS. Dose escalation was undertaken after two weeks as that was felt as an adequate length of time to reach a new steady-state and observe efficacy; continued escalation was designed in an attempt to maximize the chances of detecting efficacy while limiting side effects. Study capsules were all identical in appearance. Randomization was in blocks of four by use of a computer-generated list that was accessible to study staff only in case of drug-related study emergency. Efficacy and safety were assessed at baseline and at each subsequent study visit. Acetaminophen rescue medication was allowed and limited to 500&#x02009;mg qid. All visits and data collection took place at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine between July 2012 and April 2014.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-1744806916678627"><title>Efficacy evaluation</title><p>At each visit, the following instruments were completed by each subject: NRS (0&#x02013;10&#x02009;mm scale; no pain to worst possible pain); McGill Pain Questionnaire (short-form, MPQ); Neuropathy Pain Scale (NPS); Pain Detect Questionnaire; and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).</p></sec><sec id="sec6-1744806916678627"><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>At each visit, participants were asked about changes in health status and medications.

All adverse effects were rated mild in severity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec17-1744806916678627"><title>Discussion</title><p>In subjects with chronic low back pain in this study, we observed a consistent pattern of the effect of DCS, in contrast to placebo, on a number of clinically important outcome measures. Although neither the primary outcome nor secondary outcomes showed an overall statistically significant time by treatment effect, they all showed trends, and the primary outcome measure as well as the four secondary outcomes indicated significant post-hoc effect of DCS at six weeks relative to baseline with no effect of placebo. Given the limited number of subjects included in the studied, these results are stronger than we had expected. Moreover, we observed that at six weeks at a dose of 200&#x02009;mg DCS treatment, the effect size of pain relief was 0.4, a magnitude at least comparable to efficacy of NSAIDs reported for chronic low back pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> For two outcome measures, placebo and DCS effects were not different at two weeks and at four weeks of treatment, but all five outcomes showed at six weeks a larger effect in the DCS group than in the placebo group. As the trial was a dose escalating regimen, with stepwise increases every two weeks, and given that rodent results indicated that continued treatment with DCS over many weeks potentiates its efficacy for analgesia in neuropathic animals,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> these results cannot differentiate whether the observed efficacy of DCS is due to dose escalation or simply a reflection of continued drug consumption. Yet, taking into consideration the earlier rodent results,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> we expect that continuation of DCS treatment for longer periods should result in even larger effect sizes. As expected from a recent review of the DCS literature,<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> we observed minimal side effects of DCS consumption across all three doses and for up to six weeks of treatment. Therefore, the present results suggest that DCS may be a viable treatment for CBP, as it demonstrates minimal side effects and suggestive evidence that it might be efficacious in ameliorating back pain intensity in low back pain patients. However, larger population and longer duration treatment trials are the next necessary steps that remain to be done.</p><p>The original study where DCS was demonstrated to be effective in ameliorating neuropathic pain in rodents<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> demonstrated not only that DCS reduces tactile sensitivity for the paw with neuropathic injury but also showed complete reversal of place avoidance, when paw mechanical stimulation was competed with the aversiveness of a white compartment. This result suggests that DCS diminishes the negative emotional load of neuropathic pain much more than its sensory component. Somewhat consistent with this observation, the current study showed an increase in PANAS positive scores at six weeks of DCS treatment (with no change in PANAS negative scores), which suggests improvement in positive emotional affect, reflecting higher energy, more pleasurable engagement, and increased extroversion. Thus, improved mood accompanied with decreased pain seem to also have been observed in the chronic low back pain patients.</p><p>The original study of DCS reducing neuropathic pain also showed that the primary site of action of DCS was through the glycine partial agonist site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor localized specifically in the pre-limbic portion of the mPFC, with no effects on multiple other regions most importantly within the spinal cord.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> An observation that is important to consider given that three recent studies show that manipulating activity or excitability of pre-limbic neurons can completely reverse neuropathic pain-like behavior in rodents.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-1744806916678627" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Thus, we surmise that in the current trial as well DCS effects for relieving back pain were being mediated through the same mechanism and brain pathway as observed in the rodent.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the small sample size, and the relatively short follow-up period available. In a condition such as CBP, longer follow up would be ideal to evaluate maintenance of pain-relief benefit, and a larger number of subjects would allow evaluation of whether there were subgroups of individuals with CBP who might respond in a differential manner to DCS. Additionally, because of the dose-titration design, it was not possible to differentiate a dosage from time effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec18-1744806916678627"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the current study remains preliminary and exploratory in nature, the obtained results imply further studies of DCS as a treatment option for chronic pain are warranted.
