However, a few studies focus on the role of ET-1 in breakthrough pain (BP). The aim of this pivotal study was to explore the correlation between the plasma (ET-1) level and BP intensity. A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study, and they were divided into two groups: BP group and non-BP group. Moreover, 20 healthy adults were used as the normal control group. Pain intensity was measured using visual analog scale (VAS) scores of 1&#x02013;10. Plasma ET-1 levels were detected by an ET radioimmunoassay kit. Subsequently, the correlation of ET-1 level with the VAS score and cancer types was analyzed by Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient. The plasma ET-1 level in the BP group (35.31&#x000b1;8.02 pg/mL) was higher than that in the non-BP group (29.51&#x000b1;6.78 pg/mL) and the normal control group (24.77&#x000b1;10.10 pg/mL, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, the VAS score in the BP group (7.45&#x000b1;0.82) was higher than that in the non-BP group (2.80&#x000b1;1.23, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The plasma ET-1 level was positively correlated with the VAS score of the BP group (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic>=0.42). There was no significant correlation between the plasma ET-1 level and VAS score of the non-BP group (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.22) or/and cancer types (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). The elevated plasma ET-1 levels were positively related to BP, and targeting ET-1 may provide a novel pain-reducing therapeutic treatment in BP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>visual analog scale</kwd><kwd>correlation</kwd><kwd>cancer types</kwd><kwd>background pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breakthrough pain (BP) is an acute transitory pain that occurs suddenly and breaks through the normal pain management.

The cases included ten patients with rectal cancers, ten patients with liver cancers, two patients with splenic lymphomas, four patients with gastric cancers, eight patients with colon cancers, and six patients with breast cancers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-8-3703">Table 1</xref>). All the patients were divided into two groups: BP group and non-BP group. Additionally, 20 healthy adults who had the same ages with the patients in BP group were set as control group. Comparisons of general conditions (age and sex) among the three groups were conducted, and there was no significant difference in age and sex ratio among patients and controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-8-3703">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The selected patients must meet all the following criteria: 1) without obvious hypertension and heart and lung diseases; 2) without psychiatric history; 3) both the BP and non-BP groups had pathology clinical diagnoses; 4) BP diagnosis was performed according to the Science Committee of the Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland; and 5) the age ranged from 30 years to 70 years.</p><p>Moreover, the patients with one or more of the following exclusion criteria were excluded: 1) patients who suffered from BP due to the insufficiency of last dosage, ie, BP occurred at 1&#x02013;2 hours before the next administration; 2) patients with hypertension, coronary heart disease, severe arrhythmia, or with severe dysfunction in heart, liver, or kidney; 3) patients recently treated for alcoholism or drug abuse; 4) patients with respiratory depression, anoxia, excessive bleeding, or severe shock during BP or treatment; 5) abnormal indexes because of reagents or equipment disorder; 6) patients who did not execute the protocol strictly, quitted the treatment, or died in the period of this study; 7) patients who did not coordinate with the doctors; and 8) patients with psychiatric history.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of ET-1 in plasma</title><p>Before VAS assessing, 2 mL fasting venous blood was obtained from each patient and normal control after fasting overnight.

Complications such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were cured during the treatment. Pain intensity was assessed using the VAS, and a ten-point categorical scale was recorded. The frequency of BP throughout the day and onset of relief were assessed. Patients who had the VAS score higher than 7 were considered to have severe pain, score 4&#x02013;6 to have moderate pain, and score 1&#x02013;3 to have mild pain.
