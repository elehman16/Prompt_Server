About 30% occur in the sacrococcygeal region. Surgical resection is still the standard treatment. Due to the size, proximity to neurovascular structures and the complex anatomy of the pelvis, a complete resection with adequate safety margin is difficult to perform. A radical resection with safety margins often leads to the loss of bladder and rectal function as well as motoric/sensoric dysfunction. The recurrence rate after surgery alone is comparatively high, such that adjuvant radiation therapy is very important for improving local control rates. Proton therapy is still the international standard in the treatment of chordomas. High-LET beams such as carbon ions theoretically offer biologic advantages in slow-growing tumors. Data of a Japanese study of patients with unresectable sacral chordoma showed comparable high control rates after hypofractionated carbon ion therapy only.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This clinical study is a prospective randomized, monocentric phase II trial. Patients with histologically confirmed sacrococcygeal chordoma will be randomized to either proton or carbon ion radiation therapy stratified regarding the clinical target volume. Target volume delineation will be carried out based on CT and MRI data. In each arm the PTV will receive 64 GyE in 16 fractions. The primary objective of this trial is safety and feasibility of hypofractionated irradiation in patients with sacrococygeal chordoma using protons or carbon ions in raster scan technique for primary or additive treatment after R2 resection. The evaluation is therefore based on the proportion of treatments without Grade 3&#x02013;5 toxicity (CTCAE, version 4.0) up to 12&#x000a0;months after treatment and/or discontinuation of the treatment for any reason as primary endpoint. Local-progression free survival, overall survival and quality of life will be analyzed as secondary end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study is to confirm the toxicity results of the Japanese data in raster scan technique and to compare it with the toxicity analysis of proton therapy given in the same fractionation. Using this data, a further randomized phase III trial is planned, comparing hypofractionated proton and carbon ion irradiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01811394">NCT01811394</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sacral chordoma</kwd><kwd>Chordoma</kwd><kwd>Carbon ion therapy</kwd><kwd>Proton therapy</kwd><kwd>Irradiation</kwd><kwd>Randomized trial</kwd><kwd>Hypofractionation</kwd><kwd>Heavy ion therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The advantage of radiation therapy with particles is based on the particular physical and biological characteristics of ions. Protons and carbon ions as compared to photons lead to an improved conformal dose distribution, which allows a better sparing of surrounding tissue and concurrent dose escalation in the tumor. Carbon ions seem to have an additional biological advantage due to their higher biological effectiveness in contrast to protons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Complex double-strand breaks of the DNA seem to be the reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, heavy ions provide a promising treatment option for tumors with lower radiosensitivity and critical location. Increased cure rates and low toxicity of a particle therapy are the expected results in tumors with low alpha/beta values. Chordomas, as a typical example, are rare malignant tumors (1-4% of all malignant bone tumors). This slow growing tumor arises from embryonic remnants of the chorda dorsalis. The incidence rate is 0.1/1,000,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Historically, a higher incidence of sacral chordomas than skull base chordomas was assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, published SEER data of 400 patients with chordoma show an equal distribution with 32% on the skull base, 32.8% spinal and 29.2% in the sacral region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The histological classification is divided into three types: conventional (most common type), chondroid and dedifferentiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The quality of surgical margin is the most important factor for local control and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An adequate safety margin can only be achieved in about 50% of the patients with sacrococcygeal chordomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, after R1/R2 resection the local recurrence rate is about 100% without any additional therapy. Fuchs et al. could show a significantly different time of local control between patients with radical resection and subtotal resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless the data of Park et al. indicate a large difference in local failure rate between patients irradiated for primary versus recurrent sacral chordomas after surgery. Hence, an adjuvant high-dose radiotherapy for acceptable control rates is required after complete resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. High conformal techniques help to achieve a safe dose escalation. As mentioned above, due to their physical properties ions provide the best conditions. Proton therapy is the current international standard in irradiation of skull base chordomas. The results of the Loma Linda University Medical Centre, the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and the PSI in Villingen (Switzerland) show excellent control rates for proton therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the GSI in Darmstadt, we irradiated with carbon ions by now about 300 patients with skull base chordoma/chondrosarcoma. Published data of the first 96 patients that were treated at the GSI displayed 3- and 5-year local tumor control rates (LC) of 81% and 70% with overall survival (OS) rates of 92% and 89%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Currently, there is a randomized phase III trial under recruitment, testing protons against heavy ions in patients with skull base chordoma in our department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, over 70 patients with sacral chordoma were treated with carbon ion in our heavy ion therapy center (HIT) between 2010 and 2012. Furthermore, in chordomas of the sacral region surgical resection is still the standard therapy and the extent of surgical resection is important for the local disease free interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Due to the size, proximity to neurovascular structures and the complex anatomy of the pelvis a complete resection with adequate safety margin is often difficult to realize. A radical resection, especially above S2, often leads to urinary and bowel incontinence as well as motoric/sensoric dysfunctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. An adjuvant/additive treatment with charged particles can increase the local control rate after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Radiobiological considerations lead to low alpha/beta value for chordoma (the tissue-specific constant that indicates the sensitivity of the tissue for the probability of late toxicity by increasing the single dose). The alpha/beta value for chordoma cells (2&#x000a0;Gy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] is significantly lower for other organs at risk (bladder alpha/beta 4.0&#x000a0;Gy; rectum alpha/beta 3.9&#x000a0;Gy). Thereby, a higher single dose can be used, treating the chordoma cells more effectively without increasing the risk of side effects. A Japanese trial with primary carbon ions irradiation without previous surgery confirmed this radiobiological model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The data show an excellent control rate after primary radiotherapy with carbon ions in patients with inoperable sacral chordoma. 95 patients were treated with 16 fractions carbon ions over 4&#x000a0;weeks with a total dose of 52.8 GyE up to 73.6 GyE (70.4 Gy median TD). The fraction dose therefore was 3.3 GyE up to 4.6 GyE (4.4 Gy median SD) applied four times a week. At 5&#x000a0;years, the OS rate and LC rate were 86% and 88%, respectively. The rate of acute/late skin toxicity grade 3 and higher was 6.3%. Only one patient (1%) showed transient rectal bleeding 20&#x000a0;months after therapy (Grade II). The published study with ion irradiation of sacral chordoma was conducted using a passive beam modulation. A further development of the ion irradiation is the active beam delivery using raster-scanning method. The advantage of this method is especially the lower neutron production when used in our department. As a result of the higher neutron production the passive beam modulation shows no advantage over IMRT regarding secondary cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Until now there have been no published data of hypofractionated irradiation with protons in sacral chordoma. Therefore, this is the first randomized Phase II trial protocol with hypofractionated carbon ion versus proton treatment in patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma in a single institution open for recruitment since January 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Primary objectives/endpoints of this study</title><p>The primary objective of this trial is the evaluation of safety and feasibility of hypofractionated irradiation in patients with sacrococygeal chordoma using ions (protons or carbon ions) in raster scan technique for primary or additive treatment after R2 resection.

To determine a change in QoL it will be compared with the pretherapeutic QoL for each patient in both arms. QoL will be compared between the two arms of the study after end of radiation and at end of study for the patients. For the analysis of the EORTC questionnaires the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual will be used.</p></sec><sec><title>Local progression free survival (LPFS)</title><p>The effectiveness of treatment is examined through MRI follow-ups. A progressive disease (PD) is achieved if the tumor size increases 10% or more, measured as the longest dimension in cranial-caudal, anterior-posterior and lateral direction. This definition of PD is based on the observation of a temporary tumor swelling after the particle therapy. A new tumor nodule and a tumor growth &#x0003e;10% in one direction (for example toward the gluteal muscles) will also be evaluated as PD. Since chordomas usually have a very low proliferation rate (Ki 67: &#x0003c;5%), an assessment by RECIST criteria is too insensitive for detecting a PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall survival (OS)</title><p>Overall survival is a secondary endpoint of the study.

At present, hypofractionated carbon ion radiation is considered as the standard, supported by data already existing in Japan. However, the treatment in Japan was performed without using the raster-scanning method. Nevertheless, these data can serve as historical control for the planning of this pilot study and provide the framework for the assessment of safety and feasibility of the proposed study treatments using the SFR as endpoint. Each of the planned study treatments (Arm A: protons or arm B: carbon ions) will be tested separately for this endpoint in a non-inferiority study design in comparison with that (historical) control. The comparative evaluation of favorable toxicity is assessed in an exploratory comparison by comparing the SFR of both arms. With these results, a further trial is then planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated irradiation with carbon ions or protons with active beam delivery of sacral chordoma. Consequently, the following two questions will be considered in preparation for the subsequent confirmatory study:</p><p>a) Is the toxicity of carbon ion irradiation (Arm B) non-inferior to the current standard?</p><p>b) Is the toxicity of the proton irradiation (arm A) non-inferior to the current standard?</p><p>The number of patients to be recruited is calculated separately for each arm with an assumed standard toxicity rate of 7% (Grade 3&#x02013;5 NCI-CTC AE Tox, including premature termination). Thus, the safety rate is set to 93% accounting for the Japanese results, where a toxicity of grade 3 or higher in 6.3% of patients was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Identical non-inferiority limits for toxicity and statistical error probabilities (type I error&#x02009;=&#x02009;type II error&#x02009;=&#x02009;10%) are selected for each of the two arms. Randomization is used to obtain a balanced patient population in both groups and based on permuted block randomization stratified for the CTV size (&#x0003e; or&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;L). Comparison between the two arms will be carried out as a secondary comparison. The non-inferiority of each of the two arms compared to the standard is assessed in a one-sided hypothesis test: H0: SDR &#x0003c;93% versus H1: SDR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 93% - DELTA. For the proposed pilot trial a non-inferiority limit (DELTA) of 13% is assumed. To test the efficacy and safety of the treatment, 45 evaluable patients per arm are required to reach a power of 90% (type II error&#x02009;=&#x02009;10%) at a significance level 10% (type I error). Non-inferiority is denied, if safe feasibility is possible in less than 40 patients (i.e. if more than 5 of the 45 (90%) evaluable patients show toxicity. Each of the two tests is to be tested with a power of 90% (power&#x02009;=&#x02009;90%, beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1) in a one-sample binomial test. Confidence intervals of the SFR are calculated as describing parameters. With an estimated drop out rate of approximately 10%, 50 patients should be included in each arm in order to obtain 45 evaluable patients. This sample size calculation is based on the PASS software of 2005 and the method of Blackwelder (1982) for non-inferiority trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Hence, the evidence based only on small retrospective series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. De Lany et al. published data of 29 patients with chordomas of the mobile spine and sacrum that were treated by surgery and high dose proton-/photon irradiation in a phase II trial. In this trial no significant difference between R0 and R1/R2/biopsy could be shown regarding local control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. According to these results it can be asked whether an extended surgery with high morbidity is still necessary. Japanese retrospective data compared surgery only with carbon ion therapy only and found out a 5-year local-recurrence free survival rate of 62.5% for surgery and 100% for carbon ion therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Further retrospective data of 95 patients after hypofractionated carbon ion treatment at NIRS seems to indicate a new therapeutic option in patients with sacral chordoma, which displays in contrast to the surgery lower morbidity with very good local control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Imai et al. reported about three patients with grade 3 skin toxicity and two patients with grade 4 (73.6 GyE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A decided evaluation of skin toxicity after carbon ion treatment at NIRS showed grade 3 and 4 skin toxicity only in patients which received doses&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;70 GyE in 16 fractions. It was indicated that severe skin reaction may not develop if the prescribed dose is 64 GyE or less like in our trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, we limit the maximum dose of the skin to 90-95% of the prescribed dose. Imai et al. reported about one patient with rectal bleeding grade 1, but no patient received a colostomy or urinary diversion after carbon ion treatment. 15 patients (16%) required medication due to sciatic neuropathy after carbon ion treatment. However, five of them received with 73.6 GyE a much higher dose than in our trial. More than 80% of the chordomas were localized above S2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, the expected toxicity after radical resection would have been a complete urinary and bowel incontinence in at least 80% of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore chronic neuropathic pain, wound complications and walking difficulties are also possible side effects of sacrectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Against this background, the published side effects after hypofractionated carbon ion therapy should be evaluated.</p><p>Due to missing data for a hypofractionated carbon ion therapy in raster scan technique, this trial will confirm the historical data from Japan that were developed by using passive beam application. In the Japanese trial patients received a total dose of 52.8 to 73.6 GyE in 16 fractions. Most of the patients received 70.4 GyE. In contrast to our fractionation with up to 6 fractions per week (Monday-Saturday), the patients in Japan received only four fractions per week. Therefore, the total dose in our trial is limited to 64 GyE. Only patients with inoperable, residual or recurrent tumor will be included in our trial. Patients with resectable tumor are included only after refusal of surgery treatment. Moreover, no data of hypofractionated proton therapy in patients with sacral chordoma have been published so far. However, these data are necessary to perform a randomized prospective phase III study in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MU, LE, ADJ, JD und KH have developed the study concept.
