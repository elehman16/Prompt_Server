Primaquine at the dose most usually recommended in the past for radical cure (15 mg base adult dose daily for 14 days) is also weakly effective against asexual stages of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> The standard chloroquine and primaquine treatment regimen may therefore be considered as a combination treatment. The dose-response relationship for primaquine's asexual stage activity is uncertain. Higher doses of primaquine may be more effective than standard doses but also increase the risk of adverse effects. Primaquine is associated with upper gastrointestinal discomfort, particularly if taken on an empty stomach, and causes oxidant hemolysis in subjects who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In malaria prophylaxis, a 30 mg daily dose of primaquine has been shown to be well tolerated even when given continuously for as long as 20 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">3</xref> For radical cure of vivax malaria in normal G6PD patients, adult doses of primaquine at 22.5 to 30 mg proved safe and effective in Thailand,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> and the higher dose (0.5 mg base/kg) has recently been recommended by the World Health Organization.

The dose-response relationships for primaquine's asexual stage and hypnozoitocidal activities have not been well characterized. To compare these 2 discrete activities and to assess efficacy and tolerability, we evaluated 7-day courses of 30 mg and 60 mg daily primaquine-only regimens for the treatment and radical cure of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria in Thailand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients.</title><p>The study was conducted in adult male patients with acute symptomatic <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand between 1996 and 1998. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok. All patients gave full informed consent.</p><p>All patients were screened and only those with normal G6PD testing were included. Other exclusion criteria were a history of drug hypersensitivity, having taken any antimalarial drugs within the previous 48 hours, or urine screening tests that were positive for sulfonamides (lignin test) or 4-aminoquinolines (Wilson Edeson test). Patients who had patent mixed infections or were unable to stay in the hospital until clearance of both fever and parasitemia were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Management.</title><p>After clinical assessment and confirmation of the diagnosis from thick and thin blood smears, baseline blood samples were taken for routine hematology and biochemistry. Treatments were allocated according to double-blinded randomization codes. The treatment allocation was kept in serially numbered sealed envelopes that were opened only after the patient had been enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to receive 1 of the following 2 regimens:<list list-type="order"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>Primaquine (Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization) 0.50 mg base/kg once daily (adult dose 30 mg base/day) for 7 days</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>Primaquine 1.0 mg base/kg once daily (adult dose 60 mg base/day) for 7 days.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Oral acetaminophen (0.5&#x02013;1 g 4 hourly) was given for fever &#x0003e; 38&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Assessments of clinical response.</title><p>Vital signs were recorded every 4 hours until resolution of fever and thereafter every 6&#x02013;12 hours. Fever clearance time was defined as the time for body temperature to fall below 37.5&#x000b0;C and remain below this value for &#x0003e; 48 hours. Early treatment failure was defined as persistence of fever and parasitemia for &#x0003e; 7 days or persistence of parasitemia in the absence of fever for &#x0003e; 14 days. Reappearance of infection was assessed in patients who remained in Bangkok either in the hospital or at home (i.e., outside the malaria transmission area) for at least 28 days. Patients who failed to respond to the treatment, or those who had recurrent vivax infections were treated subsequently with the standard regimen of chloroquine (25 mg/kg base over 3 days) and primaquine (0.25 mg base/kg/day for 14 days). Patients with delayed appearance of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection were treated with a 7-day course of quinine (10 mg salt/kg every 8 hours) combined with tetracycline (250 mg every 6 hours) and censored from that time in the subsequent assessment.</p><p>Assessment of gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) and any other symptoms and signs was performed every day during and after primaquine treatment (day 0 to day 7, day 14, and day 28). Hematocrit was assessed daily during and after primaquine treatment. Laboratory investigations for full blood count and routine biochemical tests were performed before treatment (D0) and then on day 7, day 14, and day 28.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Parasitological assessment.</title><p>Parasite counts of both sexual and asexual stages were measured every 2&#x02013;12 hours in thin films and thick films until the parasitemia became detectable only in thick films, then every 12 hours until clearance, and thereafter daily for 28 days. Parasitemia was expressed as the number of parasites per microliter of blood (derived from the numbers of parasites per 1,000 red blood cells in the thin film stained with Giemsa or Field's stain or calculated from the white count and the numbers of parasites per 200 white blood cells in the thick film). Gametocytes and asexual stages were counted separately. Gametocyte counts were calculated from the thick film only. Gametocyte carriage was expressed as the proportion of patients with patent gametocytemia either before treatment (i.e., on admission) or at any time after the start of treatment. The gametocyte clearance time was defined as the interval from the first detection of gametocytes in peripheral blood films either before or after treatment to the last detection of gametocytes. The variables describing parasite clearance were time taken until the asexual malaria parasite count fell by 50% (PC50), time taken to fall by 90% (PC90) of the pre-treatment admission value, and the time taken to fall below detectable levels in a peripheral blood smear (PCT); parasite reduction ratio (PRR) was the ratio of the parasite count before treatment to the counts at 24 hours and at 48 hours. Recurrence of vivax malaria could have resulted from recrudescence or relapse but not re-infection because these patients remained out of the transmission area throughout the follow-up period. In an individual patient whose parasitemia cleared, recrudescence or relapse of <italic>P. vivax</italic> cannot be distinguished reliably.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Reappearance of parasitemia within 28 days was therefore considered together as treatment failure. Reappearance rates were also compared with other studies conducted in the same hospital with similar patient populations, similar study procedures, and similar follow-up in which the dose and duration of primaquine treatment varied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>The data from each treatment group were compared by one-way analysis of variance. Non-parametric data were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The cumulative cure rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis censoring for loss to follow-up or appearance of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and were compared using the log rank test. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the association between gametocyte counts, parasite counts, fever clearance, and parasite clearance times.

The majority of patients acquired malaria infection from the western border of Thailand (<italic>N</italic> = 74, 87.1%) and a high proportion (<italic>N</italic> = 37; 43.5%) had had at least one malaria infection in the past year (median 2; range 1 to 10 attacks). All patients presented with a history of fever (median 4; range 1 to 20 days) before hospital admission. The geometric mean (range) peripheral blood <italic>P. vivax</italic> asexual parasite count was 6,205/&#x000b5;L (33 to 97,968/&#x000b5;L). Overall 29% (<italic>N =</italic> 25) of patients had detectable gametocytemia at presentation. The median (range) gametocyte count was 41/&#x000b5;L (16&#x02013;110/&#x000b5;L). The majority of patients (88%) were thrombocytopenic (platelets &#x0003c; 180,000/&#x000b5;L) but none had significant abnormalities of other baseline hematology results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Between the two treatment groups randomized to receive 30 mg or 60 mg primaquine daily for 7 days (<italic>N</italic> = 43 and 42), serum glutamic-pyruvic transferase (sGPT) concentrations were significantly higher in the high dose group (median 24; range 8 to 84 versus 19; 5 to 147 U/liter, <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) but all baseline characteristics and other laboratory findings were similar in the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.24).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Clinical course.</title><p>All patients made a full clinical recovery after treatment. One patient developed acute tonsillitis on day 5 but responded well to antibiotics (amoxicillin). His fever cleared 201 hours after starting primaquine treatment. The overall mean (SD) parasite clearance time was 87.7 hours (25.3 hours). The overall median (range) parasite reduction ratios at 24 hours and 48 hours were 2 (0.1&#x02013;4.1) and 14.4 (0.1&#x02013;1376), respectively.

As <italic>P. vivax</italic> is traditionally considered more difficult to eliminate than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, current global initiatives against vivax malaria may be unsuccessful if primaquine remains only a theoretical recommendation. Chloroquine resistance in <italic>P. vivax</italic> is now established in several areas, notably Oceania and in Indonesia. As primaquine has significant asexual stage activity against <italic>P. vivax</italic>, the combination of chloroquine and primaquine would be expected to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. India, which harbors the majority of the world's <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections, recommended an inadequate primaquine dose regimen (5 days only) for radical cure for nearly half a century, but perhaps the reason that chloroquine resistance did not emerge there was because of combination treatment against the asexual stage infection. If an effective radical cure could be given in a shorter duration than 2 weeks, then adherence would be expected to improve.</p><p>Chloroquine is still the most widely used vivax malaria treatment in the world. Given alone for tropical frequent relapse <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections, the first relapse which usually emerges at 3 weeks in Southeast Asia, is suppressed by residual therapeutic levels of chloroquine in the blood (post treatment prophylaxis). Assessment of radical curative regimens with chloroquine therefore require long follow-up, and may underestimate true relapse rates. It is not known whether the suppressed relapse is prevented or delayed. The 8-aminoquinolines are the only class of drug with radical curative activity, although there is intriguing evidence that other quinoline antimalarials may synergize with them in this activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Soon after the introduction of primaquine over 50 years ago it was established that radical cure was a function of the total dose given. Daily dosing was limited by toxicity. In this study of G6PD normal Thai adult males, the 7-day regimen of 60 mg base adult dose per day was well tolerated. It proved superior to the lower dose regimen in terms of late recurrences. As reinfection was excluded late recurrences could have resulted from either recrudescence or relapse. In previous studies in which primaquine was combined with artesunate, which has no radical curative activity but is highly effective against the blood stage infection,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> the recurrence rate with 7 days artesunate plus primaquine at a dose of 60 mg base/day was similar to that observed in the present study with primaquine only at 60 mg base/day. As recurrences following artesunate regimens are likely to be all relapses this suggests that the significantly higher recurrence rate (29% versus 7%) with the 30 mg/day primaquine monotherapy resulted both from the higher rate of relapses (~12%) but also a greater proportion of recrudescences (~17%) (Supplemental Appendix; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This indicates that 30 mg/day does not provide maximum asexual stage activity whereas 60 mg/day provides 97% of maximal blood stage effect (Supplemental Appendix). The extrapolated dose-response relationship for relapse prevention (radical curative activity) suggests that 30 mg primaquine a day for 7 days gives approximately 72% of maximal relapse prevention, but is still inferior to the 60 mg/day regimen (92% of maximum) (Supplemental Appendix; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These estimates are approximate as confidence intervals are wide, and it is possible that first recurrences (either relapse or recrudescence) could have occurred after the 28 day observation period. This confirms that primaquine has intrinsically weaker asexual stage activity than chloroquine or artemisinin derivatives,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> and it suggests that the dose response relationship for radical curative activity differs to that for asexual stage activity.</p><p>From a practical therapeutic perspective the higher dose shorter course regimen, if generally well tolerated, may be a preferable component of combination treatment regimens for vivax malaria. Further studies to assess tolerability in a broader age range are now indicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Appendix: Estimation of Relapse and Recrudescence Rates in the Present Study</title></caption><media xlink:href="SD1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e581" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pukrittayakamee</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanijanonta</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Chantra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Clemens</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group><year>1994</year><article-title>Blood stage antimalarial efficacy of primaquine in <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria</article-title><source>J Infect Dis</source><volume>169</volume><fpage>932</fpage><lpage>935</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8133114</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baird</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Lacy</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Basri</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Barcus</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Maguire</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Bangs</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gramzinski</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sismadi</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Krisin, Ling</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiady</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Kusumaningsih</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name><name><surname>Fryauff</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoffman</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name></person-group><year>2001</year><article-title>Randomized, parallel placebo-controlled trial of primaquine for malaria prophylaxis in Papua, Indonesia</article-title><source>Clin Infect Dis</source><volume>33</volume><fpage>1990</fpage><lpage>1997</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11712091</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Soto</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Toledo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodriquez</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Herrera</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Padilla</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><year>1998</year><article-title>Primaquine prophylaxis against malaria in nonimmune Colombian soldiers: efficacy and toxicity.
