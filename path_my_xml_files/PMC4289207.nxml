The participants were overweight and obese students aged between 8 and 12 from six participating schools. The interventions involved students attending ten 75&#x000a0;minutes after-school sessions and one 3-hour week-end session of practical interactive and fun activities on healthy eating and exercise, and meal plan together with parents and printed tailor-made management advices. Parents received an introductory seminar with 2 sets of specially designed exercise for their overweight children. The tools to measure bodyweight and fat percentage and standing height were bio-impedance body fat scale and a portable stadiometer. Self-administered questionnaire was used to measure knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. McNemar test was utilized to compare the proportions of behaviour changes within the same group to assess for the trends of changes. BMI z-score and body fat percentage of intervention participants at baseline, 4&#x000a0;month and 8&#x000a0;month were compared pair-wisely using tests of within subject contrasts in repeated measures ANOVA to assess for programme sustainability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Those students in the intervention group reduced their BMI z-score (-0.21, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.07, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003) and body fat (-2.67%, 95% CI -5.12 to -0.22, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033) compared to wait list control group with statistical significant, and the intervention group also had a significant reduction in BMI z-score (-0.06, 95% CI -0.11, -0.007, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.028) and body fat (-1.71%, 95% CI, -3.44 to 0.02, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.052) after a 4&#x000a0;month maintenance period.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese population especially mainland China, is fast catching up with the West [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There are already signs of epidemic of childhood obesity in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another emerging country, Brazil also shows similar pattern with increase from 4% to 14% between 1974 and 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with a shift towards the poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Childhood obesity poses immediate health concerns and long-term health risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and social, emotional and psychological difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Obesity is now a significant risk factor accounting for the global burden of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It also poses problems in learning as shown by Iceland study that body mass index, diet and physical activity would explain up to 24% of the variance in academic performance after controlling major confounders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review has reported that lifestyle interventions incorporating dietary and exercise components with or without behaviour therapy would lead to improvement of weight and cardio-metabolic outcomes among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Only two studies on Chinese population were included. One study was conducted in one middle school in Beijing China with 33 students receiving family based behavioural treatment and 35 students in control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and the other study in Taiwan with 12&#x000a0;weeks heart health education and physical activity program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although general practitioners (GPs) as the first point of patient contact should be able to tackle the issue of childhood obesity, lack of experience, time and resources as well as guidelines on practical approach become the barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Individualized interventions by GPs might not be intensive enough to bring about weight reduction for substantial behavioural modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Meta-analytic review of 64 obesity prevention programmes (46 trials) for children and adolescents did not reveal significant effects to prevent weight-gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Community based intervention with greater emphasis on environmental changes (both physical and social) has shown to be more effective as children&#x02019;s behaviours are much more environmental dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Parental or family involvement in interventions would have impact on nutrition and physical activities of the children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] leading to weight reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>School is another setting in which the children spend a substantial amount of time. Policies targeting the school environment can be considered as key strategy to address childhood obesity as school resources and practices would have impact on the availability of specific food and beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Evidence has shown that home and school environments promoting unhealthy eating habit and physical inactivity are precursors of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Systematic reviews on school based obesity prevention programmes did not provide consistent evidence of the efficacy of school-based programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Most of the interventions focused on short-term changes right after the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], or process outcomes with no significant changes of behavioural outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite major reduction in consumption of high calorie beverages and snacks among intervention group in a randomised school-based intervention involving families and teachers to prevent excessive weight gain among adolescents in Brazil, no significant change of BMI was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>&#x02018;Healthy Setting&#x02019; approach such as Health Promoting School (HPS) delivers health promotion activities in the context of daily life and provides the &#x02018;social structures&#x02019; to reach the defined population i.e., the students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Schools adopting the HPS approach would be more willing to implement more intensive health promoting activities for the overweight and obese students so it is a potential avenue for more rigorous multi-component programme. This pilot study employed measures to evaluate the efficacy and sustainability of a 4&#x000a0;month school-based lifestyle intervention integrating into a boarder HPS approach on weight loss and behavioural changes in overweight and obese students by fostering individual focused weight management plan. This study also evaluated the impact of the interventions on their parents. To our knowledge, this is one of the very few studies delivered in schools which implemented a broader HPS initiative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study has been registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN 58795797) and the study was vetted and approved by Sub-committee of Health Care Promotion Fund of Hong Kong SAR Government and recommended to Health Care Promotion Fund. The project also met the safety and ethical requirement of University. Inform parental consent was obtained and investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of Helsinki. The study was endorsed by the Chinese University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics (SBER) Sub-committee, and approval was granted by University SBER to conduct survey on observation of human behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study was designed as a school-based intervention study adopting wait-list control approach over one academic year from August 2007 to July 2008. Invitation letters were sent to 65 primary schools participating in HPS project. Sixteen schools replied and based on the prevalence of obesity children in the school, school district, readiness of the school, and also similarity in socio-demographic background among participating schools, 6 schools were selected to participate. The schools were responsible to recruit eligible students for the program. The inclusion criteria were age 8 to 12&#x000a0;years, overweight or obese according to International Task Force definitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] with parents&#x02019; commitment to participate in the home-school joint venture. Informed written consent was obtained from parents prior to joining the project.</p><p>In Hong Kong, all students undergo anthropometric measurements annually with results recorded so teachers would identify overweight subjects. Teachers in Hong Kong are quite well equipped with skills in discussing sensitive issues such as overweight. They are quite comfortable to discuss the issues with students and parents if there is structured educational programme to help them emphasising positive living rather than negative images.</p><p>Within the school, those eligible subjects consented to participate were randomly assigned (random numbers) to start the program immediately (intervention group) or received the intervention 4&#x000a0;months later (wait-list control group). Due to difficulties in school administrative arrangement, only 4 primary schools were able to undertake both intervention and control groups while the other 2 schools only had students in the intervention group. The findings reported in this paper were based on data from the 4 schools with both intervention and control groups.

The project team guided the participating schools to implement series of school-based activities promoting healthy eating and active lifestyles throughout the project period under the broad HPS approach enhancing the awareness of health lifestyle for all students (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This approach would reduce the contamination effect for the intervention group of students as they received the tailor-made weight management programme as well as whole school approach health promotion activities. It also reduced the co-interventions of students in wait-list control group as all students were involved in the general school based health promotion activities and they enrolled during second phase. This study evaluated the effectiveness of this multi-component weight management programme.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention program for overweight and obese students</title><p>Intervention group received 4&#x000a0;months intensive intervention conducted by the dietician, nutritionist and physiotherapist of the project team as well as teachers of the participating schools followed by 4&#x000a0;months maintenance phase. The program consisted of ten 75-minutes after-school sessions and 3&#x000a0;hours weekend session of practical, interactive and fun activities covering the topics on healthy eating, exercise and positive self-image. The sessions included 5 nutrition education sessions, 1 session on body image and self-esteem, 1 session on sport safety and 4 sessions of supervised physical activity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Strategies such as assessing readiness for change, goal-setting, self-monitoring, problem-solving, role-playing, motivational reinforcement and awards were adopted to enhance behavioural modification. Teaching strategies included interactive games, practical workshops, problem-solving activities, fun-based physical activity. A meal plan (1500 to 1800&#x000a0;kcal/day according to their age and sex, 50 to 55% total energy from carbohydrate, 15 to 20% from protein and 30% from fat) was provided for all participants in the presence of their parents at the start. Students also received printed tailor-made weight management advices. The dietetic advice included suggestions on portion of core food groups and snacks; food selection and healthy eating strategies. Exercise plans consisted of prescription on aerobic, stretching and strengthening exercise as well as suggestions on strategies to be more physical active.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Two sets of exercise specially designed for overweight children were introduced to parents together with their children so they would practise together at home. Parents received two sessions of 1-hour follow-up on further skills about healthy eating and exercise strategies to assist weight control in children. During the follow-up sessions, the dietician and physiotherapist discussed with parents in group to monitor students&#x02019; progress at home and provided solutions for problems encountered. Parents were also invited to join the food label education training together with their children. Results of anthropometric measurement together with dietary and excise advice were explained to parents together with their children immediately after each assessment to enhance their awareness. Parents were encouraged to convert their enquiries to the project team via school teachers if they could not attend the planned workshop or face-to-face consultation.

To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first weight management trial evaluated in a school setting versus a clinical or community setting. We demonstrated that a 4-month school-based child weight management programmes delivered in HPS is efficacious for obesity management after intervention and at 8-month follow up. Significant changes in BMI z-score and percent body fat were observed. The reduction in BMI z-score are of similar magnitude as reported in 2009 Cochrane review of lifestyle trials in children under 12&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Although statistical significant improvements were observed only on few health behaviours with established linked to weight control, reverse trend was observed for control group. The findings still alert the possible impact on behavioural change.</p><p>Integration of knowledge concerning healthy dietary intake, physical activity habits, and smoking and drug prevention through specified modified school curriculum needs to act in parallel with other strategies to tackle the environmental and economic limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. An Active Programme Promoting Lifestyle Education in School in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and some previous studies mainly showed change in nutritional knowledge rather than significant changes in behaviour or short to intermediate term health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Cost-effective intervention should target children at higher risk and devote more resources to intensive interventions integrating nutrition and physical activities with strong family components similar to this study and some other recent studies. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>The WHO concept of HPS is seen as most promising approach as it incorporates actions addressing the school physical and social environment not just health education. The interventions adopted in this study were embedded in a supportive environment for HPS. If the targets were weight loss and weight maintenance, the insignificant findings of wait-list schools despite the supportive environment suggest that the HPS model ought to be supplemented by intensive interventions and parental engagement. The researchers of this study have successful implemented HPS in Hong Kong demonstrating health improvement amongst students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This programme building on the successful model of HPS has demonstrated the potential of overcoming the environmental and economic barriers, and moving beyond curriculum as curriculum approach alone had limited effectiveness in improvement of physical activities. The school environment would shape youth health via common pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This might explain why not many other school based weight control programmes showed improvement of anthropometric measures within a short period of time. Building on existing HPS framework would add synergy to school based health promotion initiatives.</p><p>There are limitations of this pilot study. We are unable to determine if the environment component was essential to success because of design limitations in this pilot study. Further research should compare students receiving group education/counselling and parent education alone with students receiving the intervention within boarder HPS activities. The sample size of this study might not have adequate power to detect the difference of behaviours between intervention and control groups with statistical significant. Behaviour outcomes should also be quantified more precisely. It was not done in this pilot study to avoid over burdening the participants. Statistical significant difference of mean age 10.1 vs 10.7 was found between intervention and control groups but the impact on health behaviours would be minimal. Although the programme has received very positive feedbacks from students, parents and schools, the duration of intervention was too short for monitoring longer term effects. The heavy commitment of students in other activities also limited the participation of eligible students in this programme. Education sector should take note of the findings and evaluation from stakeholders of this pilot programme and accord higher priority for school based weight management programme.</p><p>Our programme puts a strong emphasis on parental participation with more parents engaging in exercise, improved cooking styles and discussing the importance of physical activities with their children, and continued to do so after intervention period. A systematic review of environmental correlates of obesity-related youth dietary behaviours shows consistent associations between parental intake and children&#x02019;s fat and their fruit/vegetable intakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Long term school-parent partnership and education intervention has shown positive statistical significant results in overall physical activity incidence, and adiposity and fitness measures such as BMI, sit and reach flexibility, and 20&#x000a0;m shuttle run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It would also help families at lower socio-economic status to ameliorate the moderation effect of socio-economic status on relationship between psychosocial predictors and healthy eating of students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The scale of the obesity epidemic makes it difficult to manage overweight and obese children on one to one basis through clinical services alone.
