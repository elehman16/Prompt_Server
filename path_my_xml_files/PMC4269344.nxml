Patient-reported outcomes, which provide insight into the impact of treatment on patients' quality of life are often omitted or included only as secondary or exploratory analyses. A recent systematic review of clinical trials of approved prostate cancer therapies showed that only 17% of trials included patient-reported outcomes or health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) measures [<xref rid="MDU510C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], yet this type of information is highly relevant to patients with advanced prostate cancer. The increasing use of HRQoL data has prompted guidance from industry regulators [<xref rid="MDU510C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and calls from opinion leaders [<xref rid="MDU510C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] for a more patient-oriented approach to drug development in oncology.</p><p>In the randomized phase III AFFIRM study, enzalutamide, an oral androgen receptor inhibitor that acts on different steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway, significantly prolonged overall survival compared with placebo in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDU510C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The AFFIRM study also included secondary end points involving patient-reported outcomes on HRQoL, reported using tools such as the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) [<xref rid="MDU510C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="MDU510C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The FACT-P is a reliable and validated multidimensional disease-specific instrument for assessing HRQoL in patients with prostate cancer [<xref rid="MDU510C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In AFFIRM, a responder analysis of HRQoL using FACT-P total score indicated that a significantly higher proportion of patients randomized to enzalutamide had improvements in overall HRQoL compared with placebo [<xref rid="MDU510C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent industry guidance [<xref rid="MDU510C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] encourages the use of cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots, which present the percentage of responders at each score change value, as a supplementary methodological approach to HRQoL responder analyses. CDF plots allow an at-a-glance view of the difference between treatment groups across all possible score changes, rather than at a single score as in a responder analysis.</p><p>In this paper, we present CDF plots of the FACT-P data from the AFFIRM study. In addition, we report the longitudinal FACT-P data over 25 weeks of treatment with enzalutamide and placebo in the AFFIRM study population, which include details on domain-specific HRQoL by disaggregating the total FACT-P score.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdu510_s2"><title>methods</title><sec id="mdu510_s2a"><title>study design</title><p>AFFIRM was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 156 sites in 15 countries in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and South Africa (NCT00974311).

FACT-P is a 39-item questionnaire with five subscales: physical wellbeing (PWB), social/family wellbeing (SWB), emotional wellbeing (EWB), functional wellbeing (FWB), and prostate cancer subscale (PCS) [<xref rid="MDU510C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, three indices [trial outcome index (TOI) [<xref rid="MDU510C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index (FAPSI) [<xref rid="MDU510C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and PCS pain-related score [<xref rid="MDU510C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]] have been developed to capture the most relevant questions about physical functioning, prostate cancer symptoms, and pain. FACT-P has several empirically derived score differences that are documented as meaningful, surpassing a value that could be considered a minimally important difference (MID). There is no single or certain MID for all applications; therefore, a range of important differences is generally provided. Ranges of likely important differences applied in the present analyses were: FACT-P total score, 6&#x02013;10 points [<xref rid="MDU510C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; FACT-P general health subscale (FACT-G) total score, 5&#x02013;7 points [<xref rid="MDU510C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; all FACT-P subscales, 2&#x02013;3 points [<xref rid="MDU510C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="MDU510C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; TOI, 5&#x02013;9 points [<xref rid="MDU510C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; FAPSI, 2&#x02013;3 points [<xref rid="MDU510C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; and PCS pain-related score, 1&#x02013;2 points [<xref rid="MDU510C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="mdu510_s2e"><title>statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses described here were exploratory, as per protocol, and conducted to provide a more detailed and elaborate set of sensitivity analyses around the positive planned analyses [<xref rid="MDU510C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

MMRM analysis uses all available data and assumes that any missing observations are missing at random. To address the possibility that missing data were not at random, a second analysis was carried out using a pattern mixture model (PMM) with placebo-based pattern imputation [<xref rid="MDU510C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="MDU510C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Enzalutamide has been shown to significantly prolong overall survival in men with mCRPC after docetaxel-based chemotherapy, compared with placebo, in the AFFIRM study [<xref rid="MDU510C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This study also included a detailed assessment of patient HRQoL using the disease-specific FACT-P instrument. We present the longitudinal FACT-P data from the AFFIRM study which show that, after 25 weeks of treatment, the changes in FACT-P total score and all subscale scores from baseline are significantly smaller (indicating less HRQoL deterioration) with enzalutamide than placebo. Further, the changes observed with enzalutamide were negligible or small. In contrast, placebo-treated patients showed a marked and steady deterioration in HRQoL. Most scores fell within or below the range indicating likely important deterioration by week 13 or 17. Taken together, these results suggest that, in this study, enzalutamide stabilizes HRQoL in patients with progressive mCRPC who, if left untreated, would experience a rapid and clinically significant HRQoL deterioration.</p><p>One of the earliest reports that investigated the impact of treatment on QoL on patients with advanced prostate cancer demonstrated that docetaxel, estramustine, and low-dose hydrocortisone significantly improved FACT-P scores from baseline [<xref rid="MDU510C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the more recent TAX-327 study in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, the median time to QoL response was similar among the treatment arms (3-weekly docetaxel, docetaxel, or mitoxatrone, all with prednisone) [<xref rid="MDU510C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The more detailed analyses reported here further support the improvements in pain and increased time to HRQoL deterioration observed with enzalutamide compared with placebo reported with the BPI-SF and FACT-P in AFFIRM [<xref rid="MDU510C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similar results on improving HRQoL and delaying HRQoL deterioration assessed using FACT-P have also been reported for abiraterone plus prednisone compared with prednisone alone in patients with mCRPC post-docetaxel [<xref rid="MDU510C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The previously reported AFFIRM prespecified HRQoL responder analysis [<xref rid="MDU510C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed a statistically significant higher proportion of enzalutamide- versus placebo-treated patients had improved HRQoL based on FACT-P total and subscale scores, using a responder definition, i.e. &#x02018;a score change in a measure experienced by an individual patient over a predetermined time period that has been demonstrated in the target population to have a significant treatment benefit&#x02019; [<xref rid="MDU510C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An alternative method of presentation recently advocated by the US Food and Drug Administration [<xref rid="MDU510C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is to present the entire distribution of responses for each treatment, thereby avoiding the need to select a single responder definition. CDF plots of the AFFIRM data show clear separation of the curves favoring enzalutamide for all FACT-P scores and subscales, except for EWB, PWB, and SWB. This reinforces the findings from the responder analysis, and suggests that the HRQoL effects of enzalutamide are most marked for the disease-specific and symptom-focused indices, rather than the more general items which would not necessarily be expected to be influenced by drug treatment.</p><p>Although various statistical methods (e.g. MMRM, PMM, selection models, etc.) are available to analyze longitudinal data, there is no universally accepted method for handling missing data as each method requires assumptions to be made about the nature of the missing values. A primary analysis alone is not sufficient when there are substantial, non-random missing data. In the AFFIRM study, most patients (&#x0223c;80&#x02013;90%) discontinued treatment because of disease progression. For the primary analysis, we used MMRM, which assumes that the missing data follow the pattern of patients who remained on study. For the sensitivity analysis, we applied a PMM model with placebo-based pattern imputation, which considers that data may not be missing at random. Placebo-based pattern imputation assumes that, after treatment discontinuation, patients who withdraw from enzalutamide will tend to show outcomes closer to placebo-treated patients. As similar results were observed using both analytical methods (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDU510F1">1</xref>), we suggest that the longitudinal findings were not strongly dependent on the nature of the missing data.</p><p>While most patients completed the FACT-P questionnaire at baseline, the completion rates decreased at later time points due to attrition associated with disease progression, particularly in the placebo group. This pattern of attrition makes interpretation of data difficult and can lead to overestimation of HRQoL at later time points. To address this imbalance, the MMRM analysis of longitudinal data was limited to 25 weeks. It has also been shown that MMRM works well when there is unbalanced withdrawal [<xref rid="MDU510C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="MDU510C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the results of the MMRM analysis should be interpreted in the context of a conservative statistical approach, also confirmed by the results of the sensitivity analysis.</p><p>A strength of the AFFIRM study was that it involved a large global patient population and the findings are likely to be generalizable to men with progressive mCRPC after chemotherapy. The baseline FACT-P scores of the AFFIRM study population were similar to a reference population with advanced prostate cancer [<xref rid="MDU510C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and therefore in line with values that would be expected for these patients. An additional strength of the AFFIRM study was its placebo-controlled design, because, at the time the study was designed, there was no approved second-line therapy following progression on docetaxel-based chemotherapy for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, the survival benefit of enzalutamide is accompanied by stabilization of patient HRQoL, as assessed by FACT-P, compared with placebo in men with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer after prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Application of different analytic methods to the FACT-P data presented here further corroborate the HRQoL benefits observed with enzalutamide in the AFFIRM study.</p></sec><sec id="mdu510_s5"><title>funding</title><p>The study was supported by Astellas Pharma Inc. and Medivation Inc.
