Ambrisentan is a selective endothelin type A receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of patients with PAH World Health Organization group 1. The efficacy and safety of ambrisentan has been evaluated in the ARIES series (Ambrisentan for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter, Efficacy Studies), which has established its use as both monotherapy or in conjunction with other PAH therapies. Specifically, ambrisentan is effective at increasing exercise tolerance, decreasing the risk of functional class deterioration, and prolonging time to clinical worsening. Further, ambrisentan has a favorable effect on mortality, with an 88% patient survival rate after two years of therapy compared with a 61% survival rate as estimated by the National Institute of Health Registry. Ambrisentan is generally well tolerated in all patient groups, with the main side effects of peripheral edema, sinusitis, flushing, and nasal congestion considered to be mild to moderate in nature. Ambrisentan has several favorable qualities that potentially make it more acceptable to patients, including once-daily administration, limited adverse drug reactions and drug-drug interactions, and minimal risk of liver enzyme elevation. Because of the potential risk of teratogenicity associated with ambrisentan, it is only available through a limited distribution program, ie, LEAP (the Letairis Education and Access Program). Ongoing clinical trials will help to clarify the role of ambrisentan in the treatment of PAH.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ambrisentan</kwd><kwd>endothelin</kwd><kwd>endothelin receptor antagonist</kwd><kwd>pulmonary arterial hypertension</kwd><kwd>Letairis Education and Access Program</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a unique and progressively debilitating disease that is characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure secondary to vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, and remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature.

Additional tests (human immunodeficiency virus and antinuclear antibody serology, ventilation/perfusion scan, pulmonary function tests, overnight oximetry, liver function tests) should be done to determine the etiology of suspected PAH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ppa-7-401">2</xref> Confirmation of the diagnosis of PAH requires right heart catheterization, which is also used to determine disease severity and to guide treatment decisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ppa-7-401">2</xref></p><p>PAH is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) according to etiology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-7-401">3</xref> WHO group 1 PAH is the most prevalent, and includes PAH associated with idiopathic etiology, genetic predisposition, congenital heart abnormalities, connective tissue disorder, portal hypertension, use of anorexigen, and human immunodeficiency virus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-7-401">3</xref> WHO groups 2&#x02013;5 refer to PAH associated with left heart disease, lung disease, chronic thromboembolic disease, and miscellaneous causes, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-7-401">3</xref></p><p>Progression and prognosis of PAH is nonlinear. Clinical status and severity are classified by the WHO functional classification scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-7-401">4</xref> Functional classification I represents patients with the least restrictive symptoms (asymptomatic) on ordinary activities of daily living, while functional classification IV describes the most functionally impaired patients, in whom symptoms occur at rest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-7-401">4</xref> Functional classifications II and III refer to patients with slight limitations on activities of daily living and those with marked limitations on activities of daily living, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-7-401">4</xref> WHO functional classification I and II are associated with the best prognosis, and have a median predicted survival of 58 months; class III has a less favorable prognosis of 36 months; and class IV is associated with the worst prognosis, having a median survival of 6 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-7-401">1</xref></p><p>The pathogenesis of PAH is the result of an imbalance between key mediators in the pulmonary circulation. This imbalance leads to increased thrombosis, vasoconstriction, and proliferation of smooth muscle and endothelial cells within the pulmonary vasculature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-7-401">5</xref> Among these mediators is endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates the proliferation of smooth muscle cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ppa-7-401">6</xref> Levels of endothelin-1 have been established to be elevated in patients with PAH and contribute to progression of the disease. This observed increase in endothelin-1 levels is correlated with a proportional decrease in pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-7-401">5</xref> As a result, therapies that block the detrimental effects of endothelin-1 have been recently developed.</p><p>Endothelin receptor antagonists represent a drug class currently being utilized in the management of PAH. Ambrisentan (Letairis&#x000ae;, Gilead Sciences Inc, Foster City, CA, USA) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007 for the treatment of primary PAH (WHO group 1). The purpose of this review is to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient acceptability of ambrisentan in the treatment of PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacology</title><p>Ambrisentan is a propanoic acid, nonsulfonamide, selective endothelin type A (ET<sub>A</sub>) receptor antagonist. The endothelin neurohormonal system is comprised of three isoforms, ie, endothelin-1, endothelin-2, and endothelin-3, each consisting of 21 amino acid residues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ppa-7-401">7</xref> The most abundant and predominant isoform is endothelin-1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-7-401">8</xref> Endothelin-1 has potent vasoconstrictor activity as well as proliferative and hypertrophic actions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-7-401">8</xref> Levels of endothelin-1 have been demonstrated to be elevated in patients with PAH and contribute to progression of the disease. Endothelin acts via two specific receptor subtypes, ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub>, which have different pharmacologic functions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ppa-7-401">9</xref> ET<sub>A</sub> receptors mediate the vasoconstrictive, proliferative, and hypertrophic effects of endothelin-1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-7-401">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-7-401">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ppa-7-401">11</xref> ET<sub>B</sub> receptors promote vasodilation via release of nitric oxide or prostacyclin, and mediates the pulmonary clearance of circulating endothelin-1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-7-401">12</xref> In the human lung, ET<sub>A</sub> is the dominant endothelin receptor subtype, existing in a ratio of 93:7 compared with the ET<sub>B</sub> subtype.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-7-401">13</xref></p><p>Given the activity and location of the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor, therapy has been targeted towards blocking the effect of endothelin on the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor, utilizing either the nonselective ET<sub>A</sub>/ET<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist, bosentan, or the selective ET<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, ambrisentan (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-7-401">Table 1</xref>). A previous selective endothelin receptor antagonist, sitaxsentan, was approved for treatment of PAH in the European Union and Canada, but was removed from the market as a result of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-7-401">14</xref> There are theoretical benefits for using a selective ET<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, which include blocking the vasoconstrictive and proliferative effects of endothelin-1 at the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor, while at the same time preserving the potentially beneficial effect of endothelin-1 activation at the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor (vasodilation and enhanced clearance of endothelin-1). Which type of endothelin-1 antagonist is preferred is debatable, because there are currently no head-to-head clinical trials comparing the two therapies; however, both agents have documented clinical benefits in the treatment of PAH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ppa-7-401">15</xref></p><p>As mentioned, ambrisentan is a selective antagonist of the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor, with an affinity of &#x0003e;4000:1 as compared with the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-7-401">17</xref> Administration of ambrisentan in patients with PAH is associated with vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, as evidenced by a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ppa-7-401">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Ambrisentan is rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations achieved at two hours post administration, and administration with food has no effect on its bioavailability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-7-401">17</xref> Ambrisentan undergoes intestinal extrusion through the P-glycoprotein system, is highly protein-bound (99%), and is eliminated predominantly by nonrenal mechanisms, with&#x0003c;5% excreted unchanged in the urine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-7-401">17</xref> Therefore, the dose of ambrisentan does not need adjustment in individuals with mild to moderate renal impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref> There are currently no data on the use of ambrisentan in patients with severe renal impairment or those receiving hemodialysis.

As a result, ambrisentan dosing should not exceed 5 mg per day if coadministered with cyclosporine. Ambrisentan does not inhibit or induce hepatic drug metabolism pathways. Specific to the treatment of PAH, ambrisentan does not interact with sildenafil, tadalafil, warfarin, or digoxin. The elimination half-life of ambrisentan is 15 hours, although the mean trough concentration at steady-state with once-daily dosing is only 15% of the mean peak concentration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-7-401">17</xref> However, no studies have examined the clinical effects at trough concentration nor the effect of twice-daily dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability</title><p>Ambrisentan is marketed as Letairis&#x000ae; in 5 mg and 10 mg tablets.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref> Because of the potential risk of teratogenicity, ambrisentan is only available through the Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ppa-7-401">19</xref> which is a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies program designed to eliminate the risk of fetal abnormalities and/or death in females of childbearing potential receiving ambrisentan.

The frequency with which adverse drug reactions occurred was similar in all three dosing groups, with the exception of worsening PAH, which occurred more frequently in the 2.5 mg group (7.3%) than the 5 mg (2.1%) and 10 mg (3.1%) treatment groups.</p><p>The risk of developing alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal was relatively low, occurring in 1.8% and 3.9% of patients at year 1 and year 2, respectively.

These side effects were mild to moderate in nature, and rarely resulted in discontinuation of therapy. Some serious side effects were reported, including right ventricular heart failure, pneumonia, and worsening PAH. This was not a placebo-controlled study, so it is difficult to assess whether these adverse events were as a result of disease progression or use of ambrisentan.</p><p>Supporting the findings of the previously discussed studies, ARIES-3 did not report a significant increase in aminotransferase levels in patients receiving ambrisentan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ppa-7-401">27</xref> Four patients had alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels that were greater than three times the upper limit of normal but less than five times the upper limit of normal, and were allowed to continue therapy with no adverse outcomes reported. Two patients experienced alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels that were greater than eight times the upper limit of normal and were not allowed to continue therapy; one patient was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and the second patient was found to be taking other hepatotoxic drugs. Further, the mean hemoglobin concentration showed a slight decrease from baseline at 24 weeks (0.92 &#x000b1; 1.3 g/dL), but was not correlated with any major bleeding events.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Patient acceptability</title><p>Currently, there are no clinical studies evaluating patient acceptability of ambrisentan therapy.

Ambrisentan is administered once daily, compared with bosentan, which is administered twice daily.

This requirement was removed in March 2011 after the FDA revised the black box warning to exclude liver injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ppa-7-401">30</xref> The FDA cited the low incidence of liver injuries in both clinical trial and post-marketing studies to support their decision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ppa-7-401">30</xref> The FDA currently recommends that providers order a liver function test as clinically necessary in patients using ambrisentan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ppa-7-401">30</xref></p><p>Further, because it is only a minor CYPC19 and CYP3A4 substrate, ambrisentan has a more favorable metabolism and drug interaction profile than bosentan (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-7-401">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ppa-7-401">31</xref> Ambrisentan is safe for use with all PAH and most non-PAH therapies, with cyclosporine being the only established drug-drug interaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref> In contrast, bosentan is both a major substrate and inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, so has the potential to interact with numerous medications, including several agents used to treat PAH (sildenafil, tadalafil, nifedipine, warfarin).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ppa-7-401">31</xref></p><p>Ambrisentan and bosentan have both been associated with decreases in hemoglobin concentration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ppa-7-401">31</xref> This has not been associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage or hemolysis, but anemia has been reported during post-marketing surveillance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ppa-7-401">31</xref> Use of ambrisentan is not contraindicated in patients with decreased hemoglobin levels, but is not recommended for use in those with clinically significant anemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref> The recommended monitoring is slightly different between the two agents, with bosentan requiring more frequent monitoring than ambrisentan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-401">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ppa-7-401">31</xref></p><p>Other factors that may influence patient acceptability include the reproductive risks associated with endothelin receptor antagonists. One such risk is the potential for decreased spermatogenesis in males.

However, this risk is extensively monitored through the comprehensive Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies programs. While there are no comparative studies between the endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil), clinicians may be inclined to use phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors because of their ready availability and favorable adverse effect profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ambrisentan is a selective ET<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with PAH WHO group 1.

Access to ambrisentan is restricted through LEAP, because of the potential risk of teratogenicity associated with its use. As with many of the current treatments of PAH, further clinical trials are needed to define the optimal utilization of ambrisentan for treatment of the
