SADs are routinely used these days during anesthesia, after failed tracheal intubation as airway rescue, facilitating tracheal intubation by acting as a conduit and to secure airway during emergencies. They have an advantage over endotracheal tube (ETT) intubation in patients with difficult airways and also enable ventilation in patients with difficult facemask ventilation. Thus, in situations where facemask ventilation and laryngoscope-guided tracheal intubation have failed, the LMA has a high likelihood of succeeding.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Being noninvasive when compared to endotracheal intubation, it causes minimal disturbances in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Another advantage is that the LMA can be used both as a ventilatory device and for intubation of the airway. Also that, tracheal intubation through the LMA can take place in an unhurried fashion while the patient is being oxygenated and his &#x02044; her lungs ventilated. In addition, insertion of the LMA is atraumatic and does not reduce the chances of other techniques subsequently succeeding.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] LMA could be inserted without the aid of a laryngoscope or neuromuscular blockade.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The widespread use of the LMA in routine anesthesia practice means that it is readily available and most anesthesiologists reasonably skilled in its use. The other advantages offered by LMA over ETT include ease of placement even by inexperienced personnel; improved hemodynamic stability at induction and during emergence; minimal increase in intraocular pressure following insertion; reduced anesthetic requirements for airway tolerance; lower frequency of coughing during emergence; improved oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) during emergence; and lower incidence of sore throat in adults.</p><p>On the other hand, the tube is placed into the trachea in ETT intubation. Although it remains the gold standard procedure for airway management, it is not without its disadvantages such as abnormality in hemodynamic and respiratory parameters failed intubation, tension pneumothorax, spinal cord and vertebral column injury, pulmonary aspiration, occlusion of central artery of retina and blindness, airway obstruction the corneal abrasion disconnection and dislodgement, difficult extubation, sore throat, cuff-related problems, laryngeal edema, ETT sutured to trachea or bronchus, hoarseness of voice, laryngeal edema, nerve injury, and may more.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In long duration surgeries such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the use of ETT is associated with various hemodynamic complications such as hypertension (HT), tachycardia, and arrhythmia. Such hemodynamic changes that occur during intubation may alter the delicate balance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply and precipitate myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] PLMA offers the advantage of minimal hemodynamic complications over ETT during such surgeries. However, except for few studies, there are no significant data available that promote the use of laryngeal mask during cardiac surgery. This prospective study was conducted with the objective of demonstrating the advantages of PLMA over ETT in the patients undergoing beating-heart CABG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methodology</title><p>This observational comparison study was carried out in 200 patients who underwent beating-heart CABG. The study was commenced after taking permission from the Ethics Committee. Those patients who consented to participate in the study and gave written consent were included in the study. The patients were purposively selected to either of the two groups; the first group consisted of patients in whom ETT was used for securing airway during anesthesia and second group consisted of patients in whom PLMA was used for securing airway during anesthesia. 100 patients were selected in each group, i.e., 100 patients in ETT group and 100 patients in PLMA group. For the present study, a sample size of 200 patients, 100 patients in each group, was determined based on attainment of primary and secondary variables using the actual data information from study procedure.</p><p>Patients with obesity, sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, major abdominal surgery or warranting intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography, emergency surgery, crashed angioplasty, preoperatively on high inotropic support, difficult intubation, patients with life-threatening arrhythmias or on intra-aortic balloon pump, unstable angina patients with poor left ventricular function, i.e., ejection fraction &#x0003c;35% were excluded from the study.</p><p>All the preoperative medications were continued until the morning of surgery, except angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients had also been off antiplatelet agents for 5&#x02013;7 days before the date of surgery. Patients were premedicated with oral lorazepam 1&#x02013;2 mg or oral alprazolam 0.5 mg on the night before surgery. Monitoring was started with the patient awake, using central venous line, arterial cannula, pulse oximeter, temperature, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), and five-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p>The following parameters were measured heart rate (HR), BP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, peak airway pressures (PAPs), and lung compliance. HR and BP were noted at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min of insertion and time to extubation was also noted. Any complication during the procedure and/or after extubation was also noted. Normothermia was maintained with the help of warm saline, warming blankets, and core and skin temperatures were duly monitored.</p><p>Based on the standard institutional protocol, the pharmacological intervention was initiated if mean arterial pressure (MAP) was &#x0003c;60 mmHg or &#x0003e;110 mmHg, or ECG signs of myocardial ischemia were noted at any time during the surgery. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg intravenously; propofol (1%) 1 mg/kg and vecuronium 0.8 mg to 1 mg/kg were used as a muscle relaxant. This was followed by securing the airway by PLMA or ETT in the respective groups. In the PLMA group, PLMA was secured with the gum elastic bougie (GEB) technique. The size of the PLMA used was determined as per the body weight of the patients; size 3, 4, and 5 for patients with weight between 30 and 50 kg, 50 and 70 kg, and 70 and 100 kg, respectively. The GEB-guided insertion technique involved the following steps: First, the distal portion of the GEB was placed 5&#x02013;10 cm into the esophagus while the assistant held the PLMA and the proximal portion of GEB; second, the PLMA was inserted using the introducer while the assistant stabilized the proximal end of the GEB, so it did not penetrate further into the esophagus; third, the GEB was removed while the PLMA was held in position; fourth, the cuff of PLMA was inflated with air until effective ventilation was established or the maximum recommended inflation volume was reached. All techniques were performed with the patient in the &#x0201c;sniffing position&#x0201d; with the cuff fully deflated and using a midline approach. A slight lateral approach was used if tactile resistance was felt at the back of the mouth. In the ETT group, 7.5 and 8.5 size tubes were used for female and male patients, respectively, and the intubation was done using standard mackintosh blade.</p><p>The patients were then maintained on isoflurane, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>&#x000d2;), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and infusion of fentanyl (1&#x02013;2 mcg/kg/h) with propofol (0.02&#x02013;0.05 mg/kg/min). Heparin 300 units/kg to achieve activated clotting time (ACT) of around 250&#x02013;300 s; after completion of grafting, heparin was reversed with protamine to achieve ACT below 150 at the time of chest closure. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade was achieved with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. When spontaneous respiratory efforts were detected, patients were maintained on assisted mode till complete spontaneous recovery.</p><p>Criteria for extubation were spontaneous eye opening, moving all four limbs, head holding for more than 5 s, PaO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;8.0 kPa with a FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.4, core temperature above 36.0&#x000b0;C and blood loss &#x0003c;50 ml/h, normal reflexes, obeying verbal command, normal arterial blood gas, serum electrolytes, and ACT. Following extubation, final set of readings was taken; patients were asked for their names and pain score using the visual analog scale on a score of 0&#x02013;10 and shifted to the Intensive Care Unit with an oxygen mask. Postoperatively, analgesia was provided using fentanyl infusion (2-20 mcg/kg), and rescue analgesia was given with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac 75 mg by parenteral route).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using statistical software EpiInfo (U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services, USA). The primary variables studied were BP and pulse rate. Secondary variables were PAP, compliance, partial pCO<sub>2</sub>, and peripheral capillary SpO<sub>2</sub>.

This increase in arterial pressure was a similar, but attenuated, response to that after tracheal intubation. They also report a significant increase in HR immediately after LMA insertion which is contradictory to the findings of the current study. The reason might be that there is more mechanical pressure applied on the entire pharyngeal structures during laryngoscopy and intubation, and therefore, the increase in HR during intubation is attributed to sympathetic stimulation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Respiratory parameters such as SpO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>, PAP, and lung compliance evaluated in the current study showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the respiratory parameters in both groups at all the evaluation time points (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Similar results were seen in a study conducted by Saraswat <italic>et al</italic>., in which the mean change in hemodynamic and respiratory parameters with use of PLMA and ET in the patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia was evaluated.
