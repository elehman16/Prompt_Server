The US Preventive Services Task Force has recommended alcohol screening and intervention in general medical settings since 2004. Yet less than one in six US adults report health care professionals discussing alcohol with them. Little is known about methods for increasing implementation; different staffing models may be related to implementation effectiveness. This implementation trial compared delivery of alcohol screening, brief intervention and referral to specialty treatment (SBIRT) by physicians versus non-physician providers receiving training, technical assistance, and feedback reports.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a cluster randomized implementation trial (ADVISe [Alcohol Drinking as a Vital Sign]). Within a private, integrated health care system, 54 adult primary care clinics were stratified by medical center and randomly assigned in blocked groups of three to SBIRT by physicians (PCP arm) versus non-physician providers and medical assistants (NPP and MA arm), versus usual care (Control arm). NIH-recommended screening questions were added to the electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate SBIRT. We examined screening and brief intervention and referral rates by arm. We also examined patient-, physician-, and system-level factors affecting screening rates and, among those who screened positive, rates of brief intervention and referral to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Screening rates were highest in the NPP and MA arm (51&#x000a0;%); followed by the PCP arm (9&#x000a0;%) and the Control arm (3.5&#x000a0;%). Screening increased over the 12&#x000a0;months after training in the NPP and MA arm but remained stable in the PCP arm. The PCP arm had higher brief intervention and referral rates (44&#x000a0;%) among patients screening positive than either the NPP and MA arm (3.4&#x000a0;%) or the Control arm (2.7&#x000a0;%). Higher ratio of MAs to physicians was related to higher screening rates in the NPP and MA arm and longer appointment times to screening and intervention rates in the PCP arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings suggest that time frames longer than 12 months may be required for full SBIRT implementation. Screening by MAs with intervention and referral by physicians as needed can be a feasible model for increasing the implementation of this critical and under-utilized preventive health service within currently predominant primary care models.</p><p>Trial registration: Clinical Trials NCT01135654</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alcohol screening</kwd><kwd>Brief intervention for alcohol misuse</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Unhealthy alcohol use</kwd><kwd>Cluster randomized trial</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Unhealthy alcohol use is a major contributor to the global burden of disease and injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and accounts for one in ten deaths of US adults aged 20&#x02013;64 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Screening and brief intervention to address non-dependent unhealthy alcohol use within primary care is effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and recommended in national practice guidelines (including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism&#x02019;s (NIAAA) Clinician&#x02019;s Guide &#x0201c;Helping Patients Who Drink Too Much&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and Canada&#x02019;s College of Family Physicians Guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), but is seldom delivered in health care settings. Fewer than one in six Americans report being asked about or discussing their drinking with a health professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and screening is rarely conducted in US primary care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] outside the Veteran&#x02019;s Affairs Health System (VA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since efforts to implement alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention (for non-dependent unhealthy use, such as binge drinking with no current adverse consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) and Referral to Treatment (for alcohol dependence) (SBIRT) have fallen short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the field has called for more SBIRT implementation research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is particularly timely given important new environmental factors, such as the alcohol screening and brief counseling performance measures developed and approved by American Medical Association&#x02019;s Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement, the Affordable Care Act&#x02019;s provisions for substance use services, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, and Medicare reimbursement codes for SBIRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Studies of SBIRT implementation within primary care settings have found implementation difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and have typically focused on delivery of SBIRT by physicians. A European study of a tailored, multi-faceted improvement program for physician-delivered SBIRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] found little change in screening and intervention behavior at 12&#x000a0;months. Implementation of SBIRT delivery by primary care physicians, including brief advice, has been difficult to achieve even with financial incentives provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Non-physician provision of SBIRT may also be considered as a viable approach. Babor and colleagues found higher implementation rates by non-physicians and similar effectiveness to physician-delivered screening and brief intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, use of non-physician providers to conduct behavioral and disease management interventions is increasingly being considered as an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to physician delivery, and has been found to be acceptable to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There is evidence that primary care teams involving nurses or health educators for behavioral interventions have higher rates of preventive screenings, such as colorectal cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The Alcohol Drinking as a Vital Sign (ADVISe) study is a cluster, randomized trial in 54 adult primary care clinics within 11 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) medical centers. It compares implementation of primary care physician (PCP)-delivered to non-physician provider-delivered SBIRT, and to usual care. In the non-physician provider-delivered arm, medical assistants (MAs) screen and clinical health educators, behavioral medicine specialists or registered nurses deliver brief intervention and referral to treatment (NPP and MA arm). The outcomes examined are screening rates and rates of brief intervention and referral to treatment (BI/RT) among those who screened positive. Cluster randomization of clinics prevented contamination between clinicians, and also was necessary because training and quality improvement is generally conducted at the clinic level. Because there is some variation in practice and leadership across the organization by medical center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and consistent with prior research on physician versus non-physician SBIRT implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we present findings overall and by medical center. Based on prior research showing that non-physicians can increase implementation of preventive and behavioral interventions, and findings that the most common barriers to SBIRT delivery in primary care are limited physician time and competing priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we hypothesized that the NPP &#x00026; MA arm would have higher rates of screening and BI/RT than the PCP arm.</p><p>To inform implementation strategies, we also examine how, within each intervention arm (PCP and NPP and MA), patient, physician, and system-level factors may be associated with SBIRT implementation as the literature suggests that such factors influence implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Prior research suggests that critical factors within these domains include provider training, time constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], lack of treatment referral resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], systems issues such as staff workloads, patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and integration of screening into the electronic health record (EHR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Thus, we examined how implementation outcomes were related to patient factors including demographic characteristics and medical and psychiatric problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], physician factors including training, demographics and specialty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and system factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] including office visit length, the ratio of support staff to physicians, and co-location of specialty alcohol and drug (AOD) services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>Due to the naturalistic design of the current study we did not measure provider attitudes. However, recent research from a large European implementation trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] suggests that providers&#x02019; role security with and commitment to addressing alcohol misuse are cross-sectionally related to reports of addressing alcohol misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Yet, neither role security nor therapeutic commitment were prospectively related to screening or intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>To better understand the system context, we surveyed physician leaders within the study sites to understand alcohol screening practices and policies within the internal setting prior to the training and implementation processes. We hold constant a key factor found to be a salient influence on provider performance of care services&#x02014;an EHR screening tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] made available in all three study arms. EHR use is growing steadily, both domestically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and in many developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and developing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] countries, increasing opportunities to incorporate such tools broadly. The findings on physician versus non-physician implementation and factors related to implementation within each delivery model can inform delivery and implementation of alcohol SBIRT and similar USPSTF-recommended behavioral care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] in primary care settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p>KPNC is a private, integrated health care delivery system covering 15 counties and serving 3.8 million members, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and KP covers 40&#x000a0;% of the insured population in California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] with AOD services provided internally. The membership reflects the population of the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], with more than 40&#x000a0;% of adult members being non-white or Hispanic, nearly 30&#x000a0;% with only a high school or lower level of education, and 44&#x000a0;% with annual incomes less than $65,000. KPNC&#x02019;s and the University of California San Francisco&#x02019;s institutional review boards approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomization, sample and intervention</title><p>The unit of randomization was clinic. Eleven medical centers (of 47 in KPNC) were chosen to represent both urban and suburban locations and various clinic sizes. Fifty-four primary care clinics were in the 11 KPNC medical centers, located in Fairfield, Napa, Redwood City, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Clara, Santa Rosa, South Sacramento, South San Francisco, Vacaville, and Vallejo. The 54 clinics were stratified by medical center and randomly assigned (parallel-group design) in blocked groups of three to SBIRT by physicians (PCP arm) versus non-physician providers and medical assistants (NPP and MA arm) versus usual care (Control arm), with 18 clinics in each of the three arms.</p><p>There were 204 physicians in the PCP clinics, 189 in the NPP and MA clinics, and 163 in the Control arm clinics. We excluded two physicians in the PCP arm who used an earlier version of the screening tool (see methods below for screening tool details). In the year following the date at which each clinic had started the study (ranging from September 22, 2010 to November 24, 2010), a total of 218,667 unique patients had visits to the PCP arm physicians, 223,147 to the NPP and MA arm physicians, and 197,799 to the Control arm physicians (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and because screening and interventions were intended to be part of usual care, we used KPNC&#x02019;s EHR and other administrative data to examine patient and provider data and did not recruit individual providers or patients.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of participating clinics, physicians and patients through phases of the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13722_2015_47_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Screening tools</title><p>The evidence-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] screening tool from the NIAAA Clinician&#x02019;s Guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] was added to the adult primary care EHR with an automated clinical reminder at each adult (ages 18+) patient visit. It included the NIAAA single question screener &#x0201c;How many times in the past year have you had 5 or more drinks in a day&#x0201d; (for men aged 18&#x02013;65, and &#x0201c;4 or more drinks&#x0201d; for women and individuals aged 66 and older) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Providers and MAs were instructed to use a laminated chart (distributed to exam rooms in the intervention arms) during screening to show patients various alcoholic beverage types and their standard drink sizes. Per the NIAAA Guide and prior studies, if a patient&#x02019;s response was positive to the single question (i.e., &#x0003e;0 times exceeding the daily low-risk limit), the patient is considered an unhealthy drinker. Thus, for responses &#x0003e;0 times to this question, the tool prompted additional questions to assess use exceeding the NIAAA weekly low-risk limit (&#x0201c;On average, how many days a week do you have an alcoholic drink?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;On a typical drinking day, how many drinks do you have?&#x0201d;), plus a validated two-question screener for alcohol use disorders (&#x0201c;In the past year, have you sometimes been under the influence of alcohol in situations where you could have caused an accident or gotten hurt?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Have there often been times when you had a lot more to drink than you intended to have?&#x0201d;; an affirmative response to either is considered a positive screening result) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

Further, providers were trained in brief motivational intervention, and to: (1) incorporate salient medical conditions if possible (e.g., &#x0201c;drinking above these limits can worsen your hypertension and insomnia&#x0201d;), and (2) ask patients how ready they were to make the recommended changes, and (3) assist in goal-setting to reduce or stop drinking if the patient was willing.

In Medical Centers 1, 6, 10, and 11, clinical health educators were trained; in Medical Centers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9, behavioral medicine specialists (clinical psychologists or licensed clinical social workers) were trained; and in Medical Centers 7 and 8, registered nurses were trained.

There was no defined screening or intervention policy or standardized workflow for either physicians or non-physicians to address unhealthy alcohol use in the Control arm. In the Control arm webinar information session, the screening tool was described as evidence-based but additional details (such as sensitivity and specificity) were not provided.

The curriculum and duration of training were equivalent across arms; the trainings differed only in instruction about the workflow (with the NPP and MA arm including instruction about the handoff to the non-physician provider). In the NPP and MA arm, physicians were also included in the first hour of the training to learn about the importance and effectiveness of SBIRT and the workflow. The first hour included the NIAAA low-risk drinking limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the USPSTF recommendations, the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use in primary care in KPNC, evidence of the adverse health effects of unhealthy alcohol use, and effectiveness/cost-effectiveness of specialty treatment for alcohol, screening procedures and the screening tool (including sensitivity and specificity for identifying unhealthy alcohol use and a demonstration of the EHR screening tool); and an overview of the basics of the BI/RT and how to code for interventions/referrals. The second hour covered the BI/RT in more depth, including brief motivational interviewing, video case studies, and role-play practice. It also included a brief presentation by an AOD clinician about how to refer and assessment and treatment services offered at the local AOD clinic.</p><p>Each clinic also received in-person technical assistance 3&#x000a0;months after training. Trainers reviewed the clinics&#x02019; quality feedback reports on screening, intervention, and referral rates; and addressed questions and challenges. At 6&#x000a0;months, clinics received a 30-min &#x0201c;booster&#x0201d; training. All physicians in the PCP arm were included in the booster training.

In the NPP and MA arm, clinic managers (to whom the MAs report) generally directed the MAs to use the screening tool, and it was generally seen as part of the MAs&#x02019; responsibilities. In each medical center, the physician chiefs of medicine (to whom the physicians report) agreed to having their sites used for the project and generally encouraged (but did not mandate) the use of SBIRT by physicians and non-physician providers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Incentives</title><p>Incentives to conduct SBIRT were limited to clinic recognition in the quality feedback reports (see &#x0201c;quality feedback reports&#x0201d; above) for high performing clinics. There were no financial incentives for any staff or providers to conduct screening, brief intervention, or referral to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data sources and measures</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Primary care leader survey</title><p>We conducted an online survey of the Chiefs of Adult Primary Care in each medical center and the Physician Leader of each clinic, to understand practices and policies related to alcohol screening and intervention prior to the training. The response rate among the 62 physicians was 73&#x000a0;%. Participants were offered a $50 gift card. The survey also asked the allocated office visit length in the clinic which was used to calculate average visit time for each medical center.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>EHR and administrative databases</title><p>The EHR was used to extract patient age, gender, and medical comorbidities. In the year prior to each patient&#x02019;s index screening visit, we identified presence of a psychiatric diagnosis (i.e., psychoses, neurotic, personality and other psychiatric disorders, excluding AOD disorders) and presence of an other chronic disease diagnosis (yes/no) (i.e., Arthritis, Hypertension, Chronic Pain, Diabetes Mellitus, Asthma, Ischemic Heart Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, Stroke/Cerebrovascular Accident, Epilepsy, Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease, End-Stage Renal Disease, HIV, Osteoporosis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (ICD-9 codes available upon request). Physician race/ethnicity, gender, age, and MD specialty (Internal Medicine, Family Medicine or other) as well as the ratio of MAs to PCPs in each clinic were drawn from the administrative databases.</p><p>For each patient in the sample (i.e., who had one or more visits to a study physician in the study year), screening (1 if screened/else 0) was measured as having been asked the single-item screener as recorded in the EHR tool on any visit to the provider within the study year. If occurring in multiple visits within 1&#x000a0;year, the index screening visit was defined as the first visit. BI/RT was measured as having a visit in which an intervention or referral was recorded during or within 45&#x000a0;days of the screening visit for those who screened positive at the screening visit. We allowed a 45-day window because providers were trained to schedule a follow-up visit for the BI/RT within 6&#x000a0;weeks if unable to complete during the screening visit. We examined the EHR tool (containing fields for providers to record interventions and referrals) and also the diagnostic &#x0201c;V-code&#x0201d; for &#x0201c;Counseling, Alcohol Prevention&#x0201d; as indication of brief intervention or referral (as per the training). We also reported the BI and RT rates, separately, for each arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Other data collection</title><p>Co-location of primary care and specialty AOD clinics was measured by examining medical center maps and confirming with local staff. Anonymous questionnaires gathered at booster sessions asked providers and MAs the average amount of time spent on screening and asked providers the average total amount of time spent on BI/RT. To inform quantitative results, provider and staff feedback on the implementation and workflow challenges at the booster sessions was documented as part of data collection, and qualitative interviews with staff and providers at each study clinic were conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Analyses</title><p>Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Stata version 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Physician survey results were examined descriptively. We calculated average monthly and annual screening rates for each medical center by study arm, and examined differences in screening rates between study arms using z statistics for comparisons of proportions. We also examined the number and percent screened for the best month over the 12&#x000a0;months after study start, which is the highest screening rate that each entity attained. Similarly, screening rates of BI/RT performed among those screened positive were calculated for each medical center and overall by study arm, and differences examined using Chi square tests. We also report a population-based BI/RT rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] by arm&#x02014;this figure is the proportion of patients of all those with visits at the primary care clinics who received the intervention (regardless of being screened or not).</p><p>Within each intervention arm, multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to examine associations between patient-, physician- and system-level factors and screening and BI/RT implementation outcomes while accounting for clustering within physician and within clinic correlation of patient outcomes. Patient characteristics included age (18&#x02013;24, 25&#x02013;44, 45&#x02013;59, and 60+), gender, and comorbid psychiatric and chronic conditions. Physician characteristics included age, gender, race/ethnicity, years serving the health plan, and specialty. System characteristics included co-location of primary care and AOD clinics, ratio of MAs to PCPs at the primary care clinic, average allocated office visit length, and number of physicians trained. For each outcome, we first fitted a series of multilevel univariate models to examine each predictor individually. All predictors associated with the outcome at p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.10 for either intervention arm were successively included in the multilevel models, with categories in the same direction being collapsed for some predictors to avoid extreme Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95&#x000a0;% Confidence Intervals (CIs) due to empty or small cells (for example, PCP race/ethnicity categories were collapsed to Non-White and White). Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Models (GLLAMM) were used for multilevel analyses. We examined physician characteristics as predictors only in the PCP arm because SBIRT delivery in the NPP &#x00026; MA arm was contingent on an entire team rather than an individual. No adjustments were made for multiple comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Screening practices prior to study implementation</title><p>In the survey of primary care leaders (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;45) prior to the training, 88&#x000a0;% reported no policies or requirements to ask patients about alcohol. Those with policies indicated no consistent evidence-based screening methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Screening rates and proportion screened positive</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the average number of unique visits, screens per month, average percent of patients screened and the number and percent screened for the best month over the 12&#x000a0;months after study start in each medical center and overall. For average percent screened, the NPP and MA arm (50.9&#x000a0;%) was higher (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) than both the PCP arm (9.2&#x000a0;%) and the Control arm (3.5&#x000a0;%); and the PCP arm higher (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) than Control. Exceptions were three medical centers (1, 3, and 11) in which rates were higher in the Control than the PCP arm. A similar pattern was found for the best screening rate. The NPP and MA arm had higher rates (60.1&#x000a0;%) than either the PCP (10.7&#x000a0;%) or Control arm (6.0&#x000a0;%), and the PCP arm had higher rates than the Control arm (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), with higher rates in the Control than PCP arm for Medical Centers 1, 3, and 11. Some movement of MAs from the NPP and MA arm to other arms occurred in these medical centers; in some sites MAs covered duties for absent MAs in other clinics.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Screening rates by treatment arms in first year</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" colspan="3">Average unique visits per month</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Average screens per month</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Average % screened</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">p value</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Best month N screened</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Best month % screened</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">p value&#x000a0;</th></tr><tr><th align="left">PCP</th><th align="left">NPP &#x00026; MA</th><th align="left">Control</th><th align="left">PCP</th><th align="left">NPP &#x00026; MA</th><th align="left">Control</th><th align="left">PCP</th><th align="left">NPP &#x00026; MA</th><th align="left">Control</th><th align="left">PCP</th><th align="left">NPP &#x00026;MA</th><th align="left">Control</th><th align="left">PCP</th><th align="left">NPP &#x00026; MA</th><th align="left">Control</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="18">Medical center</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;1</td><td align="left">1464</td><td align="left">2797</td><td align="left">2928</td><td align="left">41</td><td align="left">1107</td><td align="left">148</td><td char="." align="char">2.80</td><td char="." align="char">39.56</td><td char="." align="char">5.07</td><td align="left">

For the few physician leaders who reported any policies, the recommended practice was to use questions embedded in the EHR system for which there is no evidence, and which are not included in guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These findings underline the need for formalized SBIRT implementation programs, incorporating the use of evidence-based instruments, to ensure that patients obtain optimal primary care treatment, including addressing alcohol as a potential complicating factor in many prevalent health conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Implementation by physicians versus non-physicians</title><p>In this cluster randomized controlled trial in adult PC, we compared implementation of alcohol SBIRT in three arms: physician-delivered, non-physician-delivered and Control. Consistent with prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], screening rates were much higher in the NPP and MA arm than PCP arm, and both had higher rates than the Control arm. Generally, this pattern was true across all sites, with some exceptions, particularly one medical center in which MAs (who were trained as part of the NPP and MA arm) &#x0201c;floated&#x0201d; between the NPP and MA and Control arm clinics, resulting in similar screening rates. Two of the medical centers had slightly higher rates in the Control than PCP arm due to some MAs &#x0201c;floating&#x0201d; into the Control arm.</p><p>MAs are well-placed to provide alcohol screening and it is consistent with their role to collect and record vital signs in the EHR, including weight, height, blood pressure and (in KPNC) smoking screening and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The NPP and MA arm&#x02019;s steadily improving screening rates from 38&#x000a0;% in month 1 to 60&#x000a0;% in month 12 suggests that barriers to screening that MAs may encounter are temporary and may be addressed through managers&#x02019; use of ongoing monitoring and performance feedback reports and practice. Improvements may also have been affected by booster sessions and technical assistance visits, which minimized discomfort with screening through reframing and normalizing it as a routine part of health care. Normalizing was accomplished by acknowledging that drinking is common in our culture and not problematic if within low-risk limits, and by comparing alcohol&#x000a0;screening to asking about smoking and exercise&#x02014;both are&#x000a0;routinely addressed in KPNC&#x02019;s primary care clinics.</p><p>Different approaches to screening may also be more efficient and increase rates in the NPP and MA delivery model. The two NPP and MA clinics with the highest rates attributed success to the use of paper forms provided to patients by the receptionist and collected by MAs, who simply recorded responses in the EHR screening form; an approach they already used for other screening activities. This &#x0201c;paper and pencil&#x0201d; screening may increase workflow efficiency and increase quality and reliability of screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. It may be that PCPs were less likely to consistently record screening when it was performed because of their many competing priorities, whereas MAs were more likely to record screening in the EHR tool because they were more closely supervised and monitored.</p><p>The BI/RT results were counter to prior research which found good implementation rates among non-physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The PCP arm rates were 44.4&#x000a0;% versus the NPP and MA arm&#x02019;s 3.4&#x000a0;%. This was the pattern in most medical centers, with one exception where two physicians provided interventions themselves. When examining a population-based intervention rate (i.e., the proportion of all patients seen who received BI/RT), the PCP arm still had an advantage (0.63 versus 0.24&#x000a0;%).</p><p>The lower BI/RT rate in the NPP and MA arm was counter to our hypothesis that non-physician providers would have higher BI/RT rates. Several factors may have contributed to low BI/RT rates in the NPP and MA arm. First, because this was a naturalistic implementation study, we trained non-physician providers working in the health system rather than using research or externally or grant-funded clinicians, who may have different characteristics and motivations (because of being paid by a research study and invested in the success of the intervention) rather than having an existing operational role with competing duties. Non-physician providers were not always available immediately and thus the workflow often required an additional appointment either by phone or in person, or required phoning the provider when possible via a &#x0201c;consult phone&#x0201d;, which meant a delay. Second, exam room availability was often an issue, which translated into concerns about backlogs if interventions were provided there. Third, providers reported that patients were resistant to seeing the non-physician providers, regardless of whether they were told that the discussion would be about their alcohol screening results or whether a more vague script about &#x0201c;healthy lifestyle&#x0201d; was used.</p><p>Overall, the findings from the current study suggest an efficient, but less complex workflow of MA screening followed by BI/RT by physicians, consistent with how other preventive services are delivered in this health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. It also parallels recent findings that alcohol screening by staff and follow-up by clinicians is associated with more frequent use of screening and intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. These findings are also consistent with aspects of the Consolidated Framework on Implementation Research (CFIR) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The CFIR suggests that evidence-based interventions with greater complexity (such as the NPP and MA delivery model examined here) are less likely to be implemented. Also consistent with the CFIR framework, the lack of resources in the form of sufficient available time of non-physician providers and exam rooms were barriers to implementation of interventions and referrals in the NPP and MA arm. Further, the CFIR suggests that high compatibility of new evidence-based interventions with existing roles and duties can increase implementation as is the case for adding alcohol screening for MAs who already ask about other health behaviors (smoking and exercise).</p><p>One potential disadvantage with the physician-delivered intervention is that physicians reported shorter interventions (5&#x000a0;min average) versus non-physicians (23&#x000a0;min average). Yet longer interventions may not significantly increase effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Physicians reported that the single item screening question required less than 1&#x000a0;min. We did not gather more specific information on how long providers spent on brief interventions versus referrals to specialty treatment.</p><p>These results may raise questions about the ability of currently predominant primary care models to use non-physician clinical team members to perform SBIRT and other new evidence-based practices. Team-based care has potential for addressing behavioral health problems including unhealthy alcohol and tobacco use and depression and for improving health conditions affected by these problems such as hypertension and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Yet, a recent study documented staffing models in primary care practices which participated in a nationwide US team-based care initiative and found that even among those designated as patient-centered medical homes, fewer than 23&#x000a0;% employed health educators, pharmacists, social workers, nutritionists or community service coordinators and fewer than half employed care coordinators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Ideally, medical home models and integrated care systems would include adequate levels of behavioral health care staff, on-call and readily available to deliver behavioral health interventions such as multiple-session brief interventions for unhealthy alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Further, sufficient exam room space is needed to prevent backlogs, and the purpose of exam rooms may need to be expanded so that care coordination and behavioral services can be provided. Alternatively, primary care office design may need to be reconsidered so that sufficient non-physician provider consult room spaces are interspersed next to exam rooms.</p><p>In addition to increased team staffing, performance measures linked to incentives could aid implementation. The CFIR model and the experience at the US VA Health System, where alcohol SBIRT is mandated by an internal performance measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], suggest that policies such as performance measures may increase implementation. Yet to date there are no external performance measures applicable to private, capitated systems or to US Federally Qualified Health Centers. Recently released findings that fewer than one in six Americans reported being asked about or discussing their alcohol consumption with a health professional are striking, given that the USPSTF has recommended it in general medical settings since 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the system studied here, MA screening and physician intervention were found to be a feasible solution for implementation of SBIRT. Without structural changes in primary care practices that would improve their ability to provide consistent team-based care, MA to physician workflow may be one viable approach, and may also be considered for other underutilized USPSTF recommended services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] such as depression screening. Full implementation of SBIRT likely also requires a time frame of more than 1&#x000a0;year for both individual providers and organizations to progress through stages of readiness for change in order to achieve optimal results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Predictors of implementation within each model</title><p>In both PCP and NPP and MA arms, younger patients were less likely to be screened; this was counter-intuitive given their higher prevalence of unhealthy drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and also counter to prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Similarly, in general, younger patients were not more likely to receive BI/RT, though in the NPP &#x00026; MA arm, patients aged 45&#x02013;59 who screened positive were more likely to receive BI/RT than those aged 60 or older. Physicians may assume that unhealthy drinking is &#x0201c;to be expected&#x0201d; in younger patients, and thus not be as concerned about identifying it. Also, the training emphasized the link between alcohol and chronic conditions, which may have made it easier for physicians to screen and discuss drinking among older patients at risk for such conditions.</p><p>Consistent with results suggesting that men are more likely to binge drink, male patients were more likely to be screened and receive BI/RT in both arms. This is consistent with prior research indicating that men are more likely to be screened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and raises concerns given that women are less likely to seek alcohol intervention and treatment and may be more vulnerable to adverse health effects of unhealthy use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. That more individuals with psychiatric and chronic disease diagnoses were screened than those without (in both arms) is also consistent with prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] and with the emphasis in the provider training on the relationship of unhealthy alcohol use to adverse health effects and reduced medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. However, psychiatric and chronic conditions only predicted receiving BI/RT in the NPP and MA arm. Such patients are generally more likely to see non-physician providers for chronic conditions, e.g., for behavioral interventions related to diabetes, so the intervention may have been paired with conversations about their chronic condition.</p><p>As found in prior research, female physicians were more likely than male to screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], though there was no difference by physician gender in providing BI/RT. Physicians from non-White and Latino ethnic/racial groups were more likely to screen, although White physicians were more likely to record providing BI/RT. Few studies have examined these characteristics as predictors of SBIRT; the large sample size and racial/ethnic diversity of the provider sample allowed us to examine this. More research is needed to understand these differences in screening and BI/RT rates between gender and racial/ethnic groups. For example, some national studies have found higher rates of alcohol abuse in whites than some other ethnic groups and in men than women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Perhaps these differences in screening may reflect that physicians with healthier habits themselves (which was unmeasured in this study) are more likely to provide counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Alternatively, the findings may reflect gender and ethnic differences in communication styles in which case additional or different approaches to training may particularly be needed for these subgroups.</p><p>Consistent with a greater focus on preventive care, a specialty of Family Medicine or training other than Internal Medicine was related to screening, but this characteristic did not affect BI/RT rates. Physicians newer to the system were less likely to both screen and intervene. Perhaps longer experience in the system may help physicians to practice more efficiently, leaving time for preventive screening and intervention.</p><p>Consistent with studies suggesting lack of screening is due to time constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], longer visits were related to higher odds of screening in both arms and intervention in the PCP arm. Provision of BI/RT was not related to appointment time in the NPP and MA arm likely because the intervention usually required a separate visit. However, having a higher ratio of MAs per physician increased the likelihood of screening in the NPP and MA arm. Having more MAs did not seem to off-load the work of physicians enough in the PCP arm to result in higher rates of screening or intervention as we had expected, and in fact was related to a lower odds of screening and BI/RT. This may be because a higher MA ratio is a reflection of a busier clinic.</p><p>Some findings on system-level predictors were counter-intuitive. Having more physicians trained in SBIRT in a medical center was related to lower odds of screening. The findings that co-location between primary care and specialty AOD treatment clinics was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving screening or intervention are also counter to the ideas that proximity of specialty treatment would increase awareness and that easier patient access to specialty treatment would increase physician confidence in discussing alcohol with patients. More research is needed to understand how co-location affects primary care clinician behavior, and whether there is a confounding factor related to both variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p>Conducting this study in real-world busy clinics, and using existing staff are important characteristics of an implementation study, and at the same time enhance both limitations and strengths. We could not control the schedules or priorities of clinic managers or providers or the movement of staff across clinics. However, using existing staff is important for understanding whether a model is feasible and sustainable regardless of externally funded interventionists.</p><p>Provider factors not examined include outcome expectancies, concerns about intrusiveness, beliefs that SBIRT is ineffective, negative attitudes about patients with alcohol problems, and self-efficacy; these have been previously well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].</p><p>Similar to studies for other health conditions, use of EHR data means that our data on screening and BI/RT are limited to that documented in the EHR. Yet this approach allowed for studying the natural process of care, studying a large number of patients, and having a population-based sample of patients and providers, rather than limiting our sample to those willing to be recruited into a study.</p><p>This study is the first to examine implementation of the NIAAA Guide for SBIRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in adult primary care in a private, non-profit US health care system. It also uses an established EHR, a mechanism recommended by the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and known to be salient in predicting better implementation of primary care practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. EHR use is also more generalizable to the future of private US health care settings because of Phase III Meaningful Use requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].</p><p>Because of the large sample size, some statistically significant differences may not be clinically meaningful. Variations in the pattern of results across medical centers highlight the importance of including multiple medical centers or clinics when studying factors that influence implementation.</p><p>A further limitation is that data on alcohol use disorder screening were not recorded for a considerable proportion of those who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use. We thus were unable to examine the proportion of those screening positive on the alcohol use disorders screen who received RT.</p><p>Finally, it is not known how the study&#x02019;s findings would generalize to systems with fewer exam room constraints or systems in which clinical health educators are dedicated to SBIRT (which would allow for same-time, warm hand-offs to exam room consultations). Moreover, currently predominant primary care models do not include health educators or behavioral specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings from this randomized trial of physician versus non-physician alcohol SBIRT implementation suggest that a model of MA screening and physician intervention may have the highest odds of implementation in currently predominant primary care models. Further, in large organizations such as this one, where policies and practices for systematic screening were not in place prior to training, implementation may take a longer time period than 1&#x000a0;year after an initial training and a higher &#x0201c;dosage&#x0201d; of quality improvement and feedback; longer time frames may be required for provider change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and full implementation, as has been found in the VA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Many facilitators of implementation, such as organizational and provider stages of readiness for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] may increase over time after a new initiative begins. Informed by this study, a model using MA screening and physician intervention was adopted by Kaiser Permanente Northern California across all adult primary care clinics in June of 2013 for annual, evidence-based alcohol screening and intervention or referral to specialty treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Future research is needed across systems that have implemented SBIRT to examine duration of time since initial implementation and duration and amount of related quality improvement activities as factors predicting SBIRT implementation outcomes. Research is also needed on whether implementation of BI and RT by non-physicians is more effectively implemented within fully realized and staffed medical home models.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AOD</term><def><p>alcohol and other drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BI</term><def><p>brief intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EHR</term><def><p>electronic health record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MA</term><def><p>medical assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIAAA</term><def><p>US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPP</term><def><p>non-physician provider</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCP</term><def><p>primary care physician</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>referral to treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBIRT</term><def><p>screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USPSTF</term><def><p>United States Preventive Services Task Force</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JM, FC, CW and SS obtained funding and devised the concept for the clinical trial design, and analysis.
