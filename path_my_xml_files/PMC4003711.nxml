Few degrees of angular deformity and few centimetres of shortening are acceptable in children according to their age group, because children have tremendous re-modelling potential. A variety of methods are used for the treatment of paediatric diaphyseal femur fractures, including immediate spica casting, traction followed by spica casting, external fixators, osteosynthesis with plate and internal fixation with intramedullary rod or flexible intramedullary nail. Choice of treatments depends upon the age of children, anatomical site, fracture pattern and preference of the surgeon. Traditionally, children below 6 years of age are treated with immediate hip spica and adolescent children are treated with operative methods.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>External fixators are associated with increased chances of pin tract infection and re-fracture. Plate osteosynthesis need extensive soft tissue strapping and re-surgery for removal. Intramedullary rods increase the chances of avascular necrosis of femoral head and damage to the physis. Flexible intramedullary nailing has become an increasingly popular method of paediatric femoral fracture fixation.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Systemic reviews and various cohort studies have shown excellent clinical results with flexible intramedullary nails (Rush pins) for children, and few studies has extended its indication to preschool-going children. However, no randomized controlled trial has been reported comparing flexible intramedullary Rush nailing with other mode of management of paediatric diaphyseal femur fracture.</p><p>We present a randomized controlled trial comparing flexile intramedullary Rush pins with immediate spica casting for paediatric diaphyseal femur fracture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 50 children belonging to the age group 3 to 13 years presenting to Teaching Hospital of National Medical College (November 2010 to December 2012) with diaphyseal femur fracture were randomly allocated into group A (immediate hip spica casting) and group B (flexible intramedullary Rush pins) using random number generation technique.</p><p>In group A, the fracture was reduced on the same day or the next day of presentation to the hospital with fluoroscopy control under general anaesthesia and one and half spica casting was applied [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Criteria of acceptable reduction were based upon Kasser <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Children were admitted to the hospital until parents learned how to take care of spica. Follow-up was performed at the 2<sup>nd</sup> week for evaluation of reduction and spica-related complications. Radiological evaluation of bridging callus was performed at the 6<sup>th</sup> week for evaluation of radiological union. If bridging callus was seen at three cortices, the child was asked to bear weight with or without support, according to pain tolerance. If callus was not evident, long leg cast was applied for 4 more weeks.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Children with femoral shaft fractures: Before hip spica X-ray, (a) in spica cast, (b) after the cast, (c) broken spica on 6-week follow-up, (d) X-ray on 6-week follow-up (e) and final X-ray at 4-month follow-up (f)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-55-111-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Acceptable Angulation and Shortening in Children with a Femoral Fracture*</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-55-111-g002"/></table-wrap><p>In group B, under general anaesthesia, two small skin incisions were made on either side of distal metaphysis and two holes are made obliquely facing towards medullary cavity with the help of 4-mm awl, an inch proximal to the growth plate. Two pre-contoured C-shaped Rush pins were passed retrogradely with fluoroscopy control until both the tips reached just distal to the fracture site. Fracture was reduced with manual traction and rush pins are pushed into medullary cavity of proximal fragment under fluoroscopy control [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Tips of the pins were targeted up to the level of the neck and base of the greater trochanter. Care was taken to ensure that the bent distal part of Rush pin lied on the cortical surface of the supracondylar of femur without soft tissue impingement. Size of the Rush pins were measured as 40% of narrowest diameter of femur on AP and lateral view. In initial few cases, we applied posterior long leg plaster of Paris back slab, which we later discontinued and used only knee immobilizer post-operatively until the sutures were removed after 2 weeks. As soon as pain was tolerable, the hip and knee were mobilized and non-weight bearing ambulation was allowed. Weight bearing was permitted once bridging callus was evident on X-ray on three cortices. Follow-up was done at 6<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> week, 6<sup>th</sup> months, 1 year and 2 years for radiological and clinical evaluation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Rush pins were routinely removed after 1 year of surgery. The treatment cost was calculated as the total amount paid to the hospital that covered admission, investigation, operation and hospital stay charges because many indirect costs are associated with total management, which could not be generalized.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Fixation of flexible intramedullary Rush pins procedure in a child with femoral shaft fracture (a) and radiographs taken before operation, (b) immediately after operation (c) and at 14-month follow-up (d)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-55-111-g003"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Radiological and clinical evaluation of the outcome of Rush pin fixation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-55-111-g004"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Success of randomization was tested between two groups.

Male to female ratio was 2.5:1 and 4:1 in group A and B, respectively. Fracture pattern was classified according to AO classification, which showed type 32A1 as the most common pattern of injury. Spiral or long oblique fractures or fracture with comminuation more than two-third of the diameter of the bone were considered unstable. Fall related injury either from hill slope, tree, cliff or wall was commonest mode of injury, which comprised of 88% of injury in both group A and B. Anatomically, femoral diaphysis was the most common site of femur fracture in this study.</p><p>The mean follow-up period was 16.1 months (range: 6-26 months) in group A and 17 months (range: 6-28 months) in group B. One patient in group A could not be followed up at all after discharging from the hospital and hence excluded from the analysis.</p><p>A total of 16 children in group B who could be trained for ambulation with walking aids started walking much earlier than 14 children in group A with significant mean difference (13.38 &#x000b1; 2.3 days in group B vs. 52.33 &#x000b1; 4.5 days in group A, <italic>P</italic> = 0.000). Similarly, children in group B started walking without aid with a mean duration of 6.6 &#x000b1; 1.29 weeks as compared to 10.67 &#x000b1; 4.32 weeks in group A (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002).

Increased hospital cost in group B can be attributed to longer hospital stay that ranges from 3 to 14 days, as many patients in our teaching hospital come from far and remote distance from where it is not only expensive but also difficult for coming to hospital for the removal of sutures. Therefore, they preferred longer hospital stay until the sutures were removed.</p><p>Final outcome at the end of follow-up was evaluated according to Flynn's grading.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

Immediate spica casting or skeletal traction and application of a cast is common method for the treatment of diaphyseal femoral fractures in children and young adolescents and surgical intervention is indicated in open fractures, multi-trauma, concomitant head injuries, burns and neuromuscular wounding. However, psychosocial and economic effects of spica cast immobilization on children and their families have been reported by Hughes <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and many studies advocate early fixation of femur fracture because complications inherent in conservative treatment, such as malunion and shortening, cast intolerance, financial factors and increased hospitalization can be decreased by surgery. Among other operative methods, flexible intramedulary nail has been used increasingly due to its simplicity and characteristics of load-sharing internal splint that maintains the length and alignment of the limb until bridging callus is formed and spares the risk of damaging the physis or the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis with a proper surgical technique.</p><p>Torsional stability depends upon divergence of the rods in the proximal metaphysis and resistance to sagittal and cornal bending results from spreading of the prebent rods through the diaphysis, size of the rod and material properties of the rod. Micro-motion confirmed by elasticity of fixation promotes early callus formation. There are no clinical study comparing efficacy of titanium elastic nail with stainless steel nail like Enders nail and Rush pins. The Young modulus of stainless steel is nearly double the size of titanium (approximately 200 GPa versus approximately 110 GPa), making it a much stiffer material with less elastic properties. Lee <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> demonstrated that Ender nail fixation of simulated femur fractures maintained fracture length and rotational control with weight bearing of up to 40% of body weight, even in the presence of comminution, whereas Mahar <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reported that the titanium implants provided greater stability in resisting torsional loading and axial compression in both transverse and comminuted fractures in biomechanical comparative study with stainless steel nails. Besides elastic property, retrogradely passed adequate size crossed Rush pins offer all the advantages of closed reduction technique and internal fixation with flexible intramedullary nails. Excellent clinical results using stainless steel flexible nails have been reported for both stable and unstable femur fracture in children. Rathjen <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> assumed that the stiffer properties of a stainless steel implant should confer greater fracture stability, especially in the setting of an unstable fracture pattern.</p><p>Cramer <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reported 10 prospectively evaluated 57 femoral shaft fractures in children treated with Ender rods, 21 of which were either spiral fractures or comminuted. Although the results were not stratified according to fracture stability, the authors noted no clinically significant leg length discrepancy or malunion. Four patients did demonstrate radiographic angular deformities of &#x0003c;15&#x000b0;deviation at final follow-up. Another advantage of stainless steel nail is ready availability and lesser cost.</p><p>Simanovsky <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> defined that the flexible intramedullary nails can be an attractive and safe treatment options in children aged 3-5 years for femoral shaft fracture and should be brought up and discussed with parents.</p><p>This study had a prospective design and used a convenience sample, which were its limitations. The different characteristics of the two groups of patients were also a limitation. Nonetheless, this study points towards the important that femoral shaft fractures in children can be better treated with surgery.
