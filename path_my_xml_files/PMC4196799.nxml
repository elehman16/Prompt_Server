Nr S-04115, June 8th, 2004, Prof. Nitter-Hauge). Forty-five patients scheduled for day surgery of the hand or forearm were recruited and gave written informed consent to participate in the study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Inclusion criteria were ASA physical status 1 to 2, age 18 to 75 years and weight 50 to 95&#x0200a;kg. Exclusion criteria were neurological disease, prior adverse reaction to local anaesthetic or contraindication to MRI examination. The patients were randomised into three groups each of 15 patients, using random digits (The Rand Corporation, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.rand.org">www.rand.org</ext-link>). Group allocation was sealed in envelopes that were opened just before the axillary block. The three groups were defined by the number of axillary local anaesthetic injections, namely single, double and triple-deposit groups.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ejanet-31-611-g001"/></fig><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Block procedures</title><p>Premedication consisted of midazolam 3.5&#x0200a;mg and paracetamol 1 to 1.5&#x0200a;g per os.

A total of 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g fentanyl intravenously (i.v.) was given before the skin infiltration with 1&#x0200a;ml lidocaine 10&#x0200a;mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>In all patients, the position of the median nerve was primarily identified by percutaneous nerve mapping (Stimuplex Pen; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and marked with a skin pen. A short catheter with an internal cannula (Contiplex; 18-gauge, 1.3&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;45&#x0200a;mm, B. Braun) was inserted 1 to 2&#x0200a;cm distal to the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle. It was advanced parallel to the median nerve and anterior (superior) to the brachial-axillary artery by nerve stimulation guidance (Stimuplex DIG/HNS11; B.

The local anaesthetic dose for every patient in all groups was 40&#x0200a;ml of a 50&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;50 mixture of lidocaine 20&#x0200a;mg&#x0200a;ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and bupivacaine 5&#x0200a;mg&#x0200a;ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with 5.0&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g&#x0200a;ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> adrenaline, giving a total dose of 400&#x0200a;mg lidocaine, 100&#x0200a;mg bupivacaine and 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g adrenaline. It was injected at approximately at 0.5&#x0200a;ml&#x0200a;s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.</p><p>In the single-deposit group, the total volume of local anaesthetic was given through the catheter. In the double-deposit group, a divided transarterial block<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> was performed with the injection of 30&#x0200a;ml lateral (deep) to, and 10&#x0200a;ml medial (superficial) to the artery, using a standard hypodermic needle (25G, 0.50&#x0200a;x&#x0200a;25&#x0200a;mm, Sterican; B. Braun). It was inserted approximately 1&#x0200a;cm posterior (inferior) to the catheter insertion site. In the triple-deposit group, the block techniques of the single-deposit and double-deposit groups were combined. Here, 20&#x0200a;ml was initially injected deep to, and 10&#x0200a;ml superficial to the artery, followed by 10&#x0200a;ml through the catheter. Pressure was not applied to the neurovascular bundle distal to the injection sites.</p><p>Prior to magnetic resonance (MR)-scanning, injections through the short catheter were only given to patients in the single-deposit and triple-deposit groups. However, the catheter could be utilised for prolongation of per- and postoperative analgesia in any group. In addition, the catheter ensured that the block assessor was blinded to the block that had been performed.</p><p>Regarding adverse events, we recorded paraesthesia and heart rate/blood pressure changes of more than 20% from baseline. Patients with paraesthesia were contacted at home for a follow-up interview.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI</title><p>MRI scanning (Achieva 3T, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) was performed immediately after completion of the block procedures, using the protocol of a pilot study.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Two radiologists, blinded for the block method and its clinical effect, independently evaluated the T2-weighted, fat suppressed MRI images. If their assessments differed, consensus was obtained by joint evaluation of the images. The neurovascular bundle and local anaesthetic deposits were examined in short axis view (cross-sectional, Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and the long axis (coronal, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In coronal images, the proximal and distal local anaesthetic distributions were measured using maximal intensity projections with reference to an imaginary line, perpendicular from the most cranial point of the humeral head to the neurovascular bundle. In addition, as a measure of free/inhibited local anaesthetic distribution, the number of separate fluid compartments was counted.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Single-deposit group, catheter injection; double-deposit group, transarterial injections; triple-deposit group, transarterial and catheter injections.

Finally, a circle with a radius of 10&#x0200a;mm was drawn around the centre of the midaxis of the axillary-brachial artery.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> One of the radiologists recorded whether the five main terminal nerves were inside or outside of the described circle, evaluating all cross-sectional levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Block testing</title><p>The closed-bore MRI scanner did not allow clinical block assessment during imaging. As soon as the patients were accessible after scanning, a sensory-motor status was obtained. The assessors were anaesthetists who were blinded to the block method and MR images.</p><p>Sensory testing also included, in addition to the five main terminal nerves, the medial antebrachial cutaneous, medial brachial cutaneous and intercostobrachial nerve. We used a cold test, repeatedly touching the skin with ice cubes at predefined points in the sensory areas of the nerves applying the following scale: 0, normal; 1, hypoalgesia, patient felt coldness but less than on the contralateral side; 2, analgesia, patient felt touch but not coldness; and 3, anaesthesia, no feeling at all.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Muscle power was recorded for the five main terminal nerves using the following scale: 0, normal; 1, slightly reduced power; 2, moderately reduced power; and 3, strongly reduced power (paralysis).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> A block was defined as successful when all five nerves distal to the elbow (musculocutaneous, radial, median, ulnar and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve) had sensory test scores of 2 or 3.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Similarly, a cutaneous nerve territory was defined as successfully blocked when its sensory score was 2 or 3.</p><p>If a territory distal to the elbow had a sensory score of 0 or 1, the patient received a supplementary peripheral nerve block at the elbow, by nerve stimulation guidance or infiltration technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation between MRI score and sensory score</title><p>An innervation area may become anaesthetised because local anaesthetic has reached the terminal nerve, the cord from where the terminal nerve originates or has an effect at both nerve levels. To correlate MRI and sensory scores, a summarised MRI score was derived by adding the MRI score at terminal nerve level to the MRI score of the related cord. These scores were weighted equally with a maximal score of 2 at each nerve level, giving a maximal summarised score of 4. There was, however, an exception when scoring for the median nerve territory. As the median nerve has a root from both the lateral and medial cord, the maximal score for each of these cords was 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Due to limited access to the MRI facility, we based the study on only 15 patients in each of the three groups. With an experienced block difference of almost 30% between single and triple injection<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and a 5% significance level for one-sided tests, a statistical power of 74% was calculated. Data were described by mean, standard deviation and counts. The groups were compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Pearson Chi-square test for continuous or categorical variables as appropriate. Correlating MRI scores with the sensory scores from correspondingly innervated areas, we used cross tabulation and the gamma test, considering all patients as one group. Gamma values may be characterised as follows: 0, no; &#x000b1;0.01 to 0.09, weak; &#x000b1;0.1 to 0.29, moderate; &#x000b1;0.3 to 0.99, strong; &#x000b1;1, perfect, strongest possible association/correlation (SPSS etutor by Dee Britton. Available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://commons.esc.edu/spss/">http://commons.esc.edu/spss/</ext-link>). The assessments of the two radiologists in scoring the local anaesthetic distribution were compared by cross tabulation and the Kappa test. Kappa values may be characterised as follows: less than 0.40, poor; 0.4 to 0.75, fair/good; more than 0.75, excellent.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><italic>P</italic> values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Sensory-motor testing was performed at a mean of 54.5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;8.4&#x0200a;min after completion of the local anaesthetic injection (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), delayed because of prior MR-scanning.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical effects</title><p>The number of patients with successful blocks (having analgesia or anaesthesia for all five nerves distal to the elbow) was 10 in the single-deposit, 10 in the double-deposit and all 15 patients in the triple-deposit group. This difference (33%) between groups was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04, Fisher's exact test). When considering the terminal nerves separately (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), there was no sensory block difference between the groups. The ulnar nerve was the only terminal nerve with a successful sensory block in all patients of all groups.</p><p>To obtain anaesthesia or analgesia for all nerve territories distal to the elbow, five supplementary peripheral nerve blocks (among five patients) were made in the single-deposit group and 11 supplementary blocks (among five patients) in the double-deposit group. For these blocks, we used the same local anaesthetic mixture as described above, using an average of 8.1&#x0200a;ml for each nerve. All surgeries took place distal to the elbow and all the blocks were adequate for surgery (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><sec><title>MRI findings</title><p>The local anaesthetic fluid was always clearly visualised in the T2-weighted images, both in cross-sectional and coronal images (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cross-sectional images</title><p>Among the 135 cords and 225 terminal nerves of the 45 patients, all the cords and 218 (97%) of the terminal nerves were recognised (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This required consensus assessment for only four cords and three terminal nerves. All but two of the terminal nerves (99%) were located inside the described 20&#x0200a;mm diameter periarterial circle. There was a trend for the axillary-brachial artery to be more centrally located within the local anaesthetic area in the triple-deposit group than in the two other groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). According to the consensus between the radiologists, 204 (93%) of the terminal nerves were surrounded by local anaesthetic (MRI-score 2, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). This occurred for all of the superficially located median and ulnar nerves. Only partly contacted by local anaesthetic were 12 terminal nerves (5.5%), although four nerves were not reached by local anaesthetic. For three axillary and two musculocutaneous nerves, no MRI-score was recorded (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). A significant difference between the groups was found for the radial nerve (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). It was completely surrounded by local anaesthetic in all patients in the double-deposit and triple-deposit groups, although this occurred only in 11 patients in the single-deposit group.</p><p>Of the 135 cords, 90 (67%) were surrounded by local anaesthetic, 35 (26%) were partly contacted by local anaesthetic and the remaining 10 cords (7%) were not reached by local anaesthetic (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The lateral and posterior cords in the single-deposit and triple-deposit group were more often surrounded by local anaesthetic than in the double-deposit group.</p></sec><sec><title>Coronal images</title><p>Referring to the most proximal point of the humeral head, the proximal distribution in the single, double and triple-deposit groups measured (mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;SD) 4.5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.0, 1.8&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.5 and 3.6&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.0&#x0200a;cm, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001).

There were two fluid compartments in all the remaining patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of MRI assessments by the two radiologists</title><p>The MRI scoring of the two radiologists was different for 53 (39%) of the cords and 46 (20%) of the terminal nerves. The poor agreement was also expressed by the kappa values (in parenthesis) for the lateral cord (0.15), posterior cord (0.17), medial cord (0.18), axillary nerve (0.16), the musculocutaneous nerve (0.13) and the radial nerve (0.35). In contrast, the agreement was excellent for the median (1) and ulnar nerve (1).</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation between local anaesthetic distribution (MRI) and sensory block</title><p>For the local anaesthetic distribution pattern at the axillary nerve/posterior cord, radial nerve/posterior cord, musculocutaneous nerve/lateral cord and the median nerve/lateral and medial cords, the correlation to the corresponding sensory block was strong. We found the following gamma values: 0.53 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01); 0.50 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.023); 0.54 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007); and 0.59 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007). The ulnar nerve/medial cord correlation score was poor: &#x02013;0.09, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.83. This paradoxical result is probably due to almost maximal scores in each of the two scoring systems (MRI versus sensory block), giving minimal variation of the values.</p><p>Nevertheless, correlations between MRI and clinical scores were not always straightforward. This was highlighted for the innervation area of the musculocutaneous nerve. Among the eight patients of the single and double-deposit groups with insufficient block in the area of the musculocutaneous nerve, four of them had the maximal MRI score of 2 at both the terminal nerve and the cord level.</p><p>The radial nerve represents another example. In the single-deposit group, it had a significantly lower MRI-score than in the two other groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), but this was not reflected by a poorer sensory block score (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>All patients had local anaesthetic contact either at terminal nerve level or at the corresponding cord or both. We did not have a patient with a clinical block and lacking local anaesthetic contact at both of these nerve levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>Paraesthesia was recorded 10 times in the double-deposit group (seven patients) and twice times in the triple-deposit group (two patients), none of which resulted in neurological sequela. The transarterial needle (25 G cannula) was involved in seven of the nine patients who reported paresthesia. After transarterial injection, two patients in the triple-deposit and one patient in the double-deposit group had mild tachycardia for a few minutes. A third patient in the triple-deposit group had mild tachycardia, a 28% SBP elevation and transient dizziness after injection through the catheter. One patient in both the double and triple-deposit groups had temporary pale skin colour in the hand after transarterial injection. A venous puncture occurred in only one of the 45 patients who had the Contiplex catheter/cannula inserted. Haematomas were not found in any of the groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Block success showed a statistically significant difference between the triple-deposit group and the two other groups. The patients in the triple-deposit group most often had the best MRI scores as well. Considering the cords the distribution was best in the single and triple-deposit groups, which had local anaesthetic injections through the catheter. At terminal nerve level, the spread to the radial nerve was best in the double and triple-deposit groups, which had transarterial injections. Hence, for any nerve or cord at least one of the two other groups had a similarly high MRI score as the triple-deposit group. This might be explained by the fact that the triple-deposit block is a combination of the single and double-deposit method.</p><p>A general correlation between the local anaesthetic proximity to the cords and terminal nerves (as described by MRI scores) and local anaesthetic effect (as described by sensory block scores) could be demonstrated when combining the data sets of all groups.</p><p>Some secondary findings deserve discussion. In this study not only the cords<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> but also the main terminal nerves of the brachial plexus could be identified, which had been indicated in our pilot study.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Although earlier only assumed,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> the present study confirmed these nerves to be located inside a circle of 20&#x0200a;mm surrounding the brachial-axillary artery.</p><p>At the level of the cords, the double-deposit method had a significantly lower MRI score than the two other methods. We assume that this method's injection, perpendicular to the brachial artery, gave a weaker proximal local anaesthetic thrust and spread than the two other methods, by which local anaesthetic was injected through a distal-to-proximal directed catheter. This consideration is strengthened by the significantly longer proximal distribution with the single and triple-deposit than with the double-deposit method.</p><p>Remarkably, in some patients, a nerve was not successfully blocked, although it was surrounded by local anaesthetic. Similar observations have been made in previous computed tomography and MRI studies.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> What may be the particular barrier for local anaesthetic reaching the axons of the nerve? Thompson and Rorie<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> suggested the &#x02018;nonunicompartmental&#x02019; nature of the neurovascular bundle. We have not come closer to the answer, except for the obvious possibility of errors in identification of the nerves or the local anaesthetic's relation to the nerves.</p><p>Among a majority of patients in both the double and triple-deposit groups, MRI demonstrated that the local anaesthetic merged to form a single fluid compartment. This could suggest a free distribution of local anaesthetic. However, in a smaller group, three patients in both the double and triple-deposit groups (six patients), local anaesthetic was identified as two fluid compartments, indicating inhibited local anaesthetic spread. This supports the established recommendation to use multiple injections when performing axillary blocks.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Moreover, we found that the distal distribution was practically constant among all patients in the coronal images. It ended regularly 14 to 15&#x0200a;cm distal from the top of the caput humeri. We assume that the distal end of the local anaesthetic spread corresponds to the distal end of the tunnel containing the neurovascular bundle.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Although the musculocutaneous nerve was not blocked selectively in any of the three groups, it was successfully blocked in all patients of the triple-deposit group. This is interesting with regard to double-deposit ultrasound-guided axillary blocks, for which a separate local anaesthetic injection towards the musculocutaneous nerve has been recommended.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>The long performance time in all study groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) can be explained by the combination of several block methods that included transcutaneous mapping, transarterial injections and particularly the nerve stimulator guided insertion of the catheter. Although not used for local anaesthetic injection, a catheter was also placed in the double-deposit group.</p><p>The five patients in our study who showed local or systemic signs of intravascular injections during transarterial injections underline the importance of using this technique with outmost care.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study. Nonultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus blocks have typically used high doses of local anaesthetic. The mixture, concentration and volume of local anaesthetics in the present study were similar to a series of studies by Sia <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> except for adrenaline that was not contained in their mixture. Our results are valid only for the mixture of local anaesthetics, volume and concentration used in this study. When nerves are detected individually by ultrasound guidance or electrical nerve stimulations, lower local anaesthetic volumes can be used.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>A larger number of patients would probably have characterised the group differences more strongly, for both the sensory-motor block effect and the local anaesthetic distribution patterns. The MR images were obtained at variable intervals before block assessment, with an unknown impact on our results. The discrepancies between the two radiologists in scoring the proximity of local anaesthetic to the nerves were considerable, in spite of their profound experience. Distortion of the anatomy after local anaesthetic injection was mainly responsible for the difficulties in identification of the cords and terminal nerves, as demonstrated in our pilot study.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In addition, when the rim of local anaesthetic close to a nerve was narrow, it was difficult to distinguish between MRI scores 0, 1 and 2. MRI of local anaesthetic in the axillary region is further a less explored field in radiology, which could have influenced the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this combined clinical and MRI study of three axillary block methods, the sensory block effect distal to the elbow was best for the triple-deposit method. This could to some extent be explained by analysis of the MRI distribution patterns. The transarterial technique, however, has an increased risk of paraesthesia and intravascular local anaesthetic injection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements relating to this article</title><p>Assistance with this study: we thank Hugo Pripp, PhD (Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Oslo University Hospital) for statistical support, Axel Sauter, PhD (Department of Anaesthesiology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet) for review of the manuscript and Mike Dodgson, BSc, MB, ChB, FRCA for review of the language.</p><p>Financial support and sponsorship: none.</p><p>Conflict of interest: none.</p><p>Presentation: preliminary data of this study were presented as an abstract at a national meeting for Norwegian anaesthesiologists in Troms&#x000f8; in 2012.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name><name><surname>Rorie</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name></person-group>
