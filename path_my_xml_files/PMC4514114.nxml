Accumulation of monocytes/-macrophages has been noted in the intima of early atherosclerotic lesions, and these inflammatory cells may promote progression of atherosclerosis by producing and releasing various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Among these mediators, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a key chemokine that activates monocytes/macrophages by promoting leucocyteendothelium binding and migration to sites of inflammation [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although a number of cytokines have been found to participate in the inflammatory process of plaque vulnerability, MCP-1 as an upstream chemokine in the atherosclerotic inflammatory pathway has been consistently reported to have high expression in vulnerable plaques, and the intensive infiltration of macrophages in plaques with active inflammation could be, to a large extent, due to the chemotactic effects of MCP-1. Therefore, targeting MCP-1 may be an effective approach to the inhibition of plaque inflammation and stabilization of vulnerable plaques regardless of serum lipid levels.</p><p>Jarnagin <italic>et al.</italic> first demonstrated that dominant-negative mutation of MCP-1 derived by deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 2 to 8 of the human MCP-1 (7ND) resulted in a deficiency in chemotaxis but retained affinity to the CCR-2 receptor [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Subsequent studies confirmed that gene transfer of the MCP-1 mutant significantly inhibited monocyte activation/infiltration and reduced the severity of restenosis in rabbits after arterial balloon injury or stent placement [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, whether dominant-negative mutation of MCP-1 can actually reduce plaque vulnerability and disruption is still unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that the MCP-1 mutant is effective in attenuating plaque inflammation, reversing plaque progression and preventing plaques from rupture regardless of serum lipid levels. We constructed a eukaryotic expression vector of green fluoresence protein (GFP)-fused human MCP-1 mutant (plRES-EGFP-7ND), which was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells to examine the effects on monocyte chemotaxis <italic>in vitro</italic> and then into rabbits with vulnerable plaques to investigate changes in circulating biomarkers and plaque morphology <italic>in vivo.</italic></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid expression vectors</title><p>Recombinant PCR was used to construct human 7ND cDNA, with a wild-type MCP-1 cDNA used as a template and N-terminal amino acids 2 to 8 of the human MCP-1 deleted. By use of gene cloning techniques, the MCP-1 mutant was inserted into the Xho I and Mlu I sites of the pIRES-EGFP expression vector plasmid to form a eukaryotic expression vector of GFP-fused human MCP-1 mutant (plRES-EGFP-7ND) whose gene expression is controlled by the immediate early enhancer/promoter of the cytomegalovirus. Human MCP-1 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Yoshimura (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> transfection</title><p>The vector plRES-EGFP-7ND was transfected into HEK 293 cells by lipofectamine mediation. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the 7ND expression in the transfected cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy and ELISA and the mRNA expression shown by RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotaxis test</title><p>Monocytes were extracted by centrifugation of a blood sample from a normal rabbit, and 0.1 ml monocyte suspension (4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>/ml) was instilled into the transwell chamber to assay monocyte chemotaxis. Monocytes were stimulated by Hankis fluid (Hankis fluid group), cell supernatant fluid after plRES-EGFP-7ND transfection (7ND group) and activated rabbit serum containing a potent chemotatic factor complement C5a (C5a group) as described previously [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Then, the number of migrated monocytes and the distance travelled by monocytes in 10 high-power microscopic fields were measured and the values averaged.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal model</title><p>Thirty male New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2.0 to 3.0 kg underwent balloon-induced abdominal aortic endothelial injury and were randomly divided into control group (group A, <italic>n =</italic> 10), plRES-EGFP-7ND treatment group (group B, <italic>n =</italic> 10) and an empty-vector treatment group (group C, <italic>n =</italic> 10). All rabbits were fed a diet of 1% cholesterol for 8 weeks, then group A rabbits were killed, and group B and C rabbits underwent injection into the right hind limb with previously reported plasmid doses at the end of week 8 [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On day 3 after transfection, one rabbit in group B was killed to observe the expression of 7ND in injection sites under a fluorescence microscope. The expression of 7ND in the rabbitis serum was monitored by ELISA before and at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after transfection. Four weeks after transfection, all rabbits underwent pharmacological triggering as described [<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In brief, rabbits were injected intraperitoneally with 0.15 mg/kg Chinese Russellis viper venom, and then 30 min. later, with 0.02 mg/kg histamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). High-frequency ultrasonographyand intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging were performed before and after pharmacological triggering to study morphological changes of the abdominal aortic plaques. Rabbits were euthanized 24 hrs later for pathological studies. All animal care and experimental protocols complied with the Animal Management Rule of the Ministry of Public Health Peopleis Republic of China (documentation 55, 2001) and the Animal Care Committee of Shandong University and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Shandong University.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical studies</title><p>Blood samples were collected from all rabbits at the beginning of the experiment and before rabbits were killed. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured by enzymatic assays. Serum levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), inter-leukin-8 (IL-8), IL-18, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and P-selectin were assayed by use of a highly sensitive ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D Laboratory Research, Chicago, IL, USA). A human MCP-1 ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D Laboratory Research) was used to measure the plasma concentration of 7ND released from the skeletal muscles after plRES-EGFP-7ND transfection, and a rabbit MCP-1 ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D Laboratory Research) was used to measure the plasma concentration of MCP-1 in rabbits.</p></sec><sec><title>Ultrasonographic studies</title><sec><title>High-frequency ultrasonography</title><p>A high-frequency duplex ultrasonographic system (HP SONOS 5500<sub>:</sub> Andover, MA, USA) and a 7.5-MHz transducer were used to detect atherosclerotic plaques in the abdominal aorta before and after pharmacological triggering. After the aortic longitudinal and transversal axis views were scanned, the aortic diameter at end-diastole (Dd) and the maximal intima-media thickness (IMT) were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography, and the aortic peak velocity (Vp), mean velocity (Vm) and velocity-time integral (VTI) were recorded by pulsed Doppler technique.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Integrated backscatter analysis</title><p>Ultrasonic integrated backscatters from the aortic wall and the atherosclerotic plaques were analyzed by acoustic densitometry technique. The mean ultrasonic intensity (All) of the aortic intima and adventitia in normal segments and in the atherosclerotic plaques were measured, and the corrected All (Allc%) was derived by calculating the ratio of All of the intima to All of the adventitia in both normal segments and plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Intravascular ultrasound studies</title><p>IVUS studies were performed before and after pharmacological triggering by use of a 3.2F catheter containing a single rotating element transducer of 40 MHz connected to an IVUS system (Galaxy Boston Scientific Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA). The catheter was withdrawn from the aortic arch to the abdominal aorta by use of a motorized pullback device at a constant speed of 0.5 mm/sec. The following parameters were measured from the abdominal aortic cross-sectional images: external elastic membrane area (EEMA), lumen area (LA), plaque area (PA = EEMA-LA) and plaque burden (PB%= PA/EEMA &#x000d7; 100%). The IVUS images were reviewed by two independent observers, and values were averaged for data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry analysis</title><p>Rabbits were euthanized by overdose of intravenous pentobarbital. The abdominal aorta was dissected and excised to observe the occurrence of plaque rupture and thrombosis. Tissue samples 2-cm long were taken from the abdominal aorta of the three groups of rabbits. Abdominal aortic segments were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and some segments were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-&#x003bc;m-thick sections for staining with haematoxylin and eosin or picrosirius red or for immunohistochemical staining. Cryosections were cut into 6-&#x003bc;m-thick sections for Oil-red 0 staining. Some segments were fixed in 3% glutaral and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, and the intimal surface of the abdominal aorta was examined by scanning electronic microscopy (TEM-100, Electron Co., Tokyo, Japan) under 15-kV accelerating voltage. For ultrastructural examination, samples were fixed with 0.2 mol/l glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide and embedded into epon by standard procedures. Ultra-thin sections were cut and doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The ultrastructure of the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was observed on transmission electron microscopy (JEM-1200EX, Electron Co.).</p><p>The primary antibodies included monoclonal antibodies against rabbit macrophages (RAM11, Lab Vision Neomakers, Fremont, CA, USA) diluted to 1: 400 to identify macrophages; SMC actins (Boshide, Wuhan, China); and mouse anti-MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-12, P-selectin and MCP-1 monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) diluted 1: 100 to detect MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-12, P-selectin and MCP-1, respectively.</p><p>Histopathological slides were analyzed by use of a computer-assisted morphometric analysis system (Image-Pro Plus 5.0, Media Cybernetics, Cambridge, MA, USA). The fibrous cap thickness and IMT were measured at 10 equidistant points around the cap in each slice; three slices per section were measured and values were averaged, and the ratio of fibrous cap thickness to IMT was calculated. The area of positive staining of lipids, collagen, iron and macrophages was expressed as a percentage of the staining area divided by the plaque area in at least 10 high-power fields (&#x000d7;400). The vulnerability index was (macrophage staining%+ lipid stain-ing%) / (SMC%+ collagen fibre%) [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Plaque rupture was defined on histopathological observation as fibrous cap disruption with luminal thrombosis or buried fibrous cap within a plaque [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular biological studies</title><p>Tissue samples were frozen with use of liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted, and mRNA expression of MCP-1, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-12 and P-selectin in plaques was examined by quantitative real-time PCR with use of LightCycler (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA sequences were obtained from GenBank (Bethesda, MD, USA). Quantitative values were obtained from the threshold cycle value (Ct), the point at which a significant increase of fluorescence is first detected. The transcript number of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was quantified as an internal control. Experiments were performed in triplicate for each data point. Quantitative values were obtained from the Ct, the point at which a significant increase of fluorescence is first detected [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

These molecular and cellular effects translated into a successful prevention of plaque disruption, even in the presence of endothelial injury, hyperlipidaemia and pharmacological triggering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that directly targeting MCP-1 can prevent plaques from progressing to the point where they can be induced to rupture by external triggering.</p><p>MCP-1, as a single peptide chain of 76 amino acids, is a major chemotactic molecule in the vascular wall excreted by SMCs, macrophages and endothelial cells [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Once bound to its receptor, CCR-2, a member of the G-protein coupling receptor family, MCP-1 can activate the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway leading to chemotactic effects and production of a number of cytokines. The key role of MCP-1 in the atherosclerotic process has been firmly established in many studies. Aiello <italic>et al.</italic> reported that MCP-1 accelerated atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and was extensively expressed in macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Gu <italic>et al.</italic> found that LDL receptor/MCP-1-deficient mice given a cholesterol-rich diet displayed 83% less lipid deposition in the aorta than did LDL receptor-deficient mice with the wild-type MCP-1 allele on the same diet. The MCP-1-deficient mice also had less prominent aortic accumulation of macrophages, which reflects the relative paucity of MCP-1-derived monocyte chemoattraction [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Gosling <italic>et al.</italic> found that the absence of MCP-1 appeared to confer substantial protection against macrophage recruitment and atherosclerotic lesion formation without affecting lipoprotein metabolism in MCP-1-deficient mice [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Schecter <italic>et al.</italic> also found that MCP-1 can induce coagulation, which may enhance thrombosis in atherosclerotic plaques [<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For these reasons, MCP-1 has emerged as an important target in the gene therapy of atherosclerosis.</p><p>MCP-1 has two major functional domains &#x02013; chemotactic and receptor binding. Jarnagin <italic>et al.</italic> first demonstrated that deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 2 to 8 of the human MCP-1 resulted in a deficient chemotactic effect but unchanged receptor affinity [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which allowed for the use of 7ND as a therapeutic tool. Subsequent studies confirmed that blockade of MCP-1 attenuated neointima formation after balloon injury or stenting and initiation and progression of <italic>de novo</italic> atherosclerotic lesions [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, a Japanese group reported that 7ND gene transfer to apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice significantly inhibited monocyte infiltration and activation, reduced the seventy of atherosclerotic lesions and increased the contents of collagen and elastin in plaques [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, whether the MCP-1 mutant treatment can actually reverse atherosclerotic lesion progression and prevent vulnerable plaques from rupture has never been proved. In the present study, we successfully used recombinant PCR and gene cloning to delete N-terminal amino acids 2 to 8 of the human MCP-1 and construct the recombinant eukarytic expression vector plRES-EGFP-7ND.</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> study further demonstrated that plRES-EGFP-7ND can be transfected into HEK 293 cells with high transfection efficiency and that 7ND significantly reduced the number of migrating monocytes and the distance travelled by monocytes, which indicates that dominant-negative mutation of human MCP-1 resulted in loss of its chemotactic effects.</p><p>In the present study, 1 day after intramuscular injection of plRES-EGFP-7ND in rabbits, the 7ND proteins secreted by the transfected cells were released into the circulatory blood and peaked at a level more than 300 times higher than the baseline level on day 3, remained at a high level for 2 weeks and gradually decreased to a low level up to day 28. Green fluorescence protein expression in the skeletal muscles showed similar dynamic changes. These results indicated that one intramuscular injected dose of plRES-EGFP-7ND can produce effects for as long as 4 weeks. Such remarkable changes in plasma concentration of human MCP-1, however, were not repeated in the plasma levels of MCP-1 in rabbits, which remained stable, although the mutant 7ND would compete with the rabbitsi MCP-1 in combining with the CCR-2 receptors.</p><p>An intriguing finding in this study was that 4 weeks after plRES-EGFP-7ND transfection, even in the presence of continued high-cholesterol diet, plaque inflammation, burden and vulnerability in group B rabbits were greatly attenuated as compared with those in groups A and C, which suggests that plRES-EGFP-7ND treatment not only halted the progression of atherosclerotic lesions but also reversed the pathological process. The exact mechanisms underlying this finding is unclear but may be related to the marked inhibition of monocyte&#x02013;endothelium binding, proliferation and migration of SMCs and oxidative stress in mature plaques.</p><p>Consistent with the hypothesis driving this study, transfection of plRES-EGFP-7ND into group B rabbits greatly protected against plaque burden, inflammation and disruption, as shown by the following evidence: first, after 4-week transfection, ultrasono-graphic measurements of IMT, EEMA, PA and PB% were greatly decreased and those of Allc% increased; pathologically, the fibrous cap became thicker and the IMT thinner; second, serum levels of hs-CRR IL-8, IL-18, MMP-1 and P-selectin 4 weeks after gene transfection were significantly reduced and the vulnerability index as well as positive staining for MCP-1, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-12 and P-selectin was significantly lowered; fourth, the mRNA expression of MCP-1, MMP-1, MM-3, MMP-12 and P-selectin in the plaques was consistently decreased; and finally, no rabbits in group B developed plaque disruption, which indicates successful prevention of rupture. A notable finding in this study is that transfection with plRES-EGFP-7ND did not affect serum lipid level and only moderately reduced lipid contents in plaques. Nonetheless, this gene therapy induced an extraordinary anti-inflammatory effect, which led to stabilization of plaques. These results are in contrast to the situation with statin therapy, in which the major mechanism of plaque stabilization is due to the lipid-lowering effects by statins [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and lends support to the fascinating concept that inhibition of plaque inflammation alone without lipid lowering can stabilize vulnerable plaques [<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Our study contains several limitations. First, the sample size in each of the three animal groups was small, and further studies involving a larger animal sample and other types of animals such as apoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice are warranted to confirm our results. Second, IVUS was used in this study to measure the extent of vessel remodelling and plaque formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and endothelial injury, and luminal thrombosis may have been produced by IVUS catheter manipulation. Such a possibility, however, is trivial because the IVUS catheter is much smaller than the abdominal aortic lumen, and no luminal thrombosis occurred in groups A and B rabbits. Third, the incidence of plaque rupture after pharmacological triggering in group C rabbits was relatively low because of the simplicity of our methods in inducing plaque vulnerability, which may explain in part the absence of plaque rupture in group B rabbits. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of dominant-negative mutation of MCP-1 in animals with a high incidence of plaque disruption require further investigation. Finally, other gene interventions against MCP-1, such as mRNA interference, possibly effective in alleviating the chemotactic effects of MCP-1, as well as the relative efficacy of MCP-1 mRNA interference and 7ND in preventing vulnerable plaques from rupture, remain to be clarified. In conclusion, plRES-EGFP-7ND transfection provides a novel and effective approach to the inhibition of monocyte chemotaxis, attenuation of plaque inflammation, reversal of plaque progression and prevention of plaque disruption. These therapeutic effects are independent of serum lipid levels and demonstrate that inhibition of plaque inflammation alone without lipid lowering can stabilize vulnerable plaques.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the National 973 Basic Research Program of China (No. 2006CB503803), the National High-tech Research and Development Program of China (No. 2006AA02A406) and grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30470701, 30470702<sub>:</sub> 30570747 and 30670873).
