This concept has been termed &#x0201c;chemo-vaccination&#x0201d;, where aborted viral replication is thought to leave an immune footprint of exposure, which may augment protection provided by microbicides/PrEP. We investigated whether T cell responses were detectable in women participating in CAPRISA004 1% tenofovir microbicide trial, which showed 39% efficacy in reducing HIV acquisition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-eight HIV-uninfected participants were selected based on consistently high gel use and a high number of recorded sex acts over the duration of the trial. Cryopreserved PBMC were stimulated with HIV-1 peptide pools based on the HIV-1 clade C proteome, and IFN-gamma production was measured by the ELISPOT assay. Positive response were defined as &#x0003e;55 SFU/106 PBMC. Samples were tested at the visit at which preceding monthly coital activity was the participant&#x02019;s highest, and at study exit. Assays were conducted blinded to placebo or tenofovir arm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>T cell responses were detected in 1/18 tenofovir and 2/13 placebo participants at the high gel use visit. Responses were of low magnitude (between 60 and 100 SFU/106 PBMC), and directed at peptide pools from HIV Gag, Pol, Nef and Env. T cell responses were not detected at the exit visit. These data suggest that HIV-specific responses are infrequently detected in blood in uninfected participants from a clinical trial of a vaginal microbicide, and where present, are of low magnitude and transient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Magnitude and timing of viral exposure may account for differences in detecting systemic T cell responses between preclinical studies in non-human primates and a human clinical trial of a vaginal microbicide.</p></sec></body></article>
