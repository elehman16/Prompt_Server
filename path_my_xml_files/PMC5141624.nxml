ST is a 19-gauge cannula and 25.5 mm long. It is metallic and has a curved shaft and flattened tip [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The olive tip (OT) cannula is primarily used to free the intraocular adhesions secondary to previous inflammation or adhesions over the capsular bag during cataract surgery.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This cannula has a smooth oval tip and a malleable shaft compared to the ST cannula. It also has a smaller gauge (25) but comparable length (26 mm) to the ST cannula [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. We assumed that OT cannula can be used for STB, due to the very similar design to the ST cannula. In addition, the OT cannula may be less traumatic due to the smoother bulbous tip and smaller gauge, especially in patients with sclerotic vessels or in eyes with adhesions from a previous surgery. This prospective, randomized study compared the efficacy of OT cannula to the ST cannula for the delivery of STB for cataract surgery.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Standard Steven's cannula</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MEAJO-23-307-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Olive tip cannula</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MEAJO-23-307-g002"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 120 patients, scheduled for phacoemulsification cataract surgery under local anesthesia having the American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I-III were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups using a sealed envelope technique to receive STB with ST cannula (ST group) or an OT cannula (OT group). After approval from Institutional Review Board, written informed consent was obtained from all patients. No pilot study was performed as STB is a routine procedure at our institution.</p><p>Patients with a known allergy to local anesthetics, previous retinal surgery with a scleral buckle in place, previous strabismus surgery, localized infection, previous STB in the same quadrant, and those on anticoagulant therapy or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were excluded from the trial. Patients were also excluded if they declined to consent or had any communication difficulties.</p><p>To calculate sample size, we assumed that pain during delivery of anesthesia and surgery will occur in 20% of the ST group and 5% of the OT group. To achieve 95% confidence interval (CI) and 90% power to the study with 1:1 ratio in two study arms, at least 51 patients were required in each group. To compensate for patient dropout and introduction of an additional anesthetic agent, we increased the sample size to sixty patients in each arm.</p><p>The technique of STB for both groups involved the instillation of three drops of 0.4% oxybuprocaine (benoxinate) followed by two drops of 1% tetracaine and one drop of 5% iodine. A lid speculum was inserted and the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule were incised with Westcott scissors in the inferonasal quadrant, approximately, 5 mm from the limbus. The cannula was slowly advanced through the incision in the infero-posterior direction in a sliding pattern. The cannula was gently moved right and left while advancing to separate the tissue and 4&#x02013;6 ml of a mixture of local anesthetic solution (bupivacaine 0.5%, lidocaine 2% in a 3:2 volume ratio and hyaluronidase 5 unit/ml) was slowly injected. The cannula was withdrawn, and the incision site was compressed with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator for 2 min for hemostasis. To decrease the chance of postoperative endophthalmitis, the second drop of 5% Iodine was instilled on the ocular surface prior to removal of the speculum.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Ocular movements were assessed at 5 and 10 min after the block. A simple akinesia score (globe movement-inferior, superior, medial, and lateral) was used for assessment of STB. Normal movement graded as two and reduced movement as one while a flicker to no movement was graded as zero.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Similarly, eyelid movement was separately scored as 0 for complete ptosis, 1 for partial ptosis and 2 for no ptosis.</p><p>The purpose of study and procedure of STB block was explained to every patient. The patients were masked to the type of cannula used. A primary anesthesiologist performed the block in the holding area while a second anesthesiologist assessed the block, once the patient was moved into the operating room. The surgeon was assigned to check the patient's pain and akinesia score. The surgeon was also asked to rate his own satisfaction level about the quality of block using a subjective score with a verbal scale, from 0 (total dissatisfaction) to 10 (total satisfaction).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A visual analog scale (0&#x02013;10) was used to assess the level of patient pain during the block and at the end of the procedure.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Chemosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage were noted in each eye before starting surgery. The amount of supplementary local anesthetic (if required) was also recorded for the study.</p><p>Statistical Package for Social Studies 22 (IBM Corp., New York, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Numbers and percentages were calculated for qualitative outcome variables. The relative risk and 95% CI with a two-sided <italic>P</italic> value were used to compare outcomes between groups. Quantitative outcome variables were plotted to determine the distribution pattern. If they were normally distributed, the mean and standard deviation was calculated. To compare the outcomes between groups, we calculated the difference of mean, the 95% CI and a two-sided <italic>P</italic> value. A <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty patients were included in each of the group, and there were no dropouts from either group.

Patients with myopic globes, thin sclera and staphyloma, pose a higher risk of hemorrhage and globe perforation during insertion of a sharp needle.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] STB is a safer alternative technique that not only avoid to penetrate a more vascular peribulbar area but also uses a blunt cannula instead of a sharp needle to avoid this complication. Different types of cannulas are currently used for STB, but ST cannula is considered the gold standard.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Hence, the efficacy of all other cannulas is compared to the ST cannula. Mather compared a simple 20-gauge intravenous cannula to ST and has found it equally effective.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Better akinesia scores have been reported with the Jacob cannula because of its shape has a definite endpoint compared to the standard cannula, which does not have a well-defined end point.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>We compared the OT cannula, which is basically a surgical cannula and is meant to free the intraocular and the capsular bag adhesions during cataract surgery.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We used it for the first time for STB because of its similarity in shape and size with the standard ST cannula.</p><p>The primary outcome of our study suggests that the OT cannula is as effective as the conventional ST cannula for STB. In the current study, the overall quality of blocks was similar in both groups, irrespective of the type of cannula used. The lower number of patients with complications such as chemosis and hemorrhage in the OT group (a secondary outcome of our study), suggests that the OT cannula may also mitigate ocular damage compared to the ST cannula during STB.</p><p>We assumed that the oval bulb at the end of the OT cannula during insertion into the sub-Tenon's space may have separated the tissues and fibrous bands (if present) more gently, compared to the ST cannula, despite the similar outcome in both groups. In addition, the smaller gauge of the OT cannula may have added another safety factor because needle gauge has been associated to the risk of trauma during peribulbar anesthesia in patients who were at higher risk for hemorrhage.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, currently, there is no such comparison for STB.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Hence, we speculate that in addition to the equal efficacy, an OT cannula may also be safer than the ST cannula because of the smaller gauge.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is the type of patient population that is referred to our hospital. The majority of the patients have systemic and ocular comorbidities. Simple cataract cases usually undergo surgery at local hospitals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but complicated cases are referred to our hospital. Based on this observation, the ease of access to sub-Tenon's space at the inferotemporal quadrant could vary in eyes that had undergone previous surgeries. In this study, information on previous ocular surgery was limited, and the effect of this variable could not be evaluated. However, the randomized, prospective, double-masked nature of this study does mitigate some of the drawbacks of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The OT cannula seems equivalent to the gold standard Steven's cannula (ST) for STB during cataract surgery. Both patient and physician perceptions were similar regardless of the type of cannula used. There were greater complications such as chemosis with the ST cannula compared to the OT cannula. Further studies on larger patient groups are warranted before the recommending switching to the OT cannula for Sub-Tenon's ocular anesthesia.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Dr. Waleed Riad made a significant contribution to the research that resulted in this paper.
