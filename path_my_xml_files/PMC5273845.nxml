However, reduction in alcohol use is an important goal. Alcohol use affects other key factors that may influence treatment course and outcome. In this study the authors aim to administer an adapted intervention for AUDs to reduce alcohol use in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial at 16 HIV care clinics. A motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy based intervention for AUDs, developed through adaptation and piloted in Zimbabwe, will be administered to PLWHA with AUDs recruited at HIV clinics. The intervention will be administered over 16 sessions at 8 HIV clinics. This intervention will be compared with an equal attention control in the form of the World Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Programme (WHO mhGAP) guide, adapted for the Zimbabwean context. General function, quality of life, and adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) will be secondary outcomes. Booster sessions will be administered to both groups at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months respectively.</p><p>The primary outcome measure will be the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score. The World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQoL) HIV, viral load, and CD4 counts will be secondary outcome measures. Outcome assessments will be administered at baseline, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months. Moderating factors such as perceived social support, how people cope with difficult situations and post-traumatic exposure and experience will be assessed at baseline. Trained research assistants will recruit participants. The outcome assessors who will be trained in administering the outcome and moderating tools will be blinded to the treatment arms allocated to the participants. However, the principal investigator, participants and intervention staff will be unblinded.</p><p>Data will be analysed using STATA Version 14. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at four time points that is; at baseline, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months respectively. All participants will be included in the analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures. The mean AUDIT scores will be compared between groups using student t-tests. Multilevel logistic regression analysis will be performed for binominal variables and multilevel linear regression for continuous variables. Descriptive statistics will be computed for baseline and follow-up assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will be the first to address problematic alcohol use in PLWHA in Zimbabwe. It seeks to use local resources in delivering a modified, brief, evidence-based, and culturally contextualised intervention. The study results will determine the effectiveness of adapting psychological interventions for AUDs in HIV infected adults using a task-sharing framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/appmanager/atmregistry?dar=true&#x00026;tNo=PACTR201509001211149">PACTR201509001211149</ext-link>.

In low and middle income countries, AUDs cause 19.5 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Harmful alcohol use results in 3.3 million deaths per year globally. In 2012, according to WHO alcohol use contributed 5.1% to the global burden of diseases or 139 million net DALYS. Zimbabwe is a country with one of the highest per capita alcohol consumption rates in the WHO Afro-Region at 5.7&#x000a0;l per capita per year in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Alcohol consumption is high among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) especially hazardous alcohol consumption and this is associated with decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Studies have also shown that alcohol consumption is linked to HIV infection, adherence to the highly effective antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV prevention, delayed testing and treatment, and general poor outcome in HIV care and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PLWHA are at increased risk of physiologic injury such as liver disease from alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Heavy episodic drinking is common in sub-Saharan Africa, the epicentre of the HIV pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The quantity of alcohol consumed is more closely related to HIV infection than the frequency although some studies have indicated that the drinking context is as important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to alcohol and other drug abuse, depression, anxiety and psychosis, are linked to non-adherence to HAART and to treatment interruptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In order to achieve adequate viral suppression and improve adherence to HAART, AUDs and other psychiatric disorders need to be appropriately treated. Wu et al., after controlling for adherence, showed that daily consumption of alcohol was associated with a viral load increase, while reduction of alcohol intake to once weekly intake was associated with a reduction in viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence that alcohol affects the functioning of the human immune system negatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Alcohol has been shown to increase the concentration of HIV RNA in semen and the vagina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is also some evidence that vaginal shedding of viral RNA is increased by alcohol which is associated with increased infectiousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>AUDs and low adherence to HAART are associated with poor health outcomes and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while simplification of HAART has been associated with improved adherence and quality life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Alcohol consumption has implications for HIV treatment through direct toxic effects on the liver and the interactions with HAART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite the high prevalence of alcohol use disorders among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and the potential for adverse health consequences, there is not enough contextual evidence for behavioural interventions for AUDs in African settings. Motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), problem solving, and risk reduction are some of the evidence-based treatments that have been used to treat alcohol use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. MI and CBT have been used both in combination and separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from the world&#x02019;s most pronounced crisis in terms of human resources for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A streamlined and rationalized chain of care that relieves pressure on individual workers is needed. However this chain of care for patients, while increasing access to and uptake of interventions, must be quality assured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Up skilling various cadres of staff to provide services that are normally delivered by highly skilled workers is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Task sharing has been proposed as an approach to provide services that are normally provided by highly skilled staff by the lesser skilled through training and provision of treatment manuals. For task-sharing to work, attention needs to be paid to the selection of staff, their current workload, the adequacy of training, and the availability of manualised interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Supervision and support visits are essential for quality control and maintaining fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Task-sharing has the potential to build capacity and integrate HIV care, thereby also addressing the gap that results from health worker attrition due to immigration and HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Most studies on HIV in Zimbabwe have focused on behavioural change with particular emphasis on risk reduction and adherence to HAART. There have been no studies of the management of AUDs among PLWHA in Zimbabwe. This is to our knowledge, the first intervention study that specifically targets AUDs in PLWHA. This intervention for AUDs intervention will be compared with the mhGAP intervention guide alcohol use management module which is a part of the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (WHO mhGAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The mhGAP intervention guide was developed for primary care settings and has been used in developing countries for the identification and management of various mental and neurological and substance use disorders (MNS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparatory-work</title><p>In the development of the intervention for the proposed study, a literature review was undertaken to evaluate the available scientific evidence on the magnitude of the AUDs in PLWHA across Low and Medium Income Countries (LMIC). The review of literature for efficacy and effectiveness studies was focused on relevant socio-demographic variables (including gender), methods used, HIV disease progression and alcohol outcomes. This evidence was then presented to experts and HIV specialists to bring their attention to the problem and get them on board to expand on the work and bring in local context. The study flow is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Intervention preparatory stages</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2017_1208_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>Focus in the development of this intervention was on integration and adaptation of MI and CBT, which were the main intervention theoretical frameworks and brought in the local contextual framework. Development of treatment manuals, and exploratory work with a small number of patients then followed. The intervention development and design included meetings and workshops that were qualitative in nature. This involved experts such as provincial medical officers, district medical officers, nurses, and stakeholders from community leadership and provincial government, NGOs and alcohol service organizations such as the alcoholics anonymous and PLWHA. Interactions and formal meetings with the Ministry of Health, College of Health Sciences (Departments of Medicine, Psychiatry and Community Medicine) were done to gather their views. The National AIDS Council, which is the statutory body mandated with planning, coordinating, and evaluation of HIV/AIDS activities in Zimbabwe participated in the development of the intervention.</p><p>Focus group discussions, which were conducted with PLWHA, were around the language of alcohol and knowledge gaps concerning alcohol use. Barriers and facilitators of AUDs treatment were explored. Issues around &#x02018;messaging&#x02019; in the intervention and patient information leaflet were discussed as well.</p><p>The current HIV clinic setup, existing staff skills in counselling and established counsellor-patient relationships was identified as the main facilitators to intervention. Stigma, lack of skills among health professionals, absence of brief culturally appropriate screening tools, and patient and provider attitudes toward their own alcohol use were identified as the main barriers. The pilot study showed that the RGNs could deliver the intervention. The recruitment and retention of participants was feasible and adjustments to the study instruments needed to be done to allow smooth flow of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aims</title><p>

The unit of alcohol as defined in the AUDIT is 10&#x000a0;g. The legislation requires that the percentage of alcohol in alcoholic beverages be specified and follow the regional norm. The alcohol quantity in grams is however more informative. A traditional brew in the rural areas of Zimbabwe, which has 40&#x000a0;g of alcohol in 1.5&#x000a0;l, is estimated to have 4 units of alcohol and will be used to assess the quantity of units consumed according to local norms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Secondary outcome tools</title><p>The secondary outcomes will be the functional capacity, the quality of life and adherence to HAART.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]</title><p>The WHODAS 2.0 will be a secondary outcome measure and will be administered at baseline, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months respectively to assess functional capacity.

The four key principles of MI which are to (a) express empathy, (b) develop discrepancy, (c) roll with resistance, and (d) support self-efficacy will be employed in this intervention. MI topics will help in building client motivation and emphasize responsibility for change. The provider gives guidance and support with no specific assumptions regarding the course of treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy will include (a) identifying intrapersonal and interpersonal triggers for relapse, (b) coping-skills training, (c) alcohol refusal skills training, (d) functional analysis of alcohol use, and (e) increasing non-drinking related activities.</p><p>The intervention will have 16 sessions. Eight sessions will be given at baseline and 4 each at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Sessions 1, 4, 6 and 7 will be repeated at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months.

The session will also focus on providing feedback on the AUDIT score, the CD4 count, viral load, and on functioning and quality of life. This intervention is expected to last one hour (based on our experience in the pilot study). At 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, the control intervention will be re-administered and outcomes assessed with the final assessment done at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Training</title><p>The principal investigator will be the chief trainer on the MI/CBT AUDs intervention while a co-investigator trained in the mhGAP intervention guide will train the control arm interventionists.</p><p>RGNs will be trained in the use of the intervention (MI/CBT) and control (mhGAP) manuals. Sixty-four nurses working at 16 HIV Care clinics will be trained. Material covered in the training manual will include evidence-based interventions for co-occurring HIV and AUDs, administration of the AUDIT and other data gathering tools, the theoretical basis of the intervention, counselling skills and supervision. Further, RGNs will receive training in good clinical practice, covering research ethics, the importance of maintaining confidentiality, reporting adverse events, the intervention protocol, and the process of referring patients for specialized care. Practical exercises will include self-administered quizzes, small group discussions, and case study exercises.</p><p>Training materials developed during the preparatory phase of the study will be used in the intervention and control training. RGNs who were identified and trained for the pilot study will be recruited for the training. Staff trained in the feasibility study, who are RGNs by profession, will do supervisory visits. Supervisors will use supervision protocols developed for the study. Supervisory visits will be undertaken at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. The ability to follow essential elements of the intervention manual as judged in a meeting of supervisors through the review of audio and videotaping will be the standard of practice. Further, trained intervention staff will be required to take a written test covering the content of the intervention and control manual and attain a pass mark of 50%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The selected 16 HIV clinics will be requested to provide patient registration numbers, which will then be entered into a remote computer to randomly select participants for screening for study eligibility.

The training will include the scoring of the AUDIT, the WHODAS and the WHOQoL HIV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Fidelity</title><p>Fidelity has four defined components: design of the intervention, training in the intervention, monitoring the delivery of the intervention and monitoring its receipt. As it is essential to maintain fidelity, the treatment will be manualised and intervention staff will be appropriately trained to adhere to the treatment guides. Training in the intervention includes role-playing, which facilitates competence in the delivery of the intervention. As part of the training, an intervention training manual has been developed that will be used in the intervention and controls. Delivery of the intervention will be monitored through patient cards and video and audio recordings of patient session. Supervision will also be used to maintain fidelity. The standard operating procedures will contain supervision protocols. The receipt of the intervention will be monitored through patient record cards and interviews. Overall fidelity will be assessed with a comprehensive intervention fidelity guide (CIFG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Randomization</title><p>A computer generated block randomization will be used to assign clinics to either intervention or control arm (as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Procedure and study flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2017_1208_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>

Any individual identified as alcohol dependent will be referred for alcohol treatment services. Individuals assigned to the MI/CBT intervention may reduce their alcohol consumption, in turn improving HAART adherence and HIV disease outcomes. Clinic staff will benefit as they will be trained in delivering the intervention aimed at reducing harmful/hazardous alcohol consumption. Finally, substantial public health knowledge will likely be gained from this search.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study it is hypothesized that an adapted MI/CBT intervention will lead to a significant reduction in alcohol use in PLWHA. It is further hypothesized that reduction in alcohol use will lead to improved function as measured by the WHODAS 2.0, improved quality of life as measured by the WHOQoL HIV, and improved adherence to HAART as measured by the CD4 and viral load. This study further seeks to establish whether registered general nurses in primary health care facilities in Zimbabwe will be effective in providing the MI/CBT intervention to reduce alcohol use and improve patient engagement with treatment.</p><p>We will test the effectiveness of an MI/CBT intervention that can be used by RGNs for alcohol reduction in PLWHA. If successful, the intervention will be implemented in HIV clinics in Zimbabwe and other settings where general nurses oversee HIV treatment. We hypothesize that patients may view their ability to return to work as important and this may motivate them to adhere to the treatment. Improved quality of life has been shown to improve adherence in other studies.</p><p>Given that most behavioural interventions for alcohol use have been developed within a Western framework, the use of an adapted intervention in this study will inform us about its effectiveness in reducing alcohol use in PLWHA in a resource limited setting. In resource rich environments, inpatient and outpatient services for addictions are usually widely available. However, in Zimbabwe, as in many other resource-limited settings, inpatient management of AUDs may be unaffordable for the majority. Outpatient care, if available, is the rule rather than the exception.</p><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no published study from Zimbabwe has examined functioning and quality of life in PLWHA with AUDs. Improvement in functioning and quality of life are key aspects to address in this population. Quality of life has been shown to improve upon initiation of HAART (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stata.com/">http://www.stata.com</ext-link>) and studies in other countries have documented an improvement in adherence with an improvement in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Over a quarter of 15&#x02013;49 year olds in sub-Saharan Africa are living with AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Given that this is the most productive age group in the community, improving functioning will likely have positive socio-economic impacts on the community.</p><p>There are few limitations that warrant mention. Firstly, we will use a self-report screening measure of drinking. Self-report may not accurately reveal drinking quantity and behaviour. That said, the AUDIT has excellent sensitivity and specificity and cross-cultural applicability and can be used in remote areas where sampling for alcohol biomarkers may be challenging. Secondly, brief interventions have been shown to be more useful when provided at community level although the lack training often hampers provision at community level. Thirdly, viral suppression may not correlate well with adherence; even in resource rich settings viral suppression can be low despite an adherence of 80&#x02013;95%. In this study viral load will be a proxy measure of adherence. CD4 count in addition to the viral load will be used as a measure of adherence.</p><p>This is a task-sharing intervention study. It is hoped that, upon successful completion of this study, RGNs from district hospitals and municipal health facilities will be trained in recognising and managing AUDs in HIV infected patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AIDS</term><def><p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUDIT</term><def><p>Alcohol use disorder identification test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIFG</term><def><p>Comprehensive Intervention fidelity guide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMB</term><def><p>Data monitoring and safety board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DTS</term><def><p>Davidson trauma scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DUDIT</term><def><p>Drug use disorders identification test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FGD</term><def><p>Focus Group Discussion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>Generalized estimation equations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAART</term><def><p>Highly active antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IHDS</term><def><p>International HIV dementia scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M.I.N.I.</term><def><p>Mini International neuropsychiatric interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mhGAP</term><def><p>Mental health gap action programme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MI/CBT</term><def><p>Motivational interviewing/cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSPSS</term><def><p>Multidimensional scale of perceived social support</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLWHA</term><def><p>People living with HIV/AIDS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTSD</term><def><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RGN</term><def><p>Registered general nurses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAMISS</term><def><p>Substance abuse mental illness symptom screener</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHODAS</term><def><p>World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHOQoL</term><def><p>World Health Organisation Quality of Life</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Angeline Paradzai and Wendline Mukombachoto for helping in the preparation of the manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The South African Research Chairs Initiative in PTSD, funded by the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Foundation, supported the pilot study.
