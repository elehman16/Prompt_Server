Introduction</title><p>Bright light is the principal zeitgeber (time giver) for the biological clock in mammals, including humans. Maintenance of regular circadian timing is important to human health and well-being, and physical exercise has been shown to entrain circadian rhythms and can cause phase shifting [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The effect of time of the day on performance has been well established with early morning nadirs and late afternoon peaks [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This diurnal rhythm can be influenced by several factors, including exposure to hot and humid environmental conditions, which in turn are factors that can affect sports performance [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>There are substantial physiological, immunological, and psychological changes that occur in an athlete during exercise in the heat compared with the habitual environment [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These changes include thermoregulatory alterations in the circulatory and endocrine systems, cardiovascular strain, glycogen depletion, and increased metabolite accumulation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many interrelated physiological processes work together to maintain muscular function, sustain central blood pressure, regulate fluid volume, and maintain the body temperature within normal limits [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Several of these exacerbated physiological demands may be responsible for mobilising a larger number of white blood cells (WBCs) into the circulation when exposed to the heat [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is already known, for example, that the amount that interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases is correlated to exercise intensity, duration, muscle mass, and the power involved in the mechanical work [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that the release of IL-6 in exercise is related to the occurrence of muscle damage [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Heat shock protein (HSP70) can be treated as a part of the stress response as well [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which increases when human cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or to other stress types such as exercise. A perception exists that some athletes, especially those engaging in prolonged intense exercise and competition, such as running, cycling, and swimming, may show an increased rate of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], owing to a compromised immune system. Moderate exercise enhances the athlete's immunity, but high-intensity prolonged exercise impairs, temporarily, immune competence [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The existence of circadian rhythmicity in the human immune system has been recorded for some time [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It has been reported in Haus and Smolensky [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that the circulation of the WBCs involved in the defence of the human body shows high-amplitude circadian rhythmicity, being lower in the morning and higher in the afternoon. Additionally, a diurnal variation has been observed in IL-6, with a decrease at 12:00&#x02009;hs, 16:00&#x02009;hs, and 20:00&#x02009;hs compared to 07:00&#x02009;hs during high-force eccentric resistance exercise using the elbow flexor muscles [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HSP70 also shows a diurnal variation which strongly correlates with core body temperature, with a maximum reported in the evening and a nadir in the early morning [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, club cell protein 16 (CC16) concentration, which plays an important role in protecting the respiratory tract against inflammation and oxidative stress and therefore is a suitable biomarker of lung inflammation and injury, shows a diurnal variation, with a decrease during daytime hours [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Elite athletes not only compete against one another but also compete against tough environmental conditions. Challenging environmental conditions such as heat or cold during racing or training phases pose particular risks to an athlete's health. In modern sports history, the Olympic Games, World Championships, and major races have drawn attention to a number of climatic effects on running performance [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The summer competition calendar events such as the Olympics, Outdoor World Championships, and some major road races have all been held in hot and humid conditions.</p><p>Thus, intense exercise in the heat can overload the body's ability to react appropriately to the stress imposed on athletes, and the result of this can be hyperthermia, dehydration, a decrease in physical and mental performance, and even heat stroke and immune depletion [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Identifying circadian factors influencing athletic performance is often difficult because of the interaction between endogenous and exogenous components which contribute to overall performance, and in addition, any time-of-day effect of exercise on inflammatory responses remains vague.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on physiological and immunological variables of highly trained runners, completing a 10&#x02009;km time trial run in a hot and humid environment at two time points within the diurnal day. We, therefore, hypothesised that (1) running performance will reflect a diurnal variation, with peak performance occurring in the evening; (2) there will be a circadian influence on immunological and physiological response to the exercise stress, in addition to the response to the hot and humid condition (28&#x000b0;C and relative humidity of 70%).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Method</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Population</title><p>British or European runners are exposed to a range of environmental conditions they are unaccustomed to as they compete around the world (such as IAAF Outdoor World Championships in Doha, 2019). Therefore, investigations into the impact of different environmental conditions are required to understand their impact on athletes. A running trial in hot and humid conditions was selected for investigation. This study was approved by the University Ethics Committee and was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Anthropometric measurements were taken prior to the trial including height and mass. Thirteen highly trained runners (range <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> 64&#x02013;79&#x02009;ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; age 33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5&#x02009;yr) were enrolled in this study. All participants trained daily (covering 80&#x02013;120&#x02009;km a week), with some participants training twice daily, with the main training session for athletes is in the evening. All participants were healthy, injury free, not on medication for inflammatory conditions, and without infection within the three weeks prior to the study. The participants in the study all lived in Scotland, UK, and were not accustomed to the hot and humid conditions employed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Exercise Protocol</title><p>A 10&#x02009;km treadmill time trial was performed under controlled environmental conditions: 28&#x000b0;C, 70% relative humidity in an environmental chamber. The chamber had a complete volume change (76&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup>) every 15&#x02009;min during the trials and had been recently serviced and calibrated by the manufacturers (Weiss Technik, UK). Trials were conducted on two separate occasions, separated by at least a week, at two different times of the day (09:00&#x02009;hs and 18:00&#x02009;hs). Heart rate (Polar Electro, Finland) was recorded pretrial, each 1&#x02009;km during the trial, posttrial, and 1&#x02009;h posttrial, whilst running speed was recorded at the end of each km. The athletes had free control of their running speed, without having access to the value of the actual treadmill speed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Body Temperature (Gastrointestinal Temperature)</title><p>Core body temperature was measured by ingesting a telemetric temperature sensor (ThermoDot, USA). Participants were required to swallow the temperature pills two hours prior to the trial. Measurements were taken at pretrial, each 1&#x02009;km during the trial, posttrial, and 1&#x02009;h posttrial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Blood Sample, BP, and Lung Function</title><p>Lung function tests, blood sampling, blood pressure (Wrist, Omron, 5-1, Japan), and anthropometric measurements were conducted pre, post, and 1&#x02009;h posttrial. Lung function tests including forced vital capacity (FVC and used to help determine both the presence and severity of lung diseases), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 and used to calculate Tiffeneau-Pinelli index), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and forced expiratory flow<sub>25&#x02013;75%</sub> (FEF25&#x02013;75) were measured using a spirometer (Compact II: Type C, Vitalograph Ltd., UK).</p><p>Blood samples were collected in a 2&#x02009;ml tube (BD Vacutainer SST&#x02122;) and differential counts carried out using an automated cell counter (Sysmex, XS-1000i, USA). The numbers and types of different cells within the blood were determined by the cell counting component and automatically saved ready for review (RBC, WBC, and platelet); the samples were run in triplicate and the mean values were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Biochemical Analyses</title><p>For the determination of CC16, HSP70, and IL-6, blood samples were collected in a 6&#x02009;ml tube (BD Vacutainer SST) and immediately centrifuged for 15&#x02009;min at 1000<italic>g</italic> at room temperature (Mistral 2000R, Sanyo, Leicester, UK), and the serum was separated, aliquoted, and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>All the measurements were performed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&#x00026;D Systems Europe Ltd.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Nasal Lavage Method</title><p>The method of Naclerio et al. [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was modified to increased cell concentrations in the sample based on previous pilot work in our lab. The temperature of the saline solution was increased from 37&#x000b0;C to 40&#x000b0;C, and a gentle massage of the nose was performed prior to conducting the test. These changes increased the amount of cell release from the nostril during sampling.</p><p>At rest, prior to the testing, and directly after finishing the 10&#x02009;km trial, nasal lavage was performed. Participants performed a gentle massage to the nose immediately before the procedure. Saline water was prewarmed to 40&#x000b0;C. Participants tilt their head backwards to a 45&#x000b0; angle, elevating their palate and closing the nasopharynx. Then 5&#x02009;ml of pre-warmed (40&#x000b0;C) the sterile saline solution was introduced into the nostril and held for a duration of 10 seconds. The participant then brought their head forward and expired the lavage into a polyamide gauze-filtered funnel (size 100&#x02009;mm) that separated the mucus from the solution, and the samples were collected at the base in a 15&#x02009;ml centrifuge tube. The nasal lavage procedure was performed again with the other nostril. The volume collected from both nostrils was stored in the same tube; the total volume collected was recorded and immediately placed on ice until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Prior to statistical analysis, all data were checked for normality. Data were analysed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc tests to determine the difference at which time point the diurnal variation occurred and the difference between time points of the trial (SPSS20 Statistical Software, IBM, UK). This analysis revealed the global effect of time of day which includes resting state, the global effect of the environmental conditions, and the effect of the interaction between time of day and the environmental conditions which include posttrial and 1&#x02009;h posttrial state.

Discussion</title><p>Our findings add to the existing literature by defining a major impact of circadian rhythm physiology and immunology on exercise performance [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A greater phase response in both core body temperature and HR causing a higher physiological strain in the morning trial was evident; whereas, immunological markers including IL-6, HSP70, WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and CC16 were more affected in the evening trial.</p><p>Mean running times were not statistically different, between the two time points despite the mean morning trial time being faster by 19 seconds compared to the evening trial. This result contradicts previous research where a significant difference in time-of-day variation in running performance has been reported [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All participants (100%) in this study ran slower than they were accustomed to, suggesting that environmental temperature and humidity changes were the main factors influencing their performance and importantly masking any effect of the time of day. In addition, unaccustomed environmental conditions have had a direct effect on core body temperature and HR, with a significant phase response evident in the morning compared to the evening. This may be linked directly to the athlete's greater ability to remove heat load in the morning compared to the evening, a phenomenon explained by the body's heat gain mode during the morning compared to the evening when the body exhibits slow heat gain so that heat loss is more pronounced [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The current data suggest that morning exercise exerts higher physical demands on the individual.</p><p>Contradicting previous findings, plasma CC16, lung function measures, and nasal lavage neutrophil concentration did not display circadian variation [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Again, the overriding effect of the heat and humidity compared to alterations caused by diurnal variation could be masking results. However, a significant difference between trial time points occurred, with an increase in CC16 levels posttrials, irrespective of time of day; this is in agreement with previous findings [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, the effect of warm and humid environmental condition and exercise on the increase on CC16 was limited (lower) compared to another similar study conducted by the same authors in a cold environmental condition [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Environmental conditions are known to impact the degree of airway epithelial disruption during high levels of exercise, in particular, warm humid air inhalation appears to limit the airway injury and epithelial cell perturbation compared to cold dry air [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This finding highlights the potential for exercise, when performed at high intensity in hot and humid conditions, to limit the airway epithelial cell disruption and hence could be employed as a strategy to minimise dehydration stress to the airways and therefore protect the long-term respiratory health of elite winter athletes [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Unlike RBC total concentration, HGB, HCT, and platelet numbers, there was an evident diurnal rhythmicity in total WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte concentrations that was higher in the evening compared to the morning at all time points in the trials. These variables also displayed a response to the exercise/environment stress, including the classic lymphocyte biphasic response to an intense bout of exercise [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There did appear to be a phase response in the IL-6 measures, however, with a greater increase in the evening trial compared to morning. The altered pattern of IL-6 suggests that the combination of exercise in the evening time, as well as the hot and humid environment, elicited greater circulating numbers of IL-6 compared to the morning. This elevated evening IL-6 concentration could be due to an increase in total white blood cell concentration (including neutrophil and lymphocyte) in the evening as these cells are known to express IL-6 [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>We know that in postintense exercise, there is an associated open window to immune perturbation with evidence for this perturbation again shown here in this study [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In terms of physical performance, it would appear that the physiological response of the participants was driven by the unaccustomed hot and humid environment, more so than the time-of-day differences. In this study, athletes routinely trained throughout the solar day and appear to entrain systems to adapt to negate the circadian influence often seen in the morning. The questions to be posed therefore are the given differential diurnal response of the respective variables measured in this study: does this relate to a differential diurnal physiological/immune stress response? Importantly, does this result in a diurnal training effect phase response? Given the complexities of the systems involved in these responses, these will be difficult questions to answer but merit further research. A differential training response depending on the time of day, if elucidated, could be very useful in terms of training and training time efficiencies.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 was therefore rejected as there were no significant differences in the running performance of the athletes between the morning and evening trials; therefore, we believe to the habitual training patterns of the athletes and additionally to the masking effect of the unaccustomed environmental conditions of heat and humidity. We did, however, see some differential responses in the physiological and immunological variables depending on time of day, although not across the entire panel of measures, and hence, hypothesis 2 was therefore partially accepted.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>4.1. Practical Application of Results</title><p>The current data suggest that exercise and/or time of day would interfere with clinical endocrine profiling of a population exercising in the evening. There is evidence that morning exercise exerts higher physical demands on the individual [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hence, athletes and coaches should take into consideration these phenomena when planning intensity training or racing in the morning time. In addition, athletes may endeavour to adjust their internal clock to its peak performance time, regardless of what clock time the athletic event is occurring. Coaches are required to design training schedules to either enhance or avoid obvious issues when competing in uncustomised environmental conditions. Thus, from a clinical perspective, the morning HR may be a cause for concern for the risk of cardiovascular events, where it is reported to be more pronounced in the morning hours compared to the rest of the day, especially when one additionally considers the results found here, for nonacclimatised participants exercising in hot and humid conditions. Furthermore, athletes are advised to train at the same time as planned races to advance and shift their circadian rhythm and minimise physiological strain and immunological suppression.</p><p>The findings of this research not only apply to athletes engaging in strenuous endurance events but also may apply to the general population, where the stress of physical exertion is combined with environmental stress at different times of the day, or even in some occupations, for example, firefighters.</p><p>Despite our findings, we acknowledge a number of limitations. Firstly, within the laboratory setting of this study, participants were exposed to the hot and humid condition only during a limited time. Secondly, we are unable to determine the exact mechanism underlying our findings due to complex and interrelated interactions. Measuring other hormonal variables such as cortisol and melatonin would help bring clarity to these results, elucidating further the prevailing mechanisms causing the high morning physiological strain and evening immune suppression.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the late Professor Mark G.
