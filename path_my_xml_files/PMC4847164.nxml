Topical application of fluoride, use of fluoride toothpastes and fluoridation of drinking water are methods to prevent dental caries by decreasing the demineralization and increasing the mineral content of the saliva, which may inhibit enamel demineralization [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Laser application along with the application of fluoride is a new technique to improve fluoride binding to the enamel [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Heat generated by the laser light not only prevents the formation of caries on enamel surfaces [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but also leads to decomposition of the organic matrix, loss of water and carbon, and formation of the refractory phases of hydroxyapatite, such as calcium phosphate or calcium pyrophosphate. In addition, it helps the incorporation of fluoride into the hydroxyapatite structure when combined with topical fluoridation and results in the formation of fluorohydroxyapatite and calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>) on the enamel surface serving as a reservoir of fluoride against dental caries in the process of demineralization [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Diode laser is a laser containing active solid ingredients made of semiconductor crystals of indium, gallium and arsenide with a wavelength between 800 and 980 nm, near the non-ionizing invisible infrared spectrum [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Continuous wavelength of diode laser makes it excellent for soft tissue surgery. A major advantage of diode laser is its small size and portability [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CO<sub>2</sub> laser with the carbon dioxide gas as its active substance and a wavelength of 10600 nm, which lies at the end of the non-ionizing, non-visible infrared spectrum is transmitted through continuous pulse with the highest absorption rate in water after erbium laser. Among all dental lasers, CO<sub>2</sub> laser wavelength has the maximum absorption rate in hydroxyapatite, which is 1,000 times the absorption rate of diode laser [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some authors believe that laser therapy may have adverse effects on the enamel causing melting zones, pitting and fracture lines and thermal damage to dentin or pulp [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, it has been shown that the application of diode laser, combined with topical fluoridation inhibits damage caused by acid attack in vitro [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Villalba-Moreno et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] assessed the effect of diode laser on fluoride uptake. In their study, 25 third molars were sectioned mesiodistally and divided into five groups of 10 specimens. The first group received no treatment. The second group was treated with fluoride varnish (NaF: 1.0 mg) for 15 seconds.</p><p>The third group was treated with fluoride varnish and diode laser (wavelength of 809 nm, power of 5W). The fourth group was treated with fluoride varnish and 7W diode laser. The fifth group was treated with fluoride varnish and 10W diode laser. The results showed that laser treatment significantly increased fluoride binding to the enamel surface [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> laser and diode laser on 90 specimens obtained from 45 third molars, which were divided into six groups. Diode laser (wavelength of 809 nm, power of 5 and 7W, for 15 seconds) and CO<sub>2</sub> laser (wavelength of 10.6 &#x003bc;m, power of 1 and 2W, for 15 seconds) with the interval of 30 ms, along with 1.0 mg amine fluoride were used. There was a significant difference in the amount of fluoride absorption between the CO<sub>2</sub> laser and 5W diode laser [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sayed et al, [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in 2012 evaluated four common laser wavelengths including neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP), diode, and CO<sub>2</sub> in combination with fluoride therapy in acidic challenges. Forty sound human premolars were divided into buccal and lingual halves and 1.23% NaF gel was applied on each sample. The samples were divided into five groups of control, KTP, Nd: YAG, diode and CO<sub>2</sub> laser. The minimum reduction in enamel hardness following acidic challenge was seen in KTP, Nd: YAG, CO<sub>2</sub> and diode lasers, respectively [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and diode lasers on topical fluoride uptake by primary teeth surfaces after NaF varnish treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this parallel-group in vitro study, 40 primary molars with no visible defects on their enamel surfaces were selected and stored in 5% chloramine T solution at room temperature for one week. Then, they were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 specimens. The roots were sectioned and the crowns were divided into buccal and lingual halves using a diamond disc and a handpiece. One section was used as the control and the other as the experimental specimen. A total of 80 samples were assigned to four groups each containing 20 specimens. In each specimen, a 4 &#x000d7; 4 mm window was considered, then the periphery of the window was coated with nail varnish and the specimen was stored in distilled water.</p><p>All specimens (experimental and control) were then dried and treated with 5% NaF varnish (Sultan Topex&#x000ae;, USA) for 15 seconds, and were then laser irradiated (control specimens did not receive laser treatment). In the first group, diode laser (A.R.C. Laser GmbH., N&#x000fc;rnberg, Germany) was used (wavelength of 980 nm, frequency of 16 Hz, power of 5W, beam diameter of 600&#x003bc;m and pulse duration of 30 ms) in pulse mode with exposure time of 15 seconds. The same diode laser was used in the second group with a power of 7W. In the third group, CO<sub>2</sub> laser (Daeshin Enterprise Corp., Seoul, South Korea) was used (wavelength of 10.6&#x003bc;m, frequency of 30 Hz, power of 1W, beam diameter of 0.6 mm and pulse duration of 15 ms) in pulse mode with exposure time of 15 seconds; the same CO<sub>2</sub> laser with a power of 2W was used in the fourth group. The power density of the four groups was 53, 74, 5 and 10.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Dental samples were irradiated by an operator using the same method described above from a distance of 5 mm. Putty molds were used to ensure equal distance between the tip of the laser handpiece and the enamel surface. After laser irradiation, the specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours; then excess fluoride varnish was removed from the surface of all specimens by an electric toothbrush (Oral-B Laboratories Inc., Iowa City, IA, USA) for 5 seconds followed by rinsing with distilled water for 30 seconds.</p><p>Fluoride uptake was measured by the enamel biopsy technique using a fluoride ion selective electrode (Fluoride ISE Metrohm 2000, Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland) and a potentiometer. Each specimen was placed in a test tube containing 1 cc of perchloric acid (0.5 M HClO<sub>4</sub>) and removed after 30 seconds. Then, the enamel surfaces were washed with 2 cc of 0.2 M KOH. All these procedures were carried out in a test tube with 2 mL of the above-mentioned solution to obtain 3 mL of biopsy solution. For fluoride measurement, EDTA was added to the solution until the pH reached 5.2. Standard electrode of the potentiometer and fluoride electrode were inserted into the solution to find the electric potential difference. This value was placed in the linear equation obtained from the graph of the electric potential difference versus concentration in order to determine the concentration of fluoride in the specimens.</p><p>ANOVA and post hoc tests were used for data analysis treating the control measurements as covariates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">

However, despite the widespread use of diode laser in dentistry, its beneficial effects as an adjunct to topical fluoridation have yet to be completely understood [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The method used to measure fluoride uptake in the current study was based on studies that evaluated fluoride uptake following the application of several topical fluoridated products in vitro [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that in the above-mentioned studies, there were variables that were difficult to control, such as differences in tooth structure and composition. Confounding factors such as place of birth, place of residence, amount of fluoride in drinking water and proper nutritional habits can affect the results. In the current study it was impossible to control for all these variables. Thus, the teeth in each group were divided into two buccal and lingual halves. Studies have shown that buccal and lingual tooth halves are similar with regard to the pretreatment fluoride concentration [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This method decreases the error due to variable pre-treatment fluoride concentrations in different human teeth [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the treatment protocol that includes a combination of laser irradiation and fluoride therapy, the exact mechanism of fluoride absorption by the enamel is not clear. Two mechanisms have been suggested: 1. Increase in penetration and uptake of fluoride by the enamel due to the heat generated by laser treatment [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and 2). Retention of fluoride in the enamel surface porosities and micro-cracks caused by laser irradiation [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Of the two mechanisms, the thermal effect is more important in increasing fluoride uptake by the enamel surface. High temperature of the laser converts acid phosphate to carbonate pyrophosphate, which leads to enamel water loss. As the enamel crystals lose carbonate they become more stable and more resistant substances such as tetra-calcium diphosphate monoxide, alpha-tricalcium phosphate and beta-tricalcium phosphate may form, which lead to obstruction of interprismatic spaces and low permeability [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Some studies have found elevated concentrations of fluoride and hardness of enamel after laser treatment [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] attributed to an increase in the amount of fluoride loosely bonded to the enamel surface (calcium fluoride) and strong coupling of fluoride with the crystalline structure of enamel (fluorapatite). Both types of fluoride can be released during the acidic attack to tooth structure and will facilitate remineralization and inhibit demineralization [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>According to Chin-Ying et al, laser treatment can increase fluoride uptake by loose binding rather than strong coupling; however, the difference was not statistically significant [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, the authors concluded that the beneficial effects of combined use of laser and fluoride in vivo were less than those in vitro, due to the reduction in fluoride topically applied on the enamel surface because of release and ion exchange with the surrounding tissue fluid, saliva or dental plaque [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, treatment with 5W and 7W diode laser in combination with NaF varnish increased fluoride uptake by the enamel of primary teeth compared to the control group. Although the mean fluoride concentration in the 7W laser group was more than in 5W laser group, this difference was not statistically significant. These results are similar to those of Villalba-Moreno et al, [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The lower mean fluoride concentration in 5W and 7W laser treatment groups in the study by Villalba-Moreno et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] compared to our study can be related to lower initial concentration of fluoride in the specimens, because their dental specimens were prepared from impacted third molars that were not exposed to the oral environment and therefore did not have the ability to absorb fluoride topically over time. Our study specimens were primary molar teeth, which had the opportunity to absorb fluoride topically from various sources. Moreover, the concentration of the fluoride varnish applied by Villalba-Moreno et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (1% NaF) was lower than that used in our study (5% NaF). Also, we used a stronger acid, i.e. perchloric acid versus chloridric acid in the study by Villalba-Moreno et al, [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which causes greater solubility of calcium fluoride in the enamel surface. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations in the study by Villalba-Moreno et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] showed changes in the enamel surface due to 5W and 7W diode laser irradiation, which strongly confirms the efficacy of diode laser combined with topical fluoride treatment. In their study, enamel surface after laser application was free of cracks and grooves [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while changes are observed in the enamel surface following treatment with other types of lasers [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, further studies are recommended. In our study, the group treated with CO<sub>2</sub> laser and fluoride had a significantly higher fluoride uptake by the enamel than the control group.</p><p>Although the mean fluoride concentration in 2W laser group was greater than in 1W laser group, this difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>These findings were also demonstrated by Tepper et al, [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Chin-Ying et al, [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; although they reported higher amounts of fluoride uptake by their specimens. This difference can be justified by the use of CO<sub>2</sub> laser in pulse mode with lower power in our study compared to the continuous mode in their study, which results in lower heat generation and less adverse effects on the enamel [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The increase in fluoride uptake by both groups of 1W and 2W CO<sub>2</sub> laser was significantly higher than that in 5W diode laser; but a significant difference was seen only between the 2W CO<sub>2</sub> laser and 7W diode laser. Thus, given the absence of a significant difference between the 1W CO2 laser and 7W diode laser, it can be stated that the effect of both 1W CO2 laser and 7W diode laser on fluoride uptake was the same. Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al. reported similar results [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Microscopic examination in their study showed that increase in fluoride uptake with 2W CO<sub>2</sub> laser was not possible without morphological damage to the enamel structure [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Specimens treated with 1W CO<sub>2</sub> laser showed changes in almost all laser-irradiated surfaces but without any cracks. No change in enamel surface was seen following application of 5W diode laser; however, morphological changes and detachment of small areas with 7W laser occurred. CO<sub>2</sub> laser wavelength has higher absorption coefficient by the enamel surfaces compared to diode laser; thus, it may have more significant effects on the surface even in lower powers.</p><p>Therefore, they concluded that the fracture and detachment zones are seen more frequently following the application of 2W CO<sub>2</sub> laser compared to 7W diode laser. These defects are caused by the steam released from the enamel organic matrix due to heat generation following laser treatment. It should be noted that the use of diode laser has advantages such as low cost, portability and easy use and that it is a fiber laser (compared to CO<sub>2</sub> laser), which facilitates its use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The simultaneous use of fluoride and laser in all four groups significantly increased fluoride uptake by the primary enamel compared to fluoride treatment alone.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Treatments with 1W CO<sub>2</sub> laser and 7W diode laser were equally effective with regard to fluoride uptake.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Given that the safety of 7W diode laser is confirmed in future studies, it may be suitable for use as an adjunct to fluoride therapy.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1-</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
