This study investigates how one weekly hour of strength training for the neck and shoulder muscles is most effectively distributed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 447 office workers with and without neck and/or shoulder pain were randomly allocated at the cluster-level to one of four groups; 1&#x000d7;60 (1WS), 3&#x000d7;20 (3WS) or 9&#x000d7;7 (9WS) min a week of supervised high-intensity strength training for 20 weeks, or to a reference group without training (REF). Primary outcome was self-reported neck and shoulder pain (scale 0&#x02013;9) and secondary outcome work disability (Disability in Arms, Shoulders and Hands (DASH)).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The intention-to-treat analysis showed reduced neck and right shoulder pain in the training groups after 20 weeks compared with REF. Among those with pain &#x02265;3 at baseline (n=256), all three training groups achieved significant reduction in neck pain compared with REF (p&#x0003c;0.01). From a baseline pain rating of 3.2 (SD 2.3) in the neck among neck cases, 1WS experienced a reduction of 1.14 (95% CI 0.17 to 2.10), 3WS 1.88 (0.90 to 2.87) and 9WS 1.35 (0.24 to 2.46) which is considered clinically significant. DASH was reduced in 1WS and 3WS only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>One hour of specific strength training effectively reduced neck and shoulder pain in office workers. Although the three contrasting training groups showed no statistical differences in neck pain reduction, only 1WS and 3WS reduced DASH. This study suggests some flexibility regarding time-wise distribution when implementing specific strength training at the workplace.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physical exercise reduces the morbidity and disability from many diseases and disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Neck pain is frequent in the working-age population and increases the risk for long-term sickness absence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> One mode of physical exercise that has shown great promise in this regard is specific strength training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> A Finnish study showed a &#x0223c;70% reduction of neck pain in response to a 1-year strength-training regime,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and women with trapezius myalgia achieved a &#x0223c;80% reduction in neck pain after 10 weeks of intensive muscle-specific strength training consisting of dumbbell exercises performed 3&#x000d7;20 min a week.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> As little as 2 min of daily strength training have also provided modest benefits in adult office workers with frequent neck/shoulder pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Altogether, many studies have shown good efficacy on neck pain from strength training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Although different strength-training protocols appears to work, the optimal frequency and duration of strength training for effective management of neck pain remain unknown. Furthermore, for physical exercise to be feasible in a workplace setting, the exercise should be easy to implement in the daily routines as this has a marked effect on training adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> At some companies, a few long training sessions each week may be most suitable, whereas at other companies, several short bouts of exercise may be more feasible. Physiologically, longer and more fatiguing sessions may lead to a higher tissue turnover and thus muscle hypertrophy than shorter sessions. By contrast, shorter and less fatiguing sessions may lead to higher average training intensities and thus neural adaptations resulting in increased strength gains.</p><p>The general strength-training literature may provide further insight to the effects of different training programmes for neck pain. A meta-analysis &#x02013; based on 177 resistance training studies &#x02013; showed that three training days per week is optimal for efficient strength gains in untrained healthy adults without musculoskeletal disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> In a workplace setting, adherence to exercise programmes is challenging,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> thus balancing the optimal physiological recommendations with practical solutions is necessary. In weight loss programmes, adherence is higher in multiple short sessions of exercise as opposed to fewer and longer sessions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Similarly, integration of short bouts of physical activity into organisational routine may be more feasible in a workplace setting than long exhausting training sessions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></p><p>The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of three different time-wise combinations of strength-training programmes, all with a total of 1 h per week on non-specific neck and shoulder pain among office workers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled trial was performed in Denmark from January to June 2010. The participants were recruited from 12 geographically different units located in major cities throughout Denmark and were cluster randomised into five groups. The recruitment and cluster randomisation procedure is described in an open-access protocol elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> The 1WS group trained for 1 h once a week, the 3WS group trained 20 min three times a week and the 9WS group trained 7 min nine times a week.

The fifth group 3MS trained with minimal supervision and is not included in the present paper but in a paper testing the relevance of training supervision for safe and effective training. In the present paper, we tested the hypothesis: &#x02018;there is no difference between the groups 1WS, 3WS, 9WS and REF for the change in neck/shoulder pain from baseline to week 20&#x02019;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Number of participants in each group: 1WS=116, 3WS=126, 9WS=106 and REF=101.

Although a direct comparison between studies is difficult due to methodological differences, the marked pain reduction in our study is only surpassed with 79% reduction over 10 weeks by Andersen <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> who used a similar training protocol in women with trapezius myalgia, and 69% in clinical neck-pain patients over 1 year period by Ylinen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></p><p>As a novel finding, our study shows that the three time-wise distributions of the strength-training programme were not significantly different in reducing pain. However, as 3WS showed numerically higher pain reduction in both neck and shoulder pain cases as well as in the entire cohort, we cannot rule out a statistical type 2 error. Further, 1WS had lower adherence than 3WS and 9WS which indicates difficulties in fitting long sessions into the organisational routine. However, 9WS had a slower increase in training load progression and may thus be physiologically suboptimal for novice trainees.</p><p>Our analysis showed that there was positive correlation between change in neck pain and pain in either shoulder in accordance with previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Chronic pain can lead to central sensitisation and referred pain in areas adjacent to the actual painful muscle,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> but the influence of these factors in the rehabilitation process &#x02013; that is, pain reduction during the 20-week training programme &#x02013; is unknown. For shoulder-pain cases among completers, there were only slight differences between which interventions were most effective for the different outcomes.</p><p>In relation to DASH, 3WS provided the largest effect size with 9WS being generally less effective across the groups in the analyses. Thus, to improve the DASH, score training sessions may have to exceed some critical volume or level of muscle fatigue, for example, at least 20 min per training session.</p><p>To our knowledge, no previous high-quality intervention studies have compared effects of different time-wise distributions of a fixed 1 h per week strength-training programme with equal volume. Most training studies in relation to neck pain have used three weekly sessions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> One recent study used five short weekly sessions, but as they used just one exercise and low training volume, comparison to previous studies is difficult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Regular training is important for optimal results regardless of the training programme. Rhea <italic>et al</italic> concluded in a meta-analysis on untrained healthy adults that maximum strength gains were obtained using three weekly strength-training sessions. This also applies to older women, that is, age seems to be of minor importance for relative strength gains.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> However, pain relief and strength gain may occur through different physiological mechanisms in different groups and optimal training frequency may therefore be different.</p><p>Even though the training frequency and duration of training sessions is roughly similar in most of the studies, training adherence varies widely. Some studies have had high training attendance: 87% (10 weeks),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> 85% (20 weeks),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> 80% (10 weeks),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> some had medium attendance: 60% (10 weeks),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> 57% (52 weeks)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> and some had low training attendance: 39% (12 weeks)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> and 31% (12 weeks).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In our study, the average training adherence was medium with 66% attendance over the 20 weeks. Although recruitment, screening and training procedures in this study were similar to those used by Zebis <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> training adherence was different between the two studies &#x02013; probably due to differences in the participating companies and the circumstances under which they worked. Thus, to effectively implement training at workplaces, fitting the training sessions into the organisational routine in a flexible manner is important. Our study suggests that several combinations of a total of 1 h of strength training per week are effective for pain reduction. This implies a large degree of flexibility for companies and employees regarding time distribution when implementing specific strength training into a weekly schedule.</p><p>In healthy novice trainees, loads are often doubled during the initial months of training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Our study elaborates on these previous findings by showing that individuals with and without pain experience similar progression in training loads, that is, pain at baseline did not significantly halt progression in training loads. The strength-training protocol in our study was based on best-practice experience with neck'shoulder training combined with knowledge from resistance training studies in healthy individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> We induced a progressive overload by periodising exercise intensity and total repetitions performed, because systematic variation of volume and intensity is effective for long-term progression in rehabilitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> This systematic variation allowed the training stimulus to remain challenging and effective throughout the 20-week period.</p><sec id="s19"><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>As our study included both men and women from 12 geographically different units located throughout the country, the generalisability to office workers in general is high. The cluster randomisation protected against contamination between groups and provided a real-world setting where colleagues had the opportunity to do the same training programme together. However, a limitation is that not all participants replied to the follow-up questionnaire. Importantly, completers and non completers were similar in all but one of the baseline characteristics, suggesting that completers were representative of the total study population. Although statistically non significant, the 9WS group had a numerically higher dropout than the other groups, but as the dropouts have not answered the follow-up questionnaire, we can only speculate about this. One reason could be that with nine weekly sessions, some of the participants in the 9WS group may have experienced that having to schedule in the short sessions twice a day to be a burden.</p><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>What this study adds</title></caption><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x025b6;</label><p>Strength training for a total of 1 h per week effectively reduces neck and shoulder pain in office workers.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b6;</label><p>Combinations of 1&#x000d7;60, 3&#x000d7;20 and 9&#x000d7;7 min per week all provide benefits in terms of pain reduction.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b6;</label><p>Fewer and longer sessions provide larger strength gains than more frequent and shorter ones.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><p>We imputed missing values by adding the natural seasonal change in pain and DASH score to the baseline value.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> However, all types of imputation have limitations.

Overall, three weekly sessions provided the most positive effects, but as long as it is manageable for the participants to adhere to, a single long session can also be effective. This implies some degree of flexibility for companies and employees regarding time-wise distribution when incorporating specific strength training in an effective manner into a weekly work schedule.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Klaus Hansen for assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CHA: data collection, manuscript.
