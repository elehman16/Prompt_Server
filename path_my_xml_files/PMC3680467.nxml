Previous studies have suggested that their emergence may be explained by disturbances in prediction error-dependent learning. Here we set up complementary studies in order to examine whether such a disturbance also modulates memory reconsolidation and hence explains their remarkable persistence. First, we quantified individual brain responses to prediction error in a causal learning task in 18 human subjects (8 female). Next, a placebo-controlled within-subjects study of the impact of ketamine was set up on the same individuals. We determined the influence of this NMDA receptor antagonist (previously shown to induce aberrant prediction error signal and lead to transient alterations in perception and belief) on the evolution of a fear memory over a 72 hour period: they initially underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning; 24 hours later, during ketamine or placebo administration, the conditioned stimulus (CS) was presented once, without reinforcement; memory strength was then tested again 24 hours later. Re-presentation of the CS under ketamine led to a stronger subsequent memory than under placebo. Moreover, the degree of strengthening correlated with individual vulnerability to ketamine's psychotogenic effects and with prediction error brain signal. This finding was partially replicated in an independent sample with an appetitive learning procedure (in 8 human subjects, 4 female). These results suggest a link between altered prediction error, memory strength and psychosis. They point to a core disruption that may explain not only the emergence of delusional beliefs but also their persistence.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Wellcome Trust and the Bernard Wolfe Health Neuroscience fund.

It is driven by prediction error (PE) <xref rid="pone.0065088-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and there is evidence that altered PE signal drives the formation of delusions, the abnormal beliefs that characterise mental illnesses like schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Romaniuk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. PE represents the mismatch between what we expect in a given situation and what we experience <xref rid="pone.0065088-Rescorla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It guides learning directly; we form and strengthen explanatory associations (e.g. between causes and effects) by minimizing PE <xref rid="pone.0065088-Rescorla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, PE guides the allocation of attention <xref rid="pone.0065088-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; we attend to and learn about stimuli with unpredictable consequences. PE is represented in a range of neural structures and circuits, most notably the midbrain dopamine cells in area A10, the striatum and the prefrontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition to guiding learning about rewards, PEs are vital to social <xref rid="pone.0065088-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and perceptual learning <xref rid="pone.0065088-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> as well as the formation of causal beliefs <xref rid="pone.0065088-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Based on these normative observations, we have proposed <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett5" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> that, if PE signals occur inappropriately, individuals would attend to and learn about stimuli, thoughts and percepts that others would ignore. As a consequence, they would develop beliefs that do not reflect the contingencies of the real world &#x02013; delusions. There is growing evidence that this may be the case <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Romaniuk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>: people with delusions exhibit inappropriate prediction error signals whose magnitude correlates with delusion severity.</p><p>This model accounts for why delusions emerge but not for why they persist. We argue <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett5" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett7" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> that disturbed PE, as well as leading to erroneous updating of beliefs (and, hence, the emergence of delusional ideas) may also be critical in their persistence <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett5" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett7" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. While this may appear counter-intuitive, given that PE is associated with the flexible updating of learned expectations <xref rid="pone.0065088-Rescorla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, latterly it has been demonstrated that PE-driven memory reconsolidation can strengthen memories in the absence of reinforcement: specifically, the surprising re-presentation of a retrieval cue can strengthen a memory <xref rid="pone.0065088-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Reconsolidation occurs when memories are recalled into a labile state, integrated with new information, and consolidated once more <xref rid="pone.0065088-Misanin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Nader1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This process depends on PE <xref rid="pone.0065088-Pedreira1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, that is, surprising information returns related memories into a labile state <xref rid="pone.0065088-Sevenster1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Two competing processes are evoked <xref rid="pone.0065088-Eisenhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>: on the one hand, there is extinction initiated by a negative PE signal, engendering competing learning <xref rid="pone.0065088-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> that overrides the original memory <xref rid="pone.0065088-Bouton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Extinction memories involve new learning, not simply forgetting of the old representation (as demonstrated by the fact that memories of the reinforced situation can recur spontaneously in rats and humans <xref rid="pone.0065088-Bouton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Bouton2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). Negative PE signals guide this new learning <xref rid="pone.0065088-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. On the other hand, the positive PE response to predictive cues <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schultz2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schultz3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> engages an expectation of reinforcement and leads to the reminder-based strengthening of the belief <xref rid="pone.0065088-Eisenhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The precise balance between these processes is driven by the magnitude, sign and timing of the accompanying PE signal <xref rid="pone.0065088-Pedreira1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Given the growing evidence that the psychotic state is associated with aberrant PE <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schlagenhauf1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, we have suggested that this extinction-reconsolidation balance may be fundamentally altered in delusions <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett6" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. That is, altered PE signal leads patients to attend to and learn about events that healthy individuals would ignore <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett6" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett8" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This accounts for the emergence of delusions, which form as explanatory schemes <xref rid="pone.0065088-Kapur1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. But the same disturbance means that the delusion will be frequently reactivated, employed to explain subsequent experiences <xref rid="pone.0065088-Jaspers1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and strengthened once more <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett5" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett6" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Mishara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This strengthening may share a cognitive basis with the <italic>illusory truth effect</italic>, whereby judging the veracity of a statement enhances later belief in its truth <xref rid="pone.0065088-Begg1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Patients with delusions are more susceptible to the illusory truth effect, particularly for judgments related to their delusions <xref rid="pone.0065088-Moritz1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We hypothesise that in psychosis, aberrant PE signal encourages inappropriate memory strengthening and delusion fixity, relative to extinction <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett6" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>In short, we suggest that the same disturbance in PE may account for both the emergence and the persistence of delusions.</p><p>We tested this hypothesis using a drug model of psychosis <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett9" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Honey1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In a previously published fMRI study, we quantified individual neural responses to PE <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett10" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The same participants were recruited to a placebo-controlled ketamine study, in which we assayed the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine as well as its impact upon the re-presentation of an aversive CS conditioned 24 hours previously (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065088-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We initially chose aversive learning and memory reconsolidation because, of the few reconsolidation studies in human subjects <xref rid="pone.0065088-Sevenster1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Kindt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Agren1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, none have previously examined appetitive memory. We hypothesized that, since ketamine engenders aberrant PE signal in response to unsurprising events <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett9" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, it should induce reactivation and strengthening of memories, and this effect should be directly relatable to individual variability in PE signal, measured using fMRI, as well as to the severity of ketamine-induced symptoms. Given that it could be argued that any effect of ketamine could be attributed to generalization of the unpleasant psychotomimetic experience to the reactivated cue, we conducted a follow-up behavioral study of appetitive conditioning (Study 2) in which an independent sample of subjects.</p><fig id="pone-0065088-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0065088.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study Design.</title><p>
<italic>A. Task Design.</italic> Target and control conditions for the food-allergy causal learning tasks. Subjects see that <italic>bananas</italic> cause an allergy in their patient. Subsequently they see that <italic>bananas</italic> and <italic>mushrooms</italic> cause the allergy. Their prior learning about bananas should block new learning about the mushrooms. In the final phase of training, subjects see the mushrooms causing the allergy; this violates any blocking that took place in the previous Stage. Blocking trials are compared to control events that are matched for the presence of allergy as well as novelty and familiarity (<italic>Avocado and Chilies</italic>). Likewise, at Stage 3, there are trials matched for novelty and familiarity that act as comparators for the blocking violation events. The figure depicts key trial types. Filler cues were also presented to control for the relative frequency of allergic reactions. Each trial type was presented 10 times for Stage 1 and 6 times for Stages 2 and 3 with the caveat that no trial type was repeated before all trial types had been presented. <italic>B. Trial Design.</italic> On each trial, subjects saw a meal that their patient had eaten for 3 seconds. During this time, they made a prediction response &#x02013; pushing one button to predict an allergy and another to predict no allergy. They also held the button down for longer the more confident they were that they were making the right choice. Next they were shown the effect of that meal on their patient. If he suffered an allergy, they would see the words <italic>Allergic Reaction</italic> in red letters with a jagged border for 1 second. If there was no allergy, subjects saw the words <italic>No Allergy</italic> in green letters with a green rectangle around it for one second. <italic>C. Memory Reactivation and Extinction Task.</italic> In a follow up placebo-controlled behavioral study of ketamine, the same subjects from the scanning study attended the laboratory on three consecutive days twice (separated by at least one month). On Day 1, they learned that one visual stimulus predicted the delivery of a 90dB loud noise with 70% contingency and another cue never predicted load noise. The following day (Day 2) they saw the noise predicting cue whilst receiving an infusion of either ketamine or placebo. The next day (Day 3) they returned to the lab and observed the cues again in extinction. After 30 trials of extinction, they were reminded of the loud noise once more and observed a further five repetitions of each cue in extinction. We tracked skin conductance responses to the cues on Day 1 and Day 3. The subjects returned to repeat the procedure with different cues and received the other infusion the second time around.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0065088.g001"/></fig><p>We carried out two studies: Study 1, in which we relate PE brain responses, Ketamine-induced psychopathology and ketamine effects on aversive memory reconsolidation, and Study 2, in which we examine ketamine effects on reactivated appetitive memories in a separate cohort of subjects. To be clear, the fMRI study (Study 1a) was not set up to characterize the neural correlates of memory reactivation or reconsolidation <xref rid="pone.0065088-Agren1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schwabe1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Rather it was conducted to capture individual differences in PE brain response. Those individual differences then formed the basis for exploring how variability in PE relates to the effects of ketamine on memory reconsolidation and the genesis of psychosis-like symptoms (Study 1b). A relationship between the neural marker for PE and reconsolidation across our studies would constitute evidence in favor of our hypothesis: PE disturbance is key to the formation and maintenance of delusions <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett6" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Individuals showing weaker blocking have &#x0201c;inappropriate&#x0201d; PE, driving them to attend to and learn about the redundant blocked cue. This learning was captured behaviorally (the degree to which subjects made confident predictions about the blocked cue) and neurally (the magnitude of brain surprise response to trials that violate blocking). That is, subjects with stronger blocking should be more surprised to see the blocked cue predicting a salient outcome, while those with weaker blocking should be less surprised. The present procedure has some similarities with the unblocking effect, previously demonstrated in rodent conditioning <xref rid="pone.0065088-Holland1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and human causal learning <xref rid="pone.0065088-LePelley1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and used recently in experimental animals to clarify the neural mechanisms of reward prediction and PE <xref rid="pone.0065088-McDannald1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

Furthermore, we assayed brain responses during blocking trials (compared with control events matched for novelty, familiarity and contingency with the outcome) as a further metric of aberrant PE &#x02013; those subjects who imbue the redundant blocked cue with causal significance ought to have responses in PE-related regions during blocking trials &#x02013; providing a neural metric of their aberrant PE at the time of the redundant trials.</p><p>We used an established causal learning approach, in which learned expectations are violated to produce a prediction error <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

In brief, the key trials in Stage 1, <italic>Learning</italic>, comprised of single foods that caused or did not cause the allergy. There were also meals presented in this stage, which comprised of two different foods and were employed as fillers such that subjects were not surprised by the appearance of meals of two foods during the subsequent blocking phase. In the <italic>Blocking</italic> phase, single items from Stage 1 were paired with novel food items. Having previously learned that a food from Stage 1 caused the allergy should block new learning to the novel food. Two separate blocking contingencies were presented, represented by different foods. In the blocking control condition, which served as a comparator in our imaging analysis (see below) a food that previously predicted no allergy was paired with a novel food and this compound caused the allergic reaction. In the final <italic>Violation</italic> phase, one blocked cue was shown causing the allergic reaction; responses to this cue were compared with those to the novel blocking control food leading to the allergic reaction (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065088-g001">Figure 1</xref> for more information). In order to control for novelty, familiarity and contingency reversal, one of the cues subjected to blocking at Stage 2 was presented causing no allergy. Other filler cues were presented to balance for the presence and absence of an allergic reaction, across trials involving single foods and compounds of two foods.

To this end, we planned a paired t-test on subjects' prediction confidence for the first trial of Stage 3 on which they see the blocked cue alone (mushrooms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065088-g001">Figure 1</xref>) compared with their initial prediction the first time they saw the blocking control cue alone (chilies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065088-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Mean predictive confidence ratings were calculated such that subjects' responses to the initial presentations of blocking and control cues for both contingencies (confirmed and violated) both contributed to the behavioral analysis. This was legitimate because up until this point (i.e., before subjects saw the outcome at the first trial of Stage 3), the novelty, familiarity and contingency with the outcome of these parallel causal contingencies were identical.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>fMRI Data Acquisition</title><p>We used a Siemens Trio scanner operating at 3 Tesla. 720 gradient echo T2*-weighted echo-planar images depicting blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast were acquired for each subject.

Images were realigned, spatially normalized to a standard template and spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (8 mm at full width half maximum). The time series in each session were high-pass filtered (to a maximum of 1/120 Hz) and serial autocorrelations were estimated using an AR(1) model. The average haemodynamic response to each event was designated at the presentation of the outcome. Trials were modeled using a canonical, synthetic haemodynamic response function used as a covariate in a general linear model. A parameter estimate was generated for each voxel for each event. Responses were parametrically modulated by the subjects' confidence in their prediction for that event. Individuals' contrast images, derived from the pair-wise comparisons between key events, were then entered into a second-level group analysis for each of the stages.

In order to limit our exposure to type-I error, we planned only to bring through the variables (of those 3) that were significantly impacted by ketamine to the regression analysis. We did not relate the reinstatement data to the neural or clinical data as they were gathered in order to confirm and inform upon any behavioral effects that we observed during extinction (i.e. whether or not we had modulated reconsolidation or blocked extinction).

During blocking trials, there was the expected <xref rid="pone.0065088-Waelti1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> overall suppression of BOLD response in regions previously shown to be sensitive to PE <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett9" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Fletcher2" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. When blocked cues were subsequently presented, group average predictive responses indicated that subjects had not learned to associate these cues with an outcome. Violation of that attenuated expectation was expressed neurally as a PE response in key frontostriatal regions <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Participants showing the lowest rPFC response during blocking trials showed the greatest subsequent behavioral evidence of blocking and the greatest subsequent neural &#x0201c;surprise&#x0201d; response when particular blocked cues proved unexpectedly to be predictors of an outcome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065088-g002">Figure 2</xref>). More importantly, as we discuss below, variations in PE responding predicted individual vulnerability to the subsequent experiential and mnemonic impact of ketamine.</p><p>We determined the influence of ketamine on reactivated memories. Re-presentation of a pre-trained aversive cue under ketamine compared to placebo was associated with elevated ratings of unpleasantness and GSR when these were tested the following day. Crucially, individuals showing aberrant PE in the fMRI study were more susceptible to these enhanced effects. We argue that this underlines the importance of aberrant PE and subsequent memory processing in the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms. Put simply, the failure of PFC to show an appropriate response to blocking (study 1a stage 2) and its ensuing violation (stage 3) are predictive of an enhanced vulnerability to the memory-altering effects of ketamine.</p><p>We considered the possibility that the strengthening of the reactivated cue occurred because the cue was associated with an aversive ketamine experience. However a similar (albeit weaker) effect in an appetitive conditioning in study 2 militates against this argument. For both aversive and appetitive reactivated cues, strength of responding (GSR and anticipatory sucking respectively) increased following ketamine. It is difficult to explain this observation in terms of attenuated extinction, since one would expect consistent responding from Day 1 to Day 3 for the ketamine reactivated cues and perhaps a decrease in responding for the placebo reactivated cue, which we did not observe.</p><p>It is perhaps surprising that ketamine (a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist with known amnestic effects <xref rid="pone.0065088-Fletcher3" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>) appears to enhance reactivated memories. Initial pre-clinical studies of pharmacological effects on reconsolidation have demonstrated that NMDA receptor antagonism impairs or prevents memory reconsolidation. Importantly, however, only one rodent study employed ketamine as the NMDA blocking agent that perturbed drug-memory reconsolidation <xref rid="pone.0065088-Zhai1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, others employ more potent NMDA receptor antagonists like MK-801 or PCP. The difference between our work and the rodent work may also have arisen because we are dealing with different response systems in human and rodent subjects <xref rid="pone.0065088-Hamm1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Weike1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Behavioral studies capture numerous measures of conditioning, ranging from subjective ratings, skin conductance measures and startle responses to conscious expectancies of subsequent outcomes. In the intact organism, these measures often cross-validate. However, in a reactivation-degradation procedure in human subjects, only some of these measures are disrupted whilst other remain intact <xref rid="pone.0065088-Soeter1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>: startle responses are degraded whereas measures related to conscious awareness are not. Electrodermal conditioning reflects anticipatory arousal <xref rid="pone.0065088-Lovibond1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Lovibond3" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref> and conscious awareness of contingent relationships seems critical for the expression of skin conductance responses <xref rid="pone.0065088-Lovibond1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Lovibond3" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. These measures were the focus of our present research and we did not record startle responses (perhaps more akin to freezing in pre-clinical models). Furthermore, in considering the fact that a ketamine-induced memory strengthening is counter-intuitive, it is notable that, ketamine, when used as an anesthetic in accident victims, may enhance PTSD symptoms <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schonenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, perhaps suggesting that aversive memories are enhanced, although this claim is controversial <xref rid="pone.0065088-McGhee1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Our data suggest that both appetitive and aversive memories may be enhanced, depending on what is brought to mind during the ketamine experience. This must give us pause for thought when we consider the increasing interest in using repeated ketamine as an anti-depressant.</p><p>Intriguingly, in Study 1b, subjective and objective measures of the strength of fear conditioning correlated with variability in different components of the PE circuit: variation in electrodermal response to a fear-cue reactivated under ketamine was correlated with aberrant prefrontal PE responding whereas variation in the lingering subjective arousal ratings of the fear-cue reactivated under ketamine correlated with aberrant striatal responding. These results are perhaps indicative of different roles for PE across different regions: striatal signals may compute predictive value or salience, whereas PFC PE may sculpt more complex global expectations <xref rid="pone.0065088-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. This distinction echoes that between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning <xref rid="pone.0065088-Daw2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Glascher1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. Both of these processes are driven by PE <xref rid="pone.0065088-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref> and may be important for symptom generation and maintenance <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett4" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett7" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These data provide preliminary support for our model; aberrant PE drives delusion formation by imbuing stimuli, thoughts and percepts with a salience that demands explanation. Such an explanation requires rumination and memory reconsolidation, strengthening it inappropriately such that it eventually becomes impervious to contradictory evidence <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett6" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Another important point to take into account is that, as well as blocking NMDA receptors, ketamine engenders glutamate release <xref rid="pone.0065088-Moghaddam1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, which may stimulate AMPA receptors <xref rid="pone.0065088-Moghaddam1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref> and engage intracellular signaling cascades that engender synaptogenesis <xref rid="pone.0065088-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. For example, ketamine increases prefrontal extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) <xref rid="pone.0065088-Duman1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>, a key regulator of the fate of reactivated memories <xref rid="pone.0065088-Duvarci1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Furthermore, memantine, an NMDA antagonist like ketamine, has been shown to facilitate aversive memory reconsolidation even when given two hours prior to memory reactivation in day-old chicks <xref rid="pone.0065088-Samartgis1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>.</p><p>Prior work has shown that ketamine increases cortical excitability <xref rid="pone.0065088-Hoffken1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>, increasing AMPA receptor stimulation <xref rid="pone.0065088-McNally1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation, which also increases cortical excitability, has been shown to enhance the strength of reactivated memories <xref rid="pone.0065088-Javadi1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Rodent work has confirmed the crucial role of AMPA receptor mobilization in this post-reactivation strengthening effect <xref rid="pone.0065088-RaoRuiz1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. Our own computational modeling work suggests that ketamine induces dis-inhibition of cortical microcircuits resulting in synaptic glutamate spillover <xref rid="pone.0065088-Murray2" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Anticevic1" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. In brain slices, this ketamine induced increase in glutamate release and EPSCs can be curtailed by propranolol <xref rid="pone.0065088-Narimatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>, the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been shown to degrade reactivated memories across species <xref rid="pone.0065088-Kindt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, the aberrant salience experiences and delusion-like ideas (that we presently relate to excessive PE driven memory reconsolidation) are ameliorated by lamotrigine, a drug that blocks presynaptic glutamate release and cortical excitability <xref rid="pone.0065088-Deakin1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest that ketamine-induced psychosis results from excessive glutamate release which engages aberrant prediction errors and hence excessive memory strengthening (even if those memories are false).</p><p>We should consider the possibility that ketamine is having a primary and deleterious effect on extinction, a pathophysiological process implicated in spontaneous confabulation, another delusion-like phenomenon <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schnider1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Schnider2" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>, akin to the phenomenology of some ketamine experiences <xref rid="pone.0065088-Corlett4" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Indeed, extinction learning fails to consolidate in patients with schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0065088-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>. While this is a reasonable consideration, a number of aspects of the experimental design and findings do not support this explanation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065088-g009">Figure 9</xref>). First, day 1 entailed partial reinforcement and reactivation involved a brief single presentation of the conditioned stimulus. Both would shift the balance towards reconsolidation rather than extinction <xref rid="pone.0065088-Pedreira1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065088-Eisenhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Second, there was no sign of an extinction effect for the placebo reactivation condition and, if anything, the cue appeared to exert a stronger effect at the beginning of the post-reactivation session (day 3) than it did at the end of learning on the pre-reactivation session (day 1), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065088-g009">Figure 9</xref>. In short, a simple explanation of these findings in terms of an attenuation of extinction is unlikely.</p><fig id="pone-0065088-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0065088.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Memory Strengthening or Extinction Failure?</title><p>

It is notable that such delusional false memories can occur following long-term anesthesia that blocks NMDA receptors [106]. The present data raise the intriguing possibility that patients with schizophrenia rely on non-NMDA mediated forms of synaptic plasticity to represent their world. These learning mechanisms may produce less veridical but more robust representations hence the bizarreness and persistence of psychosis.</p><p>There are important caveats to the inferences we draw from these data and clearly, they warrant various follow-up studies. To begin with, the imaging effects we report are of small magnitude and the sample sizes, particularly in study 2, are small. Furthermore, future studies should include a non-reactivated control condition, which we included in study 2 but not study 1. It will be important to characterize PE and reconsolidation in patients with fixed delusions since an important difference from ketamine is that, though the latter induces psychotic percepts and delusion-like ideas, most subjects retain insight (although not always <xref rid="pone.0065088-PomarolClotet1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>). It would also be useful in future studies to examine the relationship between appetitive conditioning to primary reward and our causal learning PE signal and important, too, to assay the degree of arousal subjects report in future appetitive studies, since this was the dimension modulated by ketamine and related to striatal PE signal. Preclinical studies are underway in order to replicate and interrogate this strengthening effect of ketamine and its possible synaptic mechanisms. A more invasive approach will permit investigation at the synaptic level and circumvent the necessarily correlational approach adopted presently. Of course, correlation is not causation but it is a crucial first step in demonstrating that processes (in this case, PE, memory reconsolidation and delusions) are related <xref rid="pone.0065088-Kiekkas1" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref> through shared variation with individual differences in neural PE signal <xref rid="pone.0065088-Kosslyn1" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>.</p><p>Overall, while we can only speculate on the precise underlying mechanisms, the key observation here is that the same manipulation that can render an individual vulnerable to delusion-like ideas may also lead to memory persistence. These data are consistent with a theoretical model of delusions in which aberrations of a fundamental learning process, PE, can profoundly and persistently affect an individual's world view. Thus data thus provide an empirical basis for a mechanistic understanding of what has for a long time been considered &#x02018;<italic>ununderstandable</italic>&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0065088-Jaspers1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>: the delusions that attend serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia.
