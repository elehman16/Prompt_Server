Both these mechanisms may modify lipoprotein and fatty acid metabolism after dietary intervention. Our objective was to investigate how dietary MCFA and linoleic acid supplementation and body fat distribution affect the fasting lipoprotein subclass profile, lipoprotein kinetics, and postprandial fatty acid kinetics. In a randomized double blind cross-over trial, 12 male subjects (age 51&#x000b1;7 years; BMI 28.5&#x000b1;0.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), were divided into 2 groups according to waist-hip ratio. They were supplemented with 60 grams/day MCFA (mainly C8:0, C10:0) or linoleic acid for three weeks, with a wash-out period of six weeks in between. Lipoprotein subclasses were measured using HPLC. Lipoprotein and fatty acid metabolism were studied using a combination of several stable isotope tracers. Lipoprotein and tracer data were analyzed using computational modeling. Lipoprotein subclass concentrations in the VLDL and LDL range were significantly higher after MCFA than after linoleic acid intervention. In addition, LDL subclass concentrations were higher in lower body obese individuals. Differences in VLDL metabolism were found to occur in lipoprotein lipolysis and uptake, not production; MCFAs were elongated intensively, in contrast to linoleic acid. Dietary MCFA supplementation led to a less favorable lipoprotein profile than linoleic acid supplementation. These differences were not due to elevated VLDL production, but rather to lower lipolysis and uptake rates.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by Dutch government through grant &#x02018;Healthy Nutrition&#x02019;(grant number 04003).

Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), being eight to ten carbon atoms long, are used as dietary supplements in weight-loss programs, since they were frequently found to lead to greater weight loss than dietary long-chain fatty acids <xref rid="pone.0100376-StOnge1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, MCFAs were frequently found to increase fasting plasma cholesterol and triglycerides in comparison with long-chain triglycerides <xref rid="pone.0100376-Marten1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), which is found in several vegetable oils, can be used for cholesterol lowering when used in considerable quantities <xref rid="pone.0100376-Horrobin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Dietary MCFA and linoleic acid undergo processing via distinct metabolic routes. MCFA, after being absorbed by the intestine, is mostly transported through the portal vein to the liver as free fatty acid. In the liver it is packaged in VLDL lipoproteins and distributed further to other target organs <xref rid="pone.0100376-Marten1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. On the other hand, linoleic acid is generally packaged in large chylomicron particles in the intestine; from there it proceeds directly through the blood to any target organ <xref rid="pone.0100376-Bach1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore both the role of the liver in the metabolic route and the type of particle used for transport are different for the two types of fatty acid.</p><p>Next to chylomicrons and VLDL, lipoprotein classes include the successively smaller and denser IDL, LDL and HDL particles. The VLDL particles that the liver produces are delipidated by extrahepatic tissues in a process called lipolysis. This process progressively diminishes the particle's size, which first become smaller VLDL, then IDL and finally LDL particles <xref rid="pone.0100376-vanSchalkwijk1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The LDL particles have little triglyceride left, they mainly contain cholesterol and also HDL particles' core mainly consist of cholesterol <xref rid="pone.0100376-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. So although the role of LDL and HDL in fatty acid metabolism is limited, LDL may be a rest product of an upregulated VLDL production. Because MCFA are transported from the intestine to the liver directly and are there packaged into VLDL, it is intuitive to expect that VLDL production is upregulated when MCFA is supplemented in the diet. Since linoleic acid does not necessarily pass the liver before being transported to other tissues, supplementing the diet with this fatty acid is not expected to upregulate VLDL production in the liver much. According to this mechanism, MCFA supplementation is therefore hypothesized to result in higher rates of VLDL production than linoleic acid supplementation.</p><p>The second mechanism that is able to affect lipoproteins is PPAR-activation by linoleic acid <xref rid="pone.0100376-Forman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0100376-Kliewer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Fibrates, also PPAR activators, are known to increase LPL lipolysis and increase liver uptake of LDL particles <xref rid="pone.0100376-Staels1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100376-Bilz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The response to fibrates is heterogeneous and depends on the dyslipidemic state of the subject <xref rid="pone.0100376-vanBochove1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100376-Ginsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is therefore interesting to see which of the two mechanisms, upregulated VLDL production after MCFA supplementation or upregulated VLDL lipolysis and uptake after linoleic acid supplementation, are the strongest determinant for the difference in blood lipids after these two interventions.</p><p>Dietary fatty acids, transported by lipoproteins, reach various types of tissue. The tissue that eventually stores the fat is relevant, since subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue have different metabolic activities and have different implications for cardiovascular disease risk; visceral adipose tissue is thought to confer most risk (see e.g. <xref rid="pone.0100376-Lear1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). As a crude measure of this risk, either the waist-hip ratio (WHR) or the waist circumference are often used <xref rid="pone.0100376-Huxley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we investigated how dietary fatty acids and body fat distribution affect lipoprotein metabolism. More specifically, we studied how dietary MCFA and linoleic acid supplementation and body fat distribution affect the fasting lipoprotein subclass profile, lipoprotein kinetics, and postprandial fatty acid kinetics. For this purpose we conducted a randomized double blind cross-over trial. We were especially interested to see which of the metabolic processes affecting VLDL was important for the expected difference in VLDL concentration between MCFA and linoleic acid supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tilburg (METOPP) (April 18, 2007) and conducted according to the current assembly (52nd) of the Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000) and the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH Topic E6, adopted 01-05-1996 and implemented 17-01-1997).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>The study was conducted at TNO, where subjects were recruited from a pool of volunteers.

The two dietary interventions consisted of consumption of a spread containing predominantly long chain fatty acids (71% long-chain fatty acids (mainly C18:2), 28% C16:0 and 1% fatty acids shorter than C16) and consumption of a spread containing predominantly medium chain fatty acids (65% C8:0 and C10:0, 29% C16:0 and 6% fatty acids longer than C18). In both spreads a similar percentage palmitic acid (C16:0: 28&#x02013;29%) was present, necessary to make a margarine spreadable.</p><p>The treatments were given in random order. Randomization was restricted for age, BMI and WHR, resulting in a homogeneous distribution of these parameters among treatments. During the start of the intervention period subjects consumed 30 grams of test spread daily to become habituated to the fatty acids; during the rest of the study subjects consumed 60 grams of the spread daily for 2.5 weeks. The test spread replaced their normal spread and oil use. Two portions of 30 grams of spread were consumed, one with each main meal. With the test spread provided, about 50% of the daily fat intake was of experimental origin. Compliance with the spread consumption prescription was closely monitored throughout the study. Of the 960 spread consumption moments in the study only 12 consumptions were forgotten, therefore compliance was very good (98.8%).</p><p>On average <xref rid="pone.0100376-Kistemaker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> the male population in the studied age group consumes in total about 105 grams of fat daily, distributed as follows: about 11 grams of fat is consumed with breakfast, 26 grams with lunch, 42 grams with dinner and 26 grams with snacks. Subjects used the provided spreads with breakfast and lunch and were allowed to use some with their dinner. Assuming that the average amounts of fat consumed with dinner and snacks did not change, we may expect that on an average, fat intake may have been increased with about 20 grams daily.During the complete study period (84 days) no changes were seen in body weight or waist and hip circumferences. Also, the six weeks wash-out in-between both test periods did not affect these main characteristics of the study population.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Standardized diet and meals</title><p>On day 20 and day 62 (day before test day) subjects ate a standardized evening dinner at home.

It was assumed that no dilution of hepatic L-leucine by unlabeled sources (e.g., protein degradation) took place. In other words, only the apoB synthesis from plasma leucine was considered. Free plasma leucine was modeled as a four-compartment catenary system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100376-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Compartment 2 is an intracellular compartment from which the leucine is transferred into the liver's apoB synthetic machinery. The transfer coefficients between compartments 1 and 2 are equal, giving equilibrium.

Overall, this analysis indicates that through combining Particle Profiler and compartmental modeling approaches, we see that treatment differences in the VLDL lipoprotein profile are due to LPL lipolysis and uptake rather than to production.

In the lipoprotein profiles, we saw higher plasma cholesterol after MCFA supplementation than after linoleic acid supplementation, for nearly all VLDL, IDL and LDL subfractions.

Our observation that the lower cholesterol concentrations after linoleic acid supplementation can be attributed to changes in a large number of subfractions in the particle size range from VLDL through LDL is therefore new. However, we can compare the total cholesterol response. This response correspond well with that found by Asakura et al <xref rid="pone.0100376-Asakura1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> who saw a higher fasting total cholesterol after adding MCT (medium-chain triglycerides) to the diet in various proportions for six weeks, than after four weeks of corn oil diet which contains 49% C18:2.

The first are the metabolic transformations that MCFAs undergo in the liver before being released into the plasma: the active chain elongation process after dietary MCFA supplementation. This process might slow VLDL production. Secondly, studies in chicken primary hepatocites have shown that MCFAs can downregulate apoB expression, decreasing VLDL production <xref rid="pone.0100376-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100376-Tachibana1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. So chain elongation and downregulated apoB expression may help to explain the lack of difference in VLDL production between the two treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>VLDL lipolysis and uptake</title><p>In this study we observed a higher particle lipolysis and uptake rate after linoleic acid supplementation versus MCFA supplementation. A direct comparison of these two diets in the Zucker rat, showed a lower LPL activation in the gonodal fat pad after an MCFA diet <xref rid="pone.0100376-Turkenkopf1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>; this observation is in concordance with our result. Thomas <xref rid="pone.0100376-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> saw no difference in LPL activity in humans, after a single dietary challenge, but single dietary challenge is not comparable with our longer term study. No other direct comparison is available to our knowledge. So the higher lipoprotein lipolysis and uptake rate after linoleic acid supplementation versus MCFA supplementation is consistent with observations in animals.</p><p>The observed difference in lipoprotein lipolysis and uptake can possibly be explained through PPAR-activation by linoleic acid <xref rid="pone.0100376-Forman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0100376-Kliewer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As mentioned in the introduction, PPAR activators are known to increase LPL lipolysis and increase liver uptake of LDL particles <xref rid="pone.0100376-Staels1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100376-Bilz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We can directly observe an increase in LPL-related lipolysis and liver uptake in the VLDL fraction. Evidence for an effect on LDL uptake is more indirect. We observe that most variation between treatments in the IDL and LDL region is found in the uptake over influx ratio instead of the HL lipolysis over influx ratio; and HL lipolysis does not respond to the treatment like LPL lipolysis does, since the HL over total lipolysis ratio changes. This indicates an increasing lipoprotein uptake process in IDL and LDL after linoleic acid supplementation. Therefore, we can conclude that our data are consistent with PPAR activation by linoleic acid.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Potential drawbacks of the study</title><p>In this study we have been able to study the kinetics of one VLDL pool.
