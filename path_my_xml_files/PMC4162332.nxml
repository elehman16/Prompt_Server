Anticoagulation with effective and safe measures is important during PCI. Currently, unfractionated heparin (UFH) is used widely as an anticoagulant during the PCI procedure. However, because of its undesirable defects in terms of structure and composition, UFH is associated with various problems, such as a short half-life, low bioavailability, nonspecific binding to proteins that leads to unpredictable anticoagulative reactions <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, intrinsic platelet activation, and aggregation <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The intravenous half-life of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is about 2&#x02009;h, measured as anti-Xa activity, although somewhat shorter (about 80&#x02009;min) when measured by anti-IIa assay. The half-life of UFH is dose dependent but, at usual intravenous doses, it is 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;min by both assay methods. Unlike subcutaneous UFH, which has a bioavailability of less than 50%, all LMWHs have a bioavailability after a subcutaneous injection of 90&#x02013;100% <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Because of the unpredictability of heparin pharmacokinetics, activated clotting time monitoring is needed to adjust the dose of heparin during the PCI procedure. The use of LMWHs, especially enoxaparin, has gradually become more widespread and accepted by guidelines for anticoagulation during PCI, with advantages such as the more predictable anticoagulation and a lower incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Our previous work and that of others have shown that elective PCI can be performed safely with dalteparin and other LMWHs instead of UFH <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. However, there is a lack of sound evidence on the use of dalteparin as an anticoagulant during PCI. In addition, the changes in myocardial injury markers, such as cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), after PCI have rarely been reported when using dalteparin as an anticoagulant during PCI.</p><p>Clinically, cTnI and CK-MB are commonly used sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. CK-MB, which has high specificity, has served as a classic indicator of myocardial injury in the diagnosis of myocardial injury <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and also has a good long-term predictive value in patients undergoing PCI <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The sensitivity and specificity of cTnI as a myocardial injury marker are greater than those of CK-MB; in addition, cTnI has a longer diagnostic time window of up to 14 days <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p>Our preliminary data have confirmed the feasibility <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and efficacy of dalteparin during PCI <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> first found that the use of enoxaparin as an anticoagulant during PCI was both safe and effective in patients vulnerable to bleeding episodes and vascular events compared with UFH.

After this work was published, more evidence accumulated on the use of LMWH as an adjunctive anticoagulant during PCI.

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> have reported that dalteparin alone or combined with tirofiban was effective and safe in primary PCI for patients with STEMI compared with UFH. In in-vitro studies, Raaz <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> confirmed that the modulation of plasma coagulation with LMWH was critical to prevent catheter thrombus formation; thus, these authors favor dalteparin over enoxaparin in the setting of PCI. Our results in this current study further confirmed the conclusions from our preliminary study and the above-mentioned investigations <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</p><p>Myocardial injury as measured by the serum cTnI or CK-MB level is not uncommon in patients after PCI, which may result from increased lesion complexity, occluded microcirculation by a thrombus or debris embolization, low perfusion pressure, vascular spasm, insufficient anticoagulation, or vessel dissection <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. An increased serum level of cTnI or CK-MB after PCI usually predicts a worse short-term or long-term outcome <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse cardiac events was positively related to increased levels of myocardial injury markers. Using an appropriate anticoagulant during PCI can reduce the postoperative levels of cTnI and CK-MB, resulting in a decreased rate of myocardial injury following the PCI procedure <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. In this study, the promising results obtained with the use of dalteparin with a dosage of 120&#x02009;IU anti-Xa during PCI provide some evidence of adjunctive anticoagulation in such a situation. Our results also further confirmed the feasibility of using dalteparin instead of UFH for anticoagulation during PCI.</p><p>Notwithstanding the weaker effect of LMWH against thrombosis induced by foreign objects compared with UFH <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, thrombosis within the sheath occurred in only one patient of the dalteparin group, which is not statistically different from that of the UFH group. Therefore, the choice of dalteparin does not mean that more thrombosis was induced by foreign objects.</p><p>Some studies indicate that LMWH can reduce the incidence of MACEs and stent thrombosis compared with UFH. Kim <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> have suggested that tirofiban in combination with dalteparin in patients with acute coronary syndrome can significantly lower the incidence of MACEs compared with UFH plus tirofiban. In our study, no significant differences in the incidence of MACEs or stent thrombosis were found between the two groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.81 and 0.87).</p><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The present study had some limitations, including the selection of patients undergoing elective PCI and the limited number of patients treated with a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist in addition to the anticoagulant. In addition, coronary angiography was necessary to determine whether a patient should undergo PCI. The patients included in the study could therefore not be selected randomly. Furthermore, the dalteparin group enrolled more patients than the UFH group. Finally, considering the relatively small size of the study, the conclusion from this study should be confirmed in the future by a larger, double-blind, and randomized study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dalteparin is applicable for anticoagulation during elective PCI and is not inferior to UFH in terms of postoperative myocardial injury markers or bleeding complications. Thus, the use of dalteparin might be a feasible alternative to UFH in elective PCI. This study had a small sample size; therefore, the findings may be used to generate hypotheses rather than to provide definite conclusions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are indebted to the patients who agreed to participate in this trial, the study contributors, and the investigators who recruited patients.
