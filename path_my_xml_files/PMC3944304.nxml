using the Nintendo Wii Fit on the muscle activities of the trunk and lower extremities of
normal adults. [Subjects] The subjects of the study were 24 normal adults who were divided
into a virtual reality exercise group (VREG, n=12) and a stable surface exercise group
(SEG, n=12). [Methods] The exercises of the VREG using the Nintendo Wii Fit and the SEG
using a stable surface were conducted three times a week for six weeks. Electromyography
was used to measure the muscle activities of the tibialis anterior (TA), medial
gastrocnemius (MG), erector spinae (ES), and rectus abdominal (RA) muscles. [Results] VREG
showed significant within group differences in TA and MG muscle activities, while the SEG
showed a significant difference in the muscle activity of the MG. [Conclusion] Virtual
reality exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit was an effective intervention for the muscle
activities of the TA and MG of normal adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Virtual reality exercise</kwd><kwd>Stable surface exercise</kwd><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In order to increase the gait efficiency of normal gait in daily living, an exercise that
can improve the action of weakened muscles or strengthen distal muscles can be employed<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it is important to conduct
efficient and systematic gait training for improvement of balance and gait. To this end, a
variety of training methods have been employed, such as using functional electrical
stimulus, task-oriented exercises, and virtual reality exercise.</p><p>Virtual reality exercise can provide sensory feedback (auditory, visual, and proprioception
sensations) in a virtual reality environment offering an exercise training program that
meets individual needs and creates a training environment that can adjust the difficulty of
the exercise according to individuals&#x02019; adaptation levels<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A virtual reality program using Nintendo Wii Fit equipment can be
conveniently and inexpensively enjoyed at home. Virtual reality can also stimulate
excitement and fun motivating users to use the program. Furthermore, its reliability has
been proven, and many studies related to virtual reality have been conducted<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous research, various studies of
the effects on balance of a virtual reality program with expensive equipment have been
conducted. However, few studies have been performed to determine the muscle activities of
the trunk and lower extremities using the Nintendo Wii Fit virtual reality program.
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the effect of virtual reality exercises
using the Nintendo Wii Fit on the muscle activities of the trunk and lower extremities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were 24 adults (15 males, 9 females) who were divided
into a virtual reality exercise group (VREG; age 21.9&#x000b1;1.4&#x02005;years, height 169.8&#x000b1;8.1&#x02005;cm, weight
66.3&#x000b1;13.2&#x02005;kg) and a stable surface exercise group (SEG; age 24.3&#x000b1;3.9&#x02005;years, height
168.3&#x000b1;9.2&#x02005;cm, weight 67.4&#x000b1;114.3&#x02005;kg). All the subjects were given an explanation of the
purpose and exercise methods of the present study prior to the experiment. Subjects
voluntarily signed forms giving their consent to participation in accordance with the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects enrolled were adults who had
not experienced orthopedic or neurological injury in the past six months.</p><p>The VREG performed a virtual reality exercise program using the Nintendo Wii Fit (Nintendo
Company Ltd., Japan). The virtual reality system starts the game when the balance plate
recognizes motion. When subjects move or maintain their weight on the balance plate, the
system applies this to the virtual reality displayed on the screen. Furthermore, an avatar
(Mii) is shown on the screen who follows the subject&#x02019;s movement, providing not only visual
and auditory feedback, but also sensory feedback through vibrational responses to the user&#x02019;s
various movements. In the present study, three programs (tennis, baseball, and bowling) were
chosen from a total of five. The training time of a single session was 40 minutes, and
training sessions were conducted three times a week for six weeks. Each program was
conducted for 10 minutes, and five minutes of rest was given between the programs.</p><p>The SEG performed their training on a stable support surface. They conducted their exercise
on flat ground in an upright posture. First, they crossed both hands in front of the chest
and touched both shoulders. With both eyes open, they lifted and held their heels up for six
seconds, followed by lifting and holding up the toes for six seconds. Next, they bent their
shoulders to about 45 degrees as their arms were straightened, followed by turning the trunk
to the right and left while lifting the toes and heels in sequence. Finally, they crossed
both hands in front of the chest and touched both shoulders while standing balanced on one
foot, then the other foot, alternately. The training was conducted for both groups three
times a week for six weeks, with each session lasting 40 minutes. The subjects conducted the
above three steps repeatedly in each session, and five minutes of rest was given between the
steps. In order to measure the change in muscle activity, surface electromyography (MP150,
BIOPAC System Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used. Surface electrodes were attached to
the skin over the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), erector spinae (ES),
and rectus abdominal (RA) muscles. The electromyograms (EMG) were sent to the MP150 system
and converted into digital signals that were processed using a personal computer using
AcqKnowledge software (version 4.01). The average value of the EMG of a muscle is presented
as percentage of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC).</p><p>We used the paired sample t-test to determine the significance of the changes in muscle
activities within the groups. We used SPSS 12.0 for Windows for statistical processing, and
a significance level of &#x003b1;= 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results show after the intervention, there were significant differences in TA and MG
activities in VREG (p&#x0003c;0.05), and that the SEG showed a significant difference in MG
activity (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of the muscle activities of each group between pre- and

Nintendo Wii Fit on the muscle activities of the trunk and lower extremities of normal
adults.</p><p>Saposnik et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 22 patients with
stroke and reported that a group that performed virtual reality training programs showed
greater improvement in upper extremity functions than a group performing recreational
exercise. Yavuzer et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 20
patients with stroke and reported that a group that did virtual reality exercise for four
weeks showed a significant increase in upper extremity functions, such as dressing, in terms
of functional independence measures compared to a control group. Merians et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> also studied patients with stroke and
reported that virtual reality programs using robots, motion detection, sensor-attached
gloves, and computers were effective at recovering upper extremity functions. They suggested
that traditional exercise treatment with virtual reality is more beneficial, because
exercise intervention using virtual reality can provide appropriately modified visual
feedback, thereby activating brain tissue. Quaney et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 10 patients with stroke and reported that the performance of
a virtual reality exercise program that can provide visual feedback elicited a significant
improvement in the grasping ability of the hands.</p><p>Dunning et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> studied patients with
stroke who were more than nine months old and conducted exercise using virtual reality
systems for eight weeks. They reported that the patients showed improvements in gait
velocity, ankle movement, and plantar flexion while pushing their ankles, resulting in an
increase in ankle muscle strength and gait velocity. Walker et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> studied patients with chronic stroke and reported that
weight-supported treadmill training provided in a virtual environment increased the Berg
Balance Scale result from 43.8 to 48, showing that treadmill training using virtual reality
was more effective at improving balance than general treadmill training. Mirelman et
al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a program to improve
lower extremity functions using a robot virtual reality system for four weeks and reported
that the experimental group using the robot system showed greater improvements in gait
velocity, gait distance, and cadence. In addition, Yang et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted virtual reality&#x02013;based training lasting four
weeks for stroke patients, and concluded that the augmented reality&#x02013;based treadmill training
improved gait velocity. In the present study, muscle activities of the trunk and lower
extremities were measured before and after the virtual reality training intervention, and
the results show that in the VREG, the muscle activities of the TA and MG significantly
increased. This result indicates that virtual reality training contributed to improvement of
ankle joint stability, since those muscles are mainly used in ankle strategy. It also shows
that balance training using virtual reality changed the center of pressure movements in
anteroposterior and mediolateral directions, since the TA and MG are the muscles primarily
used for balance. In the VREG, no significant difference was found in the muscle activity of
the ES or the RA. This was because the virtual reality program requires dynamic movements of
the lower extremity, whereas it requires comparatively less movement involving the muscles
of the trunk.</p><p>The limitations of the present study are as follows: first, this study did not include a
large number of subjects; second, it is difficult to generalize the study results because
the subjects were only chosen from adults living in Chungbuk Province in Korea. In future
research, a study of the effects of virtual reality exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit on
the functional recovery of athletes who have an ankle injury is required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kerrigan</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>PO</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Compensatory advantages of toe walking</article-title>.
