Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a promising complementary and alternative medicine for treating SCAD, while evidence for its effect on long-term survival is limited.

In addition, increasing evidence supports a vital role of inflammation in the clinical instability of SCAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. C-reactive protein (CRP), a systemic inflammatory marker, adds prognostic information to the cluster of traditional risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the novel anti-inflammatory drugs did not show a positive effect on further reducing major adverse cardiac event (MACE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to seek more effective strategies for inhibiting inflammation and thus reducing the occurrence of MACE from SCAD.</p><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to treat CAD for thousands of years. A meta-analysis of 70 randomized clinical trials including 9706 cases of CAD demonstrated a beneficial effect of TCM on clinical symptoms (odds ratio, 3.06 [95&#x000a0;% CI, 2.58 to 3.62]; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001) and electrocardiograph (odds ratio, 2.46 [95&#x000a0;% CI, 2.16 to 2.80]; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001) compared with isosorbide dinitrate, and no serious adverse effects were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, another systematic review pointed out that the majority of randomized controlled trials on CAD with TCM are of &#x0201c;poor quality&#x0201d;, thus more powerful evidence from high-quality clinical trials are needed for future clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Qing-Xin-Jie-Yu Granules (QXJYG) have been used to treat CAD for nearly two decades in mainland China, and previous small-sample studies have demonstrated that QXJYG relieved angina pectoris and decreased cholesterol of patients with CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. QXJYG consist of five herbal granules, including <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> (Huangqi), <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge</italic> (Danshen), <italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort</italic> (Chuanxiong), <italic>Agastache rugosus</italic> (Huoxiang), and <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> (Huanglian). The pharmacological studies suggested that the bioactive component or structural modification of extracts from Huangqi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Danshen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and Chuanxiong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] had effects on cardiac protection, plaque stabilization, inhibition of platelet aggregation, etc., and these three Chinese herbs are also widely used in TCM for treating CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, extracts from Danshen and Huanglian exert anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and clinical studies showed that they decreased the level of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in patients with cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, QXJYG is worth investigating in high-risk SCAD patients due to the pleiotropic effect. The assumption is made that QXJYG in addition to conventional treatment may be superior to reduce inflammation of atherosclerosis and finally lead to the reduction of MACE in high-risk SCAD patients. If successful, it will provide an evidence-based complementary therapeutic approach for inhibiting inflammation and reducing MACE from SCAD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>This study is designed as a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial to test the hypothesis that QXJYG in addition to conventional treatment is more effective than conventional treatment alone in reducing MACE, which is defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and revascularization, for SCAD patients with two or more atherogenic risk factors during 1-year follow-up (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow of the QUEST Trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1569_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design overview</title><p>The rigorous design, organization, and conduct of the trial are supervised by a Steering Committee, which comprises two members from each participating center in addition to the chairman, scientific coordinator and statistician.

Neither financial nor nonfinancial incentives will be provided to attending physicians and patients for enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization and treatment assignment</title><p>Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio through a centrally controlled, computer-generated, site-stratified, block randomization schedule. The study granules are labeled with serial numbers, and each patient will be assigned the lowest number available at each participating center. All patients, care providers, attending physicians, laboratory staff and biostatisticians are blind to treatment assignment until the database has been locked. Randomization started on October, 2014.

The QXJYG and placebo granules were produced and packed in a single batch (Production batch number:1405001H) by China Resources Sanjiu Medical and Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China., which has no conflict of interest relevant to this study. The test results of drug quality were consistent with the Chinese Medicine Standards of the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The placebo granules are composed of 10&#x000a0;% crude drug of QXJYG and 90&#x000a0;% starch, which have the identical appearance, smell, and scent as the active treatment granules. Patients will be instructed to dissolve the granules in 150&#x000a0;mL hot water and take orally twice daily for 6 successive months.

The National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 grading system was used to classify the nature and severity of the AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Follow-up</title><p>The follow-up for all patients will be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The primary and secondary outcomes as well as safety will be evaluated at each follow-up. If severe adverse events (SAEs) occur, the attending physician must report to the principal investigator and ethics committee immediately, who will decide whether or not to continue the treatment. Patients are also free to continue or discontinue the study at any time during the trial. Additionally, any medication change and events leading to therapy interruption will be recorded on the case record form (CRF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Compliance</title><p>A mobile application will be used to remind the patients automatically at each follow-up appointment. In addition, each patient will be asked to offer at least two telephone numbers in order to be contacted in time. Furthermore, attending physicians will be responsible for each patient&#x02019;s questions.</p><p>To assess medication adherence, patients will be asked to return the unused granules. Unused granules accounting for more than 20&#x000a0;% of the total granules will be defined as nonadherence. The reasons for nonadherence (e.g., discontinuation of intervention owing to harm or unsatisfactory efficacy) will be recorded on the CRF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on the expected reduction of incidence in MACE from pre- to post-treatment at 1&#x000a0;year. A previous study suggested that the MACE (death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization) incidence in high-risk patients with SCAD is about 10&#x000a0;% within 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Assuming a MACE incidence reduction to 7&#x000a0;% following treatment with QXJYG added, and given a type I error rate of alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, a power of 80&#x000a0;% (type II error rate of beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2), the sample size for one arm needed to be 630, resulting in <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;630&#x02009;=&#x02009;1260 patients. Considering a dropout rate of 20&#x000a0;%, a total of 1512 patients needed to be allocated to reach the required number of patients for the efficacy analysis. For convenience of randomization, we decided to recruit 1500 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical approach</title><p>Continuous variables will be presented as the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD), median or interquartile range (IQR), and as frequencies or percentages for categorical variables. The comparability of the characteristics between the two groups will be assessed using a two-sample Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables and the chi-square test or Wilcoxon test, when appropriate, for categorical variables. For the SAQ scores, the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the change from baseline to 1&#x000a0;year between the QXJYG group and the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Questionnaire score data, known as nonnormally distributed, will be transformed or analyzed with nonparametric ANCOVA. If appropriate, multivariable linear models will be used to assess the association between independent predictors and the continuous endpoints of the trial. Cumulative event rates of an outcome in the QXJYG and the placebo groups, respectively, will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the curves will be tested using the log-rank method. The crude and adjusted hazard ratio and their 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals will be estimated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model.</p><p>The primary outcome will be conducted on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The ITT set includes all patients randomized to treatment. The per protocol set consists of all patients with no major deviation from the protocol and with an overall treatment adherence rate of 80&#x000a0;% or higher at the end of the study. The safety set consists of ITT patients excluding those who do not take any study medication or who have no record of follow-up after randomization. We will assess the effect that any missing data might have on the results by sensitivity analysis of augmented data sets. Dropouts will be included in the analysis by modern imputation methods for missing data.</p><p>We plan to conduct three subgroup analyses: first, we will compare hazard ratios of MACE based upon the level of hs-CRP (below 3&#x000a0;mg/L vs. greater than or equal to 3&#x000a0;mg/L). Second, we will compare the hazard ratios of MACE between SCAD patients with diabetes or not. Finally, we will compare the hazard ratios of MACE between men and women with SCAD.</p><p>For all analyses, a value of <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 is considered statistically significant, and all tests are two-tailed. <italic>P</italic> values will be reported to four decimal places.

Data and materials supporting the conclusions of this trial will be available in this system. A password system will be utilized to control access. Data integrity will be achieved through several mechanisms including referential data rules, valid values, range checks and consistency checks against data already stored in the database. Missing data or specific errors in the data will be detected by programs. Written documentation of changes will be available via electronic logs and audit trails. Original CRF will be kept at the participating center for 5&#x000a0;years after completion of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Safety monitoring</title><p>A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be in charge of safety reviews, and will include at least two independent faculty members from the participating center. The safety will be evaluated for the first time when approximately 20&#x000a0;% patients have 6&#x000a0;months of data available. Subsequently, the DSMB will perform the interim analysis for safety with the support of the statistical group when approximately 50&#x000a0;% patients have 6&#x000a0;months of data available. In addition, the DSMB will conduct at least one on-site monitoring visit during the study to ensure that each participating center complies with the study protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) principles; the data and SAEs are accurately and appropriately recorded on the CRF. When SAEs occur, the DSMB will perform unblinding immediately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>According to our knowledge, this is the first multicenter trial sponsored by the national funding of China to evaluate TCM in combination with conventional treatment on 1-year survival in high-risk SCAD patients.</p><p>Atherogenic risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are common in CAD patients, and clustering of them has a higher age-adjusted, long-term mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, accumulating evidence has revealed that all these traditional atherogenic risk factors are closely associated with an increased level of CRP, an inflammatory marker with additional prognostic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A study showed that in SCAD patients, the CRP concentration in the fifth quintile (&#x0003e;3.6&#x000a0;mg/L) showed an about twofold increase in MACE, compared with the first four quintiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is in accordance with the consensus view that inflammation has a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events. Therefore, inhibiting chronic inflammation has been regarded a potential strategy to reduce MACE from SCAD.</p><p>Chinese herbs have shown multifactorial cardiovascular protective effects, such as lowing plasma lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], reducing oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and inhibiting platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], etc. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of Chinese herbs have gained much attention recently. Danshen and Huanglian, the two herbs used in QXJYG, also have been demonstrated in many animal or cell culture models to inhibit inflammatory respondence. In ApoE-deficient mice fed with a high cholesterol diet, salvianolic acid B, an extract from Danshen, reduced metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as platelets, treatment with extract from Danshen attenuated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;)-induced expression of CD40. Furthermore, the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as well as the release of soluble VCAM-1, ICAM-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were downregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Berberine, an extract from Huanglian, also decreased serum levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in rats with isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This gives a stimulus for large controlled trials to examine the long-term effects of QXJYG in CAD patients, especially those in a high inflammatory state (a serum hs-CRP level &#x02265;3&#x000a0;mg/L, with additional multiple atherogenic risk factors).</p><p>Granules have been widely used in mainland China. Our study QXJYG granules were produced strictly in compliance with standards of Good Manufactory Practice (GMP) and Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010. The chemical compositions of the final products were analyzed for contamination with heavy metals, toxic elements, microbe and pesticide residues; the final products were analyzed for stability and adherence to quality standards of the CFDA. The fingerprint of QXJYG will be conducted to ensure the stability and homogeneity of the composition. The placebo granules have the identical appearance, smell, and scent as the active treatment granules. Granules were distributed to the 18 study sites with the same batch number. The company that provided the granules does not participate in the design, analysis, or interpretation of the study.</p><p>It should be noted that our study has limitations. First, the study is conducted only in mainland China, and whether the results from this trial can be applied to other ethnic groups is uncertain. However, the participating centers are located in different geographic areas in mainland China, and national minorities are also involved. Therefore, the recruited patients guarantee a certain representativeness. Second, the duration of follow-up is designed relatively short. The continuation of follow-up after the end of the study has been planned in order to assess the long-term outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, this trial is designed to demonstrate that the addition of QXJYG to conventional treatment will reduce the inflammation of atherosclerosis and finally lead to the reduction of MACE in high-risk SCAD patients.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has currently recruited 1202 patients since October 2014, of which 906 have completed the 6-month follow-up.
