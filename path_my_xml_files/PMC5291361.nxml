Despite widespread dissemination of evidence-based guidelines and effective treatment that have existed for decades, most patients with asthma still have uncontrolled symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, poor asthma control is defined as having daytime symptoms or requiring a short-acting inhaler more than twice weekly, awakening from sleep due to asthma symptoms, or having to reduce activities due to asthma [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In a random sample of adults with health insurance, 51.7% had uncontrolled asthma based on an Asthma Control Test (ACT) score of &#x0003c;20 [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar observations of poor asthma control have been reported in asthma management program evaluations [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interventions aimed at improving self-management of asthma control are crucial to reducing the adverse physical and economic impacts associated with this disease.</p><p>Though patient non-adherence to controller medicines is a contributing factor to poor asthma control [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], there is ample evidence to suggest that patients are also not prescribed enough controller medications and do not receive proper counseling and instruction (i.e. proper use of an inhaler) to help self-manage their asthma. It is estimated, for example, that only 55% of adults with asthma are taught to recognize early symptoms of asthma, only 47% are instructed to change their environment to improve asthma control, and only 33% have ever received an asthma management plan [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Slejko and colleagues studied a representative sample of 102,544 US adults with asthma and observed that only 60% of those using three or more canisters of a quick-relief inhaler in the past 90 days also used a long-term controller medication, suggesting significant under prescribing of these important medications [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, Yong and colleagues studied 90,909 adults with persistent asthma and observed that only 47% were using more controller medications than quick-relief medications, and those who did were 27% less likely to have an asthma exacerbation [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This suggests that fostering increased patient-provider communication of asthma management has the potential to significantly improve asthma control.</p><p>One intervention strategy that has proven effective in improving the care that patients receive is reminding patients to ask their providers specific questions that lead to changes in their care [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This strategy is effective because patients who ask for tests and treatments tend to receive them [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170447.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While a number of studies have observed that this method is effective in improving preventive services, such as immunizations, mammography, and colon cancer screenings [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it has also been successful in improving a range of mental and chronic illnesses. For example, Kravitz and colleagues observed that standardized patients trained to portray a patient with major depression were more than twice as likely (76.0% v. 31.2%) to receive an antidepressant if they were coached to ask for one [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, previous studies by our research team have demonstrated that using web-based tailored messages can encourage patients to ask their provider specific questions to improve the care of chronic illnesses, such as migraine [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and asthma [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, this approach has not been widely studied to understand its impact on asthma control. Given the power of disseminability through use of the Internet, further research of online tools to improve patient-provider communication and asthma self-management is warranted.</p><p>We sought to test the efficacy of an online tool designed to improve asthma control by reminding patients to ask their providers for changes to their treatment and to encourage specific self-care behaviors. The primary hypothesis was that participants randomized to the web-based intervention would have better asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a 5-item validated self-report instrument [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The secondary hypothesis was that participants randomized to the intervention condition would receive a greater number of controller medications, thus demonstrating their improved asthma control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design was a 12-month single-blind randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation ratio comparing the impact of an online tool designed to encourage patients to ask their provider questions about their asthma care versus a control intervention designed to encourage patients to ask their provider questions about preventive services unrelated to asthma control (e.g., cancer screening).</p><p>Randomization was performed after participants completed baseline self-report assessments online by linking an enrolled participant to the next available random allocation sequence; a computer-generated algorithm in the management module designed by study website programmers. Participants were blinded to their assignment.</p><p>All study participants were asked to use the online tool at least once each month, in which they would answer 10&#x02013;15 series of questions about their health and health care. Based on their answers and pre-written rules, the online tool provided tailored feedback reminding patients to ask providers specific questions about their asthma medications and asthma self-care, to improve adherence to the 2007 NAEPP treatment guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The study was approved by the Penn State Hershey Institutional Review Board, IRB#28190EP (Study Protocol in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170447.s002">S1 Protocol</xref>). As no face to face visits were performed during the study, informed consent was completed verbally by phone and participants electronically signed a data sharing agreement between Penn State Hershey Medical Center and their insurer, Highmark Blue Shield. The website was developed internally by the Department of Public Health Sciences at Penn State College of Medicine and all data was secured per security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Participants and procedures</title><p>Participants were members of a large insurer, Highmark Blue Shield, with over 4 million members. Recruitment letters were sent to members who were: 1) enrolled in Highmark Blue Shield for at least one year, 2) between the ages of 21&#x02013;60 years and 3) met Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) criteria for persistent asthma [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The HEDIS criteria identify individuals with persistent asthma based on their pattern of medication use specific to asthma (e.g., albuterol), emergency room visits or hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of asthma, and outpatient visits coded by the provider with a diagnosis of asthma [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Potential participants were excluded if, during a phone screener, they reported never receiving a diagnosis of asthma from a health care provider, were not able to read and speak English fluently, did not have Internet access at home or work or were pregnant. In addition, those with a history of more than 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking were excluded, as many of these individuals have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease rather than asthma [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Enrolled participants were provided a secure login and password for using the online tool. They were compensated financially for completing data collection at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Recruitment began in 2009 and all follow-up measures were completed by 2012.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Intervention condition (IC)</title><p>Participants in the IC were asked to use the online tool at least once every 30 days and within 14 days of their next scheduled health care provider visit, though they could use it any time.

In keeping with the 2007 NAEPP Guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a reminder email was sent to participants to use the website before doctor visits. In addition, the reminder email suggested that participants make an earlier visit if their asthma was not controlled and their next scheduled visit was greater than two weeks in the future. As the intervention was mainly designed to be used before a visit with the participant&#x02019;s asthma care provider, we tracked the dates of upcoming asthma care provider appointments and actively reminded participants to use the website before these visits. We assumed that the intervention would be less effective if used long before or following an office visit, as the intervention was designed to &#x0201c;activate&#x0201d; patients to ask specific questions during visits with their asthma care provider to improve clinical inertia. For that reason, participants in both conditions received automated email reminders at the beginning of each new 30 day cycle to log in to the interactive website each month. If the participant did not use the intervention by day 20 of each 30 day cycle, they received an automated reminder email to use the intervention. Additionally, to ensure completion of study measures, a reminder email and a reminder phone call from study staff took place if baselines measures were not completed within 14 days of the 30 day cycle in which the measures were due. For the 6 and 12 month measures, a reminder email and reminder phone call from study staff took place if measures were not completed within 25 days of the 30 day cycle in which they were due.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Control condition (CC)</title><p>The control condition was designed as an active treatment control that asked questions and gave feedback about preventive services (e.g., colon cancer screening) that would be unlikely to change asthma care.

Asthma-related claims for hospitalization, outpatient visits, emergency department visits and medications were examined. Data sharing agreements to allow this process were signed by each participant during the informed consent process and approved by the Penn State College of Medicine Institutional Review Board.

Categorical variables were summarized with frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, and quartiles. The distribution of continuous variables was evaluated using box plots, histograms, and normal probability plots. Cut-points were chosen for reporting results based on recommendations from the NAEPP Guidelines.

The only variable that differed significantly between conditions at baseline was the percentage of individuals in each group who were denied insurance in the past 12 months, so this variable was added as a covariate to all models.

For binary outcome variables, a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model was utilized, and differences were quantified with percentages and odds ratios. To determine the impact of losses to follow-up on the results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using a more conservative approach that replaced missing data with data from the last visit carried forward (LOCF) [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

id="sec024"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, we tested the impact of using online patient reminders designed to help patients with persistent asthma ask specific questions during office visits and modify their self-care, in order to improve their asthma control. Each reminder was based on a specific recommendation in the 2007 NAEPP Guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite the brevity and simplicity of the intervention (~10 minutes monthly + minimal interactivity), participants randomized to the IC significantly improved their asthma control versus participants in the CC. Intervention participants increased their asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) by 1.1 [+2.3, 95% CI (1.6, 2.9) v. +1.2 (0.6, 1.8)] versus controls and had non-significant improvements in 9 of 11 individual asthma control survey items. The magnitude of the effect of using the online tool is similar to that of adding an additional controller medication [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We did not, however, observe differences in asthma utilization, such as emergency department (ED) visits or outpatient visits, though the rates of ED utilization (2.3% in the IC and 1.2% in the CC) were low at baseline.</p><p>Although the finding of improved asthma control was both statistically and clinically significant in the IC, the mechanism for the difference is not clear. We hypothesized that the difference would be due to an increase in the number of, or adherence to, asthma controller medications, though we observed no such differences due to the treatment. We speculate that the differences may have been due to other reminders included in the feedback, such as reminders about inhaler technique (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170447.t002">Table 2</xref>). Participants in the IC who had not been counseled about proper inhaler technique were encouraged to ask &#x0201c;<italic>Am I using my inhaler correctly</italic>?&#x0201d; and the online reminder suggested specific changes to technique: &#x0201c;<italic>For example</italic>, <italic>many people don&#x02019;t fully exhale before triggering the inhaler</italic>. <italic>And many people don&#x02019;t hold their breath for 5&#x02013;10 seconds after breathing in the medicine</italic>&#x0201d; and included a link to another source of information about proper technique. Other reminders, based on recommendations from the NAEPP guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], focused on quitting smoking, controlling allergies and having an asthma management plan, also known as an Asthma Action Plan. The intervention, therefore, may have functioned primarily by improving asthma self-management behaviors, rather than by intensifying asthma medications. A future study should include a measure of inhaler technique to understand if this change mediated the improvement in asthma control.</p><p>This study supports the results of previous studies that have found that web-based asthma modules may improve asthma control and quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170447.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, there are important differences between our study and previous studies which highlight the strength of our intervention. For example, van der Meer, et al. also provided group education to their web-based self-management program [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our intervention, which was strictly web-based, allows for increased dissemination to patients with asthma or other chronic conditions, given that 85% of adults use the Internet and 72% of Internet users look online for information about a specific disease or medical problem [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, Rasmussen and colleagues&#x02019; study focused more on web-based monitoring of asthma symptoms compared with specialist- or physician-monitored [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], whereas we provided tailored feedback that was meant to improve patient activation when meeting with a provider. Given that 74.5% of participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the feedback they received, it is reasonable to assume that patients may benefit from using this simple, online tool to improve asthma control. An additional strength of this study was the use of an active treatment control condition, where participants were given feedback on preventive services rather than asthma treatment. This was implemented to improve participant adherence and control for contact time while still providing participants with useful medical information and encouraging them to consider scheduling certain medical tests. We believe that a 12-month follow up completion rate of 79.7% indicated that we achieved success with this study design, as shown in prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Further, our study had a larger study sample than these two studies. Similarly, many studies have focused their web-based interventions on children [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170447.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], whereas we chose to focus on adults.</p><p>Despite a single-blinded, experimental study design, high rates of fidelity and an active treatment control condition, the study has a number of limitations. First, not all clinically relevant outcome measures, such as pulmonary function, were measured. Second, measures of inhaler technique and audio recordings of provider interactions were not included and may have better enabled us to understand the reasons for the positive findings. Finally, the study enrolled patients of relatively high socioeconomic status (SES), who had both Internet access and health insurance, though asthma prevalence and severity are highest among individuals of lower SES [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While nearly 90% of US adults have Internet access via multiple modalities (e.g., computer, smartphone), access is still more limited among the elderly, poor, and those with a lower educational level [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Future research is needed to determine the best approach to utilize to reach these groups so they may receive feedback on their chronic medical conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A simple and brief online intervention improved asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Test, among insured patients in Pennsylvania. Although future studies are needed to understand the mechanism of the improvement, the magnitude of the effect was similar to the addition of an additional controller medication [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Given that half of US adults have a chronic illness [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and that chronic illnesses account for 75% of health care costs [<xref rid="pone.0170447.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it is critical to identify simple tools to help patients in their care and improve outcomes. Online tools have the potential to be used in other conditions, are relatively cost-effective to disseminate and, as observed in this study, may have a significant impact on improving chronic disease management and the public&#x02019;s health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170447.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170447.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170447.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170447.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170447.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Secondary outcomes by asthma severity.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170447.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170447.s004"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Histograms and box plots for each continuous outcome.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170447.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Christopher N.
