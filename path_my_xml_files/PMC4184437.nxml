In order to comply with the trends, we propose training on inexpensive patient-specific kidney phantoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>To develop a new kidney phantom for puncture and drainage training in interventional urology and radiology, and to evaluate their anatomical correctness and suitability for training compared to the traditional way of training on home-made phantoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods</title><p>A case study for validation of kidney phantoms was conducted with nine radiology students divided into two groups: one trained on standard home-made training phantom (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and the other on our kidney phantoms (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5). Another test phantom was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training of the two groups. The tests were video recorded and analyzed. Duration of the procedure was used as the primary indicator of procedure&#x02019;s quality. Comparison tests were also conducted with professional radiologists. Anatomical correctness of the kidney phantom was evaluated by comparing the post mortem kidney scans with reconstructed models from CT scans. Subjective feedback was also collected from the participants. Wider use of kidney phantoms was analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The average volumetric difference between post mortem kidney scans and reconstructed CT kidney models was 4.70&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.25%. All five students practicing on the kidney phantom improved their performance and the results were almost equal to the results of the professional radiologist while in the other group two students out of four trained on standard home-made training phantoms failed to improve their performance. However, the small number of test subjects prevents us from drawing general conclusions about the efficiency of the new practice. The kidney phantoms were found usable also for nephrostomy catheter placement training under fluoroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The feedback from radiologists showed that the anatomically correct features of the phantom is an added value for the training and has a potential to increase the quality of minimally invasive procedures in general.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Phantom</kwd><kwd>ultrasound</kwd><kwd>nephrostomy</kwd><kwd>patient-specific anatomy</kwd><kwd>training</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-2047981614534231"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interventional radiology is a rapidly developing area of minimally invasive procedures (<xref rid="bibr1-2047981614534231" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

Phantoms are not only useful for skill development in needle guidance and ultrasound (US) probe handling for residents but also for practicing radiologists to improve their skills with new techniques and ever changing equipment (<xref rid="bibr3-2047981614534231" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2047981614534231" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr5-2047981614534231" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) as well as to increase their confidence before procedures on patients.</p><p>In our previous work we developed an anatomically shaped kidney phantom for interventional radiology trainees (<xref rid="bibr6-2047981614534231" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) suitable for practicing variable needle thickness biopsies using US guidance. That kidney phantom prototype did not have drainage functionality. In this work we widen the applicability of our patient specific phantoms for nephrostomy drainage by introducing a kidney phantom with calyxes and fluid flow.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to develop anatomically correct kidney phantoms with calyxes for training interventional urology and radiology. The goal was to evaluate the kidney phantoms&#x02019; suitability for training in the 1-week introductive course to interventional radiology compared to the traditional way of training on home-made phantoms and to evaluate the kidney phantoms&#x02019; anatomical correctness by comparing the postmortem scans of physical kidneys retrieved from pathologists with preoperative kidney models reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2-2047981614534231"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec3-2047981614534231"><title>Phantom materials</title><p>In our previous work (<xref rid="bibr6-2047981614534231" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) we compared different phantom materials and chose to use gelatin gels as the tissue-mimicking material as they are self-supportive solids with a proper range of achievable elasticity, US characteristics, and a relatively simple manufacturing process.

The test phantom (B), which was not known to the residents before the tests, was designed to evaluate the groups&#x02019; performances after the training.</p><sec id="sec5-2047981614534231"><title>Kidney phantoms (A)</title><p>A patient-specific kidney phantom was created based on a CT scan. The model of the kidney was created by segmenting the CT images and creating an STL model using 3D Slicer software. Using the kidney model, a two-sided mold was modeled using 3D CAD design software Solidworks. The mold was made of PLA plastic (Poly Lactic Acid) using rapid prototyping technique.</p><p>Prior to the casting of the kidney phantoms, three reservoirs representing the kidney calyxes were prepared from air balloons with a diameter of 20&#x02013;23&#x02009;mm and placed into the mold. The calyxes were connected with silicone pipes (inner diameter, 3&#x02009;mm) to outer reservoirs (made of 12&#x02009;mL syringes) after preparing the kidney phantom. The kidney was placed into a box (20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x02009;cm) and surrounded with an additional gelatin medium. Before casting the surrounding medium, air balloons were removed from the kidneys. The upper surface of the phantom was covered with a pigmented silicone layer (EcoFlex 0030). The three calyxes and corresponding reservoirs were filled with differently colored water. Different colors were used for that it would be possible to check that the correct calyx was punctured and drained. The design of the phantom can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2047981614534231">Fig. 1</xref>.

The affordable price and disposable content of the kidney phantom are valuable properties that could motivate urology and radiology departments to use phantoms not only for the training of residents but also encourage experienced specialists to use phantoms before performing rarely used techniques or new equipment. This can enhance the quality of minimally invasive procedures. Our kidney phantom was well accepted by the radiology students and staff who preferred to use our kidney phantoms (A) in training and in everyday practice over home-made phantoms (C). The low score in thick needle usage of the new kidney phantom can be resolved by using the results of our previous work.</p><p>As of the training analysis, video recordings proved to be a very useful tool not just for time recording but also for post-training analysis of the correct methods and the posture of handling the syringe and the US probe by the students.</p><p>The analysis of the training showed that the group practicing on our kidney phantom (Group 1) that had much lower scores in the beginning of the training, improved significantly (73.60&#x02009;s) compared to students practicing on the home-made phantom (Group 2) (3.00&#x02009;s). In the end of the training Group 1 performance had caught up and somewhat exceeded Group 2 by 1.05&#x02009;s. Professional radiologists performed 70.47&#x02009;s faster than Group 1 and 0.91&#x02009;s faster than Group 2 in the initial test (comparing Test 0 and the test with the radiologists), which shows that the radiologists are well prepared in hand&#x02013;eye coordination when it comes to working with new kind of objects.</p><p>The results of the comparison of the volumetric data of a cadaveric kidney reconstruction with CT scan reconstructions show that the kidney phantom produced by using 3D printed molds constructed from the CT scan data simulates reliably the real-life situation.</p><p>There are limitations of our study. The small size of the group restricts us from making general conclusions about the results but it can be expected that students who train on anatomically correctly constructed phantoms gain experience faster. Some changes in the kidney phantom could also improve the training quality. For example, the US image quality of the phantom could be improved by increasing the attenuation of the surrounding medium of the kidney, the problem with needle marks left after needle extraction need attention, and the reality of the phantom could be increased by introducing pulsating blood vessels.</p><p>In conclusion, our phantom was well received by the residents and staff. The tests showed that our kidney phantom is suitable for objectively evaluating the work and training of the radiology residents. According to the feedback from the radiology students and staff we further developed the kidney phantom by improving the tactile feedback of needle insertion and anatomical complexity and correctness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank East Tallinn Hospital for using their equipment, radiologists and residents for participating in the tests.</p></ack><sec id="sec24-2047981614534231"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by European Union FP7 projects SAFROS and ISUR.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2047981614534231"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sabharwal</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Fotiadis</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Adam</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>
