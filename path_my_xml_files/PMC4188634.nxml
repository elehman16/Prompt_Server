Nine male, recreational cyclists visited the laboratory four times. During the 1<sup>st</sup> visit the participants performed an incremental test and during the 2<sup>nd</sup> visit they performed a 1000-m cycling familiarization trial. On the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> visits, the participants performed a 1000-m TT at either 8 am or 6 pm, in randomized, repeated-measures, crossover design. The time to complete the time trial was lower in the evening than in the morning (88.2&#x000b1;8.7 versus 94.7&#x000b1;10.9 s, respectively, p&#x0003c;0.05), but there was no significant different in pacing. However, oxygen uptake and aerobic mechanical power output at 600 and 1000 m tended to be higher in the evening (p&#x0003c;0.07 and 0.09, respectively). There was also a main effect of time of day for insulin, cortisol, and total and free testosterone concentration, which were all higher in the morning (+60%, +26%, +31% and +22%, respectively, p&#x0003c;0.05). The growth hormone, was twofold higher in the evening (p&#x0003c;0.05). The plasma glucose was &#x0223c;11% lower in the morning (p&#x0003c;0.05). Glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine and lactate were similar for the morning and evening trials (p&#x0003e;0.05), but the norepinephrine response to the exercise was increased in the morning (+46%, p&#x0003c;0.05), and it was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the response of glucose. Muscle recruitment, as measured by electromyography, was similar between morning and evening trials (p&#x0003e;0.05). Our findings suggest that performance was improved in the evening, and it was accompanied by an improved hormonal and metabolic <italic>milieu</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Alagoas Research Foundation (FAPEAL, process number: 20110825-011-0025-0004).

Recently, Hettinga et al. <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> have demonstrated that the difference between the fastest and the slowest performance times for four 1500-m cycling TT (a few seconds longer than a 1000-m cycling TT) was related to a higher aerobic peak power, and a higher and earlier anaerobic peak power during the fastest trial. These authors suggested that athletes paced themselves according to their optimal physiological condition at that moment (fastest and slowest), indicating that athletes may be able to effectively adjust their pacing profile based on their &#x0201c;status of the day&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is interesting to observe that there is some evidence that the contribution of the aerobic and anaerobic systems is increased in the evening compared with in the morning <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-Souissi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, suggesting that the time of day may be a potential factor influencing both energy system distribution and pacing, although there are no studies that have directly tested this relationship. The effect of time of day on pacing may be more notable during a short-distance cycling TT, in which pacing may be determined by the interplay between aerobic and anaerobic responses to the exercise.</p><p>To date, studies investigating the influence of time of day on performance have concentrated on intermittent, Wingate or constant-load exercise <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109954-Racinais2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, but pacing has not been formally reported. Giacomoni et al. <xref rid="pone.0109954-Giacomoni1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> analyzed the effect of the time of day (morning 8&#x02013;10 am and evening 5&#x02013;7 pm) on performance during an all-out, intermittent exercise (10 maximal 6-s sprints interspersed with 30 s of recovery) and observed a higher crank peak torque in the earlier sprints during the evening, but the overall mechanical work was not altered, suggesting that the earlier peak torque in the evening does not affect overall performance <xref rid="pone.0109954-Racinais2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Corroborating these findings, Hill et al. <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> showed a higher total work performed during a constant-power cycle ergometer test (5.0 W&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for women and 6.0 W&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for men) in the afternoon compared with the morning, and that this greater work was associated with a larger anaerobic and aerobic contribution. The underlying mechanism explaining the greater energy expenditure and consequently improved performance in the evening is not fully understood, but a slightly increased core temperature in the evening could increase nerve conduction velocity and vasodilatation, which in turn would increase muscular supply and substrate elimination, thereby improving glycogenolysis and glycolysis <xref rid="pone.0109954-Bessot1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. While these results would support that performance during a short-distance cycling TT might be increased in the evening, due to an increase in the aerobic and/or anaerobic energy expenditure, to the best of our knowledge no study has measured the effect of time of day on performance and associated pacing alterations during a TT.</p><p>There is also limited research connecting circadian variations in hormone levels with pacing <xref rid="pone.0109954-Reilly1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It has been demonstrated that epinephrine and norepinephrine have an &#x0223c;12-h circadian rhythm with two large peaks at 7:00&#x02013;10:30 am and 8:00&#x02013;10:00 pm, but with the largest exercise-induced increase in epinephrine ocurring at &#x0223c;8:30 am <xref rid="pone.0109954-Scheer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Cortisol and testosterone also peak at &#x0223c;8:00 am, but do not seem to respond to exercise <xref rid="pone.0109954-Deschenes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, growth hormone (GH) seems to be slightly reduced in the morning, but its response to exercise is not altered <xref rid="pone.0109954-Galliven1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition, the effect of circadian rhythm on insulin and glucagon, two hormones that are strongly linked with metabolic <italic>milieu</italic> and could influence performance during different times of day, is unknown. Given that performance during a short-distance cycling TT is dependent on the ability of athletes to produce and maintain a high level of power output throughout the test <xref rid="pone.0109954-Lericollais1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the coordinate action of these hormones might be associated with an improved or impaired performance. For example, epinephrine and norepinephrine prepare the body for an immediate action increasing several physiological markers (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, metabolic rate, and glycogenolysis and glycolysis), while cortisol increases general physiological stress and, together with glucagon and GH, increases blood glucose. Elevated testosterone concentration may be involved with an increased neuromuscular efficiency and force output <xref rid="pone.0109954-Sale1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus, an improved performance at a given time of day might be associated with hormonal and metabolic at rest and/or during the exercise. However, while circadian rhythms for some hormones have been relatively well characterized <xref rid="pone.0109954-Scheer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109954-Galliven1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, their integrated responses and association with TT performance have not been clarified.</p><p>The present study therefore aimed to investigate performance, pacing, energy system and muscle recruitment distributions, and hormonal responses, during a 1000-m cycling TT performed in the morning (8:00 am) or in the evening (6:00 pm). The 1000-m cycling time trial was chosen as it is energetically supported by both the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems <xref rid="pone.0109954-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-VanIngenSchenau1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and performance is influenced by pacing strategy <xref rid="pone.0109954-VanIngenSchenau1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We hypothesized that performance would be improved in the evening, and that this would be associated with an altered hormonal and metabolic <italic>milieu</italic> at rest and/or during the exercise, and a greater aerobic and anaerobic contribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Nine recreational cyclists [Mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD): age 31&#x000b1;7.3 years, height 175&#x000b1;7.8 cm, body mass 73.5&#x000b1;11.6 kg, body fat 11.6&#x000b1;4.7%, peak oxygen uptake (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109954.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula> O<sub>2</sub>peak) 49&#x000b1;7 ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, peak power output (PPO) 253&#x000b1;52 W] participated in this study.

A standardized knee extensor warm up, consisting of four 5-s contractions at intensities corresponding 50, 60, 70 and 80% of the maximum subjective force (30-s rest periods between the repetitions), was performed immediately before the MVC. The participants were verbally encouraged during the MVC to achieve their maximal force. Force was recorded using a load cell (EMG System of Brazil, S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; dos Campos, Brazil). Electromyographic activity signals from the vastus lateralis (VL) of the right leg were recorded via bipolar Ag-AgCl surface electrode at an interelectrode distance of 20 mm. The VL was chosen because it has been reported as the most appropriate to monitor EMG activity in the lower limb during a cycling TT <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The reference electrode was placed over the anterior surface of the tibia. The skin preparation, placement and location of the electrodes were in accordance with the recommendations of SENIAM <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hermens1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To prevent movement artifact, the electrodes' wires were taped to the skin using adhesive tape (Micropore 3 M, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). Raw EMG signal was recorded during 5 seconds, with a sample rate of 2000 Hz, for each MVC (model 410c EMG System of Brazil Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; dos Campos, Brazil). During the MVC and TT, raw EMG signals were full-wave rectified and filtered with second-order, Butterworth, band-pass filters with cut-off frequencies set at 10 and 400 Hz to remove external interference noise and movement artifacts. Integrated EMG (iEMG) obtained every 200 m during the TT was normalized by dividing by the iEMG calculated at the point coinciding with peak torque of the highest MVC. The procedures were performed using MATLAB software.</p><p>After completion of the MVC procedures, the participants were transferred to the cycle ergotrainer.

Coefficient of variation to a similar time-trial was assumed to be 0.9% <xref rid="pone.0109954-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Detection of a very conservative 1% difference as statistically significant would require at least 6 participants. Considering possible dropouts during the study, the sample was inflated by 50%, resulting in a final sample size of 9 participants. Data distribution was analysed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, total and free testosterone, epinephrine, nor epinephrine, and glucose were transformed into natural log values as they did not satisfy the assumptions of normality. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with repeated measures (period &#x000d7; time), followed by Bonferroni adjustment, was used to compare the physiological, metabolic and hormonal response during the trials. When violations to the assumptions of sphericity were observed, the degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser corrections.

Although visually the power output appears to be maintained at a higher value over the last 400 m in the evening when compared to morning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109954-g002">figure 2</xref>), these alterations failed to reach statistical significance. In addition, no apparent differences between the morning and evening Pan and Paer profiles during the trial were identified. Instead, there were moderate effect sizes for the mean Pan and Paer, with higher values observed in the evening (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109954-t001">table 1</xref>). These increased mean Pan and Paer in the evening accompanied a moderate effect size for mean PO and a large effect size to time performance in favor of evening (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109954-t001">table 1</xref>). Together, these results suggest that improvement in performance in the evening trial was not caused either by alteration in a unique energy system (i.e. aerobic or anaerobic), or by a rise in the aerobic or anaerobic energy supply at a given time point of the trial. Instead, performance in the evening seemed to be improved due a concomitant and maintained increase in aerobic and anaerobic contributions throughout the trial. These results are in agreement with other studies showing that an enhanced performance in the evening is accompanied by a slightly increase in both the aerobic and anaerobic contribution <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-Giacomoni1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>In parallel with a different performance between the morning and evening, we also observed hormonal and metabolic differences between the times of day. Insulin was increased and GH was reduced in the morning. Plasma glucose was also reduced in the morning. On the other hand, cortisol levels were increased in the morning. Cortisol levels peak in the morning and decrease linearly throughout the day with the lowest value being reached at &#x0223c;8:30 pm <xref rid="pone.0109954-Teo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This elevated cortisol in the morning is indicative of an increased physiological stress, and it would be expected to elevate plasma glucose <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hakkinen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, as insulin reduces plasma glucose levels <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hammouda1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, any effect of cortisol on plasma glucose may have been off-set. In addition, the circadian profile of GH produces a peak concentration in the night during the first two hours of sleep, but is reduced in the morning <xref rid="pone.0109954-Takahashi2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A reduced GH concentration in the morning may have contributed to the reduced plasma glucose concentration <xref rid="pone.0109954-Takahashi2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-Kanabrocki1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-Romijn1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We hypothesise therefore that elevated insulin, as well as reduced GH concentrations in the morning, may not create an optimal metabolic <italic>milieu</italic> to meet the best performance It is also interesting to note that the norepinephrine response to exercise was amplified in the morning compared to the evening, and this was accompanied by a tendency for a greater plasma glucose response to the exercise. This higher norepinephrine response to the exercise in the morning may have occurred to counterbalance the reduced plasma glucose concentration. Norepinephrine can increase plasma glucose by either its direct effect on hepatic glucogenolysis <xref rid="pone.0109954-DiConstanzo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-Puschel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> or indirectly by increased mobilization of free fatty acids <xref rid="pone.0109954-MoraRodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>We also found that free and total testosterone levels were higher in the morning than in the evening, and both increased with exercise at both times of day. It has been documented that testosterone presents a biorhythmic effect with the highest values in the morning (08:00 am) and the lowest in the evening (08:00 pm), but that the acute response to exercise is similar at different times of the day <xref rid="pone.0109954-Deschenes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109954-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Little attention has been given to the metabolic effects of testosterone and its relation with fatigue. Positive correlations between the basal level of testosterone and sprinting and explosive power performances have been found <xref rid="pone.0109954-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Elevated testosterone concentration may be involved with an increased neuromuscular efficiency <xref rid="pone.0109954-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling mechanism in the fast-twitch muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0109954-Sale1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Therefore, while an elevated testosterone in the morning could partially compensate the negative metabolic <italic>milieu</italic>, perhaps via signaling process into the cells, further studies investigating the acute molecular effect of testosterone and it relationship with biorhythms are necessaries to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that we recruited recreational cyclists and these results should not be extrapolated to other groups such as highly-trained athletes or sedentary/clinical populations. Further studies should be performed investigating if the effects found in the present study are reproducible in these populations. It is also important to underline that competitions do not always occur in the evening. However, training can be performed in both the morning and evening. It is necessary to recognize that training may have to be performed under unfavorable conditions, but as close as possible to the competition environment and conditions (e.g. if the competition is in the morning). Corroborating with this last statement, Edwards et al. <xref rid="pone.0109954-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> observed that performance was better when the previous training was performed in the early morning (07:00 AM) than in the noon (12:00 AM). These results suggest that exercise performance may be acutely altered by the habitual timing of training, and underline the necessity to understand the effects of exercise and training at different time of days.</p><p>In conclusion, performance was impaired in the morning compared with the evening, but it was not associated with a clear alteration in pacing, an aerobic and anaerobic energy supply distribuition. Morning exercise was performed in a less favorable metabolic <italic>milieu</italic> (i.e. elevated insulin and cortisol, and reduced plasma glucose levels), combined with an exacerbated norepinephrine and plasma glucose response to the exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Fernandes, AL is grateful to Alagoas Research Foundation -FAPEAL (process number: 20110825-011-0025-0004).
