Nursery measurements will include the Environmental Policy Assessment and Observation score and the nursery staff's review of the nursery environment. Child measurements will include height and weight to calculate z-score body mass index (zBMI), accelerometer-determined minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day and sedentary time, and diet using the Child and Diet Evaluation Tool.

In England, 22.6% of children starting primary school are overweight or obese.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Internationally, the highest prevalence of childhood obesity and overweight is in the USA; however, rates in the UK and Australia remain high and the UK has one of the highest rates among European countries with Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain having higher rates.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Physical activity in children is associated with lower levels of cardiometabolic risk factors including blood lipids, blood pressure and improved psychological well-being.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Physical activity patterns track moderately from childhood to adulthood indicating that physical activity is associated with short-term and longer-term health among children.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In 2012, only 10% children aged 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;years in England were classified as meeting the current guidelines for children under 5&#x02005;years,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> of at least 3&#x02005;h of physical activity per day. Children aged 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;years in the UK are sedentary for an average of 10&#x02013;11&#x02005;h/day.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Childcare settings provide opportunities to deliver interventions at the population level.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Around 97% of children aged 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;years in England attend some form of government-funded early years education, of which 39% attend day care outside school settings.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, not all childcare settings are health-promoting environments. Assessment of physical activity in children aged 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years at childcare in the USA has shown that children spend only 3% of time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A study in England found that 593 children aged 4&#x02005;years with valid accelerometer data met national guidelines for physical activity. However, this was mainly a light level of activity and children who attended nursery full time were more sedentary and less active in the mornings, with no differences in the rest of the day, compared with children who attended part time.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The findings in this study contrast with other studies internationally which find young children not meeting national guidelines. This may reflect differences in the populations studied, as well as methods of data collection and analysis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> As MVPA is closely associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and body mass index (BMI) in adolescence,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> it is of concern that such a small proportion of time in childcare is spent in MVPA. Further, around 80% of time at childcare is spent in sedentary activities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Childcare settings can be a strong predictor of physical activity levels and being outdoors is one of the most powerful correlates of physical activity in children.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In addition, suitability of indoor play space and carer encouragement of indoor play are also predictors of MVPA.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The lack of MVPA in childcare settings may be influenced by constraints of space, lack of equipment, lack of scheduled times for free play and outdoor play. A systematic review of interventions to increase physical activity in childcare settings found that regularly provided, structured physical activity programmes can increase the amount and intensity of physical activity.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>A diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in saturated fat has been associated with reduced risk of adult heart disease, many forms of cancer and all-cause mortality.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Dietary patterns are established during childhood, yet 32% of boys and 18% of girls aged 18&#x02005;months to 10&#x02005;years are reported as eating no fruit during a 4-day period.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Food and drink which is high in non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES) is frequently high in calories but not in other essential nutrients and these items contribute to weight gain and tooth decay. Soft drinks contribute 14% to the intake of NMES in children aged 1&#x02013;3&#x02005;years and 19% to the intake of NMES in those aged 4&#x02013;10&#x02005;years. Saturated fat intake is also higher than the recommended 11% of total daily energy intake, at 15% for children aged 1&#x02013;3&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Preschool-aged children of low-income parents are more likely to consume table sugar and soft drinks compared with more affluent groups.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In 2013, nearly a third (31%) of children aged 5&#x02005;years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland had experienced obvious tooth decay in their primary teeth.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Childcare centre practices and policies have been identified to have an influence on children's obesogenic dietary intake.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A cross-sectional study assessing food, drink, feeding behaviour and practices in relation to national guidelines in nurseries in England found that nurseries in the most deprived areas reported serving more healthy foods (whole grains, legumes, pulses, and lentils) compared with those in less deprived areas. However, a large percentage of nurseries were not meeting national guidelines&#x02014;for example, 83.7% were not serving diluted fruit juice and 71.6% were not providing oily fish every few weeks.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Three systematic reviews of obesity prevention, physical activity and nutrition in young children have all identified the lack of intervention studies and the need for more research with robust study designs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The Cochrane review of obesity prevention in children identified a lack of effective obesity prevention interventions for children aged 0&#x02013;5&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In addition, the review recommended that studies need to better report the impact on the environment, setting and sustainability and suggested that studies testing interventions be guided by theories such as the socioecological model.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Larson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> reviewed the regulations, practices, policies and interventions for promoting healthy eating and physical activity and for preventing obesity in children attending childcare settings. This review identified a lack of strong regulation in childcare settings in relation to health behaviours such as physical activity and diet. Yet, within childcare settings, there is ample opportunity to improve nutritional quality, time engaged in physical activity and caregivers' promotion of health behaviours. There have been a limited number of childcare interventions,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and only two interventions have successfully demonstrated an effect on body weight.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) intervention was developed in the USA to fill this research and practice gap.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> NAP SACC aims to improve the nutrition and physical activity environment, policies and practices in childcare settings through self-assessment and targeted technical assistance. It addresses nutrition, physical activity and sedentary behaviours by giving providers a choice of where to focus change. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NAP SACC in the USA have demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, the effectiveness of improving the environmental audit nutrition score (11% improvement from a baseline Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) score of 8.6),<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> increase in nursery staff's knowledge of childhood obesity, healthy eating, personal health and working with families (all at p&#x0003c;0.05 level), decrease in children's z-score BMI (zBMI; p=0.02)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and an increase in accelerometer-measured physical activity by 17% (p&#x0003c;0.05) and 46.2% increase in vigorous activity (p&#x0003c;0.05).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>The current feasibility cluster randomised trial will use an adapted NAP SACC intervention for use in the UK, with an additional home component to involve parents, and will test the acceptability of the intervention, randomisation and the study measures. The study aims to assess whether prespecified criteria relating to the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial design are met sufficiently for progression to a full-scale RCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010622F1">figure 1</xref>).

In England, health visitors are nurses or midwives who have received additional training. Health visitors provide a universal service to support all families while a child is aged 0&#x02013;5&#x02005;years, including development checks and giving information about health such as parenting, immunisation, breast feeding and weaning. Four health visitors will be recruited from the local health visiting service (based on availability rather than any pre-existing links to nurseries) and trained to work with nursery managers and staff to deliver the intervention, by supporting the nursery in the Review and Reflect process, identifying goals and actions and providing ongoing support in the changes over 6&#x02005;months. The training for the NAP SACC UK Partners will be provided by local experts in nutrition, oral health and physical activity who work with childcare settings. NAP SACC UK Partner time and travel expenses will be reimbursed. Local experts in nutrition and physical activity will deliver two training sessions to nursery staff in each nursery in the intervention arm. The training will aim to raise knowledge, self-efficacy and motivation to make changes in the areas addressed by NAP SACC UK and to involve all the nursery staff in the action planning process.</p><p>In addition to the intervention in nurseries, we have developed a home component, informed by other studies of behaviour change with parents of young children<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> use of digital media,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and interviews and focus groups with parents, nursery managers and health visitors.

The secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), prior to the intervention and 8&#x02013;10&#x02005;months after the baseline (T1). Multiple visits will be made to nurseries to maximise participant retention. Assessment of the secondary outcomes will inform the choice of primary outcomes for a full-scale trial. Further, it will inform whether the outcomes require data collected from parents/children, or if the outcomes could be the environmental audit and child zBMI obtained using anonymised data linkage with the National Child Measurement Programme. The secondary outcomes to be measured will include:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) instrument score</italic>: The EPAO instrument assesses childcare nutrition and physical activity environments, policies and practices and was developed using the standards, recommendations and research literature upon which the NAP SACC intervention itself was based.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It has been tested for validity and reliability in nursery settings in the USA.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The EPAO consists of a 1-day observation and review of pertinent centre childcare settings' documents using 189-item questions and 16 free-text sections, with the average of all subscale scores representing total nutrition and physical activity scores. The EPAO has been adapted for use in nurseries in the UK and is administered by a researcher trained by a member of the US NAP SACC research team and blind to childcare provider allocation.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Anthropometric measures of children:</italic> zBMI and proportion of overweight and obese, as determined by the UK 1990 age and gender reference charts at 85% and 95% centiles, respectively<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, with further sensitivity analysis using the International Obesity Task Force thresholds<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> to facilitate international comparisons. zBMI has been demonstrated to be a good measure of change in childhood adiposity.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> All anthropometric measurements will be completed with children with one trained fieldworker and a member of nursery staff present. Weight will be measured without shoes in light clothing to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;kg using a Seca digital scale. Height will be measured, to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;cm, without shoes, using a portable Harpenden stadiometer. All measurements will be repeated and the mean measurement used. Fieldworkers will be trained to ensure correct position for height assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Accelerometer-measured activity</italic> (mean minutes of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous activity per day).

Mean accelerometer counts per minute, which provide an indication of the overall volume of physical activity in which the children engage, will also be calculated as this approach facilitates comparison with studies that may have applied a different cut-point.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Children's food and drink intake</italic>: Dietary assessment will be performed using the Child and Diet Evaluation Tool (CADET) diary as a 24&#x02005;h recall, an instrument validated for use in intervention studies with young children.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> CADET will be completed by trained research staff observing food and drink consumption at nursery (to reflect diet at nursery settings), and parents will be asked to complete it for any other food and drink consumed on that day (to reflect diet at home). Parents in a sample of four nurseries will be asked to complete the CADET for 2&#x02005;days at a weekend to test the feasibility of collecting weekend diet data using CADET. Parents in a sample of two nurseries will be invited to complete the CADET over the telephone to compare with sending the CADET home for parental completion.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Sedentary behaviours:</italic> In addition to the accelerometer assessments, sedentary behaviours will also be assessed by asking parents to record all screen time (TV, laptop, desktop computer, tablet, mobile phone, games console or handheld games console) and quiet play time (looking at books, playing with blocks, playing with dolls/soft toys, doing puzzles, drawing or construction) during the day the CADET tool was completed and the previous Saturday.

Children will receive a small thank-you gift (worth up to &#x000a3;1) for each of the two data collections. The gifts will be used in intervention and control arms. The small gift is designed to ensure that all accelerometers are returned promptly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>A process evaluation will assess the fidelity of intervention delivery calculating reach and dose and will document the views of participants about what worked well and what could be improved if we proceed to a larger trial. In addition, it will collect information about the context, facilitators and barriers to delivering the intervention.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> The process evaluation will include observations of the training for the health visitor and nursery staff and meetings between the NAP SACC UK Partner and each of the childcare providers. Nursery managers and NAP SACC UK Partners will be asked to complete logs of meetings including goals set, support given and progress made, and for the managers, changes made and reflections on these changes. Semistructured interviews will be conducted with all nursery managers in the providers, a sample of nursery staff, the NAP SACC UK Partners and sufficient numbers of parents until saturation is reached.</p><p>The home component will be evaluated with respect to use of the website and Facebook group, goal setting, text messages and emails using reports from the website and via semistructured interviews with parents who have different levels of engagement with the home component (none, low and high).</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Any protocol modifications will be submitted for ethics approval. Written informed consent will be obtained for all participants. As the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in the UK are unknown, we believe randomising participants to the intervention or usual care is warranted. All data will be held securely in accordance with Data Protection Regulations. Participant confidentiality will be maintained at all times. Findings will be widely disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, at conferences and to public health commissioners. Participants in the trial phase will be offered the option to receive a summary of the results once the study is complete.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size for this feasibility study was not informed by a power calculation. The choice of 12 nurseries will provide some information on variability within and between nurseries at baseline and follow-up. This sample will not provide a usefully precise estimate of the intervention effect. However, the sample will indicate the likely response rates and intracluster correlations (ICCs) in anticipation of a larger trial. We will also use information on effect sizes and ICCs from other adequately powered diet, physical activity and obesity prevention trials to inform any calculation for a future phase III trial.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation of nurseries will occur after all nurseries have completed baseline data collection. The nurseries will be the unit of allocation to two arms: NAP SACC UK or no intervention (usual practice). Allocation will be conducted by an independent statistician at the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC), blind to the identity of the nurseries. Stratified randomisation will be used to ensure that the numbers of participants receiving each intervention are closely balanced within each stratum. Stratification will be based first on high/low England IMD for the local super output area where the nursery is located; the 12 selected childcare providers will be ranked by their IMD scores separately for North Somerset and Gloucestershire; the highest 3 and lowest 3 in North Somerset and highest 3 and lowest 3 in Gloucestershire will be assigned to the strata. Stratification will be based second on location (North Somerset or Gloucestershire). Childcare providers in the control arm will continue with their usual planned activities and policies. The randomisation procedure blinds all staff and casual fieldworkers to the allocation of nurseries at the baseline data collection. The trial statistician (CM) will have no contact with the nurseries, participants or the study fieldworkers.</p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>Data management</title><p>Data will be entered and transcribed by the research staff using a secure data management system at the University of Bristol. Completed questionnaires will be transported to the University of Bristol by the study manager or the recruited fieldworkers. Data from questionnaires will be stored in anonymised form, using participant identification numbers. Participant identification numbers and corresponding participant names will be held in separate files. Both files will be stored in secure password-protected folders. Individuals' names will be replaced with pseudonyms in interview/focus group transcripts. A list of participant names, pseudonyms and their unique identification number will be held securely in a separate location. Digital recordings of interviews/focus groups will be stored securely and will be held separately from transcripts and information on participant identities.</p></sec><sec id="s1g"><title>Analysis</title><p>The statistical analyses for this feasibility study will be primarily descriptive, providing realistic estimates of eligibility, recruitment, intervention delivery and retention rates in the study population, with 95% CIs calculated to incorporate between-provider variation where appropriate. The CONSORT flow diagram for clinical trial reporting will be completed. Summary statistics will also be presented for the outcome measures using means and SDs by allocation arm and key demographic variables as these will also inform the sample size and recruitment plan for the main trial. Differences will be explored for each of these measures by study location (North Somerset/Gloucestershire) and deprivation (high vs low). Comparisons will be made between those who complete the study and those who drop out to investigate if this is a potential source of bias. Missing data will not be imputed for the purposes of the feasibility study. However, the extent of missing data will be examined and described to inform the full trial. Stata statistical software will be used for all analyses.</p><p>We do not plan an economic evaluation alongside this feasibility trial. Our aim is to pilot measures of resource use and estimate more precisely the cost of the intervention to inform a full-scale trial. Costs and outcomes will be presented in a cost-consequence table. We will delineate the resource use (eg, h), unit costs (eg, cost/h) and calculate mean, provider and parental costs in the intervention and control groups. We will estimate incremental costs and 95% CIs for descriptive purposes.</p><p>For the qualitative analysis, all interview recordings will be transcribed verbatim and anonymised. As the data are exploratory, we will adopt a thematic analytical approach. Meaningful content will be coded and codes grouped to form themes that describe the content of codes. Quotations which best represent the nature of each theme will then be extracted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s2"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes the protocol for the NAP SACC UK feasibility trial, which is attempting to improve the nursery environment and health of children aged 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;years with respect to nutrition, oral health, physical activity and sedentary time. Many young children in the UK do not achieve national standards for nutrition, oral health or physical activity and, upon entry to primary school, overweight and obesity are prevalent. Childcare settings are increasingly important in the UK with 15&#x02005;h/week provided free for children aged 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;years and the intention is to increase this to 30&#x02005;h/week for children in England by 2017.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Given the lack of effective interventions to increase physical activity and healthy eating in young children, and the small number of trials which have been conducted in childcare settings in the UK, this study will provide important information to inform research and practice. The goal of this feasibility trial is to assess the potential of this intervention, developed and used successfully in the USA, to be adapted for use in the UK, expanded to involve parents and to provide all the information necessary to design a cluster RCT in UK childcare settings.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial status</title><p>The current study status (26 January 2016): we have obtained ethical approval for the study, funding for the study and have recruited all project staff. Nursery and child recruitment began in August 2015 and baseline data collection started in September 2015 and will be completed by mid-February 2016. NAP SACC UK Partner training took place in December 2015 and January 2016 and the intervention will start in February 2016. At the inaugural meeting of the TSC, it was agreed that a data monitoring committee was not necessary as there were no safety concerns associated with implementing NAPSACC UK and no interim analyses were planned.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Trial governance</title><p>The principal investigator (RK) will have overall responsibility for the conduct of the study.</p><p>Day-to-day management will be coordinated by the trial manager (SW/AN) who will be closely monitored and supported by the principal investigator. A TMG is chaired monthly by the principal investigator and includes the coinvestigators and the trial manager. In addition, the principal investigator will meet with the trial manager every 2&#x02005;weeks to address day-to-day issues. We will form a Local Advisory Group (LAG) of representatives from our collaborators including early years advisors in the councils, health visitors, childcare managers, childcare staff and parents. The LAG will advise on the delivery of the intervention and provide guidance on any provider-related, parent-related or child-related issues that might arise during the course of the intervention. The LAG will meet twice during the intervention year and immediately before the follow-up assessment. An independent TSC has been established. The TSC comprises professor Russell Viner (chair, University College London and London NHS Foundation Trust), professor Sian Robinson (University of Southampton), Dr Brad Metcalfe (University of Exeter), Claire Wilson (health visitor), Trudy May (nursery manager), Shelia Ogilvie (health visitor), Justine Britton (nursery manager) and Ruth Kipping (PI).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Safety monitoring and reporting</title><p>Nursery managers and those delivering the intervention will be asked to contact the study team within 5 working days if any untoward incident or adverse event (AE) occurs to a member of staff or child, as a direct result of taking part in NAP SACC UK, or due to changes that have occurred in the nursery environment due to participation in NAP SACC UK. In these cases, study-specific AE/incident report forms will be used to record information on the event. All AE/incident report forms will be discussed with the principal investigator to assess seriousness and to confirm causality. All AEs deemed to be &#x02018;serious&#x02019; (SAE) will be reported to the sponsor within 24&#x02005;h. Where the SAE is suspected to be related to the intervention and unexpected (NB: there are no expected events for this intervention), that is, a suspected unrelated serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), the chair of the TSC and the REC will be notified within 15&#x02005;days of the study team receiving the initial report.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study is sponsored by the University of Bristol.
