With advances in medicine and prolonged life expectancy, the proportion of older people will continue to rise worldwide.</p><p>Those unable to live independently at home are being cared for in a range of settings, and varying degrees of dependency means that many are unable to attend fully to their needs.</p><p>Those elderly people who live in nursing homes are often frail, have poor manual dexterity, and rely on the knowledge and skills of their caregivers to control and prevent dental disease. Hence, programs promoting oral health for the aged in nursing homes need to focus on educating the caretakers of these people.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Nurses and care staff require the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively meet the oral care needs of older people who are unable to do this for themselves. The need for dental health education of caretakers of elderly people is widely acknowledged and strongly recommended based on the investigations conducted on the dental needs of elderly people.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Practical training for nurses and auxiliary care staff has frequently been recommended as a way of improving oral health care for functionally dependent elderly.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In response to this need, a study was designed to evaluate an oral health education program for the caregivers of institutionalized elderly in Bangalore city, India and to develop the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior that are required for the prevention of dental disease in their clients.</p><p>The scientific hypothesis of the present study was that oral health care education for caretakers would result in significant improvement in their oral health knowledge, attitudes, and practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was a cluster randomized intervention trial with an institution as the unit of randomization. Research data was gathered at baseline and at 6 months after the start of the study. The study was supervised and monitored by two investigators. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (version 17c, 2004) and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board, The Oxford Dental College and Research Centre, Bangalore, India.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>There were 65 old age homes in Bangalore city, in which there were around 690 caretakers. This information was collected from THE ELDERS HELPLINE 1090 (a project of Bangalore city and Nightingales Medical Trust, a voluntary organization working for elders&#x02019; welfare and other sources).</p><p>The sample size required for this study was 10% of the caretakers, that is, 70 (35 per group).</p><p>A random sample of seven elderly homes accommodating a total of 78 caretakers in Bangalore city was selected. The elderly homes selected had no previous history of Oral Health Education Program. Out of the seven homes, three elderly homes were assigned to the intervention group and four to the control group randomly, which met the required sample of 35 each. Keeping attrition in mind, an additional eight caretakers were taken.</p><p>Once the manager of an institution agreed to participate by giving a written informed consent, the institution was randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group.</p><p>Prior to start of the study, the details of the study were explained to the caretakers and a written informed consent was obtained from the participating caretakers.</p><p>A 15-item questionnaire with a three-point Likert Scale (yes, no, and don&#x02019;t know) was developed in English to assess the oral health information of the caretakers pre and post intervention. Its respective psychometric properties (validity and reliability) were assessed. Content validity was assessed by a panel of eight experts consisting of staff members of the Department of Public Health Dentistry, The Oxford Dental College, Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore. The purpose was to depict those items with a high degree of agreement among the experts. Aiken's V was used to quantify the concordance between experts for each item; values higher than 0.92 were always obtained.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Before commencing the study, a pilot study was performed among the caretakers in an elderly home to check the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The results thus obtained were subjected to statistical analysis. Cronbach's alpha value of 0.82 showed good internal consistency of the questionnaire.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The questionnaire was distributed among 78 caretakers and the respondents were instructed to fill the questionnaire without discussing with each other; the response rate was 100%. The preliminary section was designed to gather demographic data, and the anonymity of the respondents was assured. The second section was concerned with questions related to oral health knowledge, attitude, and practice.</p><p>The health educator was trained before the commencement of the study. He gave a PowerPoint presentation on oral health to the caretakers and a live demonstration of oral hygiene techniques on study models. Also, a health education CD and manual were provided to the respective institutions.</p><p>Research data was gathered by another investigator who was not aware of the group allotment, at baseline and at 6 months. At baseline, oral health education and demonstration was provided to the caretakers in the intervention group. Reinforcement of oral health education was given to the caretakers of the intervention group after 3 months, and oral health education was given to the caretakers of the control group at the end of 6 months. Finally, at the end of the study, a process evaluation was conducted in the institutions using the same questionnaire used at the baseline. The investigator did not know whether the institution was allocated to the intervention or the control group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out in the present study. Statistical software, namely SPSS 15.0, was used. Chi-square/Fisher exact test was used to find the significance of the study parameters on a categorical scale between two or more groups. Paired proportion test was used to find the significance of change in proportion from initial to final knowledge and practice assessment. Significance was assessed at 5% level of significance with 95% confidence interval.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The present study was carried out for a period of 6 months.

Those unable to live independently at home are being cared for in a range of settings and with varying degrees of dependency. These dependent elderly people residing at the old age homes are usually bedridden with compromised health conditions. Old age is associated with being edentulous or partially edentulous. Epidemiological studies reveal that in general, the oral health of elderly people is poor.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] So, oral disease can be considered as a public health problem due to its high prevalence and significant social impact.</p><p>Due to the educational level and the professional role of the nurses, it is expected that they have enough knowledge in the community about oral health and its diseases. Keeping in mind the expected role to be played by the nursing staff, a need was felt for assessing the oral health related knowledge, attitude, and practice among these caretakers. A questionnaire written in English was used for the collection of data in this study, which constituted 15 questions. To obtain genuine responses, the anonymity of the respondents was ensured.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Oral health knowledge of caretakers</title><p>Oral health promotion seeks to achieve sustainable improvement in oral health and reduce the inequalities through action directed at the underlying determinants of oral health. An essential component of this process is health education. The oral health education program was directed at caretakers, since the functionally dependent elderly residents are unlikely to benefit from direct oral health education. Caretakers were targeted, since they provide personal care for up to 90% of elderly residents. The health education sessions were planned with the achievable aim of increasing the caretakers&#x02019; awareness, knowledge, and skills in oral health care. It is well documented that there is significant improvement in the oral hygiene practices of elderly residents by educating their caretakers.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the present study, oral health education intervention was given at baseline and reinforcement was given at the end of 3 months. Oral health education to the control group was provided only at the end of 6 months.</p><p>At baseline, the knowledge of caretakers regarding oral health, importance of oral hygiene, denture care and denture hygiene, and importance of dental check-ups was poor. Post intervention, there was significant improvement in the oral hygiene knowledge of the caretakers of the study group, whereas there was no improvement in the oral hygiene knowledge of the caretakers of the control group. There was significant improvement in the knowledge on importance of oral health and oral hygiene, use of fluorides, denture care and denture hygiene practices, management of dry mouth, and importance of regular dental check-ups. These results were similar to those of studies conducted by Paulsson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Simons <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Nicol <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] These improvements reflected the effectiveness of the oral health education program.</p><p>However, it is recognized that within long-term care facilities, numerous problems mitigate against routine provision of oral health care and encourage neglect. Some of the reasons for neglect include: Lack of personal perception of oral health problems by residents, inability of residents to articulate a need, family members placing dental care as a low priority, long-term care staff placing patients&#x02019; dental care as a low priority, limitations of long-term care staff like heavy workloads and psychological barriers like cleaning other person's mouth, inadequate oral hygiene aids, and difficulty in obtaining dental care.</p><p>It is generally more difficult to evaluate the benefits of health education than of direct therapies. The design of this trial and its community setting made it likely to have both internal validity and to be generalizable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Educating the caretakers for assisting or enabling residents for maintaining oral hygiene is essential; implementation of oral health management in their course curriculum is required; and oral health awareness among these health care providers should be done on a regular basis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of the present study showed that oral health knowledge among the caretakers of the elderly residents was poor at baseline; post intervention, there was a significant improvement in the oral health knowledge among the caretakers. So, in the present study, the oral health education provided to the caretakers was effective.
