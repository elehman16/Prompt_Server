massage on exercise-induced back fatigue in athletes. [Subjects and Methods] Twelve male
college athletes, randomly allocated to experimental or control groups, were instructed to
perform reverse sit-up for 8 sessions until they became fatigued. The experimental group
received a 20-min mechanical-bed massage session, while the control group rested on a bed
for the same period of time. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on perceived back muscle fatigue,
back muscle endurance, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters including stress index
(SI), HRV index, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, LF, HF, and LF/HF were analyzed. [Results]
Immediately and 24 hours after the intervention, the VAS significantly differed between
the groups. Experimental group&#x02019;s HF was significantly higher immediately after the
intervention than control group. Experimental group&#x02019;s LF and LF/HF were significantly
lower immediately after the intervention than the control group. [Conclusion] Mechanical
bed massage may help athletes overcome the subjective feelings of exercise-induced
fatigue, modulate the automatic nervous system activity, especially for balancing
sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. Therefore, mechanical bed massage may
facilitate recovery from muscle and central fatigue after athlete training or
competition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mechanical-bed massage</kwd><kwd>Exercise-induced fatigue</kwd><kwd>Heart rate variability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Manual massage can be defined as the manipulation of the soft tissues of the body by a
trained therapist as a component of a holistic therapeutic intervention<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the mechanism of massage on the body is still
unclear, it has been used as one of the modalities for rehabilitation and promoting
relaxation for thousands of years around the world. In the recent years, according to some
observations, experiences, and evidence-based studies, sports medicine experts, coaches, and
athletes believe that manual massage can have several benefits to the body; therefore,
massage is widely used in sports. Recovery from fatigue and elimination of fatigue are the
examples of these benefits. Manual massage has been found to affect both the body&#x02019;s overall
fatigue<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as local fatigue,
such as thumb fatigue<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, quadriceps
fatigue<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and lumbar muscle fatigue<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mechanical massage refers to the manipulation of soft tissues using machines, which include
chair, bed, and other mechanical devices. Most of the mechanical massage techniques imitate
manual massage. A comparison of manual massage with mechanical massage shows that the
instruments have several advantages<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. With the increasing number of mechanical
massage device users, massage devices are becoming more and more popular, especially the
mechanical massage chair and bed. The total sales of mechanical massage instrument in the
world keep increasing: 5.6 billion dollars in 2008, 8.1 billion dollars in 2012, and 10
billion dollars in 2015<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Japanese are
more likely than people from other countries to use mechanical massage chair and bed,
accounting for 46% of the Japanese households. The market penetration of mechanical massage
chair or bed is more than 40% in the developed countries of Europe and Americas, over 10% in
South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Some benefits of mechanical massage have been described by researchers, such as improving
circulation, reducing muscle tension, increasing lymphatic drainage, and increasing skin
tone<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most of these benefits
have been reported based on the experiences of people. More evidence-based studies are
needed to be researched.</p><p>Back muscle is an important part of the human body, plays a key role in keeping the body
upright and balanced and is needed to perform almost all physical activities. Sitting,
standing, and walking for a long period of time can cause back muscle fatigue and disorders,
such as lumbar muscle strain, increased intradiscal pressure, injury of the intervertebral
disc, and strained facet joints. Back muscle problem is one of the most common
musculoskeletal disorders and a burden for the patient and family<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the USA, about 80% of the adults have had an episode
of back muscle problem at least once in their lives<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and more than 70% of the population in the western societies
experience lower back pain in a given year. Back muscle problem is the most expensive
ailment in the working age, with an estimated 10 billion euros spent annually on medical
costs in Germany and more than 30 billion dollars spent in the USA<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In sports, High-intensity and long-duration exercise can cause back muscle fatigue and back
muscle injury of atheletes. Improving the performance of athletes by dealing with the
relationship of back strength training, fatigue recovery, and injury prevention has several
benefits. Therefore, back muscles and their related problems are not only important for
athletes but also for common people.</p><p>Up until now, there has been no sufficient evidence to support whether or not
mechanical-bed massage has the same benefits as those of manual massage on muscle fatigue
and recovery. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mechanical-bed massage
on exercise-induced back fatigue and recovery in athletes. It may provide more evidence for
the application of mechanical-bed massage to promote recovery from fatigue after strenuous
back exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>To avoid the environmental impact on the results, which includes ambient temperature,
humidity, noise, and lighting, all the experiments were conducted at Human Movement Science
Laboratory, Faculty of Physical Education, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China. The
laboratory meets the following requirements: sufficient but not too much light, air
conditioned and quiet room, about 50% humidity and room temperature at 22&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C. Before the
measurement, the athletes were instructed to rest for more than 15 minutes and keep a calm
state of mind and relax.</p><p>All the volunteer athletes were students at the Faculty of Physical Education, Gannan
Normal University, Ganzhou, China. They were recruited to participate in this study if they
met the following criteria: (1) Inclusion: male, aged 17&#x02013;22 years, college athletes and have
participated in sports training for more than 3&#x02005;years, Body Mass Index (BMI): 18.5&#x02013;24, no
back injury within the last 6 months, no smoking within the last 1 week, no alcohol
consumption within the last 1 week, no current health problems. (2) Exclusion: having been
on any form of medication or beverage, such as caffeine, amphetamine, and corticosteroid
that might affect athletic performance. Twelve college student-athletes who met the criteria
volunteered to participate. They were randomly allocated into two groups, control group and
experimental group using block randomized allocation with block sizes of 2 and 4. Groups
were assigned using a pre-generated random assignment scheme enclosed in envelopes, which
resulted in a total of 6 participants per group. The research protocol got the approval of
the Ethics Committee of Khon Kaen University (ID of EC: HE602260), and all participants of
this study wrote informed consent at the beginning of the study.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Trial flow chart that displays the protocol of this study.</p><p>VAS: Visual analogue scale; HRV: Heart rate variability; BME: Back muscle

and the parameters need to be measured. During the experiment, all the subjects were
required to maintain the same living habits, eat in the same canteen, go to bed before 10:30
pm the day before the experiment, and wake up before 8:00 am on the day of experiment. The
subjects were asked to rest for 15 minutes before the baseline parameters, such as VAS, HRV,
and Back Muscle Eduranece (BME) were measured; following that, the fatigue model was applied
to induce back muscle fatigue of subjects. The intervention was performed for 20 minutes
(the mechanical-bed massage was provided to the experimental group for 20 minutes, while the
control group just rested during the same period of time), and the parameters were measured
to obtain the data immediately after intervention. After 24 hours of rest, the indicators of
post-measurement 2 were tested the same way as the baseline.</p><p>In order to induce back muscle fatigue, the subjects were instructed to perform prone
reverse sit-up until they felt back muscle fatigue or could not do any further. The reverse
sit-up was performed in the prone lying position, fixed ankles and hip, hands behind the
back of the head. They were instructed to extend their back consecutively for 8 repetitions
per session. The participants were insisted on completing several sections until they could
not complete the entire section. The interval (rest) time between 1st to 3rd section was 3
minutes, between 3rd to 5th section was 4 minutes, and between 5th to 8th section was 5
minutes.</p><p>In the experimental group, the participants lay supine on a mechanical-massage bed (STRONG
SC-9903, Shanghai, China) for a session of massage. The total session was for 20 minutes,
where the massage types are similar to kneading of manual massage. There are 5 procedures
that can be selected from, which are as follows. Procedure 1: entire body and can stay on
some acupoints; Procedure 2: entire body and no pause; Procedure 3: upper back; Procedure 4:
lower back; Procedure 5: neck. Procedure 4 was selected for this study. The outline of
massage was set according to the Jingluo theory of traditional Chinese medicine, and the
name of this Jingluo is <italic>Pangguang Jing</italic>. These lines are also similar to the
meridian lines (Itha and Pingkala) according to the theory of traditional Thai massage: the
back area of mechanical-bed massage covered the latissimus dorsi, trapezius and erector
spinae, and the main acupoints, including Xinyu (BL 15), Ganyu (BL 18), Danyu (BL 19),
Shenyu (BL 23), Sanjiaoyu (BL 22), etc.</p><p>In the control group (Rest group), the subjects lay supine on the same mechanical-massage
bed as that of the experimental group for 20 minutes, where the mechanical-massage bed was
switched off. After all data for this study were collected, the participants could request
to get the mechanical-bed massage if they wished.</p><p>The HRV was measured in the sitting position. All the participants were asked to remain
calm as much as possible while measuring HRV. The HRV recording was done using SCHUHFRIED
GmbH Biofeedback instrument (Biofeedback 2000 x-pert software version 4.2, Austria) for 5
minutes from the chest wall, which is considered to be the safest recording method with the
smallest artifacts and the largest signals. The red electrode cable was attached to the left
chest in the area on the fifth rib and the blue one to the right chest. The reference was
attached to the cervical vertebrae. Some technical and parametric details were set, which
are as follows. Data transfer: raw data curve (mV) and RR interval (ms) via Bluetooth, input
range: &#x000b1; 3.2 mV and &#x000b1; 1.6 mV adjustable; frequency range: 0.4&#x02005;Hz&#x02013;100&#x02005;Hz; sample rate:
1,000&#x02005;Hz; data transfer rate: 100&#x02013;200 readings/second and transfer at every heartbeat (fast
Fourier transformation &#x0201c;FFT&#x0201d; data points 40 readings/second); common mode rejection: &#x0003e;100
dB. Various indices of the HRV were calculated in this study, which included stress index
(SI), total number of all N-N intervals divided by the height of the histogram of all N-N
intervals measured on a discrete scale with bins of 7.8125&#x02005;ms (HRV index), standard
deviation of all N-N intervals (SDNN;&#x02005;ms), the square root of the mean of the sum of the
squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD;&#x02005;ms), the proportion derived by
dividing the number of interval differences of successive N-N intervals greater than 50&#x02005;ms
(pNN50), low frequency power in normalized units (LF; n.u.), high frequency power in
normalized units (HF; n.u.), and the ratio of LF and HF (LF/HF).</p><p>The participants were asked to rate their perceived back fatigue induced by the exercise on
the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with a 10-cm line ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 meant no
fatigue at all and 10 indicated an extreme feeling of fatigue<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Isometric Back Extension Endurance Test was used to measure the back muscle endurance
of the participants. Endurance was evaluated by the duration of (holding time measured in
seconds) the participants being able to hold the upper part of the body horizontal while
lying prone, with no support on the body part above the iliac crests. The hands were kept
behind the neck while the thighs and ankles were fixed to the table by 2 wide straps. The
participants were instructed to hold the upper body parts in horizontal level as long as
they could. During testing, the participants received encouragement once if their position
fell under the horizontal level. The position was indicated by a plumb bob hanging from the
ceiling that was adjusted to contact the back when the horizontal position was maintained.
If the position was not immediately corrected or if the participant claimed that the
position could no longer be held due to fatigue or discomfort, the test was ended and the
holding time was recorded<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All of the outcomes were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). SPSS 19.0 software
was used to analyze the data. This study aimed to explore the different effects of
mechanical bed massage and resting on back muscle fatigue. Various parameters of different
time points (immediately after the intervention and after 24 hours) between the two groups
were analyzed. Since the type of data was continuous and normally distributed, independent
samples t-test was used to compare independent data of different groups, and paired samples
t-test was used to compare dependent data of the same group. To achieve statistical
significance, 80% power (beta=0.2) and alpha level of 0.05 were used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The baseline characteristics of the participants were as follows: for the control group,

exercise-induced back muscle fatigue, after 20 minutes of rest or mechanical bed massage
intervention is still lower than the baseline. However, no significant difference existed
between baseline and 24 hours after the intervention in both group (p&#x0003e;0.05, paired
samples t-test). The duration of time for back muscle endurance exceeded the baseline in the
experimental group at 24 hours after the intervention may be due to the phenomenon of
over-compensation or recovery. Furthermore, the fall time of the participants&#x02019; back muscle
endurance can be calculated through the value of baseline and immediately after the
intervention, and then calculate the rate of decline. The fall time of the experimental and

athletes. In the previous studies, closer attention has been paid to prevent fatigue
accumulation and accelerate fatigue recovery<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
is undeniable that massage has a positive influence on rehabilitation care. However, the
mechanism of massage is still unclear. Some studies have shown that massage is probably
associated with the physiological<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, psychological<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>,
biomechanical<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and neurological
mechanisms<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on the massage
theory, the mechanical bed massage was invented and used to imitate the manual massage. To
our knowledge, there are very few studies on the practical use of mechanical massage
devices<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, and experimental research on
the effects of mechanical massage bed on fatigue has not been done. This study was carried
out to explore the possible effects of mechanical bed massage on exercise-induced back
fatigue using subjective fatigue evaluation, back muscle endurance, and HRV analysis.</p><p>Visual analogue scale is a subjective assessment tool to evaluate fatigue severity.
According to a previous report, massage could significantly decrease the degree of VAS
scores for participants with localized lumbar muscle fatigue<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This phenomenon was further confirmed in this study; the VAS scores
of the participants decreased significantly not only immediately after the mechanical bed
massage, but also 24 hours after the mechanical bed massage. Our findings suggest that the
application of mechanical bed massage can help the participants overcome subjective feeling
of exercise-induced back fatigue resulting from 8 sections of prone reverse sit-up.</p><p>In many studies, fatigue was examined by assessing the endurance time. This approach was
based on a presumption that there is an association between the decline in maximal force
generating capacity and the time to exhaustion<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. A.N. Rinder and C.J. Sutherland used the number of leg extensions
as the assessment tool to evaluate quadriceps endurance to investigate the effects of
massage on quadriceps performance after exercise fatigue. The results showed that the number
of leg extensions of the massage group was significantly higher than that of rest group,
which means that massage was shown to be significantly better than rest of the treatments in
aiding recovery from fatigue<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. There were
no statistically significant differences in the recovery from fatigue between experimental
group and control group immediately after the intervention. The reason might be that the
characteristics of participants at baseline had a certain degree of difference. Therefore,
another value was used to assess the recovery of back muscle fatigue, which is the fall time
of back muscle endurance. Although no significant difference existed between two groups, the
lower rate of decline for back muscle endurance in experimental group means that mechanical
bed massage can speed up the recovery of the exercise-induced back muscle fatigue. The
mechanism may be that mechanical bed massage can improve the velocity of blood flow and
accelerate the elimination of metabolites.</p><p>The HRV is the beat-to-beat variation in time of consecutive heart beats expressed in
normal sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram recordings; it is a noninvasive, practical, and
reproducible measure of the autonomic nervous system function<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In sports, the HRV has been used as a tool for diagnostic
performance and monitoring training<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>,
which also has been recognized as a useful method for the measurement of fatigue<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Previous studies have shown that manual massage or a combination of other methods can
enhance the HRV, such as, myofascial trigger-point massage therapy can significantly
increase the parasympathetic activity<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>,
facial massage can enhance the LF/HF<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>,
self-massage combined with home exercise can increase the rate of LF and HF<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, head-neck massage showed a significant
interaction for HRV index<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, massage
therapy with a range of motions had a positive effect on HRV development<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, traditional Thai massage increased HF and
total power frequency<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study,
only frequency domain indices had significant differences, and no significant differences
existed in any of the time domain indices. The reason for this result may be interpreted as
many frequency domain indices being strongly correlated with time domain indices, but this
situation is only suitable for long-term recording of HRV, and the recording must take more
than 18 hours. When considering the stationary of HRV recording, time domain indices are
better than frequency domain indices for analyzing the long-term recording of HRV. On the
contrary, frequency domain indices are more suitable to analyze short-term recording of HRV
than time domain indices<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. The HF of
experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group, and the LF,
LF/HF of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group,
which indicates that mechanical bed massage can enhance HRV, increase parasympathetic
activities, and maintain the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic activities because
HF in normalized units is considered a marker of vagal modulation, LF in normalized units is
considered as a marker of sympathetic modulation, and LF/HF mirrors sympathovagal balance or
reflects sympathetic modulation<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
mechanisms by which massage affects HRV may be as follows. Massage has been found to
increase the level of dopamine and serotonin (5HIAA)<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> and decrease the level of cortisol<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup> and catecholamines<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, which further indicate that massage can decrease stress and anxiety
and promote relaxation<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>, all of which could be expressed in the form of increased
HF and decreased LF and LF/HF.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. Back muscle endurance was different at the
baseline of both the groups, which may have affected the results of this experiment because
fatigue recovery depends on the physiological ability of the athlete, such as highly trained
athletes can recover from exercise-induced fatigue more quickly than less trained
athletes<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, only one
session of mechanical bed massage was used in this study, which may not be sufficient to
attain the maximum effects for exercise-induced back fatigue. Therefore, longer duration of
the experiment with randomized controlled trials should be considered in the future
studies.</p><p>According to the results of this study, mechanical bed massage may decrease muscle fatigue
and facilitate recovery as indicated in the improvement of subjective feeling of
exercise-induced fatigue, modulate the activity of automatic nervous system, especially to
maintain the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. Therefore, we
suggest that mechanical bed massage could be seen as an effective means of recovery for
exercise-induced back fatigue after athlete training or competition.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was guided by Dr. Wichai Eungpinichpong who is the corresponding author of this
