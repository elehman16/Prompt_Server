Barriers to wellbeing are depression and antisocial behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Children who display early signs of anti-social behaviour and conduct problems are at high risk of early onset conduct disorder (CD). CD constitutes the largest single group of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and is the main reason for referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Children with early onset problems are at high risk of low school attendance, educational underachievement, school dropout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and subsequent mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Living in poverty in poor quality housing, having young and/or single parents, living with adults with unemployment or mental health problems increases the probability that children will arrive at school with social and emotional skill deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additional risk factors associated with higher prevalence for CD include, frequent changes of parental figures, parental psychopathology, parental substance abuse, marital problems, and poor parenting skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The Incredible Years (IY) series developed over the last 30 years, comprises a suite of programmes, for parents, children and teachers, with strong evidence of effectiveness both as treatment programmes for children with CD and as early preventive programmes (for more information on programmes and research see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.incredibleyears.com">http://www.incredibleyears.com</ext-link>). IY was one of the eleven programmes deemed a 'blueprint' programme for violence prevention following a rigorous review of 600 interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The Incredible Years Series has a strong evidence base in Wales and is acceptable to families and schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Parenting programmes are very effective in developing children's social skills and reducing child behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] whilst reducing later burden on social, health, education service use and associated costs and the costs of lifetime unemployment and welfare dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of parenting programmes are that improvements at home do not always transfer to school settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] with programme provision limited to the few families that can, or are willing to, access programmes. Schools are therefore dealing with significant numbers of children with behavioural and self-regulatory difficulties particularly in disadvantaged areas where levels of CD reach 35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In Wales initial steps to tackle the increasing numbers of children arriving in school with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties have been taken; there has been a change in the curriculum of early years education and a commitment to improve home-school partnerships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Gwynedd Education Service in North Wales has implemented and established the universal IY Classroom Dinosaur curriculum in all of their 102 primary schools; however high-risk children need additional input to meet their needs. The IY Therapeutic Dina Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] has been successful in increasing social and emotional competence in high-risk children by increasing social and problem-solving skills, and by strengthening peer relationships in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and in a small pilot study in Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The IY Therapeutic Programme would be ideally placed within schools, where children who would benefit form the programme could be easily identified by teachers. Teachers are best placed to deliver the programme to the children in schools, and to encourage the completion of the programme's homework tasks by children with their parent/s. School-to-home links will be forged through discussion of homework tasks.</p><sec><title>Summary of background literature</title><p>&#x02022; Fostering social and emotional competency can reduce or prevent CD, which is prevalent in disadvantaged areas such as North Wales</p><p>&#x02022; Parent programmes are beneficial but more support is needed for children in school, as behaviour 'rules' learnt in the home may not generalise to school</p><p>&#x02022; Schools are an ideal arena for targeting difficult child behaviour and increasing positive behaviour whilst strengthening school-home links</p><p>&#x02022; All 102 primary schools in Gwynedd implement IY programmes (Teacher Classroom Management and Classroom Dinosaur)</p><p>&#x02022; The intensive IY Therapeutic Programme with high-risk children in schools may benefit children for whom the IY Classroom Dinosaur is insufficient</p></sec><sec><title>The rationale for the trial</title><p>The aim of this paper is to present the research protocol for the randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to primarily establish whether the IY Therapeutic Dinosaur School Programme, when delivered as a school-based targeted intervention, improves 'at risk' children's social, emotional and behavioural competencies compared with a waiting list control condition.</p><sec><title>Secondary questions include</title><p>1.

It is delivered to groups of up to six children.</p><p>It is part of the successful evidenced based IY Series, a suite of programmes which include parent, child and teacher programmes. All IY programmes are manualised and require trained facilitators.</p><p>The programme will be delivered during school time as part of the typical school day. School staff will receive training prior to programme delivery, and will receive supervision throughout delivery to ensure that the programme is delivered as it was developed.</p><p>The programme promotes understanding &#x00026; communicating of feelings, problem-solving strategies, managing anger &#x00026; friendships. Puppets, role-play, and video clips are used to make it a fun learning experience.</p><p>The Dinosaur School programme sessions cover six separate programmes:</p><p>1. Making new friends and learning school rules;</p><p>2. Dina Dinosaur teaches how to do your best in school;</p><p>3. Understanding and detecting feelings;</p><p>4. Detective Wally teaches problem-solving steps (including anger management);</p><p>5. Molly Manners teaches how to be friendly;</p><p>6. Molly explains how to talk to friends.</p><p>Wally, Molly and Dina Dinosaur are puppets. Children relate better to puppets than to therapists and are more likely to imitate their appropriate behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Each session includes activities such as "feelings" and "let's suppose" games, co-operative art projects and guessing games to improve co-operation skills. Group leaders praise and reward appropriate behaviours by labelling the behaviour and awarding "dinosaur chips". Weekly homework activities involve the child talking to their parent/s about what they have learned to encourage positive parent-child interaction.</p><p>For more programme information see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.incredibleyears.com">http://www.incredibleyears.com</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Facilitators</title><p>The IY Teacher Classroom Management training and the IY Classroom Dina curriculum training has been undertaken by staff in all of the proposed schools. All facilitators will undergo the additional IY Therapeutic Dina training prior to delivery. The 40 facilitators will be teachers and/or classroom assistants working in the participating schools.</p><p>During intervention delivery facilitators will attend supervision meetings led by an IY trainer (the second author) once per month during the 18 weeks, for delivery support and to ensure implementation fidelity.

The effects on child behaviour in school and home environments, academic attainment, peer interactions, parent and teacher mental health, will be assessed.</p><p>A number of challenges exist in carrying out the proposed study; the biggest challenge is that of parental engagement and consent. The parents will initially learn of the trial through school staff. It is important that school staff are fully aware of the details of the study and are fully briefed with the most effective means of presenting the trial to parents in the most positive light to ensure that parents do not feel stigmatised, or in any way to blame for their child's social, emotional, or behavioural difficulties. Individual meetings with the Principal Investigator, Head Teachers and proposed facilitators will serve to brief school staff and alleviate any concerns on engaging with parents. Staff will be given information sheets and a template letter, summarising the study, to give to parents to aid discussion. Parents will mainly be approached on a one to one basis during parents' evening at school. School staff will help parents complete a 'note of interest' form with contact details and child details to be sent to the research staff to enable initial contact to be made. Parents will be encouraged to contact the research team or school staff with any queries.</p><p>Teachers will receive training to deliver the programme as part of the trial. Teachers will be required to take video recordings of their session delivery to monthly group supervision, undertaken by an IY Mentor.
