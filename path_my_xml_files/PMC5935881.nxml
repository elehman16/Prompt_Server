RCTs comparing surgery to non-surgical alternatives are particularly difficult to perform, partly due to difficulties with recruitment. Low recruitment rates can limit the internal and external validity of a trial thus understanding their causes may be important for avoiding protracted recruitment periods. This study aimed to report patient factors that influenced participation in a trial comparing surgery to a non-surgical treatment approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a cross-sectional study nested within CROSSBAT (Combined Randomized and Observational Study of Surgery For Type B Ankle Fracture Treatment). Eligible participants willing to be randomized were randomized while those who declined randomization were offered participation in an observational cohort. Participants from both groups (randomized and observational) were asked to indicate their level of agreement on a 100&#x000a0;mm line with statements concerning reasons for acceptance or rejection of randomization. A subset were asked to state the primary reason for agreeing to participate or not in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The nested study included 312 participants; 113 who accepted and 199 who declined randomization. Participants unwilling to be randomized (those in the observational arm of the study) predominantly received a non-surgical intervention. They were significantly more worried about receiving treatment by chance (55&#x000a0;mm vs. 33&#x000a0;mm; p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) and had a significantly higher preference for one particular treatment (less equipoise) (82&#x000a0;mm vs 43&#x000a0;mm; p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) compared to participants willing to be randomized. Influence from clinicians and risk avoidance were primary influences of participation. Participants&#x02019; responses regarding protocol burden, study follow-up requirements and altruism did not significantly differ between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patient non-participation in an RCT comparing surgery to no surgery is related to concern about receiving a treatment through chance and the presence of a strong preference for a particular treatment, particularly a non-surgical one. To avoid protracted recruitment periods, investigators can increase the number of study sites and ensure personnel involved have equipoise and are trained to provide a balanced view of both treatment arms.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Orthopedic</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trials</kwd><kwd>Patient participation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>CROSSBAT</kwd><kwd>Combined randomized and observational study of surgery for type B ankle fracture treatment</kwd><kwd>OTA</kwd><kwd>Orthopedic trauma association</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the most robust research design yet they are often arduous to perform <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Patient recruitment to RCTs in general is difficult, often because people have a preference for one treatment over another <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Surgical RCTs are reported to be more problematic than drug trials especially as the results of surgery are more permanent and may be associated with increased risks and costs. This issue is particularly highlighted in surgical vs. non-surgical RCTs <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Low patient recruitment can lead to a decrease in the scientific quality of an RCT in a number of ways, including loss of statistical power and poorer generalizability, and may lead to early termination <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">There are many factors affecting patient participation in RCTs. These can be related to the patient or to other factors such as clinician or systematic factors <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Patient factors including altruism, self-benefit, fear of chance depicting treatment and patient preference have been identified previously as they influence a patient&#x02019;s decision to participate in an RCT <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Clinician factors that can affect recruitment include time constraints, lack of staff and training, concern for patients, loss of professional autonomy, difficulty with the consent procedure, lack of rewards and recognition, or insufficiently interesting research question <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Institutional factors such as procedural, structural and infrastructural obstacles can also affect patient recruitment. Identifying and addressing these factors can improve patient recruitment and, thus, improve the quality of surgical RCTs. Although these factors have been studied in the medical RCTs, there is limited evidence on how these factors influence patient participation in surgical vs. non-surgical RCTs <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

It included a randomized group, and participants declining randomization were invited to participate in the observational cohort. CROSSBAT was designed to assess if surgical management was superior to non-surgical management for the treatment of type B ankle fractures with minimal talar shift. Consecutive adult patients presenting to a recruiting hospital during the study period with an isolated, closed OTA (Orthopedic trauma association) type 44-B1 distal fibula fracture without significant talar shift were screened for eligibility. Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants willing to participate.</p><p id="p0025">In addition to the above, inclusion criteria included patients with no other concomitant fractures/dislocations; aged between 18 and 65 years inclusive; mobilizing unaided/independently pre-injury and willing to be followed up for 12 months. Exclusion criteria included participants that were medically unfit for anesthesia/surgery; skeletally immature; previous trauma or surgery to the fractured ankle; inability to consent; pregnancy; the presence of other injuries or co-morbidities that impede mobilization; and non-English speaking. Eligible participants willing to be randomized were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the surgical or non-surgical intervention. Those not willing to be randomized were invited to participate in the study as part of the observational cohort. Members of the orthopedic team recruited participants either in the emergency department or fracture clinics of the participating hospitals.</p><p id="p0030">At baseline, along with demographics questions, all participants were asked to complete a survey indicating their level of agreement with a series of statements by placing an &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; through a 100&#x000a0;mm line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The survey questions were based on common patient concerns regarding participation in RCTs that have been raised in other studies, such as uncertainty of treatment; lack of participant equipoise; protocol rationale, follow-up burden and altruism <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. As the study progressed, it was evident that the majority of people who participated in CROSSBAT (almost 2:1), opted to become involved in the observational arm (and thus avoid the possibility of surgery). In order to understand further what was the primary reason for participation or not in the randomized arm, participants in the latter stage of recruitment were probed further at six weeks post-surgery via a telephone interview.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Participant level of agreement with questions.

As this study was nested within the CROSSBAT study, the sample size was dictated by the CROSSBAT sample. Baseline characteristics of the two cohorts were compared using Student&#x02019;s t-test or chi-squared test. The survey data were compared using Students&#x02019; t-test. Missing data were not imputed. The probed responses were categorized by two investigators (RM, JN) at the conclusion of the study.

Previous studies have shown that keeping the protocol simple, with minimal follow-up burden can lead to improved recruitment <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the context of our study, these factors may have helped overall recruitment, regardless of which arm of the study a patient consented to be involved in.</p><p id="p0100">The study has strengths and limitations. It was nested in a large-scale, multi-centre trial both of which enhance the generalizability of the findings. As all those screened for participation consented to be involved in either the randomized or observational component, our results arguably relate to why people participate or not in a RCT compared to being involved in an observational study. This not withstanding, as our findings echo previous studies exploring patient participation in randomized trials in the absence of an observational arm, we contend our results usefully add to the small body of work that currently exists in this area. In terms of limitations, our study does not provide data regarding why people may or may not participate in a surgical trial per se. Consequently, we cannot provide recommendations regarding how to improve patient recruitment to clinical studies overall.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0105">People who decline randomization in a surgical vs. non-surgical trial tend to be more worried about the uncertainty of treatment and have a stronger preference for a particular treatment. In essence, they tend to be risk averse. Further, it appears clinicians influence what potential participants decide. To avoid protracted recruitment periods, investigators can increase the number of study sites and ensure personnel involved have equipoise and are trained to provide a balanced view of both treatment arms.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>J.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>J.N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Losina</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical trials in orthopaedics research.
