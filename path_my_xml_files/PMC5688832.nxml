The <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> approach toward the treatment of <italic>Amavata</italic> is the need of present era as no system is successful in providing the complete cure to this disease. <italic>Amavata</italic> is a challenging and a burning problem of medical science. Prevalence of RA is approximately 0.8% of the population. Due to wide spectrum of disease, much prevalence in the society, and lack of effective medicine, the disease had been chosen for the study. The aim of the research was to study the efficacy of <italic>Alambushadi Ghana Vati</italic> and <italic>Vaitarana Basti</italic> in the management of <italic>Amavata</italic> (RA). It was a single-center, randomized, open-clinical study. In the present study, 30 clinically diagnosed patients of <italic>Amavata</italic> were selected and randomly divided into two groups by lottery method. <italic>Alambushadi Ghana Vati</italic> was given in dose of two tablets (each 500 mg) three times in a day with lukewarm water after meal for 30 days, while <italic>Vaitarana Basti</italic> on alternate day (15 <italic>Basti</italic>) had been given simultaneously in the second group along with drug of first group. Statistical analysis was done using InStat GraphPad 3 Software. Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test was used for the analysis of nonparametric data, while paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for parametric data analysis and Mann&#x02013;Whitney test and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test were used for intergroup comparison. Statistically highly significant (HS) improvement was found in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and HS results were found in symptoms of <italic>Amavata</italic> when the <italic>Vaitarana Basti</italic> was used along with <italic>Alambushadi Ghana Vati</italic>. With excellent relief in 20% patients, significant relief in 60% patients, moderate relief in 13.33% patients, whereas mild relief in 6.66% patients. On comparing the effect of two therapies, it can be concluded that Group B (<italic>Alambushadi Ghana Vati</italic> and <italic>Vaitarana Basti</italic>) provided better relief than Group A (<italic>Alambushadi Ghana Vati</italic>) in most of the sign and symptom of the disease at significant level.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Alambushadi Ghana Vati</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Amavata</italic></kwd><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd><italic>Vaitarana Basti</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the present era, due to modern life style, hectic work schedule, stress, and many such reasons, incidence of disease is increasing, and one of them is <italic>Amavata</italic>, which can be compared with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to its clinical presentation.
