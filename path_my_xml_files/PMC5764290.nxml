Coprimary endpoints were: change from baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) Pain and Physical Function indices, and Patient&#x02019;s Global Assessment (PGA) of OA. Study 1043 (NCT00994890) was a long-term, noncontrolled safety study of tanezumab (ie, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg) subcutaneously administered every 8 weeks.

While tanezumab has been administered via intravenous (IV) injection in most clinical studies performed to date, subcutaneous (SC) administration is more convenient and therefore preferred. Therefore, in order to determine whether SC tanezumab is also efficacious in the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) pain, two clinical trials examined the efficacy and safety of tanezumab administered by SC injection, as well as the therapeutic equivalence of 10 mg SC tanezumab versus 10 mg IV injection. In both the studies, all tanezumab doses were associated with similar improvements in pain, function, and patient&#x02019;s overall global assessment of OA. SC tanezumab had a favorable safety profile in both the studies. These studies provide preliminary evidence that the efficacy and safety of SC tanezumab is similar to that of IV administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a key modulator of pain signaling,<xref rid="b1-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and chronic pain is often associated with increased NGF.<xref rid="b1-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Tanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, tightly binds NGF with high selectivity and specificity,<xref rid="b2-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b5-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> thereby inhibiting NGF binding to its receptors (tropomyosin receptor kinase A [high-affinity receptor] and p75 [low-affinity receptor]).<xref rid="b4-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In clinical studies of osteoarthritis (OA) pain, tanezumab produced significant, clinically meaningful improvements in pain, function, and global assessments, with an acceptable safety profile.<xref rid="b6-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of subcutaneous (SC) tanezumab is dose-linear across the 2.5&#x02013;10 mg dose range, with ~70% bioavailability compared with intravenous (IV) administration across all doses.<xref rid="b14-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> To determine whether the tanezumab dose needs to be adjusted when converting from IV to SC administration, simulations were performed to predict weekly pain score over time using fixed-effect population parameter estimates from PK<xref rid="b14-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) models.<xref rid="b15-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The simulations predicted that tanezumab concentrations are maintained above the model-estimated IC<sub>50</sub> after SC and IV administration. Although the predicted mean change from baseline to week 1 in weekly pain score was lower with SC compared with IV dosing, this difference decreased with increasing dosage. In addition, the predicted difference between tanezumab SC and IV was &#x0003c;5% by week 4, suggesting no dosing adjustment is needed when converting to SC administration.</p><p>In order to confirm tanezumab SC and IV administration produce similar clinical response, two clinical trials investigated the efficacy and safety of SC tanezumab in patients with moderate-to-severe OA of the knee or hip. Since PK/PD simulations suggested that analgesia onset differed with SC administration, an additional objective was to determine whether the analgesia profile for SC administration was similar across doses. Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Studies 1027 and 1043 were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Most reactions were mild in severity; none were severe.</p><p>Adverse events of abnormal peripheral sensation reported in &#x0003e;2% of patients in any group were paresthesia, hypoesthesia, burning sensation, and sensory disturbance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-11-151">Table 2</xref>). Most patients (&#x02265;95%) had no new or worsened abnormalities at final neurologic examination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-11-151">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>No adverse events of osteonecrosis were reported by investigators. Five patients underwent TJR: two placebo-treated patients and three patients receiving tanezumab 2.5 mg SC. One event reviewed by the adjudication committee was judged as normal progression of OA. The other four events were not reviewed due to lack of radiographic images.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics and anti-tanezumab antibodies</title><p>Overall, in Study 1027, PK descriptive summaries and individual profiles of tanezumab suggest that absorption and disposition of SC tanezumab were similar across doses. Tanezumab was slowly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentrations generally occurring within 1&#x02013;2 weeks of the first injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-jpr-11-151">Figure 4</xref>). The increase in median peak and trough (week 8) concentrations was approximately proportional to dose. Because of the clinical hold, most patients received only a single dose following which median plasma concentrations of tanezumab declined exponentially throughout the remainder of the study period.</p><p>The immunogenicity profile was favorable, with only 2.3% of patients testing positive for the presence of ADA in the four tanezumab treatment groups. Among 827 serum samples screened (from 307 patients in total), 294 samples were presumptively ADA-positive, and on further testing, only 11 samples (in seven patients) were confirmed as ADA-positive. Upon titer/quantitation analysis, nine samples had titer results &#x0003e;4.32. One patient was considered baseline positive with no increase in titer postdose, and six patients had treatment-induced ADA with low titers (4.62&#x02013;8.18). The nine ADA-positive samples were analyzed in the NAb assay; five were negative for Nab, whereas four (from three patients) were confirmed Nab-positive with low titers (5.82&#x02013;10.1). Individual profiles indicated no apparent alterations in tanezumab concentrations, efficacy, or incidence and severity of adverse events for the seven ADA-positive patients compared with patients who were ADA-negative.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study 1043</title><p>A total of 678 patients were randomized and treated in Study 1043 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-11-151">Figure 2B</xref>). Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable across treatments; most (~80%) patients received at least two of the seven planned tanezumab SC injections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-11-151">Table 1</xref>). Mean treatment duration was similar across treatments (180.3&#x02013;190.8 days).</p><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>Fewer than half of the patients in Study 1043 received more than two tanezumab treatments; therefore, efficacy results are presented only through week 16. Tanezumab treatment resulted in improvements from baseline to week 16 in WOMAC Pain, WOMAC Physical Function, and PGA of OA scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-jpr-11-151">Figure 5A&#x02013;C</xref>); similar improvements were seen at week 8. More patients treated with tanezumab 5 and 10 mg had &#x02265;30%, &#x02265;50%, &#x02265;70%, and &#x02265;90% improvements in WOMAC Pain score than with tanezumab 2.5 mg; however, differences between tanezumab 10 and 5 mg were minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-jpr-11-151">Figure 5D</xref>). The percentage of OMERACT-OARSI responders was highest in patients treated with tanezumab 10 mg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-jpr-11-151">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Adverse events in Study 1043 occurred at higher rates with tanezumab 10 mg than with tanezumab 2.5 or 5 mg (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-11-151">Table 2</xref>). The number of patients experiencing at least one serious adverse event was higher in the tanezumab 10 mg group than in the tanezumab 2.5 or 5 mg groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-11-151">Table 2</xref>). The most frequently investigator-reported serious adverse events were arthralgia (n=8; 4, 1, and 3 patients in the tanezumab 2.5, 5, and 10 mg treatment groups, respectively), osteonecrosis (n=9; 1, 4, and 4 patients in the tanezumab 2.5, 5, and 10 mg treatment groups, respectively), and worsening OA (n=7; 2, 1, and 4 patients in the tanezumab 2.5, 5, and 10 mg treatment groups, respectively). Discontinuation due to an adverse event was highest in the tanezumab 2.5 mg group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-11-151">Table 2</xref>). Arthralgia was the most frequent reason for discontinuation (tanezumab 2.5 mg, n=2 [0.9%]; tanezumab 5 mg, n=2 [0.9%]; tanezumab 10 mg, n=1 [0.4%]). No deaths occurred.</p><p>Injection site reaction incidence was generally low (&#x02264;9.5% in each group), although slightly higher than in Study 1027. The most frequent injection site reactions were ecchymosis and erythema. Most injection site reactions were mild, and none were severe.</p><p>Adverse events of abnormal peripheral sensation occurred at higher incidence in the tanezumab 10 mg group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-11-151">Table 2</xref>). Most adverse events of abnormal peripheral sensation resolved before last patient contact. Most (&#x02265;81.7%) patients had no new or worsened abnormality at final neurologic examination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-11-151">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Nine patients (tanezumab 2.5 mg, n=1 [0.4%]; tanezumab 5 mg, n=4 [1.8%]; tanezumab 10 mg, n=4 [1.8%]) in Study 1043 had an adverse event initially reported as osteonecrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-jpr-11-151">Figure 6</xref>) by the investigator. Eight of these patients had documented evidence of preexisting OA in the affected joint. Overall, 34 patients (tanezumab 2.5 mg, n=11 [4.8%]; tanezumab 5 mg, n=8 [3.6%]; tanezumab 10 mg, n=15 [6.6%]) reported TJR (all-cause). This included all nine patients with reported osteonecrosis plus an additional 25 patients. Of these 34 patients, 32 (94%) took NSAIDs at some time while they were treated with tanezumab.</p><p>Twenty-two patients, including all nine patients with adverse events initially reported as osteonecrosis and 13 patients with all-cause TJR, in Study 1043 were reviewed by adjudication committee. No patients were judged as having osteonecrosis. Twenty patients were adjudicated to worsening OA: 10 to normal progression of OA, nine to rapid progression of OA, and one as worsening OA (insufficient information to distinguish between rapid and normal progression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-jpr-11-151">Figure 6</xref>). Two patients were adjudicated as another diagnosis (one with preexisting femoral neck fracture [tanezumab 10 mg] and the other had long-standing OA [tanezumab 5 mg]). All nine patients adjudicated to rapid progression of OA reported concomitant NSAID use during the study.</p><p>Long-term SC tanezumab treatment was not associated with meaningful changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiographic results.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics and anti-tanezumab antibodies</title><p>The PK profile in Study 1043 was comparable to Study 1027, as was the immunogenicity profile, with only 1.3% of patients testing positive for the presence of ADA across the three treatment groups. Of the 2021 serum samples tested (from 675 patients), 368 samples were presumptively ADA-positive, of which 17 samples (from nine patients) were positive upon confirmatory assay. Of these, 15 samples (nine patients) had titer results &#x02265;4.32 (5.12&#x02013;15.54). Three of the nine patients were baseline ADA-positive with no significant increase in titer postdose, while six patients had treatment-induced ADA. Six of the 15 samples screened positive for Nab, with five samples (from four patients) confirming positive with low titers (5.61&#x02013;9.93). Individual profiles indicated no apparent differences in tanezumab concentrations, efficacy, or safety for the nine ADA-positive patients versus ADA-negative patients.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Two studies were conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of SC tanezumab in patients with moderate-to-severe OA pain. Study 1027 was also designed to evaluate therapeutic equivalence of SC and IV tanezumab 10 mg. Due to the partial clinical hold, enrollment in Study 1027 was insufficient to yield adequate power to fulfill the primary objectives, and no statistical hypothesis testing was performed. However, qualitative inspection of results at week 8 indicates tanezumab SC and IV were associated with improvements in pain, physical function, and global well-being compared with placebo.</p><p>Onset and duration of analgesia over the 8-week dosing interval with all SC doses of tanezumab in both studies were similar to the tanezumab 10 mg IV dose in Study 1027. Moreover, the magnitude of response and analgesic profile observed with tanezumab 10 mg IV was similar to previously published studies in patients with OA of the knee or hip in which the enrollment objectives were fully met.<xref rid="b6-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Thus, the efficacy profile of tanezumab SC appears similar to IV administration based on a qualitative comparison in Study 1027 and an indirect comparison to previously published results.<xref rid="b6-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In Study 1043, tanezumab 5 and 10 mg resulted in similar improvements from baseline at weeks 8 and 16, and these improvements were larger than those in the tanezumab 2.5 mg group. Benefit with tanezumab 10 mg over 5 mg was minimal. These results are also consistent with prior studies.<xref rid="b6-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>SC tanezumab had a favorable safety profile in both the studies. Overall incidence and types of adverse events reported were generally comparable to IV administration in OA patients.<xref rid="b6-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Incidence of injection site reactions was generally low across both the studies, although slightly higher in Study 1043 due to longer study duration and additional dosing. A slightly higher incidence of injection site reactions was reported relative to other tanezumab studies conducted with IV administration only<xref rid="b6-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> &#x02013; suggesting a difference in the profile between SC and IV administration &#x02013; but may be due, at least in part, to the more detailed injection site assessment in those studies. Most injection site reactions in the current two studies were mild; none were severe. Across treatments, the incidence of serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events were low. No events were adjudicated as primary osteonecrosis. The vast majority of patients had no significant abnormality on neurologic examination at their final assessment.</p><p>Overall, PK descriptive summaries and individual profiles of tanezumab suggest that absorption and disposition of SC tanezumab were similar across 2.5, 5, and 10 mg doses and that exposure increases linearly with dose. As expected, the average tanezumab plasma concentrations in the first 4 weeks after dosing were slightly lower with 10 mg SC than with 10 mg IV administration, but (as PK/PD simulations suggested) did not decrease efficacy.</p><p>During the conduct of clinical OA pain studies of tanezumab and other NGF inhibitors, a signal event initially described by investigators as osteonecrosis often leading to TJR raised concerns about joint-related safety of tanezumab and led to a partial clinical hold on the entire NGF inhibitor class by the US FDA. Reports of osteonecrosis and all other TJRs underwent careful and thorough investigation by an independent expert adjudication committee.<xref rid="b23-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> No evidence was found to indicate that tanezumab was associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis, a disease process distinct from OA, although a risk of rapidly progressive OA was identified.<xref rid="b16-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In our studies, nine patients were adjudicated to rapid progression of OA; all had taken concomitant NSAIDs during the study. Thus, similar to other reported studies,<xref rid="b11-jpr-11-151" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> the risk of rapidly progressive OA with tanezumab was greatest when coadministered with NSAIDs.</p><p>The incidence of anti-tanezumab antibodies was low. Based on ADA incidence in IV studies, the SC route is not more immunogenic than IV infusion. Individual patient profiles indicated no apparent alterations in tanezumab concentrations, efficacy, or incidence and severity of adverse events in patients who were ADA-positive compared with patients negative for ADA.</p><p>A significant limitation of these studies was the impact of the clinical hold on the duration and enrollment of both the studies, resulting in the insufficiency to yield adequate statistical power to fulfill the primary objectives in Study 1027 and a reduction in the number of tanezumab doses administered in Study 1043.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although these studies were limited by the partial clinical hold, the data provide preliminary evidence that the efficacy and safety of SC tanezumab is generally similar to IV administration in patients with OA pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>These studies were funded by Pfizer Inc.
