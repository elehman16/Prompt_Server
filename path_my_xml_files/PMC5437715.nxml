Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast and may be a result of decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection. Mastitis affects up to one in five breastfeeding women with most episodes occurring in the first 6&#x02013;8 weeks postpartum. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of mastitis, but have not been popular or proven effective as a preventative agent. The WHO has highlighted significant concerns relating to adverse harms of antibiotic use with the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of disease organisms. Increasing research suggests that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. While animal studies have shown promising results in the use of probiotics for preventing mastitis, their use in human trials has had limited investigation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>APProve (C<bold>A</bold>n <bold>P</bold>robiotics Im<bold>Prove</bold> Breastfeeding Outcomes?) is a double-blind randomised controlled trial designed to assess outcomes between breastfeeding women ingesting a probiotic versus a placebo daily for 8&#x000a0;weeks following birth. A total of 600 women (300 to each arm) who intend to breastfeed will be randomised after the birth of a term, healthy infant. Daily and weekly surveys for 8&#x000a0;weeks and follow-up surveys at 2, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after birth will assess the primary outcome of mastitis in the first 8&#x000a0;weeks following birth as well as secondary maternal outcomes of breastfeeding duration (total/partial), antibiotic use, maternal health and well-being, and treatment compliance; and infant outcomes including gastroenteritis, infant health and well-being and growth and development. The acceptability and compliance using a novel mobile phone application system will also be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>There is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing mastitis in breastfeeding women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may also increase breastfeeding duration, providing long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children. Decreased antibiotic usage also benefits the community and health system.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=368922&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN12615000923561</ext-link>.</p><p>Date of registration: 4th September, 2015, retrospectively registered.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12884-017-1330-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mastitis</kwd><kwd>Probiotics</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Protocol</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Breastfeeding</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Ramsay Research and Teaching Fund</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1067066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nassar</surname><given-names>Natasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against a broad range of immediate and long term infant and maternal health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. International guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for all babies in the first 6 months of life as it provides the best nutritional start for infants and promotes their healthy growth and development. Given the positive benefits of breastfeeding, it is of concern that the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Health Survey reported less than 15% of women exclusively breastfeeding at 5&#x000a0;months of age, despite a 96% initiation rate at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These findings suggest that more resources and research are required to identify and treat the underlying causes of breastfeeding cessation in order to extend the overall duration and improve long term maternal and child health outcomes.</p><p>Mastitis and the pain associated with the condition have been shown to be associated with the cessation of breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It occurs in 15&#x02013;21% of breastfeeding mothers in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Most episodes occur in the first 6&#x02013;8 weeks postpartum but can occur at any time during breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Almost one-third of women experience a recurrent episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and up to 3% of women with mastitis develop a breast abscess, often necessitating hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this common condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Though not well described, the risk factors appear to be associated with milk stasis, nipple damage and maternal fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Cracked nipples may facilitate entrance of microorganisms through the skin, and incomplete emptying of the breasts may result in milk stasis which provides a susceptible and receptive culture media for microorganisms. Decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection may be a result of maternal fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Other risk factors include a history of mastitis with a previous child, using an antifungal nipple cream and using a manual breast pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Current management of mastitis generally centers on symptom management (i.e. applying hot/cold compresses, analgesics), encouragement of the continuation of breastfeeding (including fully emptying the affected breast, feeding more frequently, and changing feeding positions often), and antibiotic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in treating symptoms of mastitis in breastfeeding women showed a trend towards a benefit of treatment, but only 2 trials were included and were of limited quality, with one conducted over 30&#x000a0;years ago. As such, authors deduced there was insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Optimal management for the prevention of mastitis is not known. A Cochrane review specifically aimed to assess the effects of preventative strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration also showed insufficient evidence as to the effectiveness of a range of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These interventions included education on breastfeeding, changes in breastfeeding habits, hot/cold packs, relaxation techniques, and use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrence. Only three trials examining the effect of antibiotics were included and although no significant difference in the incidence of mastitis was found, a trend towards a reduced effect was reported (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61). When one of the trials amongst HIV infected women was excluded, the two remaining studies reported a 67% and 76% reduction in mastitis with antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, all trials were inadequately powered or prematurely stopped due to concerns related to the adverse harms of antibiotic use, issues related to side effects, patient compliance, and attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The review concluded that the use of antibiotics in the absence of clear indications resulted in no benefit and could lead to harm, not just for the participants, but in the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of the organisms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] Authors of the Cochrane review recommended future studies should consider implementation of strategies to improve adherence such as extended consultation time with participants when recruiting participants to explain and reinforce instruction; designing interventions such as tailoring drug regimens to patient lifestyle; frequent follow up when initialising or changing treatment regimes; and the use of reminder calls and alerts to keep participants focused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The underlying biological pathogenesis of mastitis is important when considering management options. Mastitis is characterised by the presence of the main aetiological agents of infection, staphylococci and streptococcal organisms. The mastitis causing strains, mainly <italic>staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>streptocococcus epidermidis</italic> usually display two common properties; resistance to antibiotics and a high ability to form biofilms, which may explain their resistance to a wide range of antibiotic therapies and resultant recurrence of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A recent WHO report outlines the growing public health concern related to antimicrobial resistance. The report stresses that resistance of common bacteria to antimicrobial drugs has reached alarming levels, with available options for treating infections becoming increasingly ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further, authors stress the importance of actively seeking safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics.</p><p>Probiotics, with their increasing recognition and use in recent years, may provide one such alternative. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts are thought to confer a beneficial effect to the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Research indicates that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties comparable to a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Given the gut microbiota is a critical stimulus for the adequate maturation and function of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], oral administration of probiotics to women during the early postnatal period to modulate microbiota composition is thought to provide an effective dietary strategy to reduce the risk of infection and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Although the knowledge of the commensal and/or potential probiotic bacteria that exist in milk of healthy women is limited, bacteria commonly isolated from this substrate include <italic>staphylococci, streptococci, micrococci, lactobacilli</italic> and <italic>enterococci</italic>. Of these, <italic>lactobacilli</italic> are considered to constitute the primary microbiological barrier to infection by intestinal and urogenital pathogens. Thus, breast milk of healthy woman may be a source of potentially probiotic or biotherapeutic lactobacilli with a role in protecting mothers and/or infants against infectious diseases. In contrast, mastitis, characterised by inflammation of one or more lobule of the mammary gland, usually has an infectious origin involving <italic>staphylococci, streptococci, and/or corynebacteria,</italic> with staphylococcus aureus thought to be the main aetiological agent of acute mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A number of studies have demonstrated that administration of probiotic bacteria, particularly the lactobacilli strain isolated from human milk, has the potential to prevent and treat maternal breast infections caused by <italic>Staphalycoccus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; the key mechanism for this probiotic treatment of mastitis being related to the stimulation of the host intra-mammary immune system. Moreover, findings from a recent randomised trial revealed that two strains of lactobacilli, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic> provided some evidence as to their effectiveness as alternatives to antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. One of these strains, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius,</italic> has recently been investigated for the prevention of mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This study, along with previous animal studies have shown promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, due to the limited evidence, there is a need for more thorough investigations of the use of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis.</p><p>The use of probiotic bacteria during pregnancy and postpartum has also been proposed as a means of modulating maternal infection or inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and to support immune development in the infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Breastfed infants of mothers who consumed specific probiotics in the early postpartum period reported fewer gastrointestinal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], while risk of atopic eczema, allergy and asthma was shown to confer some benefit during the first 2 years of life by some studies, but not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Further studies with longer follow-up and amongst specific maternal populations most likely to benefit from probiotics, have been recommended. Reassuringly, the probiotic studies that have been performed in postpartum women did not report any major side effects to the mother or infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Maternal side effects of mild gas or bloating were occasionally noted.</p><p>To date, evidence suggests that probiotics may provide an effective measure and alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis and that postpartum use may also confer additional benefit to the infant. Thus, the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women should be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>The primary aim of the APProve (C<bold>A</bold>n <bold>P</bold>robiotics Im<bold>Prove</bold> Breastfeeding Outcomes?) study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Independent assessment of intervention and mobile phone application system</title><p>A separate sub-study will be conducted to assess the independent effect of the probiotic without the potential influence of the APProve-Lite system. Despite the APP being a tool to facilitate data collection and improve compliance, it may be viewed as an intervention in itself, and have an unintended effect on study outcomes. Assessment of the APP is important to ensure this tool does not bias or exert any influence on study outcomes. This will involve a sub-study utilising a pragmatic and &#x02018;standard follow-up&#x02019; approach to data collection and follow-up of women throughout the trial for collection of information on symptoms related to study outcomes and ensuring compliance with the ingestion of the intervention.</p><p>The sub-study will involve a sample of 100 women who will be recruited on randomly selected days of each month. These women will be recruited and enrolled into the trial in an identical way to those of the APP group and randomised to the intervention as in the main study. However, they will not be asked to use the APP throughout the trial. Rather, these women will be provided with a 2-month calendar diary to complete each day. They will be encouraged to place this in a visible location such as on the fridge to encourage daily compliance. Here they will record daily ingestion of the probiotic and symptoms via check boxes (daily survey). They will be provided with an addressed reply-paid envelope in which to post the completed diary back to the recruiting center. Each week, women will be emailed a link to an online Survey Monkey questionnaire to complete (weekly survey). At the end of the intervention, women will be emailed a web-link to the 2, 6 and 12-month follow-up questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data monitoring committee</title><p>The data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established to monitor the trial and review the study progress. The DMC will meet once half way through trial recruitment to review the safety data and monitor the progress of the trial. There will be only one analysis at the end of the trial. The Committee members will be independent of the trial, free of conflicts with any of the investigative team. The terms of reference and functions are derived from the principles established by the Data and Safety Monitoring Boards: Lessons, Ethics, Statistics Study Group charter. The DMC will report its recommendations directly to the Trial Steering Committee, who are the authors of this protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Adverse event reporting</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Adverse event</title><p>Side effects of the probiotic will be collected via the 2-month questionnaire.

Although the Cochrane review reported an overall 57% non-significant reduction in mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with individual trials finding an up to 76% reduced risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], we chose a more conservative 50% reduction as a clinically meaningful treatment effect. Based on an expected rate of mastitis in the control group of 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, we estimated a total sample size of 452 would be required. However, given studies related to the duration of breastfeeding report a cessation rate in the first 8 weeks post-partum of up to 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and a potential loss-to follow-up of 5&#x02013;10% may occur with withdrawals or non-compliance, we inflated the sample size by a further 30% to ensure complete data. Hence, we estimated a total sample size of approximately 600 women would be required (300 per group) for this trial, including all sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The analysis and reporting of the results will follow the CONSORT guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</ext-link>). Primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, which includes all losses-to follow-up, non-compliances or withdrawals. Baseline characteristics will be compared between allocated treatment groups using frequencies and descriptive statistics. The principal analysis will use an unadjusted Chi-Square test to compare the incidence of mastitis between the two groups. The corresponding unadjusted relative risk with 95% confidence interval will also be calculated. Further analysis of the primary outcome will use multivariable logistic regression to examine the effect of adjusting for any imbalances at baseline or important predictors of mastitis (e.g. previous history of mastitis, antibiotic use, cracked nipples, or duration of breastfeeding). Additional unadjusted and adjusted analyses of all secondary outcomes will be performed using measures and multivariable models appropriate for the outcome. An analysis of women compliant with treatment (per protocol) will also be performed to assess the robustness of the primary findings. For all analyses, the number of cases with complete data and those with missing values will be reported. If necessary, reason for and type of missing data will be assessed to determine whether multiple imputation, sensitivity analysis or other approaches (&#x0201c;best&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;worst&#x0201d; case scenario, last value carried forward) will be required. Analyses will be performed using SPSS Version 24 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 2016 IBM Corporation,&#x000a0;Chicago, IL) by an analyst not involved in any data collection and blinded to treatment allocation.</p><p>To assess the impact of the APP, the rate of primary and secondary study outcomes will be compared between the main study group and small sub-sample. Compliance rates in the ingestion of the intervention, and completeness and acceptability of data collected during daily and weekly follow-up will also be examined between the two study groups.</p><p>This protocol has been formatted according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>Interventions that support prolonging breastfeeding duration have the potential to improve human health. Mastitis is a painful and debilitating complication of breastfeeding which affects 1 in 5 breastfeeding mothers. It is associated with early cessation of breastfeeding and, if severe, may lead to unwarranted hospital admissions for treatment of abscess often requiring treatment with antibiotics. At a time when we are experiencing the negative effects of antibiotic overuse, there is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing infections such as mastitis in lactating women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may increase breastfeeding duration and potentially provide long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children, as well as decrease antibiotic usage with benefits to the community and health system.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional file</title><p>
