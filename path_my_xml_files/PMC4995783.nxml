Over the years this has led to significant changes in how human embryos are processed: New culture media have been introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; length of embryo culture has in many IVF centers changed from 2&#x02013;3 days to 5&#x02013;6 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; and culture at reduced oxygen tension has been reported to improve embryo development and clinical pregnancy rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Increasingly, there has also been talk in recent years about automating embryology, whether to improve quality or cost effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>It, therefore, was no surprise when in recent years a series of automated closed incubation systems became commercially available. They offered the additional benefit of allowing consistent observation of embryo development via time-lapse imaging (TLI), without need of opening incubator doors, reported to be detrimental to embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>By minimizing environmental fluctuations in temperature, pH and humidity, supporters of such closed incubation systems have argued that embryo quality would be improved and, therefore, clinical outcomes. They also suggested that continuous time-lapse documentation of embryo development would improve embryo selection and, thereby, further improve pregnancy chances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These instrumentations, however, entered the market place without clinical validation for either claim. Till today it, therefore, is unknown whether embryos from different patient populations (ie, good vs. poor prognosis or younger vs, older patients) are affected differently by such culture systems.</p><p>In traditional embryology, embryo selection is performed manually and individually, trying to remove embryos from controlled incubation only as rarely as possible. Embryo assessment is, therefore, dependent on experience and training of embryologists, and will vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Time-lapse imaging (TLI) systems, in contrast, offer computer assisted, objective and non-invasive embryo assessments. Continuous recording of all key developmental events, at least hypothetically, allows for improved embryo selection based on observations, which would be missed by manual embryology. They, therefore, have been alleged to improve embryo selection and clinical pregnancy chances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Several studies have claimed early timing events to be predictive of blastocyst formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Currently available data appear, however, insufficient to support the conclusion that TLI systems, indeed, are helpful enough in embryo selection to improve IVF cycle outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Several recent studies of TLI systems failed to achieve improvements in embryo quality and other clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Park et al., indeed, reported a significant increase in miscarriages after TLI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Most so far reported studies of TLI have been anecdotal and uncontrolled. To the best of our knowledge, only two prospectively randomized studies have so far been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], one in very good prognosis patients reporting a marginal benefit for TLI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reporting no difference to standard embryology. Three systematic reviews also concluded that there was no outcome benefit from TLI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, IVF interventions that may be successful in good prognosis patients, may lack benefits in other patient populations, like average-prognosis patients, and have been demonstrated to be actually detrimental to outcomes in poor-prognosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>We, therefore, in this study attempted to asses the clinical value of a TLI system in two distinct patient populations: We, first, prospectively investigates a group of poor-prognosis patients by randomizing them to TLI and standard embryology. Secondly, we, however, investigated a group of egg donors as best-prognosis patients.</p><p>As this study will demonstrate, TLI systems in human embryology laboratories requires careful evaluation before further integration into routine human IVF practice since their effectiveness appears to be patient-dependent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Institutional review board (IRB)</title><p>Since the EmbryoScope&#x02122; was approved by The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in human embryology laboratories, and has been integrated into routine embryology practice in many IVF centers, here reported clinical trial (clinical trial registration # NCT02256309, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>) represented a prospective clinical comparison of two standard embryology practices in IVF, and was, therefore, approved by our center&#x02019;s IRB by expedited review.

A follow-up study, which attempted to determine potential causes for observed findings in Part B of the study, was carried out between April and June, 2015.</p><p>Part A of the study was an open-label prospectively randomized clinical trial, offered during the study period to consecutive patients undergoing autologous IVF (+ICSI) cycles. The primary study outcome was clinical pregnany. Anticipation was to recruit approximately 30 patients per month, resulting in a study population for randomization of ca. 100 patients. We initiated the study as a pilot study since power analysis suggested that the expected patient number to detect at least 20&#x000a0;% difference in clinical pregnancy rates would, likely, be insufficient. Our hope was that the manufacturer might extend our access to the equipment beyond 3 months to reach required numbers for statistical power. Power analyses of secondary outcomes, including embryo parameters, and time analysis of embryologists, suggested need for fewer patients/ cycles to reach statistically valuable information. We, therefore, assumed that without extended availability of the instrument, we still should be able to assess potentially important secondary outcomes with adequate statistical power.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> summarized the CONSORT flowchart for this trial: In part A of the trial 134 patients were offered participatation during the study period. To our surprise only 49 qualified and/or consented to participate by informed consent. Computer randomization to either TLI or standard embryology was the responsibility of a member of the center&#x02019;s Statistics Section (SKD) who was completely disassociated from the patient&#x02019;s IVF cycle. The designation was then reported to the embryology staff, which processed the patient&#x02019;s oocytes/embryos accordingly.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow diagram for the TLI culture randomized control trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02256309)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12958_2016_181_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Related to our center&#x02019;s adverse patient selection, the final number of women undergoing randomization for part A was only 31 (Panel a) after exclusion of other patients.

Moreover, maybe even more importantly, whether these closed culture systems are clinically equally effective in different patient populations has never before been investigated.</p><p>Embryos of good and poor prognosis or of younger and older women are known to behave differently during in vitro culture. The aim of this study was, therefore, twofold: (i) to assess whether a TLI system achieves similar IVF outcomes to standard manual embryology; and (ii) whether the efficacy of a TLI system is the same in better and poorer prognosis patients.</p><p>Our center does not change laboratory pratices without prior assessments of non-inferiority and, hopefully, determination of superiority. Before purchasing a closed incubation system, we, therefore, contacted different manufacturers in attempts to perform a prospectively randomized pilot study to assess how such a system would perform in our center&#x02019;s highly adversely selected patient population. Only one, the manufacturer of the EmbryoScope&#x02122;, graciously agreed to provide us with a loaner instrument for a 3-months study period. Intarmural research funds were used to pay for installation of the instrument, staff training and supply costs. The study only commenced, once the manufacturer was confident that our center&#x02019;s embryology staff was competent in using the instrument.</p><p>Limited time availability of the system resticted the number of patients we were able to investigate.

When our investigation was initiated, the instrument had been investigated in only one RCT, involving very favorably selected patients That study reported the instrument to marginally improve IVF outcomes (27). As effectiveness of some IVF interventions differs between good-, intermediate- and poor-prognosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], we felt the need to assess its efficacy in our patient population before committing to a purchase. Ages, FSH and AMH levels of here investigated patients (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) reflect the poor outcome prognosis of our patients in comparison to the Spanish study by Rubio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>That in contrast to their study no outcome benefits from the EmbryScope&#x02122; were seen in our investigation is, therefore, noteworthy. Our findings may suggest that closed incubation systems in different patient populations may demonstrate different degrees of efficacy. The small size and, therefore, inadequate power of our study, however, does not preclude a Type 2 error in failing to demonstrate an outcome difference in Part A of this study. Significant outcome differences may only become apparent with larger patient numbers. Since observed implantation and pregnancy rates actually trended toward traditional embryology (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), a potential outcome benefit from the instrument over standard embryology, however, appears unlikely.</p><p>No differences (ie, no improvements) in embryo development with TLI systems have been reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

In this first investigation of such a claim claim, as Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> demonstrates, the EmbryoScope&#x02122; almost doubled embryo observation times in comparison to standard embryology. Trying to determine the cause(s), we discovered that the instrument required repeated adjustment of focus because initial monitor images were not as clear as with manual inverted microscopy. Embryo scoring was also more challenging since embryos tended to migrate toward the sides of wells, as also reported by Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The EmbryoScope&#x02122;, thus, does not appear to save embryology staffing time, and, indeed, may increase staffing needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Randomization of embryos in best prognosis patients (Part B)</title><p>Part B of this study was intended to assess the instrument in &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; prognosis patients. In using young oocyte donors, large oocyte yields allowed open randomization of embryos between EmbryoScope&#x02122; and standard embryology in place of patient randomization. In the previously noted Spanish RCT, oocyte donors represented almost half of the patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The intent, therefore, was to investigate performance of the TLI system in best-prognosis patients, even exceeding the favorable patient selection of the Spanish study.</p><p>Since based on the Spanish study we expected improvements in IVF outcomes, we were surprised to observe the opposite. We were further surprised by the statistical power of observed outcome differences, even though small numbers call for caution in interpretation: Despite the relative small study size (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), the EmbryoScope&#x02122; produced significantly fewer Grade A and, therefore, significantly more Grade B embryos than standard embryology, suggesting a potentially negative impact of the TLI system on embryo quality.</p><p>Observing these rather surprising results raised the question whether staff members operating the EmbryoScope&#x02122; had been sufficiently trained. We, therefore, reviewed embryology staffing records, and found that the embryologists handling the instrument during Parts A and B of here reported study were exactly the same. Insufficient staff training, therefore, only unlikey explains the findings of this study.</p><p>Our suspicion then fell on the culture dish of the EmbryoScope&#x02122;, called the EmbryoSlide&#x02122;. It is a single-use, sterile culture dish, especially designed for the EmbryoScope<sup>TM</sup> incubator. Each EmbryoSlide&#x02122; holds up to 12 embryos, each cultured individually in droplets of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l media. They, therefore, are cultured in relative low density and not grouped together. In contrast, conventional dishes, as utilized at our center, culture up to 5 embryos in 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l droplets.</p><p>Higher embryo density group culture has been reported to benefit embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], possibly the consequence of one or more factors produced by embryos, which can stimulate embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We, therefore, parallel cultured alternating donor embryos in EmbryoSlides&#x02122; and standard embryo culture dishes in the same incubation environmentone (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). As the table demonstrates, this additional prospective evaluation by day-3 of culture demonstrated no difference in embryo quality between both embryo culture dishes. The EmbryoSlide&#x02122;, therefore, apparently was not the cause of our observation.</p><p>This left us with no established cause for our observation, and the conclusion that the incubation envrironment in the EmbryoScope&#x02122;, likely, was inferior to our center&#x02019;s standard embryo culture environment. Such an explanation is not farfetched: Several physical factors can impact final embryo development during in vitro culture, including incubation volume/embryo density, temperature/pH and light as well as shear stress from mechanical motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Even minimal changes in temperature during culture (away from 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) for short time periods can result in unrecoverable damage by hurting the stability of the oocye/embryo spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The pH of medium also plays a crucial role in embryo culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], while regulation of pH mostly relies on the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration.</p><p>The user manual of the EmbryoScope&#x02122;, notes that the instrument is equipped with unique temperature controls, characterized by direct heat transfer to individual media-filled wells. Temperature is alleged to be virtually unchanged by opening the chamber (&#x0003c;0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) when adding or removing embryos. Recovery of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is alleged to occur in less than 5&#x000a0;min and of O<sub>2</sub> in less than 15&#x000a0;min after closing of chamber. During this study, we. indeed, based on the built-in monitoring software, did not note temperature and/or CO<sub>2</sub> concentration changes of any significance.</p><p>It has been suggested that prolonged light exposure required for time-lapse photography may negatively affect embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The EmbryoScope<sup>TM</sup>, however, uses long wave length light of lower intensities (red light, 635&#x000a0;nm) than the light used in our embryology laboratory during standard embryo assessments under a microscope (15&#x000a0;% &#x0003c;550&#x000a0;nm). There also are currently no experimental data in the literature to support any negative effects of greater light exposure on embryos with use of the EmbryoScope<sup>TM</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>All of this leaves only one likely explanation for our findings: The EmbryoScope<sup>TM</sup> contains a microscope, built into a compact incubator. During image capture, the microscope is fixed, while the tray and culture dish move slightly to focus each single well. Since in our study, images were taken every 10&#x000a0;min, embryos during three days of culture had to move at least 380 times. Though this embryo motion is very gentle and mild, the impact of possible sheer stress cannot be ruled out as a potential cause for observed declines in embryo quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The effect may be statistically more apparent in best prognosis patients because even a relative small percentage loss in pregnancy in such a population may be statistically more apparent. This also would explain why the reported improvement in outcomes in the Spanish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which included only a little less than half of best prognosis patients (ie, egg donors) was only marginal. If our here laid out assumptions are correct, had the Spanish study included even more oocyte donors (ie, good prognosis patients), it too, may no longer have demonstrated marginally better IVF cycle outcomes with the TLI system or might even have drifted into the negative.</p><p>Mouse models that investigated the effects of mechanical vibration induced shear stress on embryo development, demonstrating decreased morula and blastocyst formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], caused by phosphorylating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 8/9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Similar phosphorylation of MAPK 8/9 was never observed in control embryo or in vivo cultured embryos.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>All of above noted considerations suggest that the most likely explanation for the inferior performance of the EmbryoScope&#x02122; in good prognosis donors is increased exposure of embryos to shear stress. This is, however, as of this point still a hypothesis, which requires experimental confirmation. If confirmed, this negative finding may not be applicable to other TLI systems with different camera systems.</p><p>Because of its limited size, as already noted, here presented data have to be interpreted with caution. We also have to acknowledge that we followed embryo outcomes in this study only to cleavage-stage (day-3), while TLI systems are primarily meant to be used to culture embryos to blastocyst stage (days 5/6). Though unlikely, it is possible that TLI systems affect prolonged embryo culture more favorably. Since blastocyst stage culture really only benefits good prognosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] this, at best represents only a double-edged-sword since the opposite may actually also be true, and benefits of a TLI system by day-3 may be overestimated.</p><p>This study, however, clearly demonstrates the need for larger, well designed prospectively randomized studies before TLI systems are placed into human embryology laboratories for routine IVF care. It is also important to point out that here reported study results cannot be generalized since they reflect the quality of our center&#x02019;s manual embryology. Outcome comparisons with manual embryology may obviously differ at different embryology laboratories.</p><p>If properly maintained, likely the quintessential advantage of a TLI system is stability of its performance. Less competent or less stable manual embryology may, therefore, indeed benefit from systems like the EmbryoScope&#x02122;, while superior manual embryology can, at least in good prognosis patients, likely outperform TLI systems. A TLI like the EmbryoScope&#x02122; may, thus, actually improve IVF outcomes in programs with unstable embryology by stabilizing performance; yet, in a program with excellent embryology, effects may be the opposite.</p><p>In full disclosure, based on here reported study results, our center for the time being is foregoing the purchase of TLI systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AMH, anti-M&#x000fc;llerian hormone; COCs, oocyte-cumulus complexes; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; GnRHa, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist; hCG, human chorionic gonadotopin; hMG, human menopausal gonadotropin; HSA, human serum albumin; ICSI, intracytoplasmic sperm injection; IRB, institutional review board; IVF, in vitro fertilization; RCT, randomized controlled trial; SEM, standard error of the mean; TLI, time-lapse imaging</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by intramural funds from The Center for Human Reproduction and by grants from The Foundation for Reproductive Medicine.
