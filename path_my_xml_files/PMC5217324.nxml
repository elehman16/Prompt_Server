The NDPS programme recognizes the need to reduce intervention costs through group delivery and the use of lay mentors with T2DM, the realities of normal primary care, and the complexity of the current glycaemic categorisation of T2DM risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>NDPS identifies people at highest risk of T2DM on the databases of 135 general practices in the East of England for further screening with ab fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c]. Those with an elevated fasting plasma glucose [impaired fasting glucose or IFG] with or without an elevated HbA1c [non -diabetic hyperglycaemia; NDH] are randomised into three treatment arms: a control arm receiving no trial intervention, an arm receiving an intensive bespoke group-based diet and physical activity intervention, and an arm receiving the same intervention with enhanced support from people with T2DM trained as diabetes prevention mentors [DPM]. The primary end point is cumulative transition rates to T2DM between the two intervention groups, and between each intervention group and the control group at 46&#x000a0;months. Participants with screen detected T2DM are randomized into an equivalent prospective controlled trial with the same intervention and control arms with glycaemic control [HbA1c] at 46&#x000a0;months as the primary end point. Participants with NDH and a normal fasting plasma glucose are randomised into an equivalent prospective controlled intervention trial with follow up for 40&#x000a0;months. The intervention comprises six education sessions for the first 12&#x000a0;weeks and then up to 15 maintenance sessions until intervention end, all delivered in groups, with additional support from a DPM in one treatment arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The NDPS programme reports in 2018 and will provide trial outcome data for a group delivered diabetes prevention intervention, supported by lay mentors with T2DM, with intervention in multiple at risk glycaemic categories, and that takes into account the realities of normal clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

Landmark clinical trials suggest that intensive lifestyle (diet and physical activity) intervention in a research setting reduces the risk of T2DM in highest risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These clinical prevention trials have largely focused on intensive lifestyle interventions in people at highest risk, usually with a plasma glucose (fasting or during an oral glucose tolerance test) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), that is elevated, but not to any diagnostic threshold for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In these trials the effect size is consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and there may be long term beneficial legacy effects of the trial intervention, even after the intervention is withdrawn. Despite this, there remain concerns about the translatability of this trial evidence into normal clinical practice at scale, partly because of the very high costs associated with individualized intervention, and smaller effect sizes in &#x02018;real world&#x02019; interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These concerns were valid when the NDPS programme commenced in 2011 and remain valid now, despite the launch of the NHS England diabetes prevention programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The costs of diabetes prevention intervention can be reduced by group based delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the team who delivered the landmark study in this area recognised that &#x02018;community health workers&#x02019; could be an attractive model for delivering lifestyle intervention at reduced cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There has been growing interest in this model over the last few years for the clinical management of Type 2 diabetes, and to a lesser degree in diabetes prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recent changes in the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, with a shift from glucose based criteria to one based on HbA1c, with a diagnostic threshold of an HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol is widely supported and adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, this policy generates a large new population with prediabetes, usually defined as HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;42&#x02013;&#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol. NICE PH38 policy guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] is that these patients should receive intensive lifestyle advice and annual HbA1c monitoring, but there is relatively little trial evidence that this leads to a reduced T2DM incidence in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is still an active debate about the best approach to find those at highest risk of developing T2DM, and which glycaemic category should receive a clinical or research diabetes prevention intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) are time consuming, unsuitable for mass population screening in ordinary primary care, and are unpopular with patients clinically and in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Identifying those at highest T2DM risk for a trial intervention that translatable into normal clinical practice, must reflect the usual approach in normal clinical practice, which for some time has been based on HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose data. However, most of the large trials have examined populations defined as at risk using a GTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One final issue is that case finding for those at highest risk for entry to prevention trials or clinical prevention programs using widely available risk prediction algorithms may not be easily applicable in all primary care as some of the key variables in these risk prediction tools may be unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Mass screening in primary care for high risk individuals should reflect existing primary care models and available data, with limited additional workload.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Need for trial</title><p>The aim of this 7&#x000a0;year NIHR funded programme [PGfAR RP &#x02013; PG - 0109-10013] is to test the primary hypothesis that our novel diet and physical activity intervention reduces the risk of T2DM in a screened target population of UK adults with high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The programme comprises a large screening and risk identification study, and a suite of randomised controlled trials designed to assess the effectiveness of a realistic diabetes prevention intervention, that is community based, with recruitment through general practice. The trials are based in the realities of current NHS care, with interventions delivered in groups in the local community, in part by lay mentors with T2DM, with minimal impact on general practice. The programme recognises the current complexity of screening and glycaemic categorisation of patients at risk of diabetes, including screen detected T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Specific objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The NDPS programme has several elements: a screening programme [Project 1] to identify those at highest risk of T2DM on general practice databases in the East of England. The main element of the programme is then a randomised controlled prospective three - arm trial in those participants found to be at highest risk [Project 2], with one intervention arm supported by lay mentors [Diabetes Prevention Mentors; DPM] who have T2DM themselves. Project 3 is the recruitment, training and retention of these DPM. Project 4 ia a randomised controlled prospective three - arm trial of the same intervention[s] in people found to have a new diagnosis of screen detected T2DM in Project 1. Project 5 is the health economic analysis of these projects. Finally, Project 6 is a randomised controlled prospective two -arm pilot intervention in participants found in Project 1 screening to have non - diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH) but with a normal fasting glucose in Project 1.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Project 1 objective</title><p>To screen 10,000 participants at high risk of T2DM for non-diabetic hyperglycaemia [NDH; HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;42 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol] or impaired fasting glucose [IFG; &#x02265; 5.6 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/l] to identify participants for randomisation into one of a suite of randomised clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Project 2 hypothesis</title><p>The cumulative incidence of T2DM will be significantly lower after 46&#x000a0;months in a high risk group with impaired fasting glucose [IFG; fasting plasma glucose &#x02265;6.1 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/l] <italic>or</italic> with non -diabetic hyperglycaemia [NDH; HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;42 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol] and an elevated fasting plasma glucose [&#x02265;5.6 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;6.1&#x000a0;mmol/l] randomised to our lifestyle intervention [standard intervention group], compared to a group randomised to this intervention enhanced by additional lay diabetes prevention mentor [DPM] input, or to a control group who do not receive any trial intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Project 3 hypothesis</title><p>We can identify, recruit, train and retain 70 volunteers with known T2DM to become diabetes prevention mentors [DPM] to support one intervention arm in each of Projects 2 and 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Project 4 hypothesis</title><p>Mean HbA1c [as a measure of glycaemic control] will be significantly lower after 46&#x000a0;months intervention in participant groups with newly diagnosed screen detected T2DM [fasting plasma glucose&#x02009;&#x0003e;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/l and/or HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003e;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol] randomised to the same intervention groups as in Project 2 than in an equivalent control group who do not receive this trial intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Project 5 objective</title><p>Health economic analysis of all aspects of the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Project 6 objective</title><p>To observe changes in mean HbA1c after 40&#x000a0;months in participants with non - diabetic hyperglycaemia [NDH; HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;42 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol] and a normal fasting plasma glucose [&#x0003c;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/l] randomised to an observational controlled trial of our standard intervention compared to a control group not receiving this intervention.</p><p>Allocation into trial by glycaemic category is summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>

Randomisation of participants is conducted automatically using a dedicated function in the trial data management system. The randomisation mechanism for Project 2 consists of a pre-prepared random list of codes [for the Intervention and control groups] that are stored in the trial database. To reduce the risk of predicting the next allocation while maintaining a reasonable even spread of intervention and control patients, the list is constructed of blocks of 17 codes [3 Control, 7 intervention and 7 Intervention&#x02009;+&#x02009;DPM]] to approximate the proportions of 170:390:390 respectively. The list was built prior to the start of the programme using standard Microsoft tools. Randomisation is asymmetric to deliver the sample sizes described. Project 4 and the Project 6 pilot Project are randomised using the same method in the trial data mangement system.

Current data suggest that the targeted Norfolk population is approximately 550,000 aged &#x02265;40&#x02013;&#x02264;75, registered at 137 GP practices within five Clinical Commissioning Groups [CCG&#x02019;s] throughout Norfolk. The targeted central Ipswich (Suffolk) population has a registered population of 125,374 patients aged &#x02265;40&#x02013;&#x02264;75 in 32 GP practices in one CCG and the targeted North East Essex area [largely central Colchester] has an estimated population of 171,545 patients aged &#x02265;40&#x02013;&#x02264;75 in 38 GP practices in one targeted CCG. NDPS have contacted 207 GP practices within these seven CCG&#x02019;s, providing the programme with a total population of 846,919 potentially eligible participants. All GP practices are invited to particpate and the GP practice&#x02019;s electronic health record [EHR] software such as SystmOne and EMIS [The Phoenix Partnership TPP, TPP House Horsforth Leeds, UK and EMIS Health Rawdon House, Yeadon, Leeds, UK] is interrogated for patients eligible for Project 1. EHRs are real-time, patient-centred records that make information available instantly and securely to authorised users and make extensive use of Read codes and digital information is searchable via these codes. The GP practice is provided with the coding criteria based on the study inclusion/exclusion criteria (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Patients are then written to directly from the practice using Docmail, which allows mass mailing by uploading and merging the generated patient list with the NDPS mail pack documents. The system allows the practice to securely upload the NDPS document template and mail to patients via a secure web portal. The use of Docmail for such purposes is permissible under guidance from both the Information Commissioner&#x02019;s Office [ICO] and the Department of Health [DoH] UK, subject to the provisions of the UK Data Protection Act 1998. The NDPS mail pack consist of a patient invite letter and the study Participant Information Sheet [PIS].

The DPM work with Diabetes Prevention Facilitators [DPF] to deliver the enhanced intervention. Each participant receives a 15&#x000a0;min semi-structured telephone call from the DPM every 4&#x000a0;weeks during the education session phase [first 12&#x000a0;weeks of programme] and then every 8&#x000a0;weeks between maintenance sessions. Before the newly recruited DPM&#x02019;s are offered their role they are formally interviewed by the Senior Intervention Research Associate and the Programme Manager/Principal Investigator, with possible assistance from a Diabetes Patient Champion [a lay person with diabetes who represents the diabetes community]. DPM&#x02019;s are recruited following a successful Disclosure &#x00026; Barring Service [DBS] check and two satisfactory references. If successful the DPM is given an NHS honorary volunteer contract and receives specific training for their role. DPM are recruited via GP database recruitment searches using coding criteria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Once a participant is randomized into a DPM intervention group, their availability for receiving calls is reviewed (NM) and assigned a DPM based on the DPM availability to make calls. This allows for the greatest possible call connnection rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Training of Diabetes Prevention Mentors (DPM)</title><p>The NDPS specific standardised training programme for DPM (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) is delivered in seven 120&#x02013;150&#x000a0;min sessions over a minimum of 4&#x000a0;weeks to allow time for self-reflection and reading between each session. The training has two clear aims 1] to provide up to date information on physical activity, diet, pre diabetes.and the impact of lifestyle on the the progression to T2DM and 2] to practice (using role play) the key skills required. To successfully complete the group training seminars and be cleared to work with study participants, DPMs are required to attend at least six of the seven sessions (with sessions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 requiring compulsory attendance). Furthermore, DPMs needed to demonstrate an understanding of the intervention theory and to demonstrate successfully the active listening skills required. During the seminars, the senior research associate (NM) assesses the strengths and learning needs of each trainee and structures their following one to one practice training accordingly. The one to one practice work consisted of telephone call/s where DPMs adopt the role of the Mentor and the Senior Research Associate adopts the role of a trial participant. These calls model particular situations where it is felt the DPM needs to be &#x02018;tested&#x02019;.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Summary of diabetes prevention mentor (DPM) training seminars content and aims</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>

Classification of glycaemic categories and eligibility for randomisation is made on the basis of concordant paired baseline measurements, and sampling is repeated if necessary until paired concordant data allow classification. Samples for fasting lipids and insulin are also taken at this second appointment to form the baseline trial results. The lifestyle intervention comprises of 6 &#x000d7; 2&#x000a0;h education sessions of varying content for the first 12&#x000a0;weeks of the intervention which provide information and encourage decision making about behaviour change, increase motivation to change support lifestyle changes in relation to physical activity and diet with individual goal setting, action planning and self-monitoring. This core programme is followed by up to 15 maintenance sessions held 8&#x000a0;weeks apart from month 4 until intervention end which include facilitated discussion and physical activity circuits. Participants attend group based sessions, led by a trained DPF. On average there are eight participants in each group, with a maximum of 12. The groups remain together for the duration of the study, providing motivation for one another and a supportive network as the group bonds. All participants in the trial arms are expected to attend a 34&#x000a0;month active intervention, comprising of the 3&#x000a0;months education sessions, one month break post education and 30&#x000a0;months of maintenance sessions.

An interactive topical discussion is included to aid continued learning and development and increase motivation. Each session is concluded by the inclusion of goal setting activity including action and coping planning, links are made from the solutions, and barriers discussed during the progress review to aid the setting of new goals.

This theoretical model was adapted from the Health Action Process Approach, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and includes modifications to place a greater emphasis on self-monitoring, social support, use of coping plans and relapse management. The key intervention processes are i) increasing motivation (perceived importance of healthy lifestyle, self-efficacy for achieving healthy lifestyle, perceived risk and outcome expectations); ii) making a specific action plan (including plans for social support and for overcoming barriers (coping plans)) and iii) supporting maintenance through repeated &#x02018;self-regulatory cycles&#x02019; of planning, self-monitoring and other feedback (for example on blood sugar), problem-solving to manage setbacks and revision of action plans.

The ingroup size is initially 10&#x02013;12 participants, with options to merge groups over time (at the maintenance stage) if attendance diminishes.

Briefly, the intervention aims to reduce diabetes progression through increased physical activity, specific changes in diet and weight loss. Behaviour change goals were set by participants but the NDPS intervention encouraged participants to shape these goals around 4 set targets; 1) If a BMI is over 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> then to work towards a 7% weight loss in the first 6&#x000a0;months and maintain until study end, 2) Reduce the amount of fat and specifically saturated fat from diet, 3) Work up to 150&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity physical activity on 5&#x000a0;days of the week or more which can be achieved through an increased step count and 4) work up to increasing muscle strength activity to 160&#x02013;300 reps on 2&#x02013;3 days of the week as these are known to induce clinically meaningful changes in diabetes risk for people with hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Behaviour change techniques are selected to facilitate each of the processes identified in the behaviour change model and delivery strategies and detailed materials are specified for each change technique. The programme delivers these strategies and techniques in a logical sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This includes a focus on one type of behaviour (diet or physical activity) in each of the first six sessions and a combined focus in the maintenance sessions. In the first six sessions, activities to implement behaviour change techniques are combined with activities to build understanding around what lifestyle changes to make (e.g. what is a healthy diet?, what is moderate intensity activity?) and how to change them (e.g., how to make a SMART-ER action plans, how to identify and solve problems). Maintenance sessions then focus on reviewing progress, problem-solving any setbacks and reviewing action plans, as well as delivering a 50-min session of supervised, structured physical activity. In terms of specific strategies for lifestyle change, we present national guidance on healthy eating (based on the EatWell Guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and compared existing diet to these recommendations. However, participants were free to decide what specific changes to make. We encourag participants to choose physical activity that they can build into their existing lifestyles and present ideas for muscle-strengthening exercises. Structured activity is presented in the maintenance sessions as a) as an opportunity to practice techniques in a safe, supervised environment, and b) to reinforce the perception the programme is serious about encouraging physical activity as well as dietary change, as people may tend to focus more on the dietary aspect of such programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] To promote sustainability of lifestyle change, we advise participants to make a series of small, achievable changes, rather than dramatic changes. We encourage participants to prioritise ideas for change that would not detract from their enjoyment of food (for dietary changes) or that would be enjoyable or easy to build into a routine (for physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Delivery and facilitator training</title><p>The initial six session &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; intervention is delivered to each group of participants by a single facilitator (DPF) where possible. The sessions are semi-structured with a printed session plan and a set of Powerpoint slides for each session. Presentation of the session is based on the slides, with a mixture of didactic presentation (providing information) and interactive activities (slides are paused and participants engage in a discussion or other interactive activity, such as problem-solving, or action-planning). Content is tailored to build on the existing knowledge and skills of participants. The DPF spends time with each individual who needs help during action-planning activities and tries where possible (within the limits of group-based delivery) to elicit and respond to individual motivations, barriers to change or other concerns. Flipcharts are used to keep track of ideas from the group in a number of interactive activities and additional printed information materials (handouts) are available for a number of sessions covering a range of topics (for example, healthy eating, why weight loss plateaus and what to do about it, a pictorial diagram of a set of muscle-strengthening exercises that can be performed at home/without any equipment),.</p><p>
<italic>NDPS diabetes prevention facilitators (DPF)</italic> are recruited from varied backgrounds and experience, including academic qualifications in nutrition or physical activity, fitness industry, and physiotherapy. A 5&#x000a0;day training course was developed and delivered (primarily NM and CG). The course content focuses on developing behaviour change skills (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), updating knowledge (for example on healthy eating), using the intervention materials, delivering the session content using the slides and session plans and data collection issues (including providing data for the research study). The style of delivery is important and we trained the facilitators to use person-centred counselling techniques based on motivational interviewing (open questioning, affirmation, reflective listening, summaries, use of the Ask-Tell-Discuss technique for information exchange) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to promote autonomous motivation and to deliver all of the intervention content. A selection of 3&#x02013;4 audio recordings per facilitator of session delivery is reviewed to check fidelity of intervention delivery. Facilitators also self-complete a fidelity checklist at the end of each session. The senior staff use this data to a) develop training updates and b) give the facilitators individual formative feedback. Supervision meetings are held approximately every 2&#x000a0;months, where barriers and solutions to delivery are discussed. The intervention is delivered in local community venues (e.g. community halls, University premises etc.).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Control group(s)</title><p>Participants in the control groups (Projects 2 and 6) are offered attendance at the first available planned session for their chosen intervention location. This session is offered within 4&#x000a0;weeks of being randomised into the control arm of the programme.

The primary end point in <bold>Project 4</bold> is HbA1c at 46&#x000a0;month project end as a measure of glycaemic control between groups with screen detected T2DM.

One pre specified secondary analysis in Project 2 is to analyse the cumulative incidence of T2DM in a composite analysis group of the two intervention arms combined, compared to controls. This will be undertaken if the primary comparison between intervention groups in Project 2 end is not significant. In Project 4 in addition to these secondary end points we also collect diabetes specific questionnaire data on Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire [DTSQs] and Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale [DMSES] at each time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

We also collect data on the DPM perceptions of their capacity to deliver the NDPS intervention measured by focus groups and confidential views on DPM intervention efficacy in a study specific questionnaire and focus groups. These secondary DPM data will be analysed longitudinally within group between baseline and end point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Sample size estimates, original and revised power calculations</title><p>Original NDPS sample size and power estimates [2010] were based on transition rates from IFG [&#x0003e;6.1&#x02013;&#x0003c;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/l] to T2DM in Northern European white populations. In the Danish ADDITION study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] annual transition rates were 11.8% in 1821 individuals with IFG [mean age 60&#x000a0;years; mean BMI 29.1&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and similar to our population] with a transition rate highest in the first year. In the Inter99 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], the transition rate was 10.4% for those with IFG &#x02013; IGT combined in younger and slimmer participants [age 42.7&#x000a0;years; BMI 27.7&#x000a0;kg/m2] although 50% had already had diet and lifestyle interventions. We assumed an annual incidence rate of 8% was reasonable, at a 22% cumulative incidence over 3&#x000a0;years [allowing for incident cases]. Meta- analysis of published diabetes prevention trials at the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] suggested an estimated effect size effect sizes based on a meta - analysis effect size of 0.51 [95% CI 0.44&#x02013;0.66] of diet and lifestyle interventions in IGT suggesting we could look for an equivalent effect size in our intervention groups with a 4% annual progression in the intervention group [12% cumulative incidence over 3&#x000a0;years allowing for incident cases]. A 36&#x000a0;month intervention asymmetrically randomized controlled trial of 170 controls [standard care] and 390 intervention participants gave 80% power at 5% significance level to detect this difference in proportion progressing [project 2]. We hypothesized that the intervention effect size would be further enhanced by additional support from the DPM with enhanced weight loss, weight loss maintenance and exercise adherence, which was poor at DPP end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The lowest quartile dietary fat intake participants in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] had half the T2DM incidence compared to highest quartile, with an overall mean 58% reduction, and we hypothesized that the enhanced DPM group would experience a further reduction in the T2DM incidence rate to 2% per annum [6% cumulative incidence over 3&#x000a0;years], then 390 additional IFG participants will provide 80% power at 5% significance level to detect this difference in proportions progressing compared to the intervention alone.</p><p>The move to a diagnostic cut point of HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] largely supplanted diagnosis based on fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test criteria. This policy generates a large population with NDH HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;42&#x02013;&#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol iand UK policy guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] is that these patients should receive intensive lifestyle advice and annual HbA1c monitoring. This change occurred during the early accrual period of NDPS (largely based on glucose entry criteria at inception) and we adapted the programme to take this into account as the HbA1c defined population is likely to become the dominant &#x02018;pre diabetes&#x02019; population in UK practice in the next few years. Meta - analysis of prediabetes transition rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] suggest that this HbA1c defined NDH population have an annualised T2DM incidence of 4.7% [95% CI 3.7&#x02013;5.9] for a glucose based T2DM end point, independent of any concurrent fasting glucose classification. In earlier meta analyses, annual progression rate to T2DM based on a NDH, independent of any concurrent fasting plasma glucose data, was 5&#x02013;10% per annum, with an estimated annualised transition to T2DM of 7.5% at a mean HbA1c of approximately 44&#x000a0;mmol/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In NDPS, mean HbA1c in the NDH group was 43.7 [SD 1.4] mmol/mol for the earlier screened population [Project 1]. Lipska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], demonstrated that the combination of both NDH range HbA1c and IFG was associated with a relative risk of T2DM of 26.2 [95% CI 16.3&#x02013;42.1] compared to those with neither, with a transition rate to T2DM of 7% per annum in the combined group. Similar risk signals at this level are apparent in other populations for a combined lower range IFG (&#x0003e;5.6&#x02013;&#x0003c;6.1&#x000a0;mmol/l) and NDH with transition rates approaching 10% per annum, at an age and gender adjusted hazard ratio of 38.6 [95% CI 27.6&#x02013;54.0] compared to normal glycaemic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Because of this policy change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and these data, since 2014 we have also randomized participants into Project 2 if they had an HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;42 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/moll combined with an elevated fasting plasma glucose&#x02009;&#x02265;5. 6&#x02013;&#x0003c;6.1&#x000a0;mmol/l Current revised power estimates reviewed and approved by independent DMEC, TSC, sponsor and funding body are based on a final accrued sample size of 972 in Project 2, with a 46&#x000a0;month follow up and end of trial 1.4.18. Current retention and follow up data, and above assumed transition rates as above, gives 99.7% power to detect these difference between controls and intervention, 84% power between controls and intervention plus DPM arm, and 78.6&#x02013;80.2% power to detect a difference between the two intervention arms. In Project 4 in order to have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.5% in HbA1c between groups at end of trial, (0.4 standard deviations based on screen detected HbA1c distribution) requires 99 participants per group, and to allow for a drop-out rate of 20%, a total of 375 individuals will be randomised. The transition rate to T2DM for subjects with NDH and a normal fasting glucose (&#x0003c;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/l) is not clear, and Project 6 is not powered to detect differences in transition rates to T2DM, but is an observational RCT in this understudied group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>For project 2 we will use an intention-to-treat approach. For binary outcomes we will use the chi-squared test or logistic regression if adjustment for baseline imbalances is required; for continuous outcomes we will use the <italic>t</italic>-test for comparison of two arms or analysis of covariance for comparison of all three. For time-to-event outcomes the proportional hazards model will be used with time measured from randomisation until the end of the study or drop-out [censoring] or diabetes is diagnosed. Secondary analyses will include a per-protocol analysis and analysis of secondary outcome measures. For determinants of progression we will use logistic regression and the proportion hazards model with the time of the onset of T2DM as the outcome measure in each treatment arm separately as well as compliance with the intervention. If necessary we will use multiple imputation to assess sensitivity to missing data. For project 2, the primary outcome measure is progression to T2DM by study exit. This will be analysed using a logistic regression model including a covariate to account for the different potential follow-up times at baseline. A secondary analysis will adjust for potential prognostic factors which will be agreed prior the final analysis. Secondary continuous outcome measures will be analysed using a general linear model in a similar fashion using the study exit. Time-until progression to T2DM will be analysed using a discrete time survival analysis model. A longitudinal analysis of the continuous secondary endpoints will also be undertaken to assess for differences over time using a random effect approach. Effect sizes will be estimated for all two-way comparison of intervention group and no adjustment for multiple testing will be undertaken. The primary analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat population but, if appropriate, a CACE analysis will also be undertaken for the primary outcome. Adverse events will be tabulate but no formal comparison will be undertaken. A similar approach will applied to Project 4 with HbA1c as the primary outcome between groups with T2DM.

The committee reviews accumulating data and advises the Chief and Principal Investigator directly and indirectly via the programme statistician, on the future management of the trial. The committee reviews the safety, efficacy, quality and compliance data of the programme at yearly committee meeting and bi-monthly reports. The DMEC is privy via a closed session with the core statistical team, to interim comparisons by arm and may determine the form of data analysis, end point adjudication and interim analyses to be undertaken. The DMEC report is presented to the Trial Steering Committee [TSC] which meets 6 monthly. The DMEC and TSC terms of reference and membership are available. The study is fully GCP compliant and is audited by the host organization Research and Innovation Department. The programme receives formal quality assurance support from the Norwich CTU including the documentation of all quality procedures in a Quality Management Plan and assistance to set up the TSC and DMEC with roles and responsibilities of these committees documented in line with established guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p>All protocol amendments have been made in accordance with the Research Ethics Committees [REC] standard operating policies. All amendments have been submitted for REC, Research Health Authority [RHA], sponsor Research &#x00026; Innovation Department approval prior to implementing. All significant amendments to protocol have been reviewed by funding body [NIHR PGfAR]. All amendments have been documented in a protocol amendment tracker [see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>]. The initial protocol was approved by REC in January 2011, and current protocol is version 13]. Protocols v2 - v4, v7, v9, v10, and v12 were for minor textual changes in materials. v5 allowed new geographical areas to be accessed to maintain accrual, v6, v8 and v9 recorded additional supplementary studies, including epigenetic analysis [V6], iron balance studies [v9], and Project 6 to take into account new categories of NDH [v8]. v11 [3.4.14] was a larger scale amendment that allowed access to new populations in Suffolk and Essex to maintain power, to prolong follow up to 46&#x000a0;months and revised inclusion criteria for randomisation into Project 2 that recognised the recent development of new diagnostic criteria for diabetes and NDH based on HbA1c criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Ancillary and post - trial care</title><p>Participants with screen detected T2DM randomised to Project 4 also receive standard best practice diabetes care through their general practice. The programme does not interfere with any element of their normal diabetes care. All participants have access to a DPF, the Principal Investigator or Chief Investigator if they wish to discuss their diagnosis and implications of these results. However, in all cases the participants are encouraged to discuss their diagnosis/results with their GP. Post - trial (April 2018) all participants in this programme will be maintained in primary care follow up in line with normal clinical best practice at that time (2018). All participants and GPs will be written to with a data summary, diagnostic categorisation, and suggested further follow and care plans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The main NDPS trial(s) will be submitted for publication in July 2018. All participants and participating GPs will be sent a summary of trial outcomes, linked to current models of care and diabetes prevention strategies at the time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We will estimate the cost-effectiveness of the Norfolk DPS intervention [with and without DPM], compared to the control arm, for individuals identified as having IFG or T2DM. The level of resource use associated with the intervention [including that associated with the education and maintenance sessions, as well as DPM input] will be estimated along with other NHS resources that are potentially related to the intervention [e.g. referrals to dietician and GP visits]. Appropriate unit costs e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] will be assigned to all resource items. The economic evaluation will use the EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] as the main measure of effectiveness, enabling QALY [quality adjusted life year] scores to be estimated. Costs and QALYs incurred in future years will be discounted. Subsequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated and compared to a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In order to characterise the level of uncertainty the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] will also be presented. Sensitivity analysis will also be undertaken to assess the robustness of conclusions to key assumptions that are made within the economics analysisIf there are differences in T2DM incidence or in cardiovascular risk factors at the end of project 2, the ongoing effects, health care costs and cost effectiveness of the intervention will be modelled over the projected lifetimes of participants. Risks of complications of T2DM will be based primarily on the UKPDS risk engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], risks of coronary heart disease and stroke will be based primarily on QRISK2-2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. NHS costs of T2DM, cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes complications will be based on published estimates. Residual death rates will be based on UK Office of National Statistics estimates. This will be a multistate life table model, in which, for each surviving person each year, values of risk factors, adverse outcomes will be simulated, based on the values in the preceding year and assumed annual changes in risk factors and on incidence of adverse outcomes. The quality of life of each individual each year will be calculated, based on the presence of adverse outcomes, using primary quality of life data from project 2, and published estimates of QALYs associate with the respective outcomes. Simulation of the cohort will end when 99% have been simulated to die. As with the within-trial economic evaluation, incremental cost effectiveness ratios will be estimated and cost effectiveness acceptability curves will be presented. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be conducted, incorporating parameter and stochastic uncertainty. Other sensitivity analyses will explore the sensitivity of the primary analysis to assumptions about key parameters such as risks of T2DM, coronary heart disease, stroke, death, quality of life, costs and discount rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Discussion</title><p>The need for effective diabetes prevention strategies to be developed at scale in existing health care systems was recognised by the announcement of the NHS England diabetes prevention programme in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This national programme was largely predicated on existing evidence of diabetes prevention benefit in very large well - resourced clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in highest risk individuals. There is a substantial translational literature, examining the more variable impact of shorter term and less intense lifestyle interventions on glycaemic and metabolic outcomes in high risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recent meta - analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] of 44 clinical studies (8995 participants) has shown that modified, simpler and shorter interventions based on the US diabetes prevention programme (DPP), and using different delivery models, is associated with significant weight loss and reductions in HbA1c, but the diabetes prevention impact of these models remains uncertain. There is also still uncertainty over the best approach to find those at highest risk of T2DM for a clinical or research intervention, and over which glycaemic category should receive the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It seems sensible to develop and test research interventions that would be translatable to normal clinical practice, that recognises the complexities of risk categorization, and the need to reduce intervention costs. The NDPS will address many of these issues and reports in 2018.</p><p>The arguments underlying the NDPS programme (2011&#x02013;2018) are similar to those used later in the NHS England prevention programme (2015), that the costs of research based diabetes prevention interventions are prohibitive, that new approaches are needed to deliver the intervention (based on group work), potentially using lay mentors to deliver the intervention and recognizing the need to limit impact on pressured primary care teams. The value of the NDPS programme has increased since inception, as it will answer many of the current questions about delivery of the NHS England programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and also provide crucial trial outcomes trial data for the high risk group with non - diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH). The trial evidence in this population is relatively limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and the shift in diagnostic criteria for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] from glucose based to HbA1c based diagnostic criteria has created large populations with NDH. There are also limited data on the diabetes prevention intervention benefit in the population with IFG, based on a fasting plasma glucose test, rather than impaired glucose tolerance based on a time consuming (for patients and staff) oral glucose tolerance test, which would not be widely used for mass population screening for those at high risk in a non - research active primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These at risk glycaemic categories (based on HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose) have been for some time the largest at risk glycaemic populations identified in UK general practice. The NDPS programme recognises the complexity of the these various categories of &#x02018;prediabetes&#x02019;, and randomizes clinicallt recognizable combinations combinations of these categories into trial(s) and will provide evidence for progression and risk reduction in these categories.</p><p>One important element of NDPS is that screening programs or case finding in general practice for people at highest risk with IFG, IGT or NDH will also generate significant populations with screen detected T2DM. In NDPS we randomize these participants into the same intervention groups (Project 4). This trial will answer the question of whether a diabetes prevention intervention also has glycaemic outcomes benefit in people with screen detected T2DM, and replicates normal clinical practice.</p><p>Peer support can be defined as support from persons who have the same health condition as the people they assist and who experience similar challenges of those with the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The use of lay mentors or community health care workers to support a lifestyle intervention, and reduce the very high costs of more intensive research interventions was recognized by the early triallists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Evaluation of the role of lay supporters generally report positive participant perceptions and biomedical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although the role is variously described most of the diabetes literature has examined impact on the clinical care of people living with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the higher the intensity of the program the greater the reduction in HbA1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The use of unpaid volunteers with T2DM themselves to provide peer support in the context of T2DM prevention trial is a novel approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This model offers real opportunities to devlop a new volunteer workforce with T2DM who have a shared interest in diet, lifestyle and glycaemic outcomes to the participants they are supporting in a diabetes prevention intervention In NDPS, the diabetes prevention mentors deliver support by telephone, and telephone communication has been found to be acceptable by patients and is commonly a preferred and convenient option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>The screening element of NDPS [project 1] uses existing GP practice databases to identify those at highest risk for further screening, with minimal impact on GP workload, using standard and very simple database queries in the commonest UK database systems, where search terms are available for almost all patients. This deliberate approach was developed to limit workload within practices and encourage practice engagement without using modelling from more complex risk prediction tools where data on predictive variables may be unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The data from the screening element of this programme will have value in itself, as it will allow estimates of the population size of the various glycaemic categories in normal GP practice databases. The simple search criteria used in NDPS were also chosen to ensure NDPS was concordant with the 2010 NHS national vascular screening programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. This mass primary care cardiovascular risk screening programme in England uses age&#x02009;&#x0003e;40&#x000a0;year and BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> as criteria for further fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c testing, is now a mandatory requirement for local authorities in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>The NDPS programme is projected to reach full sample size and power on current accrual rates and will report in mid &#x02013; 2018 for all trials.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec43"><title>Additional files</title><p>
