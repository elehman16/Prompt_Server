Patients were randomly divided into three groups that received different uterotonics (oxytocin, carboprost and oxytocin plus carboprost) during cesarean section, following the delivery of the infant. A total of 117 females (age range, 19&#x02013;40 years) at 35&#x02013;40 weeks gestation who delivered by cesarean between December, 2010 and May, 2012 were included in this study. There were 29 cases of twins, 12 cases of polyhydramnios, 23 cases of placenta previa and 53 cases of fetal macrosomia. There were 37 patients in the oxytocin group, 36 in the carboprost group and 44 in the oxytocin plus carboprost group. No significant differences were identified in maternal age, gravidity/parity, gestational age and reason for cesarean delivery between the three groups. The median blood loss in the oxytocin, carboprost and oxytocin plus carboprost groups was 610, 438 and 520 ml, respectively. The blood loss in the carboprost group was significantly lower than that in the oxytocin and oxytocin plus carboprost groups (both P&#x0003c;0.05). Vomiting occurred in eight patients from the carboprost group, two from the oxytocin group and two from the oxytocin plus carboprost group (P=0.036). Carboprost was more effective than oxytocin in preventing PPH in high-risk patients undergoing cesarean delivery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>carboprost</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>postpartum hemorrhage</kwd><kwd>third stage of labor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) refers to &#x0003e;500 ml blood loss within 24 h following vaginal delivery, &#x0003e;1,000 ml following cesarean delivery, or the requirement for a blood transfusion within 24 h of delivery (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). PPH is reported to occur in ~5% of all deliveries, and the risk is significantly greater with cesarean delivery than vaginal delivery (<xref rid="b3-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In China, PPH is the most common serious obstetric complication and the leading cause of maternal mortality, accounting for 49.9% of maternal deaths (<xref rid="b5-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The leading cause of PPH is uterine atony, followed by retained placenta and injury to the genital tract (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Risk factors for PPH include fetal macrosomy, prolonged labor, multiple pregnancies, polyhydramnios, uterine myoma, placenta previa, grand multiparity and uterine infection (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The majority of maternal deaths due to PPH may be avoided, and the key lies in early diagnosis and proper treatment. However, PPH is one of the most challenging complications faced by clinicians. Active management of the third stage of labor includes the administration of uterotonic agents following the cesarean section or during the third stage of labor for vaginal delivery, and studies have shown that it may reduce the incidence of PPH (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b6-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Oxytocin is the most commonly used uterotonic agent for the prevention of PPH, and has been demonstrated to reduce blood loss following delivery (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b8-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, oxytocin has a half-life of &#x0003c;10 min and thus must be administered by continuous intravenous infusion (<xref rid="b10-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, saturation of uterine receptors may occur, and excessive dosages are capable of producing water toxicity due to its antidiuretic effect (<xref rid="b10-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Other uterotonic agents have been studied, and have been shown to reduce PPH, including carbetocin, a long-acting synthetic oxytocin analogue, ergot alkaloids (such as ergonovine, syntometrine) and prostaglandins (such as misoprostol and carboprost) (<xref rid="b11-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Carboprost tromethamine (Hemabate) is the synthetic 15-methyl analogue of prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, and has been reported to be 84&#x02013;96% effective in the treatment of persistent hemorrhage due to uterine atony (<xref rid="b18-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, since its introduction, there have been few studies of its effectiveness for the prevention and treatment of PPH, and only one specifically examining its use following cesarean delivery (<xref rid="b16-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b19-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare carboprost with oxytocin for the prevention of PPH in high-risk females undergoing cesarean delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Pregnant females at a high risk of PPH who were scheduled to undergo a cesarean section at the Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital (Jinan, China) between December, 2010 and May, 2012 were included in this study.

The patients were randomly divided into three groups and received different uterotonics (oxytocin, carboprost and oxytocin plus carboprost) during cesarean section, following the delivery of the infant.

In the carboprost group, patients received a myometrial injection of 0.25 mg carboprost tromethamine (Pharmacia &#x00026; Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) during the cesarean section, immediately following the delivery of the infant.

In the carboprost group the dosage was increased or other drugs were also administered in three cases, bilateral uterine artery ligation was performed in three cases and uterine gauze packing was adopted in two cases. In the oxytocin plus carboprost group, the carboprost dose was increased or other drugs were also administered in two cases, bilateral uterine artery ligation was performed in two cases and uterine gauze packing was adopted in one case.</p><p>The median blood loss in the oxytocin, carboprost, and oxytocin plus carboprost groups was 610, 438 and 520 ml, respectively (<xref rid="f1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The median blood loss in the carboprost group was significantly lower than that in the oxytocin and oxytocin plus carboprost groups (both P&#x0003c;0.05). The change in hemoglobin levels prior to and following delivery in the three groups is shown in <xref rid="f2-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.

Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. Vomiting occurred in eight (22.2%) patients in the carboprost group, as compared with two (5.4%) in the oxytocin group and two (4.5%) in the oxytocin plus carboprost group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.036).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the present study demonstrated that carboprost was more effective at preventing PPH than oxytocin in patients at a high risk of PPH undergoing cesarean delivery. The side-effects observed in the three groups were similar, with the exception of vomiting, which was more common in the patients who received carboprost.</p><p>To date, PPH remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in China, as well as in many underdeveloped countries (<xref rid="b2-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b5-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The main causes of PPH are uterine atony, residual trophoblastic tissue, genital tract trauma and clotting disorders. Of these, uterine atony is the most common and is apparent in 70&#x02013;90% of all cases of PPH (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). PPH within 2 h of delivery accounts for ~90% of the total number of cases (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Oxytocin is the most commonly used drug for the prevention and treatment of excessive bleeding following delivery (<xref rid="b8-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The most significant benefit of oxytocin is rapid action without causing elevated blood pressure or tetanic uterine contractions. Studies have demonstrated that the routine prophylactic use of oxytocin may reduce the need for additional uterotonics (<xref rid="b8-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b22-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, the use of oxytocin is limited by the dose. Myometrial oxytocin receptor saturation may affect its effectiveness, and excessive dosages may result in coronary artery contraction, hypotension and antidiuretic effect-induced water intoxication (<xref rid="b8-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b23-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, other uterotonics may be required in patients at high-risk of PPH. While it is clear that uterotonics are capable of reducing blood loss during the third stage of labor and preventing PPH, the most effective uterotonic in in the case of cesarean versus vaginal delivery and in certain other circumstances has not been elucidated (<xref rid="b1-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b7-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Carboprost tromethamine is the synthetic 15-methyl analogue of prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>. It may be administered via intramuscular injection at a dose of 0.25 mg, and may be repeated every 15 min until a maximum total dose of 2 mg has been administered (<xref rid="b24-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Carboprost has been reported to be 84&#x02013;96% effective in the treatment of persistent hemorrhage due to uterine atony, and may avoid the need for surgical intervention (<xref rid="b18-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, few studies have examined its use for the prevention of PPH. Vaid <italic>et al</italic>(<xref rid="b16-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) compared prophylactic sublingual misoprostol, intramuscular methylergometrine and intramuscular carboprost for the active management of the third stage of labor, and observed that the three drugs were equally effective in the prevention of PPH, although diarrhea was more common in the patients who received carboprost. In a similar study, Abdel-Aleem <italic>et al</italic>(<xref rid="b19-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) compared carboprost and methylergometrine in 150 females who were randomly assigned to receive one of the two drugs, and observed that the duration of the third stage of labor and mean blood loss were significantly less in the carboprost group. Oleen and Mariano (<xref rid="b20-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) reported that carboprost effectively controlled bleeding in 208 out of 237 (87.8%) cases of PPH.</p><p>Carboprost may cause prostaglandin-like side-effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, hypertension and bronchial asthma caused by the contraction of smooth muscles (<xref rid="b24-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It may also act on the thermoregulatory center, increasing the basal body temperature (<xref rid="b24-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Patients may experience hot flashes, sweating and increased irritability. Lamont <italic>et al</italic>(<xref rid="b17-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) compared carboprost and syntometrine for the prevention of PPH and revealed that although the two drugs were as effective in the prevention of PPH, diarrhea occurred in 21% of the patients who received carboprost, compared with only 0.8% of the patients who received syntometrine. Despite the aforementioned potential side-effects, serious side-effects are rare and self-limited (<xref rid="b16-etm-07-01-0046" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The present results demonstrated that vomiting was relatively common in the patients who received carboprost; however, it was readily managed.</p><p>There are limitations to the present study that should be considered. This was a single center study with a relatively small study group; thus, the results may not be generalizable to other patient populations.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that carboprost was more effective than oxytocin in preventing PPH in high-risk patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The drug was well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Carboprost may be considered to be suitable drug for the active management of the third stage of labor in this patient population.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term id="G1">PPH</term><def><p>postpartum hemorrhage</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-etm-07-01-0046"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leduc</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Senikas</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Lalonde</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Active management of the third stage of labour: prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage</article-title><source>J Obstet Gynaecol Can</source><volume>31</volume><fpage>980</fpage><lpage>993</lpage><year>2009</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19941729</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-etm-07-01-0046"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab><source>WHO recommendations for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage</source><publisher-name>World Health Organisation: Department of Making Pregnancy Safer</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Geneva, Switzerland</publisher-loc><year>2007</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-etm-07-01-0046"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carroli</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuesta</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Abalos</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Gulmezoglu</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of postpartum haemorrhage: a systematic review</article-title><source>Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol</source><volume>22</volume><fpage>999</fpage><lpage>1012</lpage><year>2008</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18819848</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-etm-07-01-0046"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wedisinghe</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Macleod</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of oxytocin to prevent haemorrhage at caesarean section - a survey of practice in the United Kingdom</article-title><source>Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol</source><volume>137</volume><fpage>27</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><year>2008</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17544563</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-etm-07-01-0046"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><source>Practical Obstetrics</source><edition>2nd edition</edition><publisher-name>Shandong Science and Technology Press</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Jinan, Shandong, China</publisher-loc><fpage>486</fpage><year>2004</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6-etm-07-01-0046"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Begley</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Gyte</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Devane</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>McGuire</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Weeks</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Active versus expectant management for women in the third stage of labour</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><volume>11</volume><fpage>CD007412</fpage><year>2011</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22071837</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b7-etm-07-01-0046"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gizzo</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Patrelli</surname><given-names>TS</given-names></name><name><surname>Gangi</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Which uterotonic is better to prevent the postpartum hemorrhage?
