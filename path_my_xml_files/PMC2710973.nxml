There was a large BP drop in the patients included in the two groups, which may be due to the fact that both medications were titrated upwards at close intervals although the BP readings at the end of the 12 weeks were not significantly different statistically between the two. However lisinopril was not titrated to 40 mg, which could have resulted in the differences in the BP lowering effects between the two drugs. Recent analysis of the CALM II study showed that lisinopril may have different effects on SBP, DBP and pulse pressure compared to candesartan (an ARB),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-5-587">23</xref> and since 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was not performed in this study, the observed differences in BP reduction and subsequent differences in PWV need a larger study including 24-hour BP monitoring. However, given the different resultant BP findings at the end of the 12 weeks, and knowing that BP reduction affects vascular compliance, the underlying biologic effects of the two drugs can not be fully explained. A way to address this impact of differences in achieved BP readings would be to titrate both drugs upwards to result in similar BP readings at the end of the study period.</p><p>Hypertension is associated with increased arterial stiffness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-vhrm-5-587">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-vhrm-5-587">8</xref> but it is also known that a reduction in BP is associated with an improved arterial compliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-5-587">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-vhrm-5-587">24</xref> The renin-angiotensin system affects the properties of arteries, both predominantly elastic and muscular. Neutel et al showed that benazepril improved arterial compliance in monotherapy and more efficaciously in combination with amlodipine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-vhrm-5-587">16</xref> Shargorodsky et al showed the positive effect of prolonged treatment with the AT1 receptor blocker valsartan on the small and large arterial compliance in a group of uncomplicated essential hypertensives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-5-587">17</xref> Only one other study compared the effect of ARBs with ACEIs on arterial compliance, showing a significant decrease in augmentation index and PWV with both drugs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-vhrm-5-587">20</xref> but did not analyze the effect of these on different types of arteries.</p><p>Our results confirm the finding of these previous studies on the PWV, one of the most important measures of arterial compliance. Evaluating the PWV, it has been possible for us compare the effect of these two drugs on different types of arteries. We assessed PWV C-F, PWV C-R and PWV F-D to study different segments of the arterial tree. Our findings confirm the positive effects of irbesartan and lisinopril on improving arterial compliance in elastic vessels. After 12 weeks of treatment for both the drugs the decrease in PWV C-F was statistically significant. This suggests a positive effect of these two drugs in improving the cardiovascular risk, over and above the known effects of lowering BP that were evident and statistically significant in our study.</p><p>Similar effects were also seen with irbesartan on the muscular arteries. When on treatment with irbesartan but not when on lisinopril we found a significant decrease in the PWV F-D, suggesting a positive effect of the ARBs on the arterial compliance of the muscular vessels. Our finding is important as it was also significant after adjustment for SBP. Correcting for SBP also showed that irbesartan produced a similar effect on the muscular arteries in the carotid-radial region. This suggests that irbesartan improved arterial compliance in the muscular arteries independently of its effect on BP, whereas lisinopril did not.</p><p>There are a number of large epidemiological studies showing that different antihypertensive agents have different outcomes. For example in the LIFE trial it was shown that treatment with losartan was more effective than atenolol in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as mortality from all causes in patients with hypertension, diabetes and LVH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-vhrm-5-587">25</xref></p><p>In elderly patients with heart failure the ELITE-I<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-vhrm-5-587">26</xref> trial showed better outcomes with an ARB than with an ACEI, showing that treatment with losartan was associated with a lower mortality than that with captopril. This effect was not sustained in the ELITE-II trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-vhrm-5-587">27</xref></p><p>In our study the different effects of the two drugs on muscular arteries is difficult to explain. The effects may be due to a more specific effect of the ARB on the vascular smooth muscle contraction or due to a difference in release of some endothelial mediators. However, some studies have shown a similar increase in the bioavailability of nitric oxide after treatment with both drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-vhrm-5-587">28</xref> There may be some other properties of the ARBs that explain this finding. There is some evidence that ARBs improve erectile dysfunction in hypertensive men and that that this may not be apparent with an ACEI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-vhrm-5-587">29</xref> Although there are many possible explanations for the difference, it is clear from our study that the short-term vascular effects are different. It is not clear if they are sustained over a longer period and a long-term study needs to be carried out. However, it is certain that the effect of these two antihypertensive agents on arteries is different, even after the adjustment for SBP. This may have an important clinical relevance and it may further add to the evidence required to choose antihypertensive agents.</p><p>There are a number of limitations of this study. The sample size was small. However, the changes in PWV from the baseline were statistically significant (23.8% of reduction in PWV C-F with irbesartan and 10.6% with lisinopril after adjustment for SBP of 150 mmHg), despite the small number of patients involved, suggesting the importance of the effect of these two drugs on arterial compliance. It is important to note that PWV is not the only index of arterial compliance and other techniques should be used to confirm our results. However, PWV is known to be one of the most important and commonly used indices of arterial stiffness. A washout period between the two drug regimes at the crossover point of 12 weeks was not carried out, but this would not have influenced the final statistical analysis as the BP readings analyzed were adjusted for SBP of 150 mmHg. Arterial compliance was not measured after the 12 weeks period of the study. In such a small sample size, the power to detect any crossover effects may be difficult to establish, and a larger study is needed with adjustment for the carry over effects.</p><p>In conclusion, both an ARB and an ACEI improved arterial compliance in the central elastic arteries. Irbesartan improved the vascular compliance also in muscular arteries, suggesting an additive action of this class of drugs, independently of its effect on BP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Peter Sacares and Winston Banya for their help with the statistical analyses.</p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb provided an educational grant.
