In an attempt to reduce AF incidence in these patients, serum potassium (K+) levels are commonly maintained at the high end of normal (4.5&#x02013;5.5 mEq/L). However, such potassium supplementation is without proven benefit, and is not without negative consequences. It carries clinical risk, negatively impacts patient experience and is both time-consuming and costly. This protocol describes a randomised controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility of a proposed randomised non-inferiority trial to investigate the impact of maintaining serum potassium &#x02265;&#x02009;3.6 mEq/L vs &#x02265;&#x02009;4.5 mEq/L on the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation in the first 120 hours after isolated elective coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Design: this is a randomized feasibility trial as a pilot for a randomized non-inferiority trial. Participants: are 160 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting at two centres. Allocation: patients will be randomized (1:1) to protocols aiming to maintain serum potassium at either &#x02265;&#x02009;3.6 mEq/L (&#x0201c;relaxed control&#x0201d;) or &#x02265;&#x02009;4.5 mEq/L (&#x0201c;tight control&#x0201d;). Primary analytic aim: was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of planning and delivering the intervention and trial methods to inform a full-scale non-inferiority trial. Outcome: the primary indicative efficacy outcome measures being field-tested are feasibility of participant recruitment and randomization, maintaining a protocol violation rate &#x0003c;&#x02009;10%, and retaining 90% patient follow up 28 days after surgery. The primary clinical outcome measure of the future full &#x0201c;Tight K Study&#x0201d; will be incidence of AF after cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The Tight K Pilot will assess the feasibility of conducting the full trial, which is intended to confirm or refute the efficacy of current potassium management in preventing AF after cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03195647">NCT03195647</ext-link>.

AF occurrence is associated with increased short-term and long-term mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and cost of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Persistence of this association after adjustment for potential confounding factors suggests that it may be causal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The incidence and associated costs of AF are expected to increase as the surgical population ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Potassium plays an important role in cardiac electrophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Serum concentrations ([K<sup>+</sup>]) are commonly low following cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and appear marginally lower in in non-surgical cohorts among those suffering atrial arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Despite an absence of proof that this association is causal, efforts to maintain serum [K<sup>+</sup>] in the &#x0201c;high-normal&#x0201d; range (4.5&#x02013;5.5 mEq/L), as opposed to just intervening if potassium drops below its lower &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; threshold, are considered &#x0201c;routine practice&#x0201d; for AF prevention in patients post-surgery in many centres across the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The efficacy of the practice of maintaining high-normal serum potassium levels remains unproven and data supporting it are extremely limited, being derived from observational rather than interventional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Indeed, there are no data to demonstrate that maintaining a high-normal potassium level is beneficial in these circumstances, or that aggressive replenishment of potassium in these patients improves outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Meanwhile, potassium supplementation may cause discomfort or harm. Routine central venous potassium administration in the early post-operative period, when oral supplementation is not possible, is time-consuming, costly, and associated with clinical risk: rapid infusion can prove fatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and leaving central venous catheters <italic>in situ</italic> for the sole purpose of potassium replacement increases infection risk. The annual costs of intravenous potassium exceed those for other drugs in many cardiothoracic units due to the large quantities administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nursing time (e.g. for drug checks and administration) will also add to this cost. Oral potassium supplementation is commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects and is often poorly tolerated by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">We here describe a trial (Tight K Pilot) designed to assess the feasibility of performing a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial to assess any impact of targeted maintenance of serum K+ concentration &#x02265;&#x02009;3.6 mEq/L vs &#x02265;&#x02009;4.5 mEq/L on AF incidence after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par21">The trial is a randomised feasibility trial.

If the anticipated recruitment, follow-up and retention rates are demonstrated over a 6-month recruitment period, this would confirm the feasibility of a multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial in 1682 patients with an estimated eligible cohort of 8700 patients over 3.5 years.</p><p id="Par87">The sample size calculation for the main trial is based on a baseline incidence of AF of 35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; a clinically relevant non-inferiority margin of 10%; a true difference in favour of tight potassium control of 2%, 90% power; a one-sided alpha of 2.5% (equivalent to a two-sided alpha of 5%) and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10% protocol violations. Due to this anticipated protocol violation rate, a greater number of patients will be recruited to the full study, as not all will be included in the final analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Outcome analyses</title><p id="Par88">The primary outcome measure of this pilot trial will be feasibility in terms of numbers recruited and randomised, protocol fidelity, and follow-up rates by trial arm.

No significance tests will be performed to test for differences at baseline, or given that this is a pilot trial, at follow up. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include the mean, standard deviation, median, range, and the number of observations. Categorical variables will be presented as numbers and percentages. Exploratory analysis of the main trial outcomes will be by intention to treat (ITT) and given the non-inferiority trial design for the main trial, a per-protocol analysis will also be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As this is a pilot trial, no interpretation will be made of any effect sizes and findings will primarily be used to help refine the design of the main trial. This will include assessment of rates of missing data. No formal analysis to account for missing data will be undertaken in this pilot trial. A detailed cost-effectiveness analysis will not be undertaken in this pilot trial, but simple analyses of cost-effectiveness will be performed utilizing data relating to data on quality of life and length of stay. Statistical analysis will be carried out blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Ethical issues</title><p id="Par90">The trial has been reviewed and ethically approved by the National Research Ethics Service London Committee &#x02013; Camden and Kings Cross. The REC number is LO/17/0318. The trial will conform to the spirit and the letter of the declaration of Helsinki, and will be in accordance with the Barts Health NHS Trust and London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The trial will be carried out in accordance with the ethical principles in the <italic>Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, Second Edition</italic>, 2005 and its subsequent amendments as applicable and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p><p id="Par91">Confidentiality: participant data will be kept confidential and managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, NHS Caldecott principles, The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, and the conditions of Research Ethics Committee Approval.</p><p id="Par92">Withdrawal of participants: a patient may decide to withdraw from the trial at any time without prejudice to their future care and will undergo standard clinical care. Patients will be encouraged to allow data and samples that have been collected before withdrawal to be used in the analyses. However, if consent to use data is also withdrawn, then these will be discarded. Patients withdrawing from the trial will continue to be followed up by their local clinical team. There should be no need for further follow up from the research team. The Clinical Trials Unit at LSHTM should be informed by email if a patient has withdrawn from the trial. A withdrawal form will be completed on the trial electronic case report form.</p><p id="Par93">Safety reporting: Barts NHS Trust, as Sponsor of this trial, has responsibility to ensure arrangements are in place to record, notify, assess, report, analyse, and manage adverse events in order to comply with the UK regulations of Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004. All sites involved in the trial are expected to inform the Chief Investigator of any serious adverse events/reactions within 24 hours so that appropriate safety reporting procedures can be followed by the Sponsor.</p><p id="Par94">All adverse events judged by either the investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable suspected causal relationship with potassium supplementation qualify as adverse reactions. Whilst any suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) involving potassium will be reported according to the timelines for SUSARs, expected side effects of potassium will be reported in the end-of-trial safety report unless serious enough to warrant expedited reporting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial governance</title><p id="Par95">Trial documentation: relevant trial documentation will be kept for a minimum of 15 years.

The DSMC will consist of an independent chair, a senior statistician and at least one other senior clinician independent of the investigators. The DSMC will meet prior to the start of the trial and as this is a pilot trial their main role will be to monitor safety on an ongoing basis. They will also monitor data for quality and completeness.

Practice is diverse, and the supporting evidence base is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Anecdotally, the commonest practice is to maintain serum [K<sup>+</sup>] in the high-normal range. The evidence base underpinning such practice is limited. Whilst postoperative potassium supplementation has been associated with reduced AF risk after CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], such data are retrospective and no specific potassium target is suggested.</p><p id="Par102">We have opted to address the efficacy of this practice in participants undergoing open CBP - a group that represents a large proportion of the total cardiac surgical workload. By choosing a large and comparatively homogenous patient cohort, the feasibility of delivering this study should be maximized.</p><p id="Par103">A study that aims to conclusively assess the effectiveness of an established practice requires a non-inferiority, individually randomised design. In our case, that will require large patient numbers. It was felt important by both investigators and funders to perform a feasibility study before embarking on a large-scale trial in order to determine possible barriers to successfully implementing a seemingly simple protocol such as ours.</p><p id="Par104">The investigators felt that it was important that any such study should be pragmatic and reflect &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; practice as far as possible. Therefore, minimal restrictions have been placed on the management of participants following surgery. Specifically, use of magnesium supplementation or antiarrhythmic drugs is unrestricted.</p><p id="Par105">The true incidence of AF following cardiac surgery is controversial with a range of AF incidence reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 65% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The consensus from our Protocol Development Group was that our chosen non-inferiority margin of 10% is reasonable and pragmatic. Opting to utilize a smaller non-inferiority margin may make the future full study unviable, due to a significant increase in sample size and costs.</p><p id="Par106">The findings of the future full study are intended to make a significant contribution to optimization of care for cardiac surgical participants. If effective, potassium supplementation to a high target level could be implemented as a standard of care, and costs related to peri-operative morbidity reduced. If potassium supplement is shown to have no benefit, the costs and risks of administration of potassium supplement that are avoided could be substantial.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par107">The trial is currently being set up at two sites. Recruitment is scheduled to start at the first site by 1 August 2017. The proposed start date is 1 August 2017.
