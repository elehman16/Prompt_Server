when microbial infection persists or recurs after
initial root canal treatment because of insufficient
cleaning and shaping, missed canals, inadequate
root filling, or coronal leakage (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Thus, the main
objective of retreatment is to completely remove
all fillings from the root canal system to provide
effective cleaning, shaping, and refilling (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).
During the retreatment procedures, dentin chips,
filling materials, microorganisms, and/or irrigants
may be extruded from the root canal space into the
periradicular tissues. Extrusion of these materials may
be clinically responsible for inducing of inflammation
and postoperative pain and delaying of periapical
healing, even in teeth prepared short of the foramen (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Numerous studies (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) have evaluated
the extrusion of intracanal debris, microorganisms,
and irrigants through the periradicular region. Debris
extrusion is a problem with virtually all preparation
techniques and files: the amount of debris extrusion
may differ according to which technique/file is
used. Several techniques have been used to remove
fillings from canals, including hand and rotary files,
which can be used by softening the filling with or
without solvents and heat and/or ultrasonics (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).
Rotary files are generally preferred for removing
fillings from canal walls because retreatment with
hand files can be a tedious, time-consuming process.
Thus, some studies (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) have researched rotary
file efficacy, cleaning ability, and safety during the
removal of the canal fillings. The Twisted File (TF;
SybronEndo, Orange, CA, USA) is a rotary NiTi file
and the manufacturer claims that its technology and
twisted file design (triangular cross-section, variable
pitch and safe-ended tip) allows use of this system
in retreatment of root canals (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Marfisi et al. (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)
found no significant differences amongst ProTaper
Retreatment files, Mtwo Retreatment files and TF in
terms of the removal of root canal filling material.
To our knowledge, no report has evaluated apical
debris extrusion during root canal retreatment with
the TF system. The Reciproc system (VDW, Munich,
Germany) was designed to prepare canals with only
one file and consists of three single-use files. Files
of this system are made of an M-wire technology
and are used in a reciprocating movement. This
movement provides improved resistance to cyclic
fatigue compared to full-sequence rotary NiTi systems
(<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Also, Zuolo et al. (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) stated that a reciprocating
instrument was significantly more effective than
rotary files in removing root canal fillings. However,
some studies reported no significant differences in
the efficacy of rotary and reciprocating file systems
for removing filling material during endodontic
retreatment (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Because of its different design
and kinematics, the effect of the Reciproc system
in terms of apical debris extrusion in root canal
retreatment has also been evaluated in previous
studies (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The aim of this study was to compare
the in vitro amount of apically extruded debris during
endodontic retreatment using the Reciproc and TF
systems and H-file. The null hypothesis tested was
that there are no significant differences in the amount
of debris extruded between the tested NiTi rotary and
reciprocating systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Specimen Preparation</title><p>Sixty extracted human mandibular premolars with
mature apices, straight root canals, and no calcification
were selected for this study. Only single-rooted teeth
with a single canal and a single apical foramen were
included. This was verified by viewing their buccal
and proximal radiographs. The selected teeth were
stored in a 0.1% thymol solution until use. Roots were
standardized to 17 mm in length using a diamond disc
operated at low speed. The working length (WL) was
established by subtracting 1 mm from the length of a
size 10 K-file (Dentsply Maillefer) that was visible at
the major apical foramen. Additionally, the foramen
diameter of all teeth was standardized to a size 15
K-file (Dentsply Maillefer).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Root Canal Treatment</title><p>The coronal third of each canal was prepared
using the ProTaper SX NiTi rotary file (Dentsply
Maillefer) and sizes 4-2 Gates-Glidden drills
(Dentsply Maillefer) in decreasing order. Then, the
middle and apical thirds were prepared with S1 and
S2 files until encountering slight resistance, and the
canal was then finished using files F1-F3 until the
WL was reached. After each file was used and before
proceeding to the next size, canals were irrigated with
2 mL of 2.5% NaOCl. When preparation of the root
canal was complete, 2 mL 17% EDTA was applied
for 1 min to remove the smear layer and the canal was
flushed again with 2 mL 2.5% NaOCl. The root canal was then dried with absorbent paper points. All canals
were filled with gutta-percha and AH Plus (Dentsply
De Trey, Konstanz, Germany) sealer by using the
cold lateral condensation technique. Roots were
then radiographed in buccolingual and mesiodistal
directions to confirm the quality of the filling. Samples
showing any voids within the filling were discarded.
The access cavities were sealed with Cavit-G (3M
ESPE, Seefeld, Germany). All specimens were stored
at 37 &#x000b0;C and 100% humidity for 1 week to allow
complete setting of the sealer.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Extrusion Test Design</title><p>An experimental method similar to that described
in a previous study (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was used to evaluate apically
extruded debris. Empty Eppendorf tubes without
covers were weighed with an electronic balance
(Precisa; Precisa Inst., Dietikon, Switzerland) with
a precision of 10-4 g. Three consecutive measurements
were taken for each tube, and the mean weight was
calculated. A hole was created on the cover of each
Eppendorf tube and each tooth was inserted under
pressure through the cover, which was fixed by an
adhesive (Pattex Super Glue; Turk Henkel, Istanbul,
Turkey). The apical part of the root was suspended
within the tube, which acted as a collecting container
for apical material evacuated through the foramen of
the root. A bent 27-G needle was placed alongside
the cover to use as a drainage cannula and to balance
the internal and external pressures. Then, each cover,
including the tooth and needle, was fitted into the
Eppendorf tube. The tube was fitted into a vial to
hold the device during instrumentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).
All vials were covered with aluminum leaf to prevent
the operator from viewing debris extrusion during
the retreatment phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In no case was the
inner Eppendorf tube touched with fingers.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Retreatment Procedures</title><p>After the temporary fillings were removed, the

three groups of 20 specimens each.</p><p>Reciproc Group (n=20): A Reciproc R40 file
with a size 40 at the tip was used with an endomotor

commenced with coronal flaring using a size .08/25

to 2 mm short of the WL. Apical preparation to the
WL was achieved using sizes .04/25, .06/25, .06/30,
and .06/35 files, respectively. Canal preparation was
completed with a size .04/40 file to the WL.</p><p>Hand File Group (n=20): The canals were
re-instrumented to the original WL with H-files
(Dentsply Maillefer) up to size 40 in a circumferential,
quarter-turn, push-pull filing motion to remove filling
material until the WL was achieved. A step-back
procedure with H-files was then completed coronally
in 1 mm increments to file size 55. During retreatment,
root canals were irrigated with 2 mL bidistilled
water at each file change or after three pecks with
the reciprocating file. Each NiTi or hand file was
discarded after being used in 3 canals. The retreatment
procedure was considered complete when the working
length was reached and no more gutta-percha or sealer
was detected on the file surfaces.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The experimental model used to evaluate debris

dentin as possible from an inadequately prepared
and filled root canal system is crucial to uncover
remnants of necrotic tissue or bacteria that may be
responsible for periapical inflammation and failure
(<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Variations in canal morphology greatly influence
the changes that occur after canal preparation and as
a logical extension, after retreatment procedures <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
In this study, in order to minimize these variables,
teeth were flattened coronally, and the WL of each
canal was standardized so that varying lengths
could not influence the results (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Teeth were
carefully selected according to tooth type, canal size,
WL, and canal curvature. Also, they were digitally
radiographed from buccal and proximal views to
ensure that they had single canals and orifices.</p><p>To date, many studies (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)
have investigated the retreatment performance of
different NiTi systems. Although these systems were
not originally designed for retreatment, the special
design of the files as well as the reciprocating or
rotary motion can be potentially beneficial for the
effective removal of filling. Favorable results were
observed in those previous reported studies. When
endodontic treatment or retreatment is performed,
irritants in the form of filling materials, necrotic pulp
tissues, bacteria, or irrigants might be introduced into
the periradicular region. Apically extruded materials
are held clinically responsible for postoperative inflammation and flare-ups or even failure of apical
healing (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Apical extrusion of debris and irrigants
during root canal treatment or retreatment has been
studied extensively because of its clinical relevance.
Reddy and Hicks (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) were the first to compare apical
debris extrusion among hand files and two rotary NiTi
(Lightspeed and Profile Series 29) files, comparing the
weights of extruded debris and showing that a stepback
technique produces significantly more debris
than the rotary NiTi files. Following to this study,
numerous studies have reported that rotary NiTi files
are associated with less debris extrusion than hand
files in endodontic treatment or retreatment (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). To our knowledge, only one study (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)
has evaluated the apically extruded debris during root
canal treatment with TF. That study (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) showed that
there was no significant difference between the TF
group and the ProTaper Next and WaveOne groups.</p><p>Results presented herein are consistent with other
apical extrusion studies in endodontic retreatment
(<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and reinforce the fact that it is impossible to
prepare root canals without any extrusion of debris.
This result might be due to the fact that early flaring of
the coronal part of the preparation with the rotary NiTi
files improves instrument control during preparation
of the apical thirds of the canal, and because of the
rotational motion, which tends to direct debris toward
the orifice, keeping it from becoming compacted in
the root canal. H&#x000fc;lsmann and Bluhm (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) stated that
the design of the rotary files could have an effect on
their cleaning ability. Thus, another factor for the better performance of TF can probably be attributed
to its design. The features of the TF system such as
its twisted design, not ground, surface deoxidation
treatment, triangular cross-section, variable pitch,
and safe-ended tip allow its effective use in root
canal retreatment. Large amounts of fillings from
the canals can be removed in spirals around the
files, whereas H-files only remove gutta-percha in
small increments (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, in the hand
instrumentation technique, H-files are used in a pushpull
filling motion, which has been reported to lead
a greater amount of apically extruded debris (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).
To date, few studies (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) have investigated
apical debris extrusion during root canal treatment or
retreatment with the Reciproc system. Some studies
(<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) have revealed the superiority of rotary
NiTi instrumentation over Reciproc instrumentation
in terms of the amount of apically extruded debris.
In contrast, two studies (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) observed similar
amounts of extruded debris after rotary NiTi and
Reciproc instrumentation, while some studies (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) have reported the superiority of Reciproc
instrumentation over rotary NiTi instrumentation. The
present study found no significant differences between
the Reciproc, TF, and H-file. However, in the current
study, apical debris extrusion was studied during
root canal retreatment. Therefore, we compared
our results only with the results of Lu et al. (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>),
Silva et al. (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and Dincer et al. (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) because the
retreatment procedure might affect the amount of
apically extruded debris compared with the standard
root canal treatment procedure. Lu et al. (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) reported
that reciprocal instrumentation produced significantly
more apically extruded debris and irrigant than rotary
instrumentation. However, Silva et al. (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) stated
that less apically extruded debris was produced with
reciprocating systems (Reciproc R40 and WaveOne
Large) than with a conventional rotary retreatment
system (ProTaper Universal Retreatment). Also,
Dincer et al. (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) reported that the Reciproc system
was associated with less debris extrusion when
compared with full-sequence rotary NiTi instruments
(ProTaper Universal Retreatment and Mtwo
Retreatment systems) and hand files. The contrast
between the outcomes of those previous studies
and the present study might be explained by root
canal anatomy, amount of irrigant, instrumentation
technique, file design, number of files, and especially,
the experimental set up. Also, it must be stated that
comparisons of different studies might show different
results due to the variety of experimental set ups
used in studies. In Lu et al.&#x02019;s study (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the weight
of the apically extruded debris and irrigant were
calculated together when the removal of gutta-percha
was completed. However, only the apically extruded
debris was calculated in the current retreatment study.
Thus, the difference between the studies may be due
to the apically extruded irrigant. According to the
current results, apical debris extrusion occurred in
all of the tested file systems. As expected, manual
instrumentation produced significantly more debris
compared with the continuous rotation (TF) and
reciprocating motion (Reciproc) systems. However,
no statistical difference was observed between
the Reciproc and TF systems. Therefore, the null
hypothesis was accepted. It must be stated that the
current in vitro results cannot be directly extrapolated
to clinical situations, mainly because of the absence
of back pressure provided by periradicular tissues.
A clinical study may give different results, as
periradicular tissues may serve as a natural barrier,
inhibiting apical extrusion. Results may also differ
because of the persistence of residual pulp tissue,
the pulp condition, canal curvature, and normal/
pathological periapical tissues (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Furthermore,
the current study was limited to teeth with mature
root morphology. The observed results should not be
generalized to teeth with immature root development
and open apices, as suggested by Kustarci et al. (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>All file systems tested in this study caused apical
debris extrusion. However, the rotary file (TF) and
reciprocating single-file (Reciproc) systems were
associated with less apical extrusion than hand files.
Caution should be exercised when applying these
results to clinical conditions. Further research will be
necessary to determine the clinical performance of the
tested instrumentation systems during retreatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Source of funding:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="presented-at"><p>This study was presented as a poster presentation in 12th International Congress of the Turkish Endodontic Society, Istanbul, May 15-17, 2014.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siqueira Jr</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Aetiology of root canal treatment failure: Why well-treated teeth can fail</article-title><source>Int Endod J</source><year>2001</year><issue>1</issue><volume>34</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1046/j.1365-2591.2001.00396.x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11307374</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Stabholz</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tamse</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Endodontic retreatment--case selection and technique. 3.
