feedback breathing exercise on respiratory function. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-one
subjects were randomly assigned to two groups; the feedback breathing exercise group and
the maneuver-diaphragm exercise group. The feedback breathing exercise group was asked to
breathe with feedback breathing device, and the maneuver-diaphragm exercise group was
asked to perform diaphragm respiration. Respiratory function was evaluated when a subject
sat on a chair comfortably. [Results] There was a significant difference in the functional
vital capacity and slow vital capacity before and after all breathing exercises. There was
a significant between-group difference in functional vital capacity. However, no
between-group difference was found in slow vital capacity. [Conclusion] Diaphragm
breathing exercise and feedback breathing exercise can affect respiratory function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diaphragm breathing exercise</kwd><kwd>Feedback breathing exercise</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Respiration indicates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the
tissues. It is controlled by activities of respiratory muscles and neurological
mechanism<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The diaphragm, one of respiratory muscles, plays a key role in the
respiratory pump. In addition, it influences respiratory function of controlling breathing
as well as human posture<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The respiration
performed by diaphragmatic contraction is the diaphragmatic respiration<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. There have been many studies related to it so far; the
diaphragmatic respiration has been used in various fields including Pilates, yoga, and
exercises emphasizing core stability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, the lung functions and the trunk stability can be promoted through the
diaphragmatic respiration<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is expected
that respiratory function is improved by increasing strength and endurance in respiratory
muscles through various types of exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies reported that respiratory exercise using feedback
respiratory device has been usually used as a respiratory exercise method for recovering
respiratory function. It was reported that endurance and quality of life in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were facilitated through feedback breathing device
which can enhance both inspiration and expiration simultaneously<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intervention depends on the training using
respiratory devices due to time restriction although applying direct respiratory training to
patients who need respiratory therapy is needed. Respiration is one of the most important
issues for life conservation, and its significance has been mentioned in many studies<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this regard, it is necessary to
measure exact pulmonary function. The present study investigated effects of diaphragm
breathing exercise and feedback breathing exercise on respiratory function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-one subjects with no history of neuromuscular, orthopedic, and cardiopulmonary
disorder participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to two groups; the feedback
breathing exercise (FBE) group (n=15; age, 20.79 &#x000b1; 0.85&#x02005;years; height, 160.22 &#x000b1; 8.53&#x02005;cm;
weight, 59.17 &#x000b1; 9.66&#x02005;kg) and the maneuver-diaphragm exercise (MDE) group (n=16; age, 21.8 &#x000b1;
1.61&#x02005;years; height, 167.87 &#x000b1; 8.03&#x02005;cm; weight, 62.73 &#x000b1; 9.38&#x02005;kg). The purpose and procedures
of this study were explained to all subjects, and they provided written informed consent
prior to participation. This study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. FBE group was
asked to sit with a mouthpiece in his/her mouth, watching the TIGER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>
mainframe. The investigator pressed the start button, and the subject breathed in when
the orange needle directed toward the &#x0201c;In&#x0201d; mark and breathed out when the needle toward the
&#x0201c;OUT.&#x0201d; Before the exercise, the investigator taught the subjects how to accurately perform
the exercise two or three times for them to adjust to the method. MBE group was asked to put
his/her hands on the rectus abdominis muscle immediately below the anterior costal
cartilage, and to inhale slowly and deeply only by swelling his/her abdomen without moving
his/her upper chest while relaxing his/her shoulders. Then, the subject exhaled all the air
slowly. During inhalation, the air was breathed in through his/her nose, and his/her abdomen
was swollen. After the breathe was suspended at the last moment, the subject exhaled the air
according to the pursed lip breathing, with which the subject breathed out the air through
his/her mouth with his/her lips half-opened and his/her abdomen made hollow. CardioTouch
3000S (BIONET, Korea) was used to evaluate respiratory function when a subject sat on a
chair comfortably. All subjects were given sufficient explanation and demonstration for
enhancing accuracy before measuring. Paired t-test and independent t-test were used to
examine effects of feedback breathing and diaphragm breathing on respiratory function.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver. 21.0, and statistical significance was
set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was a significant difference in the functional vital capacity (FVC) and slow vital

dioxide is emitted to the air, can be divided into thoracic and diaphragmatic respiration
basically<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, there have been many researches using diaphragmatic
respiration. The concept of the diaphragmatic respiration is applied to strengthening
exercise for abdominal and back muscles, and the exercise is introduced as a therapeutic
approach for musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The diaphragm chiefly used in the diaphragmatic respiration has significant influence on
back pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it may prevent
falling through maintaining the center of gravity (COG) within the base of support
(BOS)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study compared
diaphragm breathing exercise and feedback breathing exercise in order to investigate which
method may affect respiratory function more significant. From the results obtained,
significant differences in FVC and SVC were observed before and after all breathing
exercises (p&#x0003c;0.05). Significant between-group difference in FVC was observed (p&#x0003c;0.05)
although no significant difference in SVC was observed (p&#x0003e;0.05). In the breathing
exercise using the feedback respiratory device, the subjects used the breathing accessory
muscles more than the diaphragm, showing thoracic respiration by raising their shoulders or
moving their chests for excessive inhalation and exhalation. Such result is consistent with
that of the study in which breathing exercise using threshold device did not induce changes
in diaphragmatic activities but significantly increase activities of the sternocleidomastoid
muscle<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MDBE group showed
exhalation resistance with their lips pursed accompanied with diaphragmatic respiration; the
group showed higher increase in FVC maybe because they used the diaphragm more than the FBE
group. It is suggested that the results of the present study can be used as the baseline
data for development of new type of breathing exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Youngsan University Research Grants in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Pryor</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name></person-group>: Physiotherapy for respiratory and cardiac problems: adults and
