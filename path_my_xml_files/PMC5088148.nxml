training on postural changes in the cervical spine and changes in the range of motion of
the neck and in the Neck Disability Index in adults with forward head posture. [Subjects
and Methods] The subjects of the study were 40 college students with forward head posture,
randomly divided into a neurofeedback training group (NFTG, n=20) and a control group (CG,
n=20). The neurofeedback training group received six sessions of pottery and archery
games, each for two minutes, three times per week for four weeks, using the neurofeedback
system. [Results] There were no significant effects within and between groups in terms of
the absolute rotation angle, anterior weight bearing, and range of extension and flexion
by x-ray imaging. There were significant effects in the neurofeedback training group pre-
intervention and post-intervention in Neck Disability Index. There were significant
effects between groups in Neck Disability Index. [Conclusion] It is thought that
neurofeedback training, a training approach to self-regulate brain waves, enhances
concentration and is therefore an effective intervention method to improve neck pain and
daily activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Neck Disability Index</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Forward head posture (FHP) pushes the center of the head forward and upwards which, in
turn, increases the head weight supported by the neck, triggering relative compensatory
mechanisms, such as increased cervical lordosis and abnormal and sustained contractions in
the suboccipital muscle and muscles in the neck and shoulders. As this posture causes
changes in the head and neck area<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is
thought to be one of the most well-known postures that result from poor posture. In this
posture, posterior cranial rotation occurs to adjust the eyes by rotating the head backwards
and in the end, there is an increase in the cervical extensor; if sustained for long enough,
there will be a loss of the normal cervical lordosis<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such increases in the lordosis and muscles in the suboccipital
region, neck, and shoulders&#x02014;in other words, such muscle contractions cause changes in the
head and neck area<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Humans are greatly
influenced by physical, structural, and functional changes that result from posture.
Therefore, it is highly likely that they experience a decline in learning performance,
concentration, and memory with poor postures. Ultrasound therapy, therapeutic exercise,
electrical stimulation therapy, and a combination of therapeutic interventions are often
used as treatments for FHP. Neurofeedback is a brain-training program that self-regulate
one&#x02019;s own brain waves by providing feedback on the status of brain waves induced using the
biofeedback technique<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The underlying
principle of neurofeedback is that it improves brain plasticity by enhancing the
self-regulation of brain homeostasis with brain waves. In other words, people self-train
their brains by looking, hearing, and feeling their own brains. Neurofeedback does not
merely involve increasing specific brain waves, but also maintaining and optimizing the
health of brain functions by bringing balance and harmony of brain waves. Because the brain
self-teaches and self-trains in accordance with the given information, a strong network of
nerve fibers that connect brain cells develops, leading to improvements in blood
circulation, which in turn increases the supply of oxygen and stimulates the delivery of
information, greatly improving the brain functions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the self-training program of brain waves<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, neurofeedback training aims to normalize cerebral functions
by either decreasing or increasing specific brain waves when a patient receives visual or
auditory feedback on the activities in the cerebral cortex during a brain wave
measurement<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therfore, the training is
being used in various fields of study, such as sports training, that require
concentration<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Since it is thought that cervical spine misalignment not only affects FHP, but also
concentration, the present study aims to investigate the effects of neurofeedback training
on the postural changes, range of motion (ROM), and Neck Disability Index. (NDI) of the
cervical joints while tracking changes using x-ray imaging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were students of University G in North Gyeongsang

15&#x02005;mm<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and whose cervical extension
ROM was below 70 degrees (Neuman). They were adequately informed of the purpose and methods
of the study and took part in the study after voluntarily signing the consent form. The

neurological problems were excluded from the study. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of each group (Mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NFTG (n=20)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG (n=19)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male/Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.9 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.8 &#x000b1; 4.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.5 &#x000b1; 9.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.6 &#x000b1; 8.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.3 &#x000b1; 11.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.5 &#x000b1; 11.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>NFTG: neurofeedback training group, CG: control group</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the general characteristics of the study subjects (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All parents of the enrolled participants provided
written informed consent prior to this experiment in accordance with the ethical standards
established in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The subjects in the present study who had signed the consent form were randomly divided
into a neurofeedback training group (NFTG) and a control group (CG) and took x-ray images.
In accordance with their NDI measurements, each group underwent a four-week intervention
program of three sessions per week. After four weeks, the subjects again took x-ray images
and measured their NDIs. The NFTG performed the program using a neurofeedback system
developed by Braintech Corp. in Korea. The neurofeedback training took place in a
light-blocking and noise-cancelling space. After a 10-minute break, the subjects wore
headbands while adjusting the midline electrode site, FPz to be over the center of the
forehead, which is the prefrontal region and connecting the reference electrode to the left
earlobe. The training methods included pottery and archery games as part of the
concentration training. First, for the pottery game, the subjects would score the most
points when they made most cups out of broken pieces of glass. When the stability of brain
waves met the satisfactory level of stability for training, a signal was sounded and a cup
was made, but when the brain waves became unstable, the training stopped. The game was
repeated six times for two minutes per session. Second, for the archery game (mind arrow)
where the subjects shot arrows with their brain waves, when the brain waves met the training
conditions, a signal was sounded. If an arrow was shot when the signal was sounded, the
subjects had a high probability of hitting the bullseye. The game ended when 15 arrows were
shot within two minutes, showing the brain training performance in terms of scores. The game
was repeated six times within a period of 12 minutes. We measured the subject&#x02019;s cervical
position using x-ray imaging. The absolute rotation angle (ARA)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> was measured to calculate a cervical lordosis angle, and
the anterior weight bearing (AWB)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> was
measured to assess FHP. And to find the neck flexion and extension angles, the range of
flexion and extension motion (RFEM)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> was
examined by x-ray imaging. We also checked the NDI. The NDI was comprised of a total of 10
questions to measure the neck pain and functional disorder of respondents. The respondents
were asked to choose one option out of six (0&#x02013;5 points) in 10 survey items, namely neck
pain, daily activities, lifting objects, reading, headache, concentration, work, driving,
sleep, and leisure activities. The higher the score, the greater the neck dysfunction. The
score range was between zero and 50, indicating 0&#x02013;4 for no disability, 5&#x02013;14 for mild
disability, 15&#x02013;24 for moderate disability, 25&#x02013;34 for severe disability, and above 35 for
complete disability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the data
analysis, SPSS 14.0 for Windows was used to process the statistics, and independent t-tests
were carried out to compare differences within and between the groups. Statistical
significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant within-group differences in the AWB, ARA, cervical flexion and

posture, as they overwork and overpressure their cervical spines by sitting at a computer
for a long period of time, using a smartphone, and lacking exercise. Such postural change in
the cervical spine causes dysfunction and imbalance in the head and neck and is accompanied
by limitations in the ROM and pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Neurofeedback training is a comprehensive training system that spurs the growth of and
change in brain cells as a part of biofeedback training<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Biofeedback training involves a patient learning to control his or
her physical activities while effecting changes in his or her own physiological activities
as various physiological signals that occur in the human body are converted into
easy-to-understand visual signals by a computer<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brain waves, one of the physiological signals that occur in the
human body, reflect specific mental statuses in humans. Therefore, changes in mental status
can be observed with brain waves. In the present study, after college students with FHP
underwent the neurofeedback training, a comparative analysis of changes in x-ray images
(AWB, ARA, RFEM) and NDIs was conducted to investigate whether there were any postural and
functional changes in the cervical joints. No significant increases were found in the AWB
and cervical flexion angle of the NFTG and CG. Hence, to improve posture in the cervical
spine, physical therapy interventions, such as direct joint mobilization and direct
improvement in the muscle strength of stabilizers that maintain joint alignments, are
important<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, such direct
interventions were excluded from the present study, and only neurofeedback training, an
internal biofeedback system of brain waves, was used, which is thought to have made it
difficult to directly cause postural change and increase the ROM in the cervical spine. Such
research findings suggest that when joint mobilization, exercise therapy, and neurofeedback
training are applied in combination to people with poor posture of and pain in the cervical
spine, it will have a greater impact on improving their neck pain and functional recovery in
the future. Gong et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
after patients who had neck pain associated with acute whiplash performed exercise, there
was a reduction in the NDI in chronic neck pain patients. In the present study, a
significant increase was observed in the NFTG. This is thought to be the result of
neurofeedback training, which maintained stable and effective brain functions in the NFTG.
Moreover, with the improvement in the dynamic functions in the cervical spine, the group&#x02019;s
daily activity function improved partially. With the postural improvement in the neck, the
stress in the muscles around the neck was reduced, leading to a lower NDI, which in turn
improved concentration. In addition, pain reduction in the NDI was found both in the
study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> of neurofeedback training on
patients with chronic pain and by Ibric and Dragomirescu<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, who applied neurofeedback training to patients who complained of
neck and temporomandibular pain as well as a sleep disorder. Teaching self-regulation to
either reduce or alleviate pain sensations by stabilizing the pain in the central nervous
system is the core of neurofeedback training. From the aforementioned results, it is
expected that the subjects in the NFTG experienced pain reduction in the cervical spine.
Moreover, the finding in which scores in the NDI indicating functional disorders improved is
in line with the research findings of Yu Yeon-Ho<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> who reported improved physical movement abilities, such as static
coordination ability, hand movement coordination ability, general movement coordination
ability, and the ability to perform simultaneous movement and single movement. Furthermore,
Yu Saeng-Yeol<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
concentration training with biofeedback enhanced pitching performance and partially improved
attention, while Chang Jae-Geun<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> found
that concentration training with brain wave regulation had a positive impact on sprint
performance. Therefore, the findings of the present study can be seen in the same light.</p><p>In the present study, although neurofeedback training could not be confirmed to directly
cause change in the postural alignment of patients with FHP, it is thought to have improved
their overall ability to carry out daily activities and their physical functions. Building
on the findings of the present study, it is hoped that there will be continuous research on
neurofeedback training to investigate its effects on improving concentration and direct
changes in brain waves.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>DD</given-names></name><name><surname>Betz</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Increasing the cervical lordosis with chiropractic
