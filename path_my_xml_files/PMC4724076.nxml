Research has shown that many people with advanced cancer have problems with everyday activities, which have negative impact on their quality of life, and that they spend a considerable part of their time at home. Still, research on interventions to support the performance of and participation in everyday activities is only scarcely available. Therefore, the occupational therapy-based &#x0201c;Cancer Home-Life Intervention&#x0201d; consisting of tailored adaptive interventions applied in the participant&#x02019;s home environment was developed.</p><p>The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention compared to usual care on the performance of and participation in everyday activities and quality of life in people with advanced cancer living at home.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study is a randomised, controlled trial (RCT) including an economic evaluation. The required sample size of 272 adults living at home will be recruited from outpatient clinics at two Danish hospitals. They should be diagnosed with cancer; evaluated incurable by the responsible oncologist; and with a functional level 1&#x02013;2 on the WHO performance scale. The primary outcome is the quality of performance of activities of daily living. Secondary outcomes are problems with prioritised everyday activities; autonomy and participation; and health-related quality of life. Participants are randomly assigned to: a) The Cancer Home-Life Intervention in addition to usual care, and b) Usual care alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The trial will show whether the Cancer Home-Life Intervention provides better support for people with advanced cancer living at home in performing and participating in everyday activities, and whether it contributes to their health-related quality of life. The economic evaluation alongside the RCT will show if the Cancer Home-Life Intervention is cost-effective. The trial will also show the acceptability of the intervention to the target group, and whether subgroups of participants will benefit more than others.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02356627">NCT02356627</ext-link>.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some of the goals of palliative care are to alleviate adverse consequences of the disease, to improve the quality of life, and to help patients with life-threatening illness to live as actively as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Advanced cancer, defined as cancer diagnosed as incurable by the responsible oncologist, can cause functional limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which may result in decreased ability and energy to perform everyday activities, such as self-care, household, leisure and work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recent study found that 48&#x000a0;% of patients with advanced cancer (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;977) had problems with everyday activities, and that 29&#x000a0;% had unmet needs regarding these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In another study, more than 43&#x000a0;% of women with metastatic breast cancer (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;163) had difficulties with activities of daily living (ADL) and 74&#x000a0;% with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Further, in a study of people with advanced cancer, 10-30&#x000a0;% reported that they had needs in performing everyday activities, i.e. activities that, in addition to ADL and IADL, include leisure and work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Consequently, many people with advanced cancer are not able to perform needed and desired everyday activities, which may lead to reduced quality of life for the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite the knowledge about the problems and needs of people with advanced cancer related to everyday activities, palliative care rarely encompasses interventions that focus on enabling everyday activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and little is known about how the everyday activities are specifically affected and what kind of support is needed. Prior to the present study, a cross-sectional study was conducted to delineate the everyday activity problems, particularly in regard to ADL performance, activities prioritised to be solved, and intervention needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In all, 164 participants with an advanced cancer, a mean age of 67&#x000a0;years, and a WHO Performance Status of 1&#x02013;3 were included. The findings showed that many participants had functional limitations such as fatigue and pain, and that their ADL performance was characterised by increased effort and reduced efficiency, safety and independency. About half had ADL motor ability below age expectations. The ADLs that caused most problems were physically demanding activities such as cleaning, laundering, and cooking, while fewer problems with self-care were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The study showed that the everyday activities which the participants had problems with and prioritised being solved mostly concerned leisure, social and domestic activities, along with a wish for improved mobility, autonomy and participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>A Danish randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that an activity-focused hospital-based intervention was feasible for people with advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The study did not identify superior effect of the intervention partly due to a small sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A systematic review has indicated that home-based interventions can improve health-related quality of life and satisfaction with palliative care, reduce depressive symptoms, societal costs, and the number of hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, a study has shown that people with advanced cancer spend a considerable part of their time at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hence a home-based intervention may be more appropriate than a hospital-based intervention in order to enable everyday activities for people with advanced cancer.</p><p>We only identified one home-based intervention study aimed at supporting everyday activities for people with cancer. Hegel et al. performed a pilot RCT of a telephone-delivered problem-solving occupational therapy intervention lasting less than a mean time of 106&#x000a0;min. They found that participation restrictions in everyday activities among rural breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy seemed to be decreased due to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. When searching for interventions for groups with activity problems similar to those of people with advanced cancer, such as people with chronic diseases and older people with functional limitations, we only identified few studies. The interventions mainly consisted of adaptation of everyday activities, energy conservation, provision of assistive or mainstream technologies, and home modifications, resulting in improved functioning in everyday activities and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Based on the cross-sectional study, existing studies and available guidelines, a literature review, and consultation with representatives of the target group, the &#x0201c;Cancer Home-Life Intervention&#x0201d; was developed and pilot-tested. The intervention applies adaptive strategies, defined as individual plans to overcome particular challenges or to meet the needs of the study participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and aims to compensate for functional limitations, enhance participation in everyday activities, and support resource/energy preserving activity patterns of people with advanced cancer. The intervention has undergone a small feasibility trial (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) showing that the intervention was acceptable for the study participants and possible to implement. Since the Cancer Home-Life Intervention is newly developed an evaluation of its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is required prior to wider implementation. This study protocol outlines how we intend to conduct such evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objective</title><p>The overall objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention compared to usual care on the performance of and participation in everyday activities and health-related quality of life in people with advanced cancer living at home.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Specific aims</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To examine the effectiveness of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention in terms of quality of ADL performance as a primary aim and in terms of problems with everyday activities prioritised to be solved; autonomy and participation in the dwelling; and health-related quality of life as secondary aims.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate whether the Cancer Home-Life Intervention is especially effective in some subgroups of people with advanced cancer defined by age, gender, primary cancer diagnosis, and the WHO Performance score.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore how people with advanced cancer experience the usefulness of the intervention, and how activity patterns change over time in the two groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate the cost-effectiveness of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hypotheses</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The quality of ADL performance as demonstrated by motor and process ability will be better in participants undergoing the Cancer Home-Life Intervention compared to participants who receive usual care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants undergoing the Cancer Home-Life Intervention will report less difficulty with prioritised everyday activities, better autonomy and participation, and higher levels of health-related quality of life compared to participants who receive usual care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Cancer Home-Life intervention provides more Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) at a higher incremental cost.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Cancer Home-Life intervention is cost-effective in a health sector perspective.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is designed as a RCT using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.

The intervention program is occupational therapy-based and encompasses individually tailored combinations of the following elements: 1) prioritisation of resources, energy, and everyday activities; 2) adaptation of activities; 3) adaptation of posture and seating positioning; 4) provision of assistive devices; 5) modification of the physical home environment. Intervention elements are selected in co-operation between the participant and the I-OT by means of an interview with the participant based on the individual&#x02019;s problems and needs. The intervention is provided through instruction in and training of the selected strategies, such as how to conduct activities in energy conserving and strain minimizing ways, and guidance and training in safe and efficient use of assistive devices. It is provided in the participant&#x02019;s home within a week after baseline data collection and completed within three weeks after the initial home visit. The intervention will encompass 1&#x02013;3 home visits followed by 1&#x02013;3 telephone calls. When needed, the participant can also contact the I-OT.</p><p>In addition to the Cancer Home-Life Intervention, the participants in the intervention group will receive usual care as offered by the hospital and municipality. Usual care aimed at enhancing everyday activities of people with advanced cancer sometimes consists of provision of assistive devices and home modifications, but not necessarily provided systematically. All participants will be allowed to use available medical services such as rehabilitation and palliative care.</p><p>Four I-OTs, two at each hospital, will provide the intervention after having attended a one-day training course in the application of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention. Regular meetings will be held with the I-OTs in order to ensure that the intervention is applied according to the manual and as similar as possible across hospitals. The I-OTs will document adherence to the intervention manual by registering which components of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention they have provided to each participant. The study participants will register in a structured questionnaire which everyday activity enabling interventions they have been offered and report whether they have used them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Control</title><p>Participants in the control group will receive usual care as offered by the hospital and municipality, described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Instrumentation</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Quality of ADL performance is measured by <italic>The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The AMPS is a standardised, observation-based assessment designed to evaluate the quality of a person&#x02019;s ADL performance regarding ease, efficiency, safety, and independence. A trained and calibrated P-OT observes the quality of 16 motor and 20 process performance skills (ADL ability) while the person performs two familiar and relevant ADLs, and rates the person&#x02019;s performance of each skill on a four-point ordinal scale. The ADL motor ability is a measure of how much physical effort, clumsiness, and/or fatigue the person demonstrates during ADL performance. The ADL process ability is the person&#x02019;s overall efficiency regarding appropriate use of time, space, and objects throughout ADL performance. The ordinal scores are converted into two overall linear ability measures by Rasch-based computer-scoring software: one for ADL motor ability and one for ADL process ability expressed in logistically transformed probability units (logits). The two overall linear ability measures are adjusted for task challenge, skill item difficulty, and rater severity. ADL motor ability above 2.0 logits and ADL process ability above 1.0 logits indicate competent ADL performance, and 0.3 logits a clinical relevant change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the present study, the ADL motor ability is used as the primary outcome. The P-OT also assesses the five most effective and the five most ineffective ADL motor and process skills based on clinical reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The AMPS has been found valid and reliable in people with advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and responsive in people with other disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Problems with everyday activities prioritised to be solved</title><p>Problems with everyday activities at home that the participants face and prioritise to have solved, will be assessed using the <italic>Individually Prioritised Problems Assessment (IPPA)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The instrument has a structured interview format where the participant identifies up to seven everyday activity problems and rates the importance of and ease/difficulty with each of these problems on five-point ordinal scales from 1 to 5, where 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not important at all and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;most important; and 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;no difficulty at all and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;too much difficulty to perform the activity at all. The importance scores and the difficulty scores of each activity are multiplied. The scores are then added up and divided by the number of activity problems, resulting in an average IPPA score between 1 and 25. Higher average IPPA scores indicate more difficulty with the prioritised everyday activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The IPPA has been found to be a useful, responsive, and valid instrument in older people who use assistive devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Autonomy and participation in the dwelling</title><p>Autonomy and participation are assessed using three subscales of the Danish version (IPA-DK) of the <italic>Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The IPA-DK is a questionnaire targeting adults with chronic functional limitations. It assesses person-perceived participation restrictions via 32 items organised into five subscales: 1. Autonomy indoors, 2. Family roles, 3. Autonomy outdoors, 4. Social life and relationships, and 5. Work and education. For this study, the subscales 1, 2, and 4 are used. Response options are given on five-point ordinal scales from 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;very good to 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;very poor. In addition, there are nine items which quantify the degree to which the respondents perceive these restrictions as problematic in their daily life. As these are used for clinical decision making, they are not included in this study. IPAQ is available in several language versions which have well-documented psychometric properties, and the Danish version has undergone a reliability test with satisfactory results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Health-related quality of life</title><p>Health-related quality of life will be assessed by means of <italic>The European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C-30)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], designed to assess the health-related quality of life of persons with cancer. The instrument consists of nine scales assessing: physical function, role function, emotional function, cognitive function, social functioning, global health status/quality of life, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain, and six single-item scales: dyspnoea, insomnia, lack of appetite, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties. All the scales and single-item measures range in a score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&#x0201c;better&#x0201d;) level of functioning or a higher (&#x0201c;worse&#x0201d;) level of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Additionally, health-related quality of life will be measured by the use of the <italic>EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D-5L)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The EQ-5D-5L is a generic instrument measuring health-related quality of life, and it is widely used in economic evaluations. The instrument consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The participant scores each dimension on a five-point ordinal scale ranging from no problems to severe/extreme problems. A Danish set of preference values was constructed based on interviews with 1332 Danish respondents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The psychometric properties of the EQ-5D-5L including the Danish version have been extensively investigated and are considered as good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

T1 will be taken as the start of the time frame that will end at T4. All costs will be reported in 2015-Euros. By the use of register data to estimate costs, we expect a full follow-up of these data. The method of multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] will be used to handle possible lost to follow-up in the ADL motor ability or the EQ-5D-5L due to other reasons than death.</p><p>In the cost-effectiveness analysis the ADL motor ability will be used as the clinical parameter and QALY will be used as the measure of utility.

The ICER summarises the results of each economic evaluation in a single parameter, defined as the ratio of additional costs per additional unit of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

All eligible participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time without consequences for their future care. The trial will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. According to the Danish Regional Scientific Ethical Committee regulations the project is not notifiable, because no human biological material is included in the project (S-20122000-96). Permission to obtain and store data was originally given by the Danish Data Protection Agency (J.nr. 2012-41-1404), but controllership has later (March 27 2015) been transferred to the umbrella/joint notification of Southern Denmark to the Danish Data Protection Agency of University (FN 215-57-0008). The intervention group will be treated by authorised occupational therapists trained specifically for the present study. Since the control group will be offered the care that is usually given, and the outcome of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention is expected to have a positive impact on the everyday activities of people with advanced cancer, allocation to either the control group or the intervention group is ethically acceptable. No adverse effects of the planned intervention are expected. However, because the participants suffer from a life-threatening disease, the assessments may cause emotional reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. This will be handled in an ethically appropriate manner: all participants will receive a telephone number so that they can contact the research team if needed, and time is allocated for the P-OTs and the I-OTs to talk to the participants if required. All results will be handled confidentially, and only group results will be published.</p><p>The project is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (J.nr. 2012-41-1404). Data will be stored in locked filing cabinets or in password-protected computers at the University of Southern Denmark, archived in accordance with University guidelines and the Danish Data Protection Agency.</p><p>The study is registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ClinicalTrials.gov">www.controlled-trials.com/ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02356627).</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study will contribute with knowledge about whether the Cancer Home-Life Intervention can support people with advanced cancer living at home in performing and participating in prioritised everyday activities, and whether the intervention contributes to their health-related quality of life. So far knowledge about improving and preserving everyday activities of people with advanced cancer is scarce. Given that these people live longer and are increasingly receiving medical treatment on an outpatient basis, they need to be able to manage or live an everyday life according to their own wishes; there is a definite need for such knowledge.</p><p>A strength of the study is that parts of it are based on the previous cross-sectional study serving as a kind of feasibility study as recommended by The Medical Research Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. For instance we gained experience with ways of recruiting from hospitals, time use and procedures for data collection; we got knowledge about the demographics and clinical characteristics of the study population and which everyday activities they had problems with, and which they would like to have solved. Most importantly the cross-sectional study provided empirical information that could be used to calculate the sample size on basis of our primary outcome measure. The calculation was therefore based on the required number of participants at T3, taking expected drop-out into account in order to get sufficient power to detect possible effects. Another strength is that we involved a patient expert group consisting of representatives of people with advanced cancer to advise us about the contents and feasibility of the Home-Life Intervention and piloted the procedures and the intervention prior to trial start (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4).</p><p>One of the challenges encountered in the cross-sectional study was the mortality of the study population. For instance only ten of the 84 study participants included from OUH were alive one and a half year after completion of the cross-sectional study. The consequence may be that a substantial part of the study participants may not be alive at the 24&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; follow-up (T4). Since data from T4 are solely used for the economic evaluation and mostly consist of register based data, it still is possible to get useful results.</p><p>The study is one of the first to investigate the effect of everyday activity interventions for people with advanced cancer in the home. In addition to data on the effectiveness of the Cancer Home-Life Intervention, the study will provide information about the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, its acceptability for the target group, and whether some subgroups might benefit more than others from the intervention. Hence the study will yield comprehensive knowledge that can be applied in palliative care in case of positive results; if so, the next step will be to investigate how to implement the Cancer Home-Life Intervention in municipality palliative care.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>Activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMPS</term><def><p>The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUH</term><def><p>Aarhus University Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEAC</term><def><p>Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DREAM</term><def><p>The Danish Register for Evaluation of Marginalization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRG</term><def><p>Diagnosis related group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC QLQ-C30</term><def><p>The European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L</term><def><p>The EuroQol 5-dimensions 5 levels</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>I-OT</term><def><p>Intervention Occupational Therapist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPA-DK</term><def><p>The Danish version of the Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPPA</term><def><p>The Individually Prioritised Problems Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPR</term><def><p>The National Patient Registry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHSR</term><def><p>The Danish National Health Service Register for Primary Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OUH</term><def><p>Odense University Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>P-OT</term><def><p>Project occupational therapist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality Adjusted Life Years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>&#x000c5;B and KlC conceived the original idea for the trial, sought and obtained funding.
