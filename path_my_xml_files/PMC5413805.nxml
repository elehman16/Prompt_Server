Knowledge about whether patients who achieve clinical benefit early in treatment retain that response over time, and whether patients who fail to achieve an early benefit may develop a positive response at a later time, is critical in establishing reasonable expectations about the effectiveness of treatment.</p><p>Many clinical development programmes, including eluxadoline for IBS&#x02010;D, are not prospectively designed to answer such questions, since the primary focus is on the regulatory endpoint(s) necessary for approval. Because of the waxing and waning character of IBS symptoms, it is recommended by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that patient&#x02010;level overall responses to IBS treatments are determined over a specified interval (no less than 8 weeks for the FDA and 26 weeks for the EMA for drugs intended for chronic, continuous use), with patients required to meet the response criteria for &#x02265;50% of this time. Furthermore, the minimal time interval for effectiveness has historically been no less than 4 weeks, limiting the ability to determine time to onset of benefit.</p><p>Moreover, the regulatory endpoint of composite response, whether analysed over 3 or 6 months, may underestimate treatment benefit. The composite response endpoint is based on simultaneous improvement in both abdominal pain and stool consistency, over either the 3&#x02010; or 6&#x02010;month period, resulting in an outcome measure that may be difficult for prescribers to put into clinical context. Additionally, it only assesses two IBS symptoms and may not provide a perspective of overall patient wellbeing and satisfaction, in contrast to a global symptom assessment such as AR. The AR endpoint may therefore be more relevant to the prescribing physician and the patient, as well as being easier to comprehend; however, it is no longer in favour from a regulatory standpoint due to its dependence on distant patient recall and inability to detect improvement or worsening of specific symptoms.</p><p>As previously published, data from the two eluxadoline Phase 3 trials demonstrated that prospectively analysed monthly assessments for the composite endpoint were comparable to the results over the full 6 months (weeks 1&#x02013;26) of efficacy evaluation. Note that the monthly responder rates over time in Lembo <italic>et al</italic>. are driven by the population that met the responder criteria at each independent monthly interval.<xref rid="apt14031-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> In contrast, the current analysis takes an alternative approach, assessing only the subpopulation of patients who were responders in the first month for a response in subsequent months.</p><p>It is important to note that for all of these analyses, the placebo effect is prominent and the response in the placebo arm parallels the findings in the active arms. However, these retrospective analyses were not intended to demonstrate separation from placebo, but rather to assess how the population of patients who either did or did not respond in month 1 fared over the remainder of the study, independent of treatment. The similarity seen between the active and placebo arms is not unexpected and may be related to selection bias, since the analysis population for continued response over subsequent months included only month 1 responders or month 1 nonresponders.</p><p>Despite possible selection bias, these data strongly suggest that the response in the placebo arm is both early and maintained, as is true for the active treatment arms. Factors underlying the response in the placebo arm will also contribute in part to the response seen in the active treatment arms. An explanation for this sustained placebo response underlying all treatment arms is unclear, but could be related to: regression of IBS symptoms to their respective means; the power of suggestion originating from &#x02018;response fatigue&#x02019; or response shift due to daily responses over 6 months to the same symptom questions; a true physiological effect of placebo; or latent effects unmeasured in the current studies.</p><p>Alternatively, disease variation, which again will affect both active and placebo treatment arms, may have contributed to this finding. A previous study has demonstrated considerable variability in the natural history of IBS, with 32&#x02013;68% of patients showing an improvement in their symptoms over the course of long&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up,<xref rid="apt14031-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> suggesting that a degree of variation and/or improvement in symptom severity attributable to the underlying disease course is to be expected, regardless of treatment arm. Similarly, it has been shown that while 62.2% of patients with IBS&#x02010;D followed up for 10 months continued to show symptoms consistent with IBS&#x02010;D, the remainder switched to the constipation subtype (7.7%), mixed subtype (7.0%) or unspecified subtype (23.1%).<xref rid="apt14031-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>
</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, regardless of treatment arm, &#x0003e;65% of subjects who were composite responders within month 1 remained responders over the full duration of 6 months (weeks 1&#x02013;26), with nearly identical results seen when evaluating the AR endpoint (Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This was further corroborated by the monthly assessments, which demonstrated that &#x0003e;60% of subjects who showed a composite response in month 1 of therapy, and ~70% who showed an AR response, remained responders for &#x02265;3 of the five remaining months (Figures <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p>For those subjects who were composite nonresponders over month 1, 18% of subjects receiving eluxadoline 100 mg were subsequent composite responders over months 1&#x02013;6 (weeks 1&#x02013;26), vs. 13% for placebo (Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Similar findings were noted for the AR nonresponders over month 1, whose subsequent responder rate over months 1&#x02013;6 (weeks 1&#x02013;26) was ~17% for the active arms, albeit with less prominent separation from placebo (Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p>Our results both corroborate Lembo <italic>et al</italic>.'s findings<xref rid="apt14031-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> and demonstrate the robustness of the data. Specifically, these analyses suggest that a response during the first month after initiating eluxadoline treatment in IBS&#x02010;D appears to be predictive of a sustained response.</p><p>Additionally, Lembo <italic>et al</italic>. depict in their Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> that the treatment effect observed for the composite endpoint occurred within the first few days of treatment, with the proportion of responders on active treatment being greater than placebo and the separation from placebo remaining constant over the 6&#x02010;month assessment period.<xref rid="apt14031-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> A similar pattern of response over time is seen when plotting the weekly assessments of AR response (our Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), although the ranges of response are notably higher than with the composite response.</p><p>The endpoints depicted in these two graphs are different both from a standpoint of definition (AR for the present Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> vs. the composite endpoint of improvement in pain and stool consistency for Lembo <italic>et al</italic>. Figure <xref rid="apt14031-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="apt14031-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>) as well as the timing of assessments (weekly for the AR endpoint with &#x02265;50% of weeks positive and daily for the composite endpoint with &#x02265;50% of days positive). Both the AR and composite endpoints qualitatively demonstrate a rapid onset that is not detectable by assessments evaluated over 50% of a time interval.</p><p>Based on the above, clinicians can employ both of these endpoints despite the differing rates of response. Therefore, the AR approach can be used, that is, a simple yes/no question, to assess response instead of the more cumbersome composite endpoint, which requires a daily diary record of stool consistency and pain scores. This is critical for appreciating the benefit of eluxadoline, as AR is an endpoint that clinicians and patients understand and it can easily be adapted for day&#x02010;to&#x02010;day practice.</p><p>Our data support that a trial of eluxadoline for at least 1 month to assess response is reasonable in patients with IBS&#x02010;D. Thirteen to 18% of nonresponders by either criteria (composite responder or AR responder) over the first month of treatment ultimately show a composite response over the remaining 5 months, suggesting that continuing therapy may offer minimal benefit to patients. The majority of patients who respond by either set of criteria over the first month of treatment retain their positive response over 6 months of treatment, thus a response in the first month bodes well for the continuation of response over time.</p></sec><sec id="apt14031-sec-0020"><title>Authorship</title><p>
