However, no previous research has examined how long KT should be applied to muscle following damaging exercise. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the duration of KT application on markers of muscle damage following eccentric exercise. Thirty-two male subjects participated in the study and were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control (CON), KT-post, KT-30 min, or KT-24 hr. Eccentric exercise consisted of 2 sets of 25 contractions of elbow flexors using the non-dominant arm. Maximal isometric strength, muscle soreness (SOR), range of motion, and creatine kinase activity were measured before, immediately after, and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr after exercise. The KT-24 hr group showed lesser muscle damage and a faster recovery time than the CON and KT-post groups. Both the KT-30 min and KT-24 hr groups showed lesser SOR than CON and KT-post groups. These findings suggested that prolonged application of KT had a positive effect on markers of muscle damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Eccentric exercise</kwd><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Muscle damage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It is well known that strenuous physical activity or excessive eccentric exercise may cause muscle damage (<xref rid="b29-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Proske and Morgan, 2001</xref>). Muscle damage may lead to decreased muscle strength and range of motion (ROM), delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), as well as increased blood level of muscle enzyme such as creatine kinase (CK), through efflux across the cell membrane (<xref rid="b7-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Clarkson and Sayers, 1999</xref>).

When KT is applied to the muscle, in which the tape lifts the surface of skin and forms a wide space between the skin and the muscle, resulting in increased blood and lymph flow (<xref rid="b40-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida and Kahanov, 2007</xref>). Additionally, the use of KT has been proposed for the maintenance of function by promoting proprioception in the skeletal muscle, for reducing pain by stimulating the neurological system, and for realigning joint movement, by recovering muscle tension (<xref rid="b10-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b17-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several studies investigated the effect of KT on muscle damage after exercise. <xref rid="b24-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al.

In contrast, <xref rid="b27-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Ozmen et al.

Additionally, no studies have investigated how long KT should be applied to prevent or treat muscle damage following damaging exercise. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate whether prolonged application of KT has effect on markers of muscle damage following eccentric exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We enrolled 32 collegiate male subjects between the ages of 21&#x02013;30 who had not participated in any exercise programs within the past 6 months, were not diagnosed with any neuromuscular diseases, and had not received medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Each subject was randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control group without KT during and after exercise (CON), KT application during exercise and removal immediately after exercise (KT-post), KT application during exercise and removal 30 min after exercise (KT-30 min), or KT application during exercise and removal 24 hr after exercise (KT-24 hr). Characteristics of subjects are shown in <xref rid="t1-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>On the first visit, each subject was explained in detail the procedures of the study, prior to signing an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board, Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea. Subjects also completed a brief medical history questionnaire. On the second visit, after at least 8 hr of overnight fasting, subjects returned to the laboratory to obtain baseline measurements and perform the eccentric exercise protocol. The baseline measurements include maximal isometric strength (MIS), muscle soreness (SOR), ROM, and serum CK activity. Immediately after exercise, only MIS and ROM were assessed. On the third visit (24 hr after exercise), subjects returned to the laboratory for another set of measurements, including MIS, SOR, ROM, and serum CK activity. During fourth to sixth visits, subjects underwent the same measurements. All measurements were taken for each subject, at the same time of the day.</p></sec><sec><title>Eccentric exercise protocol</title><p>A modified preacher curl machine was used to induce muscle damage (<xref rid="b6-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Clarkson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b31-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Sayers and Clarkson, 2003</xref>). Each subject resisted the investigator while lowering a bar attached to the preacher curl. Each subject performed 2 sets of 25 eccentric contractions with 5-min rest between sets. These exercises involved the elbow flexors for the nondominant armeach contraction lasted for 3 sec, with 12-sec rest between contractions. To make sure that each subject performed voluntarily the maximal contraction, the investigator encouraged to resist maximally when the lever is lowered.</p></sec><sec><title>KT application</title><p>Prior to eccentric exercise, Y-shaped KT (width, 5 cm; length, 20 cm) was applied to the nondominant arm of each subject (Kinesio Tex, Nitto Denko, Japan). The application of KT was used as described in <xref rid="b21-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Kase et al. (2003)</xref>. While each subject maintained his elbow at 45&#x000b0;, palm upward, the lower part of the Y-shaped tape was attached to the front of the elbow. Each subject was then asked to straighten the elbow, and the upper side of the Y-shaped taping was attached to the biceps.</p></sec><sec><title>Maximal isometric strength</title><p>MIS was measured using a strain gauge (Jackson Strength Evaluation System Model. 32628CTL, Lafayette Instrument Co., Lafayette, IN, USA) attached to a modified preacher curl machine (<xref rid="b6-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Clarkson et al., 2005</xref>). Each subject performed maximal isometric contraction of elbow flexors, using the nondominant arm, while sitting on the preacher curl machine. During each 3-sec contraction, subjects maintained their arm at 90&#x000b0; and pulled the pad attached to the preacher curl machine. The resting period between measurements was 1 min. To ensure that each subject performed in the same position, the investigator measured joint angle at 90&#x000b0; with a goniometer (S29-5900, KASCO, Islamabad, Pakistan) and marked the line on the pad attached to the elbow joint each time. Three trials were performed and averaged to determine the MIS.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle soreness</title><p>SOR was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 indicated no soreness and 10 indicated severe soreness (<xref rid="b22-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b26-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Nicol et al., 2015</xref>).

Previous studies have demonstrated that KT has a positive effect on pain and functional improvement among athletes and patients (<xref rid="b28-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Paoloni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b39-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate the effect of duration of KT application on MIS, SOR, ROM, and CK activity following eccentric exercise. We found that prolonged application of KT has a positive effect on markers of muscle damage, after eccentric exercise.</p><p>MIS is closely related to primary muscle damage after eccentric exercise and is accompanied by morphological changes, such as Z-line streaming, A-band disruption or cytoskeletal disturbance (<xref rid="b29-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Proske and Morgan, 2001</xref>). Several studies have reported that KT may improve muscular function by reducing abnormal muscle tension (<xref rid="b21-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Kase et al., 2003</xref>) and muscle strength, by refining muscle alignment (<xref rid="b16-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>). <xref rid="b16-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al. (2009)</xref> reported that KT had a significant increase in muscle strength compared to placebo taping group, when the strength of the lower trapezius muscle among individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome was measured using hand-held dynamometer. <xref rid="b23-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2010)</xref> also found that KT application on the flexor muscles around the elbow joint resulted in improved handgrip strength. However, these studies applied KT without inducing muscle damage. A possible explanation that KT improves muscle strength after damaging exercise, may be related to proprioceptive feedback system, in which sensory information is processed in the surrounding muscle tissue, such as muscle spindle that senses abrupt changes in muscle tension and length (<xref rid="b30-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Riemann and Lephart, 2002</xref>). Several studies reported that reduced force sense was developed by impaired function of proprioceptors following eccentric exercise (<xref rid="b4-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Byrne and Eston, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b35-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Torres et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that decline in force sense may be related to disturbance of proprioceptive system, including muscle spindle (<xref rid="b3-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Brockett et al., 1997</xref>). Some studies reported that KT improved the proprioceptive system (<xref rid="b5-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b25-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). <xref rid="b5-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2010)</xref> found that KT significantly reduced both, absolute and relative force sense error, when compared to placebo taping or no taping. Taken together, it is speculated that KT application may reduce muscle damage, by controlling proprioception, when muscle spindle prevented the overstretched muscle length, by KT during eccentric exercise. However, in the present study, muscle strength in KT-post was significantly different than that in KT-30 min and KT-24 hr, at 48 and 96 hr after exercise and this may be due to application time. Thus, it may be postulated that the longer period of KT application, the more prevention to be lengthened by muscle fibers.</p><p>KT also significantly reduced SOR after eccentric muscle contractions in the present study. Several clinical studies have reported that KT may be effective in reducing pain (<xref rid="b20-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Karatas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b28-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Paoloni et al., 2011</xref>). Reduced blood flow occurs under eccentric muscle contractions, although the exact mechanisms are not elucidated (<xref rid="b14-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Heap et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b19-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Kano et al., 2005</xref>). In animal models, diameters of arterioles and venules in rat gastrocnemius were significantly reduced after eccentric exercise, when compared to nonexercised control (<xref rid="b14-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Heap et al., 2006</xref>). Red blood cell hemodynamics, as well as microvascular oxygen pressure were significantly reduced after downhill running in rat spinotrapezius muscle (<xref rid="b19-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Kano et al., 2005</xref>). A recent human study, also reported that healthy men showed a transient increase in arterial stiffness and impairment of macrovascular function, after damaging exercise (<xref rid="b2-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, a recent study by <xref rid="b1-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Aguilar-Ferr&#x000e1;ndiz et al. (2014)</xref> reported that KT improved the peripheral venous flow, when measured by venous refill time and venous pump power, as well as perception of pain, among postmenopausal women with chronic venous insufficiency.</p><p>Another explanation for KT to reduce SOR may be related to inhibition of nerve activation. It is proposed that KT reduces pressure to the nociceptor situated under the skin (<xref rid="b21-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Kase et al., 2003</xref>) and attenuates afferent nerve activation, leading to a decreased pain perception (<xref rid="b33-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Thelen et al., 2008</xref>). However, since the above mechanism is not elucidated by an experimental data, most of KT studies have been relied on this proposed hypothesis. In addition, reduced inflammatory response, a potent factor for SOR following eccentric exercise, may be attributed to reduction in SOR, but again this was not fully demonstrated by experimental data. However, a recent study reported that KT could significantly reduce edema, as well as pain perception after knee replacement surgery (<xref rid="b9-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Donec and Kri&#x00161;&#x0010d;i&#x0016b;nas, 2014</xref>). Since edema is an indirect marker of inflammation, reduction in edema by KT may be related to blunted inflammation. Again, this needs to be clarified in a further study.</p><p>Reduced SOR may affect changes in ROM after eccentric exercise. It is suggested that increase in SOR is related to decrease in ROM (<xref rid="b34-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Tokmakidis et al., 2003</xref>). A clinical study demonstrated that KT had a significant reduction in pain, with improved ROM in patients with whiplash injury compared to sham taping group (<xref rid="b13-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Iglesias et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, in the present study KT significantly decreased SOR in KT-24 hr, resulting in improvement in ROM.</p><p>CK is one of the muscle proteins that leaks into the interstitial spaces by lymphatic system, following eccentric exercise (<xref rid="b31-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Sayers and Clarkson, 2003</xref>). In the present study, CK activity was significantly lower in KT-24 hr than in KT-post, at 96 hr after eccentric muscle contractions. This may be attributed to increased CK clearance, by improved blood and lymphatic flow after KT application. This mechanism may be related to manual lymph drainage in a rehabilitation setting. The manual lymph drainage technique is known to promote biochemical products in the body by stimulating the lymphatic system (<xref rid="b37-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Vairo et al., 2009</xref>). <xref rid="b32-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Schillinger et al. (2006)</xref> reported an experimental group that had undergone manual lymph drainage after treadmill exercise and showed significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, when compared with the control group. Another explanation for decrease in CK activity after KT may be related to reduction in inflammatory response. Myoglobin is a muscle protein that leaks into the circulation after eccentric exercise. A recent study demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between the number of neutrophils and myoglobin levels (<xref rid="b18-jer-12-5-456" ref-type="bibr">Kanda et al., 2013</xref>). Like CK activity, myoglobin levels are closely related to changes in permeability of cell membrane. Since increase in neutrophils indicates the initiation of an inflammatory response, in the present study, lower CK activity in KT-24 hr may indicate a reduced inflammatory response. Such changes may be related to secondary damage due to eccentric exercise, but it is not clear whether the secondary damage rapidly facilitated those markers or did not occur sufficiently in KT-24 hr. Further research is needed to clarify the exact mechanisms by which KT attenuated muscle damage.</p><p>According to the results of our study, KT should be used in both situations: during exercise and after exercise for up to 24 hr, in order to promote faster recovery following eccentric exercise. Furthermore, KT may be a useful technique for physical therapist and athletic trainers in preventing muscle damage and promoting faster recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-jer-12-5-456"><p>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</p><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was
