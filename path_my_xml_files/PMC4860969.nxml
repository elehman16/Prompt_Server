The ANS is known to control the secretion volume of sIgA; however, the effect of high-frequency (HF) EA on salivary sIgA has not been determined. We investigated whether HF EA affects salivary sIgA levels and the ANS.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Sixteen healthy subjects were randomly classified into two groups: a control group and an EA group. After a 5&#x02005;min rest, subjects in the EA group received EA at 100&#x02005;Hz bilaterally at LI4 and LI11 for 15&#x02005;min before resting for a further 40&#x02005;min post-stimulation. Subjects in the control group rested for a total of 60&#x02005;min. Measurements of the ANS and sIgA levels in both groups were made before, immediately after, 20&#x02005;min after, and 40&#x02005;min after rest or 15&#x02005;min EA treatment. HF and LF components of heart rate variability were analysed as markers of ANS function. LF/HF ratio and HF were taken as indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity, respectively. Salivary protein concentrations and sIgA levels were determined by Bradford protein assay and ELISA, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>LF/HF ratio was significantly increased immediately after EA.

EA and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be classified as low-frequency (LF) or high-frequency (HF), which imply 2&#x02013;5 and 100&#x02013;250&#x02005;Hz, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Previous research has reported that HF and LF electrical stimulation have differential effects on the secretion of opioids.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, LF and HF stimulation excite A&#x003b4; and C nerve fibres, and A&#x003b4; and A&#x003b2; nerve fibres, respectively,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with resultant effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), endocrine system, and immune system.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These systems play an important role in the ability to cope with physical and mental stress. The sympathetic-adrenomedullary and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical systems are activated in response to stress, leading to increased adrenalin (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), and cortisol levels. These mediators act on all organs of the body and increase the ability to cope with stress by increasing pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A previous study has shown that LF stimulation decreases heart rate, and that HF stimulation increases heart rate.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, it has been reported that electrical stimulation of A&#x003b2; nerve fibres in dogs increased parasympathetic nerve activity after increasing sympathetic nerve activity.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Mucous membranes play an important protective role by preventing infection of pathogenic organisms located on the surface of the body. Various proteins contained in saliva, such as mucin or secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), provide protection against infection within the oral cavity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> sIgA prevents adhesion and replication by binding to pathogenic microbes. IgA is a monomer secreted by plasma cells that is combined with a secretory component; therefore sIgA is secreted outside of the glands. Consequently, large amounts of sIgA are found in the oral cavity and intestinal tract. sIgA and mucin levels are controlled by the ANS. Stimulation of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve systems has led to increased secretion of sIgA by submandibular and parotid glands, but the stimulatory effect on salivary sIgA was greater following stimulation of the sympathetic versus parasympathetic nervous systems.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> In addition, sIgA levels are known to fluctuate with physical or mental stress. Acute high-intensity exercise, long-term heavy training, and chronic mental stress lead to a decrease in sIgA.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It has been reported that LF EA attenuates the decrease in salivary sIgA induced by high-strength exercise.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the effect of HF EA on sIgA level and ANS function and their potential interactions have not yet been investigated. The latter is important as it may form the basis for deciding the appropriate EA frequency in clinical settings. The present study aimed to investigate whether markers of autonomic function and salivary sIgA parameters are impacted by HF EA in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixteen healthy volunteers (aged 21.05&#x000b1;0.82&#x02005;years) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a control group and an EA group (n=8 each). This study was approved by the ethical committees of Teikyo Heisei University, Tokyo, Japan (reference no. 25-007). Informed consent was obtained from each healthy volunteer in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects who smoked or were on medication in the month before study recruitment were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The subjects were asked to refrain from consuming alcoholic drinks from the day before the experiment, and caffeinated drinks such as coffee or tea on the day of the experiment. In addition, the subjects were requested to fast for 2&#x02005;h before the experiment to limit carbohydrate intake, as acidic or high sugar foods can compromise salivary protein assay performance by lowering sample pH and influencing bacterial growth. Volunteers were instructed to arrive 15&#x02005;min before the start of the experimental procedure to allow time for acclimatisation. To avoid the influence of circadian fluctuation in heart rate variability (HRV), salivary protein and sIgA, each experimental procedure was scheduled to take place in the morning between 09:00 and 12:00. In addition, the room temperature was maintained at 23&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C. As calmness is important when measuring heart rate and assessing HRV, all external factors that might disturb the subject under investigation were kept to a minimum. All experiments were performed with the subject in a sitting position. After resting for 5&#x02005;min, volunteers either continued to rest (control group) or underwent EA stimulation for 15&#x02005;min (EA group), and then rested for a further 40&#x02005;min. HRV was measured and saliva was collected at baseline (before) and at three time points following EA or rest: immediately, 20 min, and 40&#x02005;min after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Electroacupuncture</title><p>Acupuncture points LI4 (<italic>Hegu</italic>) and LI11 (<italic>Quchi</italic>) were chosen based on previous research demonstrating a positive effect on sympathetic nerve activity and sIgA levels in saliva.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> A frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz was selected as most HF EA studies have opted for this level of stimulation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In the EA group, stainless steel needles (50&#x02005;mm long, 0.20&#x02005;mm in diameter; Seirin, Shizuoka, Japan) were inserted bilaterally at LI4 and LI11 to a depth of approximately 10 and 15&#x02005;mm, respectively. LI4 was located at the centre of the second metacarpal bone in the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and LI11 was located at the end of the lateral transverse elbow crease in the proximal part of the brachioradial muscle. EA was performed for 15&#x02005;min at 100&#x02005;Hz frequency using an electrostimulator (Ohm Pulser LFP-4000A; Zen Iryoki, Fukuoka, Japan). The control group subjects did not receive any stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Heart rate variability</title><p>To determine the effect of EA on cardiac sympathovagal tone, subjects were fitted with a disposable electrode for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring (Vitrode Bs 150; Nihon Kohden, Inc, Tokyo, Japan). HRV was recorded with a Marquette Holter recorder (LRR-03; GMS, Inc, Tokyo, Japan) at four time points: 5&#x02005;min before, immediately after, 20&#x02005;min after and 40&#x02005;min after rest (control group) or 15&#x02005;min EA. HRV data were processed using HRV analysis software (Crosswell, Inc, Tokyo, Japan). A power spectrum of this time series was then calculated using the maximum entropy method. LF and HF power were estimated within the 0.04&#x02212;0.15 and 0.15&#x02212;0.50&#x02005;Hz frequency bands, respectively. The LF/HF ratio and HF were taken as indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Saliva collection</title><p>Saliva was collected before and after the EA period of 15&#x02005;min (or rest) and every 20&#x02005;min during the post-EA observation period of 40&#x02005;min. Subjects were made to rinse their mouth thoroughly with 100&#x02005;mL drinking water 10&#x02005;min before sample collection, and then to chew a cotton sponge (Salivette; Sarstedt, Inc, Vumbrecht, Germany) for 2&#x02005;min. Saliva was collected after centrifugation of the Salivette tube at g value=2000 for 10&#x02005;min and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Protein measurement</title><p>Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford protein assay.

Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio Rad, Inc, Hercules, California, USA) was diluted 1:4 with distilled water and added to each well. The plate was incubated for 5&#x02005;min and absorbance was measured using a micro-plate reader (iMark; Bio Rad, Inc) at 570&#x02005;nm.

After the plate was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Nissui Pharmaceutical, Inc, Tokyo, Japan) containing 0.05% Tween 20, PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, Inc, St Louis, Missouri, USA) was added to the plate for blocking and maintained for 2&#x02005;h at room temperature. Saliva samples were diluted 1:2000 with diluent (PBS containing BSA, 0.25% Tween). The dose standard consisted of human reference serum (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc). The diluted sample and dose standard were added to each well and incubated for 1&#x02005;h at room temperature. After washing, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgA (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc) was added to the plate and incubated for 1&#x02005;h. After washing, 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; KPL, Inc, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) solution was added to each well. After incubation at room temperature for 15&#x02005;min, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.18 M sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and absorbance was measured using a micro-plate reader at 450&#x02005;nm.

<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, increased sympathetic nerve activity by EA may not be the most important factor affecting sIgA level. It is also possible that, despite the fact that the volunteers were resting, sympathetic nerve activity might have increased due to sitting for a long time, which itself can be stressful and may increase sympathetic tone. This is supported by the fact that mean values of LF/HF ratio increased slightly throughout the 40&#x02005;min observation period in the control group, although not to a statistically significant degree.</p><p>Our results indicated that EA may increase sympathetic nerve activity immediately, parasympathetic nerve activity after 20&#x02005;min, and salivary sIgA level after 40&#x02005;min, respectively. However, this study has a few limitations. Our sample size was small and consisted of only healthy subjects. We believe that additional studies with a larger sample size, and including patients, are necessary to investigate further the physiological effects of acupuncture. In addition, the use of spectral indices of HRV may not completely reflect autonomic control<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and it would be useful to examine also the effects of acupuncture stimulation on components of the endocrine system, such as adrenalin, noradrenaline, and cortisol. However, in summary<bold>,</bold> our study indicates that HF EA may increase salivary sIgA levels by influencing parasympathetic nerve activity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TH, NY, HT, YM, YO, KU and HT conceived the study.
