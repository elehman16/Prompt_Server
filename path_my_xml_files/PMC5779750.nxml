The first choice of anticoagulant therapy (AT) is the vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Contraindication to VKA or poor control of the International Normalized Ratio leads to the administration of direct-acting oral anticoagulants. There is a trend toward inadequate AT in nonvalvular AF (NVAF) patients. Aim: To evaluate the impact of the implementation of a decision support tool linked to the digital clinical history on the adequacy of AT, the incidence of complications, and the mortality in patients with NVAF in primary care centers (PCCs) of the Catalan Institute of Health (ICS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods and analysis:</title><p>Randomized clinical trial in 287 PCCs, formed by 2 groups (intervention and control). Population: patients controlled in PCCs, diagnosed with NVAF 1 year before the implementation of the decision support tool and with VKA treatment over a minimum of 1 year. A simple randomization method will be performed at a sector level. The decision support tool will be available for 1 year. The time in therapeutic range (TTR) will be available in the digital clinical history only to professionals of the intervention group. The information system for primary care research development database will be used for the data extraction. Statistical analysis will be done at 3 time points: before the implementation of the tool, at 1 year, and at 2 years after the beginning of the intervention. Multilevel (patient and professional levels) logistic regression models will be used to estimate the effect of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination:</title><p>This study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Investigation of the <italic>Institut Universitari d&#x02019;Investigaci&#x000f3; en Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria Jordi Gol</italic> (code P17/091).

The prevention of thromboembolic complications is based on antithrombotic treatment with either oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the only oral anticoagulants available for many years. However, the characteristics of VKAs may make their use in patients with NVAF challenging in clinical practice, leading to difficulties in the management of these patients and the need to adapt the therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Recently, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed and have shown to be safe and effective in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, although some limitations have also been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>Since the introduction of DOACs in Spain their use has been on the rise. Nevertheless, data from the Catalan Health Service on the adequacy of DOAC prescriptions indicate that according to the recommendations of the pharmacotherapy commission more than 25% of the patients are not candidates for dabigatran treatment and are receiving it, whereas patients who are candidates to this treatment are not receiving the drug.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> These results indicate a clear problem of adequacy to the anticoagulant treatment. We believe that this problem is probably because of the absence of any single variable in the electronic clinical history of the Catalan Institute of Health (ICS) that provides direct knowledge regarding control of the international normalized ratio (INR), thereby making it difficult to know the real level of control in the previous 6 months, and consequently, the adequacy of treatment and the possible changes needed.</p><p>The present project has been designed taking into account the above situation. The aim of the project is to improve the information available in the electronic clinical history by direct calculation of the time in the therapeutic range (TTR) once the value of the last INR of NVAF patients receiving VKA has been entered. When the TRT is &#x0003c; 65% at 6 months, an alert will be activated and will inform the professional of the need to evaluate a change in the treatment. The TTR (calculated using the Rosendaal method<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>) is a widely applied measure for the evaluation of the adequacy of anticoagulant therapy (AT) with VKAs. In several guidelines on the management of AF the TTR is used as a treatment control criterion, although the use of these guidelines are not generalized throughout the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> According to the recommendations of the ministry of health, social services and equality of Spain (based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>) for the use of DOAC in NVAF patients, a TTR &#x0003c;65% is a criterion of poor VKA control.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>Despite the increasingly more frequent use of computerized medical reminders, few studies have assessed their impact on health outcomes.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> A systematic review showed that notifications influence specific aspects of the prescription process and may be an effective method to reduce the prescription of contraindicated medications, although their impact on health outcomes was not demonstrated.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Within the primary care setting it was found that computerized clinical notifications significantly improved the adequacy of treatment in patients with poorly controlled asthma and consequently reduced the rate of reexacerbations during follow-up. Moreover, medical professionals considered these reminders to be particularly useful for the identification of patients with bad control.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup></p><p>The present project aims to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a clinical decision support tool associated with the electronic clinical history which informs healthcare professionals of the TTR in patients with NVAF attended in primary care centers (PCCs) of the ICS. This project will evaluate the impact of this tool on the adequacy of anticoagulant treatment, the incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications, and mortality at 2 years after the beginning of the intervention. The evaluation of the impact of the intervention will be performed based on the characteristics of the patients and the healthcare professionals.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods and design</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and setting</title><p>A cluster, randomized, clinical trial (type: parallel group) will be performed with patients attended in the ICS primary care setting.

CDS-NVAF is intended for patients diagnosed with NVAF and treated with VKA. This tool calculates the TTR using the Rosendaal method considering the last INR data. The INR data are found in the clinical history of NVAF patients and are located on the screen of the follow-up of oral anticoagulant use.</p><p>The CDS-NVAF will be activated when the physician introduces the last INR value. At this time the TTR will be calculated automatically. If the TTR value is &#x0003c;65%, a pop up screen with an advisory text will open suggesting a change to DOAC therapy. The physician can decide whether to change or not the previous prescription. If the TTR value in &#x0003e;65% the pop up screen will not appear. The TTR value will remain registered on the screen of the follow-up of oral anticoagulant use and can be consulted in future queries.</p><p>The diffusion of the CDS-NVAF will be made by an announcement on the first day of the intervention when the healthcare professional opens the electronic clinical history. The professionals of the intervention group will receive the announcement and will be provided with the CDS-NVAF.

Assuming a weight of 90%, an alpha error of 5%, a control versus intervention ratio of 1, corrected for the design by clusters and assuming a loss of 10%, our study will be able to detect a difference of 1% for a rate of thromboembolic events of 0.66%.

This study protocol (version 1, November 15, 2016) was approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Investigation of the <italic>Institut Universitari d&#x02019;Investigaci&#x000f3; en Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria (IDIAP) Jordi Gol</italic>, on March 15, 2017 (code P17/091). In addition, the study has been authorized by the Direcci&#x000f3; Assistencial d&#x02019;Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria of the ICS. The data included in the SIDIAP database will be anonymized and will be identified by an internal code, making subject identification impossible even by the investigative team, thereby guaranteeing the confidentiality of the data of the study participants included in the study according to the organic law on the protection of personal data (15/1999 of 13 December, LOPD). As the study is based on the analysis of an anonymized database, informed consent will not be collected from the patients. Any alteration of the study protocol will be submitted to the ethical committee of the IDIAP Jordi Gol for approval and will be published in clinical trials.gov.</p><p>The results of the study will be disseminated through informative meetings addressed to professionals of the ICS, communications to congresses, publications in scientific journals, and in the clinical trials.gov webpage.</p></sec><sec><label>2.12</label><title>Safety</title><p>The CDS-NVAF may influence clinical decision-making and may contribute in improving the adequacy of anticoagulant treatment in patients treated with VKAs. Changes in treatments are expected (from VKAs to DOACs), which would induce a decrease in the incidence rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events in the medium and long term. Nonetheless, the monitoring of possible adverse effects will be carried out by the comparison of the incidence rates of the studied events between the 2 groups (intervention and control), monthly during the period of the intervention. If an increase in the incidence rates in the intervention group is detected at anytime, the CDS-NVAF will be deactivated by the principal investigator of the project. A data monitoring committee will not be established, as the evaluation of the adverse effects will be carried out by the SISAP in coordination with the principal investigator of the project.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to provide family physicians in primary care in Catalunya with a clinical decision support tool (CDS-NVAF) to improve the adequacy of anticoagulant treatment in patients with NVAF. The implementation of CDS-NVAF and its posterior evaluation is currently considered to be a strategy of priority by the ICS to improve the management of patients with NVAF and subsequently reduce thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications and death derived from poor control of VKA anticoagulation.</p><p>The present study may have a positive immediate impact on clinical decision-making at the primary care level, with CDS-NVAD influencing the daily clinical practice of the general practitioners in ICS. On confirming the good results expected, the use of the CDS-NVAF can be extended to all ICS patients diagnosed with NVAF in Catalunya.</p><p>The study has received financial support to evaluate the results of 2 years after the beginning of the intervention, however, taking into account the importance of obtaining more knowledge on the impact of healthcare results in the mid or long term, the investigative team is seeking financial support to assess the impact of CDS-NVAF at 5 years postintervention.</p><p>The results obtained in the study may be of interest to all of Spain as well as other countries with similar healthcare models which use support tools for clinical decision-making.</p><p>With regard to the limitations of the study, the SIDIAP database includes secondary data, and thus, there may be a certain level of underregistration of variables of interest, although this should not differ between the 2 study groups. The quality of the registry is guaranteed in that most of the study variables make up part of different indicators of quality (SHCQ and SQPP) which are incentivated in the payment systems for objectives of the ICS. There is no problem in the registry of the treatment variables as the billing system of the pharmacy offices collects these data. Another limitation is that the study is unblinded for physicians and there may be contamination between groups which may limit the conclusions of the study. Nonetheless, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in the real-life setting related to the usual clinical practice in which this type of situation is frequent. The investigative team believes that randomization by sectors and not by physicians will reduce the probability of contamination between groups. Another limitation of the study is that the tool provides information about the adequacy of the VKA but not the adequacy of the DOACs, which should be taken into account in result interpretation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the following Departments from the ICS for their contribution in the development and implementation of the CDS-NVAF: Direcci&#x000f3; d&#x02019;Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria de l&#x02019;Institut Catal&#x000e0; de la Salut, Sistemes d&#x02019;Informaci&#x000f3; dels Serveis d&#x02019;Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria, Ger&#x000e8;ncia Territorial i Direcci&#x000f3; d&#x02019;Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria de Terres de l&#x02019;Ebre, Unitat de Sistemes d&#x02019; informaci&#x000f3; de la Ger&#x000e8;ncia Territorial Terres de l&#x02019;Ebre, Centre de Compet&#x000e8;ncies Funcionals de l&#x02019;ECAP de l&#x02019;&#x000c0;rea de Sistemes d&#x02019;Informaci&#x000f3;.
