reality games on balance and gait ability, as well as the psychological characteristics of
stroke patients, such as depression and interpersonal relationships, by comparing them
with the effects of ergometer training. [Subjects] Forty stroke patients were randomly
divided into a virtual reality group (VRG, N = 20) and an ergometer training group (ETG, N
= 20). [Methods] VRG performed training using the Xbox Kinect. ETG performed training
using an ergometer bicycle. Both groups received training 30 min per day, five times per
week, for eight weeks. [Results] Both the VRG and ETG subjects exhibited a significant
difference in weight distribution ratio on the paralyzed side and balance ability. Both
the VRG and ETG patients showed significant improvement in psychological measures BDI and
RCS, after the intervention, and the VRG sowed a more significant increase in BDI than the
ETG. [Conclusion] According to the result of this study, virtual reality training and
ergometer training were both effective at improving balance, gait abilities, depression,
and interpersonal relationships among stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Ergometer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with stroke have a number of physical impairments, including movement, cognitive,
sensory, language, and visual disorders. Among them, movement disorders can limit muscle
control and motion functions or mobility, as well as a degrade in balance control abilities.
Hemiplegia is accompanied by an increase in postural instability, asymmetrical weight
bearing, impairment of body weight transfer capabilities, and a decrease in postural
stability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result, many patients
with stroke experience problems with daily activities requiring functional movements such as
balance, climbing stairs, gait, and walking<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One study reported that since stroke patients experience hemiplegia, they become isolated
in their daily lives from family members and society, and that as well as experiencing a
loss of independence, more than 50% of stroke patients had depression<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. That is, many mental problems, such as depression, apathy,
and anxiety, are prevalent in stroke patients, and depression not only has an adverse effect
on appetite and sleep<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, but it is also a
lives negative factor affecting rehabilitation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, due to the sense of loss and helplessness in their
life, stroke patients have difficulties maintaining interpersonal relationships with
others<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In terms of interventions that help stroke patients with their functional recovery, one of
the most widespread methods is training using a MOTOmed, which is done in a limited
environment in a hospital. This training is known to bring about effective improvements in
physical functions and increases in grip strength and leg muscle strength, leading to
improvements in physical activity abilities and balance due to an increase in muscle
strength<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, this training
integrates bilateral movements and assisted active training, thereby inducing alternate
movements in the paralyzed leg side with the help of the lower extremity on the
non-paralyzed side<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which requires coordinated
transfer of body weight between the two sides. This results in increase of physical strength
in the lower extremity, as well as providing weight-bearing ability through practice of gait
skills<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A great deal of attention has been paid to virtual reality training programs that involve
various treatments providing virtual environments and simulating conditions using virtual
reality tools. Since intervention methods using virtual reality have been demonstrated to be
effective in the rehabilitation of stroke patients, whose physical and recreational
activities are limited due to their physical disability and who experience problems carrying
out activities of daily living in their environment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, various studies have proposed this type of training. Moreover,
positive improvements in the upper extremity functions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, balance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>,
gait<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and daily living movements<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> of stroke patients have been reported.</p><p>Virtual reality training programs initially required much equipment; however, virtual
reality home video games using consoles such as the Sony PlayStation 2 or Nintendo Wii Fit
have been widely used since the mid-2000s, as these have penetrated our daily lives and can
easily be placed in the home. In recent years, training using the Xbox Kinect has been
employed as a virtual reality training program, which is quite different from the virtual
reality computer programs that use a joystick or controller. This training involves playing
a virtual reality game in which players move their bodies in front of the game screen by and
48 of their joint positions and motions are tracked via the Kinect sensors<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. An intervention method using a virtual
reality game enables immediate feedback about task performance, and visual and audible
stimulation kindle interest<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also
generates motivation to engage in treatment, as participants enjoy themselves while actively
carrying out tasks<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it can
provide stability in activities of daily living that stroke patients are unable to
accomplish or are limited in, thereby giving them an opportunity to explore independently
and increase their autonomy<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Training programs using virtual reality games can also be effective at alleviating the
psychological problems of stroke patients such as depression, helplessness, and difficult
interpersonal relationships. Most studies of training programs for stoke patients have
focused on physical aspects, but few have been conducted with a view to elucidating
psychological and social factors related to rehabilitation. Therefore, this study aimed to
determine the effects of training using virtual reality games on balance and gait ability,
as well as the psychological characteristics of stroke patients, such as depression and
interpersonal relationships, by comparing them with the effects of ergometer training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 patients diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from stroke
by a rehabilitation doctor practicing at N Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea. They were
randomly and equally assigned to a virtual reality group (VRG: 10 males, 10 females) and an
ergometer training group (ETG: 12 males, 8 females). The mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) age,
height, and weight of the VRG were 51.37&#x000b1;40.6 years, 167.00&#x000b1;9.53 cm, and 64.12&#x000b1;13.12 kg,
respectively. Eleven of the patients had right hemiplegia, and nine had left hemiplegia. The
onset period was 14.75&#x000b1;6.06 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of ETG patients
were 50.10&#x000b1;7.83 years, 169.20&#x000b1;9.21 cm, and 65.20&#x000b1;11.26 kg, respectively. Eight of the
patients had right hemiplegia, and 12 had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 14.30&#x000b1;3.40
months.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality in the
vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, ability to
understand and perform the exercise as instructed by the researcher, and a score of 24 or
higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination&#x02014;Korean version. This study was approved by the
university&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board and all of the subjects understood the purpose of
this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their participation in the
study, in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The VRG patients performed training using the Xbox Kinect for 30 minutes per session, five
times per week, for a total of 8 weeks. In front of the Xbox Kinect sensor, the subjects
moved their bodies to play the games. Various games such as Kinect Sport, Kinect Sport
Season 2, Kinect Adventure, and Kinect Gunstringer were provided to kindle the subjects&#x02019;
interest and prevent boredom. During the intervention, subjects balanced their bodies and
practiced using their bodies and limbs. Mostly, sport programs, such as 10-pin bowling,
skiing, and golf, and programs such as ground walking, walking over obstacles, and climbing
stairs were used for training.</p><p>The ETG patients performed ergometer bicycle training 30 minutes per session, five times
per week, for a total of 8 weeks. Training was conducted for 30 minutes so as not to exceed
40% of subjects&#x02019; heart rate reserve using a MOTOmed Viva 2. The MOTOmed provides detailed
biofeedback, software-controlled therapy programs, and motivation and training games.</p><p>The subjects in the two experimental groups began training after being given the
instruction, &#x0201c;Please start.&#x0201d; In the early stage, the researcher provided help to ensure that
the subjects maintained proper posture during the training. If a subject exhibited fatigue,
abnormalities in breathing, changes in facial complexion, or complained of pain, training
was stopped immediately.</p><p>For the measurement of balance ability, a biofeedback analysis system (AP1153 BioRescue, RM
Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez, France) was used to determine weight bearing on the affected side,
anterior range limit of stability (LOS), and posterior range LOS in a static standing
position. For the measurement of gait ability, we used the timed up and go (TUG) test and
the 10-m walking test.</p><p>For the asseement of patients psychology, we used the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and
the relationship change scale (RCS). The BDI is a depression assessmemt tool which was
developed by Beck in 1961 and adapted for use in Korea by Han et al. This tool consists of
21 questions divided into four sections, namely the cognitive, emotive, motivational, and
physiological sections. Each question is measured on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3. The
possible score ranges from a minimum of 0 points to a maximum of 63 points. If an individual
scores 0&#x02013;9 points, he or she is not depressed; a score of 10&#x02013;15 points represents light
depression; 16&#x02013;23 points, heavy depression; and 24&#x02013;63 points, severe depression. The RCS
tool consists of 25 questions divided into seven sections, as follows: understanding,
openness, sensitivity, intimacy, trust, communication, and satisfaction. Each question is
rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5. The possible score is 25&#x02013;125 points. The higher
the score, the better the individual&#x02019;s interpersonal relationships.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, the
paired t-test was used to compare the variations in weight bearing on the affected side when
standing, the anterior LOS standing, and the posterior LOS standing. The significance of
differences between the two groups was investigated using the independent t-test.
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both the VRG and ETG subjects exhibited significant improvements in the weight distribution

ergometer training, on the balance, gait abilities, depression, and interpersonal
relationships of stroke patients. To determine balance and gait abilities, the weight
distribution ratio on the paralyzed side, anterior LOS, posterior LOS, TUG, and 10 m walking
test were conducted and their results reveal that both the VRG and ETG showed significant
improvements in balance and gait abilities.</p><p>In a study by Bateni<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, BBS improvements
were shown by elderly patients after using the Nintendo Wii Fit. Moreover, Vernadakis et
al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted virtual reality balance
exercise using the Xbox Kinect for male soccer players in their teens who had experienced
injuries. On average, the participants showed improvements in the overall stability index
(OSI) and LOS. A study by Choi<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
conducted virtual reality training for stroke patients using the Nintendo Wii Fit and
reported that execution times of the timed up and go test and 10-m walking test decreased. A
study by Lee<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that chronic
stroke patients exhibited a significant decrease in execution times of the timed up and go
test and 10-m walking test after completing a virtual reality exercise program. In the
present study, both the VRG and ETG showed significant improvements in balance and gait
abilities after training. This result was obtained because patients&#x02019; motivation was
increased through the virtual reality games, encouraging their active participation and
improving their concentration<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Moreover, this enabled the successful performance of repetitive training exercises for the
damaged. In addition, errors of movement in the lower extremity regarding task performance
were shown through accurate visual and auditory sensory feedback, thereby achieving
re-education of movements of the lower extremity<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This feedback contributed to postural stability improvements,
which increased dynamic balance and gait abilities. In the case of ergometer training,
alternate movements were induced on the paralyzed side with the assistance of the lower
extremity on the non-paralyzed side, and active training could be achieved<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This resulted in increased muscle strength
of the lower extremity on the paralyzed side and the creation of collaborative movements
between both lower extremities, leading to improvements in balance and gait abilities.</p><p>Our study results reveal that the VRG patients showed more significant improvements in
balance and gait abilities than those in the ETG. Virtual reality games such as bowling,
skiing, and golf involve many movements in which the body weight is supported by the lower
extremity while playing the game, and trunk stability was required during movements, as well
as accurate control of the movements. Therefore, this training improved patients&#x02019; balance
abilities significantly, and gait exercises such as ground walking, walking with obstacles,
and walking over stairs were carried out repeatedly. Visual and auditory feedback was also
provided while performing exercises, thereby encouraging correct posture and facilitating
greater improvement of gait abilities than was observed in the ETG group.</p><p>This study also used the BDI and RCS to evaluate depression and interpersonal relationship
factors. Lee et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when
virtual reality games were used by elderly persons, their depression decreased. Moreover,
Lim et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that balance
training performed by stroke patients significantly their BDI scores decreases. Lee and
Hong<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a game-like group art
therapy program for elderly stroke patients and reported improvement in interpersonal
relationships in the subjects who carried out the group art therapy.</p><p>In the present study, both the VRG and ETG subjects showed significant improvements in
balance and gait abilities after training. In particular, the achieved VRG patients
exhibited a more significant improvement in BDI scores than those in the ETG. This result
was achieved due to the virtual reality training, in which achievement and satisfaction
increased because of active performance of exercises which kindled patients&#x02019; interest. In
addition, the ETG performed bicycle riding, which is a bilateral exercise, and affects BDI
scores through achievement of exercise on the paralyzed side. Kim and Kim<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that physical activities elderly
persons can improve not only physical health, but also happiness and quality of life, and
this proposal is supported by our results. However, there was no significant difference in
the RCS scores of the two groups. The reason for this is the two groups did not perform
their exercise with other people, but did so alone using either the virtual reality training
program (Xbox) or ergometer exercise tool.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that it was difficult to exclude various variables that can
affect psychosocial factors such as depression or subjects&#x02019; interpersonal relationships. In
future research, it will be necessary to conduct a study with larger numbers of patients,
and include various psychosocial factors such as fear of falling and self-esteem.</p><p>Our study results show that training using virtual reality programs or an ergometer is
effective at improving balance, gait abilities, depression, and interpersonal relationships
of stroke patients. Therefore, virtual reality training and ergometer training should be
used to improve these characteristics.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Horstmann</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Koziol</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Martinez-Torres</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Sonographic monitoring of mass effect in stroke patients
