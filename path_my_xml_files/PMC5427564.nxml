Empirically validated childbirth preparation options are lacking for pregnant women facing this problem. Mindfulness approaches, now widely disseminated, can alleviate symptoms of both chronic and acute pain and improve psychological adjustment, suggesting potential benefit when applied to childbirth education.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study&#x0feff;, the Prenatal Education About Reducing Labor Stress (PEARLS) study, is a randomized controlled trial (RCT; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) of a short, time-intensive, 2.5-day mindfulness-based childbirth preparation course offered as a weekend workshop&#x0feff;, the <italic>Mind in Labor (MIL)</italic>: <italic>Working with Pain in Childbirth</italic>, based on <italic>Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting</italic> (MBCP) education.&#x0feff; First-time mothers in the late 3rd trimester of pregnancy were randomized to attend either the MIL course or a standard childbirth preparation course with no mind-body focus.

MIL program participants showed greater childbirth self-efficacy and mindful body awareness (but no changes in dispositional mindfulness), lower post-course depression symptoms that were&#x000a0;maintained through postpartum follow-up, and a trend toward a lower rate of opioid analgesia use in labor. They did not, however, retrospectively report lower perceived labor pain or use epidural less frequently&#x000a0;than controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study suggests mindfulness training carefully tailored to address fear and pain of childbirth may lead to important maternal&#x000a0;mental health benefits, including improvements in childbirth-related appraisals &#x0feff;and&#x0feff; the prevention of postpartum depression symptoms. There is also&#x000a0;some indication that MIL participants may use mindfulness coping in lieu of systemic opioid pain medication. A large-scale RCT that captures real-time pain perceptions during labor and&#x000a0;length of labor is warranted to provide a more definitive test of these effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for the PEARLS&#x000a0; study is: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02327559">NCT02327559</ext-link>.

It is related to low childbirth self-efficacy, greater use of pain medication&#x000a0;during labor, more unwanted&#x000a0;obstetric interventions in labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as well as increased risk of postpartum depression (PPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Childbirth education courses are the primary mechanism by which pregnant women learn strategies for coping with labor pain, yet childbirth education has limited efficacy for reducing childbirth fear and in some cases may even cause women to doubt their ability to cope with childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], increasing fear. With over 3.9 million births in the United States (U.S.) per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], innovative and accessible interventions for addressing childbirth fear and pain are critically needed. Mindfulness training &#x02013; long used as a method for promoting coping with chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and shown to be beneficial for acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] &#x02013; provides a novel and promising strategy for preparing women for childbirth.</p><p>Childbirth fear, including its hallmark indicator of low childbirth self-efficacy, predicts poorer labor and delivery related outcomes. Alehagen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] compared primiparous and multiparous women and found that first time mothers had higher levels of fear of childbirth. Fear of childbirth in early labor predicted the total amount of pain medication used during the labor. Data from the Danish National Birth Cohort of over 25,000 nulliparous women indicate that fear of childbirth during pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy (around 31&#x000a0;weeks), was related to a higher risk of emergency Cesarean section, controlling for other risk factors (i.e., weight gain, birth weight, head circumference, and duration of pregnancy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These findings suggest the potential utility of intervening with first time mothers in the 3rd trimester to reduce childbirth fear and pain and improve perinatal outcomes.</p><p>Fear of childbirth and negative birth experiences are linked with depression, all of which can lead to poorer mother-infant adjustment in the perinatal and postpartum periods. In a sample of 89 women, pain catastrophizing scores collected during active labor prior to the administration of analgesia predicted both postpartum depression and social functioning 6 weeks post-birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Antenatal depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated; available treatments for PPD include psychotherapy and anti-depressant medication, but barriers to therapy (e.g., stigma concerns, time/expense involved) and risks of medication to breastfeeding infants restrict access to those treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Data from trials of mindfulness interventions have consistently shown a beneficial effect on depression symptoms and other mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Incorporating mindfulness into childbirth education available to the general public offers pregnant women experiencing depression symptoms, or otherwise at-risk for PPD, an alternative, stigma-free strategy for addressing these concerns while protecting their ability to engage in medication-free breastfeeding and sensitive, responsive mother-infant interactions.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The current study</title><p>We developed the <italic>Mind in Labor (MIL): Working with Pain in Childbirth</italic> (author NB), a childbirth education program that teaches mindfulness skills for coping with childbirth pain and fear in a short, time-intensive 2.5-day weekend workshop. We hypothesized that mindfulness training through MIL would: 1) produce an adaptive shift in fear and pain-related appraisals of childbirth, thereby&#x000a0;increasing childbirth self-efficacy and reducing pain catastrophizing; 2) lead to lower labor pain ratings, less use of pain medication in labor, and greater birth satisfaction; and 3) lower perinatal depression symptoms and protect against postpartum depression. This study, the Prenatal Education About Reducing Labor Stress (PEARLS) study, is a small, randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing these hypotheses in a comparison of MIL against a treatment-as-usual (TAU) active control condition of standard childbirth education with no mind-body focus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria: participants were English-speaking nulliparous women with low-risk, healthy, singleton pregnancies in their third trimester who were planning a hospital birth and willing to be randomized.

Initial eligibility screening was conducted by a brief online survey with follow-up by telephone to capture information related to each of the inclusion/exclusion criteria referenced above. We also collected information regarding intention to use epidural.</p><p>To minimize the probability of baseline group differences, randomization was stratified by pre-course intention to use epidural anesthesia and was performed with randomly varying blocks of 2 and 5 using a pre-programmed computer database. A UCSF senior biostatistician not affiliated with the study generated the randomization scheme. The study project manager (JGC) enrolled and consented study participants; group assignment and subsequent debriefing regarding intervention attendance was conducted by him opening a sealed envelope provided by the biostatistician. Data collection was completed online and through medical record review. The remaining study authors (including data analysts) were blinded to participant study condition.</p><p>As this was a small study with limited funding, we were constrained to a sample size of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 that was selected <italic>a priori</italic> based on sample size recommendations for pilot trials (thus limiting our power to detect effects). Those assigned to the MIL group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) were given a space in a publicly available MIL workshop at UCSF during their third trimester. Tuition for MIL was paid for by the study. Participants assigned to the control condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) were offered up to $200 USD&#x000a0;tuition reimbursement for attending a study-approved, standard hospital- or community-based childbirth education course in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Self-report assessments were conducted at three time points: Time 1 (T1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3rd trimester baseline (immediately pre-intervention and pre-randomization) at average gestational age 29.4&#x000a0;weeks (standard deviation; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.64&#x000a0;weeks); Time 2 (T2)&#x02009;=&#x02009;in the week immediately following the intervention (post-intervention but prior to birth); and Time 3 (T3) at post-birth (postpartum) follow-up (conducted, on average, within six weeks after birth). In addition to providing childbirth education tuition, we offered incentive payments for each assessment (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;$40 USD; T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;$50 USD; T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;$60 USD), gradually increasing the amount offered to minimize study attrition. Data collection for this study was completed in 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The mind in labor (MIL): working with pain in childbirth</title><p>MIL is a brief intervention for pregnant women and their partners specifically designed to target labor-related fear and pain by teaching tailored mindfulness-based coping strategies. It is a childbirth-specific, short form of the nine-week Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting program (MBCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] adapted starting in 1998 from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The MIL course is delivered by professionally certified MBCP instructors and it is held over one weekend (Friday evening and all day Saturday and Sunday) for a total of 18&#x000a0;h of mindfulness training. Mindfulness strategies for coping with labor-related pain and fear are taught through interactive, experiential activities, with periods of didactic instruction.</p><p>In addition to standard childbirth preparation topics (i.e. birth physiology), the MIL program includes the following aims and learning objectives: 1) participants are guided to reframe childbirth pain as unpleasant physical sensations that come and go, moment by moment; 2) participants are taught how to uncouple the sensory component of pain from its cognitive and affective components, with the objective of decreasing fear and suffering related to the physical pain of childbirth; 3) participants learn how to be more aware of their own body and fearful reactivity to pain by practicing mindful coping with pain through a pain induction activity with ice; 4) pregnant women and their birth partners develop personalized strategies to best cope interpersonally and provide support to each other throughout the birth process.</p><p>To meet these objectives, instruction in formal mindfulness meditation are given during the workshop, including body scan, mindful movement/yoga, sitting and walking meditation, and mindful eating, as well as activities of daily living and pain coping strategies, such as mindfulness of breath, partner touch, body movement, and &#x0201c;sounding&#x0201d; (using low and/or loud vocal tones during periods of intense physical sensation). Additionally there is an inquiry practice between partners exploring fear in general and fear of childbirth in particular and specific mindfulness coping strategies for being with pain with an attitude of acceptance. Participants are provided with handouts and guided audio materials for optional practicing of mindfulness meditation and pain coping strategies at home. In the current study, the course developer (NB), a senior mindfulness teacher and certified nurse midwife, provided facilitation for all MIL intervention participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Active control condition: treatment as usual (TAU) standard childbirth education</title><p>Participants assigned to the TAU control condition were provided with a list of study-approved childbirth courses of comparable length and quality to the MIL intervention, but without any mindfulness meditation, mindful movement/yoga, or other core mind/body component (e.g., hypnosis). To form the approved list, we conducted a web search of available San Francisco Bay Area childbirth preparation courses then followed up with direct contact with providers&#x000a0;to determine specific content regarding any topics related to mind/body health or stress reduction. If a control group participant could not find a pre-approved course convenient to their location and schedule, we offered to screen their preferred course. In this way, our list of approved courses grew as participants informed us of additional childbirth preparation programs. TAU control participants were strongly encouraged to participate in the control childbirth education with a partner or support&#x000a0;person, just as with MIL.

Childbirth education is the primary mechanism by which pregnant women learn strategies for coping with pain in labor, yet in its standard form it may fail to reduce fear of childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We found that participation in the MIL, a short, time-intensive weekend workshop form of childbirth education that incorporates mindfulness can lead to significant increases in childbirth self-efficacy not found through participation in standard childbirth education programs. These results are consistent with a single-arm trial conducted of a Mindfulness-Based Childbirth Education course in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] in which participants experienced large improvements in childbirth self-efficacy and fear of childbirth. Approaching labor with a greater sense of self-efficacy may help prevent an array of undesired outcomes in the intrapartum period that were beyond the scope of this small RCT, but that have been documented in prior research (e.g., emergency Cesarean).</p><p>While recent advances in labor pain management through medication have been necessary and appropriate, mindfulness interventions offer a promising and potentially appealing, evidence-based, complementary approach that can equip the laboring woman to more accurately appraise her ability to face labor pain, more effectively cope with that pain, and make better reasoned choices about the medical options available to her during birth. We saw no reduction in epidural rate or retrospective reports of perceived pain during labor, but there was a trend toward lower use of opioid analgesia during labor. The systemic opioids commonly used for labor analgesia have side effects that can negatively impact the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], thus a lower rate of opioid analgesia is highly desirable. The trend we found toward this outcome may be a result of better labor pain coping among the MIL participants, however we were unable to collect real-time data from the labor experience to examine this potential mechanism. In their meta-analysis of 48 published RCTs, Bricker and Lavender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] report that only 15% included data for opioid safety outcomes. Their review of observational studies highlights the potential for opioids to cause adverse effects in newborns and indicates some data are available that link fetal exposure to opioids during labor with risk of addictive and self-destructive behaviors later in life. MIL offers a childbirth preparation approach to complement pharmacologic strategies for labor pain management that have variable efficacy, can produce potentially harmful side effects, and may be undesirable for some women.</p><p>Notably, we found a reduction in depression symptoms that was maintained at postpartum follow-up in the MIL condition whereas the TAU control group experienced a rise in depression symptoms postpartum. Nationally in the U.S., approximately 14% of women experience postpartum depression (PPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], a condition linked with enduring risks to healthy child development extending into adolescence. A robust literature documents the negative impact of PPD on the quality of mother-infant interaction, with studies showing less reciprocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and more intrusive, hostile, disengaged, and withdrawn behavior among mothers with PPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Many women who experience PPD have also been depressed during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], indicating the benefit of antenatal intervention to prevent PPD as we saw here. Others have developed indicated approaches to managing women&#x02019;s depression in pregnancy, e.g., with Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy-Perinatal Depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] which is promising; our universal prevention approach in the form of childbirth education may reach a broader audience among the general public, reaching women at-risk for PPD who do not self-identify in that way. MIL also includes fathers/partners, which may produce benefit for preventing fathers&#x02019; postpartum depression (something not assessed in the current study) but a growing concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>In addition to showing beneficial improvements in childbirth self-efficacy and depression, this study demonstrated feasibility of online/telephone screening and retention of a diverse sample of pregnant women in an RCT of MIL. There was considerable interest in trial participation and even with rigorous RCT inclusion/exclusion criteria that screened out numerous potential participants, we achieved our target sample in the desired time frame. In terms of retention, only three participants left the study before randomization and we had 100% retention from randomization to postpartum follow-up and missing data on only two participants post-course. In informal reports made to the MIL facilitator and the study project manager, participants generally liked the format of a weekend workshop that allowed them to complete their childbirth education all at once versus needing to complete a multi-week course while facing competing demands due to weekday work schedules and other commitments involved in preparing to become new parents.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our assessment of labor pain was substantially constrained by the limitations of postpartum retrospective report, so it is possible that an ecological momentary assessment protocol during labor may reveal benefits for pain tolerance or sensitivity. The high rate of epidural use further limited the utility of the pain ratings. Since poor data quality regarding length of labor in the medical records prevented us from examining that key potential covariate, we also cannot be sure that the somewhat lower use of opioid analgesia was due to the mindfulness training. However, the use of an active comparison condition in an RCT design suggests the encouraging results on this outcome should be further tested. As with any small pilot study, we were underpowered to detect some of our hypothesized effects and thus we will aim to conduct a fully powered trial in the future.</p><p>In examining self-reports of general dispositional mindfulness and mindful body awareness, we saw significant improvements in body awareness but not dispositional mindfulness. The subfacets of mindful body awareness fit much more closely with the logic model for the MIL intervention involving developing mindfulness of bodily sensations. In contrast, it was improbable that we would see an improvement in self-report dispositional mindfulness in a program that did not emphasize development of a formal daily meditation practice. We will aim to more thoroughly investigate these potential mechanisms and other hypothesized secondary outcomes of the PEARLS study in future work.</p><p>In this rigorous pilot efficacy study, we employed the intervention developer to deliver the MIL to all intervention condition study participants. While ensuring the high quality of the intervention delivery in the current study, this strategy may pose concerns about future potential for taking MIL to scale. Following expansion and replication of the current findings, we strongly support lines of inquiry that will tackle questions in mindfulness research regarding the attributes, training, and skills needed to effectively teach mindfulness-based programs with potential for public health benefit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have developed a novel approach to fostering adaptive appraisals of childbirth and reducing perinatal depression symptoms using a mindfulness approach. Although a more definitive trial is warranted, the results of this small RCT suggest that by positively impacting labor and birth processes, while also promoting healthy psychological adjustment in the perinatal period, better postpartum outcomes can be expected. We also successfully recruited and retained a more socieconomically and ethnically diverse study sample than is&#x000a0;often found in mindfulness trials in the U.S., suggesting potential for generalization of findings and receptivity to the intervention approach as offered in MIL. If the efficacy of MIL is further supported in a full-scale trial, we believe it can be offered as a universal prevention program designed to reduce childbirth fear and improve adjustment across the perinatal and postpartum periods, reduce pain medication use in labor, and prevent postpartum depression. Intervening in this sensitive period of developmental plasticity may produce important long-term health benefits for children and families.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBSEI</term><def><p>Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CES-D</term><def><p>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFMQ</term><def><p>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIPAA</term><def><p>Health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAIA</term><def><p>Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBCP</term><def><p>Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBSR</term><def><p>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIL</term><def><p>Mind in Labor: Working with Pain in Childbirth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p>Pain Catastrophizing Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPD</term><def><p>Postpartum depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>Risk ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T1</term><def><p>Time 1 (baseline/pre-intervention/pre-test)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2</term><def><p>Time 2 (post-intervention but pre-birth)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T3</term><def><p>Time 3 (post-birth/postpartum follow-up)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCSF</term><def><p>University of California, San Francisco</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>United States</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>W-DEQ</term><def><p>Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Frederick Hecht and the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine for support of the PEARLS Study.
