The delayed matching-to-sample (dMTS) task is another WM task, which in turn involves the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of stimulus representations in sequential order. Because both n-back and dMTS engage WM function, we hypothesized that compared to a control task not taxing WM, training on the n-back task would be associated with better performance on dMTS by virtue of training a shared mental capacity. We tested this hypothesis by randomly assigning subjects (<italic>N</italic> = 43) to train on either the n-back (including 2-back and 3-back levels) or an active control task. Following training, dMTS was administered in the fMRI scanner. The n-back group performed marginally better than the active control group on dMTS. In addition, although the n-back group improved more on the less difficult 2-back level than the more difficult 3-back level across training sessions, it was improvement on the 3-back level that accounted for 21% of the variance in dMTS performance. For the control group, improvement in training across sessions was unrelated to dMTS performance. At the neural level, greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum distinguished the n-back group from the control group in the maintenance phase of dMTS. Degree of improvement on the 3-back level across training sessions was correlated with activation in right lateral prefrontal and motor cortices in the maintenance phase of dMTS. Our results suggest that although n-back training is more likely to improve performance in easier blocks, it is improvement in more difficult blocks that is predictive of performance on a target task drawing on WM. In addition, the extent to which training on a task can transfer to another task is likely due to the engagement of shared cognitive capacities and underlying neural substrates&#x02014;in this case WM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>n-back</kwd><kwd>cognitive training</kwd><kwd>delayed matching-to-sample</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Working memory (WM) can be defined as &#x0201c;a multicomponent system for active maintenance of information in the face of ongoing processing and/or distraction&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Conway et al., 2005</xref>, p. 770). Recently, there has been great theoretical and applied interest in the prospects of WM training for improving cognition. This interest stems from the possibility that improvements in WM performance as a function of training might be transferable to other mental activities similarly drawing on WM capacity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Klingberg, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Chein, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Buschkuehl et al., 2012</xref>). Although there is evidence to show that WM training can produce improvements in verbal as well as visuospatial WM, reliable evidence regarding far transfer to untrained tasks is presently lacking (for review see <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Melby-Lerv&#x000e5;g and Hulme, 2013</xref>).</p><p>An important factor that might affect transfer is the goodness-of-fit between the specific capacity enhanced during training and the cognitive requirements of the untrained activity. For example, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al. (2013)</xref> showed that training on simple and complex WM span tasks led to improved performance on similar tasks (i.e., reading span and rotation span), despite the use of material with different surface features. Thus, structural and functional similarities between the trained and untrained tasks (e.g., both necessitate the suppression of distractors) appear to increase likelihood of transfer. The same conclusion can be drawn from the study conducted by <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dahlin et al. (2008)</xref> who demonstrated transfer to a test of WM (i.e., letter memory) after 5 weeks of training in a specific aspect of WM&#x02014;updating. The control group did not receive any training or specific activity. Importantly, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers were also able to determine that the transfer effect was based on a joint training-related increase in brain activation in the trained and target tasks in the striatum. No transfer was observed to the Stroop task&#x02014;a task that does not involve updating, and does not typically engage the striatum. <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dahlin et al.&#x02019;s (2008)</xref> results suggest that to obtain transfer, it is necessary to train specific aspects of WM (e.g., updating) that are functionally shared by the trained and target tasks. In turn, likelihood of transfer is increased to the extent that training-related changes in neural function occur in the same brain region recruited in relation to the trained process (e.g., updating) in both tasks.</p><p>Consistent with these process-specific findings, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Salminen et al. (2012)</xref> examined transfer effects from WM training to executive functions. Importantly, they mapped particular cognitive processes engaged by their WM training task (i.e., dual n-back) to four aspects of executive functions, and measured transfer effects separately for each of those four processes: updating, coordination of concurrent performance, task switching, and attention. Their results demonstrated transfer from WM training to all aspects of executive function except coordination of concurrent performance, which the authors attributed to a &#x0201c;lack of commonalities&#x0201d; between the trained and target tasks (e.g., differences in the extent to which speeded processing was necessary for optimal performance). <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Salminen et al.&#x02019;s (2012)</xref> results reinforce the notion that transfer effects depend on specific cognitive processes shared by the WM training and target tasks (see also <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Karbach and Kray, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sprenger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Salminen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Building on the idea that shared capacities increase the likelihood of transfer of training, we conducted a study to test the hypothesis that training on one WM task would be more strongly associated with better performance on another WM task than training on a task that does not tax WM function. Our training task consisted of the n-back task&#x02014;one of the most commonly used tasks to assess WM performance in the cognitive neuroscience literature (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Engle, 2002</xref>). The n-back task requires that participants decide, on a trial-by-trial basis, whether a stimulus presented in the current trial matches a target stimulus presented a specific number of trials earlier in the sequence. The letter <italic>n</italic> denotes the specific number of trials that separate the current trial from the target trial. This task necessitates both maintenance and updating of dynamic rehearsal sets during performance (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, participants in the active control group completed the 4-choice reaction time (RT) task (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dollins et al., 1993</xref>), which consists of pressing one of four buttons as quickly as possible when one of four target locations on a screen is highlighted (each target being matched to a given button). This task is not hypothesized to tax WM function.</p><p>Our target WM task consisted of the delayed matching-to-sample (dMTS) task, a classic measure of short-term visual WM from the animal learning and WM literatures (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 1996</xref>). dMTS involves the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of stimulus representations in sequential order (see <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Specifically, during <italic>encoding</italic> participants memorize the stimulus, during <italic>maintenance</italic> they maintain the stimulus in WM, and during <italic>retrieval</italic> they press the button corresponding to the stimulus that matches the stimulus presented during <italic>encoding</italic>. Importantly, both n-back and dMTS are considered to be WM tasks (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Rottschy et al., 2012</xref>), although as noted above they include different sub-processes. An analysis of n-back and dMTS demonstrates that both engage the maintenance function of WM. Specifically, the n-back task necessitates that stimuli be maintained in WM across presentations so that decisions (match vs. no match) can be made. In turn, in dMTS a stimulus must be maintained for specific delay durations in WM to enable subsequent recognition among the available candidates. We therefore hypothesized that training the maintenance function of WM during n-back would confer an advantage to dMTS performance by virtue of influencing its maintenance phase, because that phase necessitates the maintenance of visual representations in WM.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Trial structure of dMTS</bold>. dMTS, delayed Matching-to-Sample Task. Participants completed 40 trials of identical structure. During <italic>encoding</italic> participants memorized the stimulus. During <italic>maintenance</italic> participants maintained the stimulus in working memory. During <italic>retrieval</italic> participants pressed the button corresponding to the stimulus (left, right) that matched the stimulus presented during <italic>encoding</italic>. The location (left, right) of the matching stimulus was counterbalanced across trials. The ITI varied randomly between 4,000 and 6,000 ms. ITI, inter-trial interval. Arrow indicates direction of trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnsys-09-00086-g001"/></fig><p>Importantly, n-back training could also impact the encoding and/or retrieval phases of dMTS because both tasks likely share those sub-processes beyond maintenance alone. For example, although there are explicit and compartmentalized encoding and maintenance phases within dMTS, the updating function inherent in the n-back very likely requires the encoding of memory representations as well as their retrieval for making matching decisions.</p><p>In order to pinpoint the locus of transfer-related brain activity, we used fMRI to determine the phase within dMTS wherein activation would distinguish the experimental and control groups. Specifically, if as hypothesized training on the n-back task were to confer an advantage to dMTS performance by virtue of improving the maintenance function within WM, then one should observe a neural difference between the two groups in the maintenance phase. Furthermore, the differences between the two groups during the maintenance phase should be apparent in regions known to underlie delay-period maintenance in visual WM, including primarily the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC; BAs 9, 44, 45, and 47), the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and adjacent parietal regions (see <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">de Zubicaray et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ranganath et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with the idea that training on the n-back could also be related to variation in brain function in the encoding and retrieval phases of dMTS, we also compared the effect of training (i.e., n-back vs. 4-choice RT) within those two phases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Our protocol was approved by Defence Research and Development Canada&#x02019;s Human Research Ethics Committee.

Each session consisted of four blocks&#x02014;two blocks of 2-back and two blocks of 3-back&#x02014;administered in alternating order and always starting with 2-back. The stimuli in our variant of the n-back were letters. No vowels were used in the task, and we only used a subset of consonants (X, G, H, K, P, Q, S, and W). We did not control for interference lures. Each block contained 150 trials. On 50 trials within each block the presented letter matched the target letter presented two or three positions earlier in the sequence (depending on the block), whereas on the remaining 100 trials it did not. Each letter was presented for 500 ms. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was a blank screen presented for 2500 ms.

We selected this task to control for task engagement not involving a WM task. Participants completed 420 trials per session.

For functional imaging, T2<sup>&#x02217;</sup>-weighted gradient echo spiral-in/out acquisitions were used to produce 26 contiguous 5 mm thick axial slices [repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; flip angle (FA) = 70&#x000b0;; field of view (FOV) = 200 mm; 64 &#x000d7; 64 matrix; voxel dimensions = 3.1 mm &#x000d7; 3.1 mm &#x000d7; 5.0 mm], positioned to cover the whole brain.

All functional volumes were spatially realigned to the first volume. A mean image created from realigned volumes was spatially normalized to the MNI EPI brain template using non-linear basis functions. The derived spatial transformation was applied to the realigned T2<sup>&#x02217;</sup> volumes, and spatially smoothed with an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. Time series across each voxel were high-pass filtered with a cut-off of 128 s, using cosine functions to remove section-specific low frequency drifts in the BOLD signal. Condition effects at each voxel were estimated according to the GLM and regionally specific effects compared using linear contrasts. The BOLD signal was modeled as a box-car, convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function.</p><p>We applied a combination of voxel-height and cluster extent correction for multiple comparisons using AlphaSim (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/manual/AlphaSim.pdf">http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/manual/AlphaSim.pdf</ext-link>) incorporated in REST (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas originally AlphaSim was developed for use within the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) software (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cox, 1996</xref>), REST enables one to conduct the same analysis on a Windows platform using SPM masks. AlphaSim takes into account the size of the search space and the estimated smoothness, and using Monte Carlo simulations generates probability estimates of a random field of noise, producing a cluster of voxels of a given size for a set of voxels passing a given voxel-wise <italic>p</italic>-value threshold.

Our results demonstrated that there was no relationship between brain activation and RT<sub>difference</sub> during encoding, maintenance or the retrieval phase.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The n-back group performed marginally better than the active control group on dMTS, registering a medium effect size (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Importantly, although participants in the experimental condition were more likely to exhibit improvement across the three training sessions in the 2-back level than the 3-back level (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>), it was their degree of improvement in the 3-back level that predicted variation in dMTS performance, accounting for 21% of the observed variance in dMTS performance (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>). Critically, degree of improvement in the 4-choice RT task in the control condition was unrelated to dMTS performance or its neural correlates, despite the fact that both are visuospatial tasks. These results demonstrate a dissociation between how training-related improvement in a WM task vs. a non-WM task is related to a target WM task. More specifically, they suggest that although performance on relatively easier levels of n-back is more likely to improve within three brief practice sessions, it is improvement in the more difficult levels that is more likely to be positively related to performance on target tasks drawing on the same capacity.</p><p>In addition, the neural difference between the two groups was only apparent during the maintenance phase of dMTS, and localized to the left IFG, right PPC and the cerebellum. Sustained activation in the PFC has been related to maintenance in memory (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fuster, 1991</xref>). Indeed, IFG activation has been shown to be involved in the maintenance phase of the delayed non-matching-to-sample task (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">de Zubicaray et al., 2001</xref>). This is consistent with the involvement of the ventrolateral regions of the left PFC in delay-period maintenance in visual WM tasks (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ranganath et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, posterior parietal regions have been shown to contribute to various aspects of visual short-term mnemonic function including maintenance (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Munk et al., 2002</xref>) and active maintenance of information in WM (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>). In fact, PPC activity has been shown to predict individual differences in visual short-term memory capacity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Todd and Marois, 2005</xref>; see also <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Todd and Marois, 2004</xref>). Our neural results suggest that the effects of n-back training on transfer-related brain function in dMTS are likely to be observed in regions that underlie capacities enhanced during training, and subsequently recruited by the untrained task. Our behavioral task analysis had led us to believe that n-back training would likely benefit dMTS performance because both tasks tax the maintenance function in WM, among others. Our neural results are generally consistent with this idea, although further experimentation is needed to determine that the regions distinguishing the two groups during maintenance indeed underlie transfer from n-back to dMTS.</p><p>Because training-related improvement in 3-back predicted dMTS performance (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>), we explored this effect at the neural level. Our results revealed that during the maintenance phase of dMTS, brain activation in right lateral PFC and motor cortex covaried with training-related improvement in 3-back (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). This region of the lateral PFC corresponds to Brodmann Area 44, and has been shown to be involved in both the storage and manipulation aspects of WM (see <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Wager and Smith, 2003</xref>). Our results suggest that this region is sensitive to training-related changes in relation to 3-back, and could be a region shared by both the n-back and dMTS for maintenance in WM.</p><p>In addition, although behaviourally training-related improvement in 2-back was unrelated to dMTS performance, our analyses of fMRI data demonstrated that during the maintenance phase of dMTS brain activation in a distributed network including the middle frontal gyrus, lateral PFC, superior parietal lobule, cingulate, extrastriate cortex, and the cerebellum covaried with training-related improvement in 2-back (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). Within this network, the frontal and parietal regions represent well-established nodes in the fronto-parietal WM network (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02018;Esposito, 2008</xref>). Although these results demonstrate that brain activation during the maintenance phase of dMTS was modulated by the degree of training-related improvement in 2-back, care must be exercised in interpreting this finding given the absence of a corresponding behavioral effect (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>).</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our results must be considered preliminary because our study had a number of limitations. First, our design involved randomly assigning participants to two treatment conditions, and subsequently measuring differences between the two groups on an outcome measure (i.e., dMTS) following training. As such, our results are correlational, and we cannot draw causal inferences. In addition, although the degree of training-related improvement in 3-back predicted and accounted for 21% of the variance in dMTS performance (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>), gain data alone cannot be used as evidence for inferring transfer effects (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Tidwell et al., 2014</xref>). Rather, there is reason to further explore the possibility of a causal link between n-back training and performance on other WM tasks, including dMTS.</p><p>Second, our active control condition was meant to control for task engagement only&#x02014;defined by identical frequency and duration of training. Although in WM training studies active control conditions are preferable to passive control conditions (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Shipstead et al., 2010</xref>), it would be better still to include both types of control conditions in a given design. Particularly desirable would be to use control conditions that enable one to isolate specific components of training that are believed to be related to transfer to dMTS performance (e.g., updating, maintenance, etc.). The present results lay the groundwork for implementing such a design feature in future studies, perhaps comparing different types of WM training that tax different aspects of WM function.</p><p>Third, although the durations and frequencies of training sessions in WM training studies have ranged greatly in the past, ranging from one 20- or 30-min session to 20 h spread over 10 weeks (see <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Buschkuehl et al., 2012</xref>, Table 1; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Klingberg, 2010</xref>, Table 2), our WM training intervention was relatively short and involved a non-adaptive WM task. Future studies would benefit from implementing an adaptive WM task, possibly administered in the context of more frequent training sessions.</p><p>Fourth, it is likely that there was a ceiling effect associated with our outcome measure (dMTS). In turn, this might have made it more difficult to observe differences between the two training conditions on this task, given that there was less room for improvement. There are at least two ways to increase the difficulty level on dMTS. First, on each trial we used a stimulus consisting of a 4 &#x000d7; 4 matrix (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Doubling the matrix dimensions (i.e., 8 &#x000d7; 8) reduces average accuracy rates to around 70% (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>). Second, whereas we used a fixed delay period, dMTS paradigms can incorporate variable delay periods. This will enable one to analyze differences in performance as a function of varying delay periods. These modifications can be incorporated in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrated that a group training on the n-back task performed marginally better than an active control group on dMTS. Although the n-back group improved more on 2-back than 3-back across three training sessions, it was improvement in 3-back that predicted and accounted for 21% of the variance in dMTS performance. There was no relationship between training-related gains and dMTS performance in the control group. At the neural level, the n-back group exhibited greater activation in the left IFG, right PPC and the cerebellum during the maintenance phase within dMTS. In addition, degree of improvement in 3-back covaried with brain activation in the right lateral prefrontal and motor cortices during the maintenance phase of dMTS, as did the degree of improvement in 2-back and activation in a distributed network including fronto-parietal WM nodes. In contrast, in the control group no relationship was observed between degree of improvement on the 4-choice RT task and dMTS performance. Combined, our results suggest that n-back training is more closely associated with dMTS performance than training on a task that does not tax WM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ruby Endre, Garry Detzler and Fred Tam for assistance with data collection, and Chao-Gan Yan for help with running AlphaSim in REST.
