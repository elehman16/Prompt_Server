Exercise-referral schemes have emerged as one effective approach to promote PA; however, there is uncertainty about the feasibility and effectiveness of these schemes in settings outside high-income countries.

Four PHCU were selected for the study; the PHCU will take part as the unit of randomization and sedentary hypertensive patients as the unit of assessment. 2 PHCU of control group (GC) will provide information to hypertensive patients about physical activity benefits and ways to increase it safely. 2 PHCU of intervention group (IG) will refer patients to sports facilities at the same institution, to follow a group-based PA program developed to increase the PA levels with a designed based on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory. To evaluate the effects of the intervention as well as short-term maintenance of the intervention&#x02019;s effects, PA will be assessed at baseline, at 24 and 32 weeks of follow-up.</p><p>The main outcome will be the difference before and after intervention in the percentage of participants meeting recommended levels of PA between and within intervention and control groups.

However, a large proportion of the world population fails to meet current global physical activity recommendations (at least 150&#x000a0;minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA/week) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In 2010 the global prevalence of inactivity was estimated at 32%, and as much as 40% of the population in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In Mexico, the prevalence of physical inactivity has increased 6%, from 13.4% to 19.4% in only six years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Globally, the magnitude of the physical inactivity problem is worse in poorer regions of the world. For example, until 80% of mortality due to NCD&#x02019;s and physical inactivity occurs in lower-middle income countries.<sup>7</sup> As part of the strategies developed to prevent and control NCDs, Mexico&#x02019;s Social Security Institution (MSSI), which covers 49.2% of the Mexican population, is providing comprehensive health care and referrals for PA programs for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, 16.8% are physical inactive and in a whole 83% of do not meet PA recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Increasing physical activity to recommended levels would help eliminate 6% to 10% of the major Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Physical inactivity contributes to and aggravates NCDs like hypertension (HTN), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] which constitutes the leading cause of NCD visits at the MSSI, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the proportion of newly diagnosed MSSI patients with HTN has increased by 30% in only five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Complications associated with HTN consume between 6 and 8% of the total health care expenditure of the Mexican health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Adding physical activity to the HTN medical treatment paradigm for HTN can help control blood pressure, reduce mortality and complications and help curb the health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The Primary Health Care (PHC) setting has been identified as a base for PA-promotion strategies since it is a point of contact with hypertensive patients, and since basing interventions there would facilitate the continuity of care and integration of multiple disciplines into treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PHC physicians have been seen as source of health promotion and powerful agents for physical activity promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, through the years strategies focusing exclusively on physician involvement have had little success. Insufficient health promotion training, lack of time of medical consultation, and lack of physician confidence that their recommendations for healthy lifestyles are useful for patients, has been the aim barriers to achieve it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, it appears that PA counseling and PHC-based PA-referral schemes as an inclusive strategy utilizing available staff and facility resources to help people to become physically active might function better in this settings, since both have proven effective in helping inactive people to meet PA recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Systematic reviews of exercise-referral schemes demonstrate that challenges remain in terms of increasing patients&#x02019; acceptance of and adherence to PA programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However the results of these studies are from high-income countries, and little is known about effective ways to increase PA in countries with different income levels. These lower income countries are the focus of only 10% of the global research but house 90% of the world&#x02019;s population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. If lifestyle changes such as increasing PA practice are to be implemented worldwide, it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying the behavior of diverse populations.</p><p>In the context of studies about effectiveness of PA-referral schemes, to date there is lack of proven evidence of its effectiveness with objective outcome measures of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], since interventions&#x02019; effects have been documented exclusively by self-report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, this study will estimate the effectiveness of PA referral scheme with an objective PA assessment. This will be the first study of PA-referral scheme for chronically ill patients in the Mexican Health System.</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an MSSI PHC-based physician to a PA- referral scheme designed to help chronically ill patients to increase PA, in order to perform recommended levels of PA (150&#x000a0;minutes at week of moderate to vigorous intensity).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The Mexican Social Security Institute (MSSI) includes offices for primary, secondary and tertiary health services as well as facilities designed to develop PA programs (sports fields, gyms, pools and outdoor spaces for PA) called Social Security Centers (SCC). The SCC have specialized staff to guide and assist on promotion and practice PA in all potential participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and recruitment process</title><p>This is a cluster randomized trial, with the primary health care unit (PHCU) as the unit of randomization and hypertensive patients as the unit of assessment, to evaluate the impact of a PA-referral scheme to help patients increase their PA levels and meet recommended PA guidelines. Four MSSI PHCU facilities will be assigned in a randomized way to intervention (2 PHCUs) and control groups (2 PHCUs). In all PHCUs, primary care physicians will identify hypertensive patients based on the following criteria: women and men with MSSI affiliation, between 35 and 70&#x000a0;years old, less than 5&#x000a0;years from hypertension diagnosis and/or without pharmacological treatment self-reporting willingness to engage in a PA program but currently not meeting PA recommendations (&#x0003c;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity PA). Using a standardized protocol, physicians will quickly screen for these criteria and will refer eligible patients to the study suite, located in the same PHCU facility. Trained staff will verify that potential participants meet the inclusion criteria described below, to confirm that they can safely engage in the PA program.</p><p>Inclusion criteria:</p><p>a) Adults between 35 and 70&#x000a0;years old; b) both sexes; c) patients with hypertension diagnosis within five years or less and/or without pharmacological therapy for hypertension (according with JNC 7 criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; d) Not meeting PA recommendations (&#x0003c;150&#x000a0;minutes at week of moderate or vigorous intensity), as measured with the short-form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; e) currently in the contemplation or preparation stage for PA, according to Transtheoretical model of behavioural change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; f) low to moderate level of cardiovascular risk, according to the Guidelines for exercise testing and recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

The program will be conducted and supervised by trained staff with experience in handling groups of patients with chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension; therefore, only typical embodiments of exercise like dancing, supervised walking and swimming will be included.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p>Patients in the IG, will be invited for following activities during the first three sessions of the PA program at the SCC:</p><p>1) Select and enroll in their PA group. Each group will start with a minimum of 5 patients and a maximum of 20. Therefore, between 6 and 8 new groups may open during the intervention, depending on the flow of participants. Patient groups were organized based on personal preferences of exercise and for patients with joint or bone problems, swimming will be recommended.</p><p>2) During the first session, MSSI staff trained in guiding the PA program will administer the functional capacity test, to personalize the PA prescription and determine the PA intensity each patient will be instructed to exercise at the start of the program. PA intensity will be increased gradually, depending on patient characteristics and training progression for each patient. PA prescription will start at 55% of the patient&#x02019;s maximum heart rate (MHR), and gradually increase to 75% of MHR to enhance safety and efficacy. The trained staff will instruct patients how to monitor their heart rate before, during and after PA sessions and to be alert to fluctuations outside the ranges. A general description of the PA program progression follows.</p><p><bold>Level 1 or induction:</bold> between the initial 4 to 6&#x000a0;weeks, during which the patients will adopt a regular exercise habit.</p><p><bold>Level 2 or development:</bold> during weeks 7 to 12 in which there will be a gradual increase in exercise volume (duration and intensity) every 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p><bold>Level 3 or maintenance:</bold> beginning at the 13th week, when the patient has started to reach an improved level of functional capacity and exercise tolerance, allowing him or her to maintain the same routine in duration and intensity during group-based exercise classes, while improving free-living and other recreational PA as part of their lifestyle sessions the following weeks.</p><p>3) The group-based PA sessions will consist of three stages: warm-up, predominantly aerobic exercise, and recovery.

Our sample size estimation is based on the aim to increase from 17% to 37% the proportion of patients meeting PA standards. To detect a PA difference of 20% in this population, with a power of 90%, and a level of significance of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, 68 patients are required in each group (IG and CG). Considering that patients involved in this type of research have high dropout rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], to achieve these 68 participants we will increase our initial estimates of sample size by 40%.

Now more than ever, these countries require evidence of locally-effective strategies that can help increase activity levels by meeting population-specific needs, which will reduce the impact of non-communicable disease on national health systems.</p><p>Community-based PA promotion programs have been developed in Latin American over the past few years. Results of systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] show that several countries, including Brazil, have carried out PA promotions in community and school settings with encouraging results. In addition, projects like GUIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] (Guide for Useful Interventions in Brazil and Latin America) facilitate PA promotion by helping to translate research findings into practice.</p><p>However, integrated community-based and clinical approaches are also needed will be needed to reducing physical inactivity in specific populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. PHC-based strategies have gained acceptance particularly among clinical populations with high levels of non-communicable disease risk factors, because they target a large percentage of the population that actually uses healthcare services. Counseling and referral schemes have been proven to increase the numbers of people meeting PA recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, evidence regarding such programs is concentrated in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>The present study will explore the effectiveness of PHC-based intervention in a middle-income country setting, assessing a strategy for linking clinical and community health program areas within the same institution and determining the feasibility of this multidisciplinary program&#x02019;s approach as a potential model to replicate. We will test the effectiveness of a group program for increasing hypertensive patients&#x02019; PA engagement, feasible at the IMSS because it contains both medical and physical activity centers, making clinician referral to free PA resources possible.</p><p>Evidence from self-reports indicates that referral schemes are effective in increasing PA as measured by self-reports. Yet, information on referral programs&#x02019; influence on patient&#x02019;s PA, measured via objective method is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This study will be the first to use direct measurements of PA to show the effects of an exercise-referral scheme in real-world settings. Although we are aware of the limitations posed by the study&#x02019;s short duration, this does not compromise its utility for physical activity promotion in patients with chronic conditions.</p><p>If this intervention is found to be effective, the information could useful to optimize resources. For example, to design programs according to different stages of change, proposing differentiated actions for patients in each one of the stages, as stated in the transtheoretical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Namely, carry out actions to encourage the willingness to change for patients in pre-contemplation stages or to strengthen their physically active behavior for patients in maintenance stage.</p><p>The study population is sharing characteristics such as initially sedentary lifestyle, willingness to engage in PA, and recent hypertension diagnosis. Sharing these traits could encourage the group to develop a sense of community which would promote self-efficacy and social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], a fundamental feature of successful behavior change according to social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>To ensure the quality of this study, the clinical trial guidelines developed by the CONSORT group will be followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. We will be able to identify the number of patients at the three measurement phases of the study and conduct the analysis according to intention to treat.</p><p>Finally, this assessment of effectiveness in the real-life conditions of the IMSS health and social services facilities, will serve as a baseline for these types of intervention studies in the context of Latin America, where the ability to test the feasibility, adherence and sustainability of an exercise-referral scheme has not been explored.</p><p>While this study is an effort to try to improve participants&#x02019; health and the quality of life through PA promotion, we are aware that this kind of initiative does not address the root causes of physical inactivity.
