Novel concepts aiming to achieve sufficient analgesia while minimizing opioid-related side effects by avoiding fluctuating plasma levels are based on perioperative oral administration of extended-release opioids beginning with the first dose pre-operatively. This is the first study to evaluate analgesic efficacy and side effect rates of extended-release tapentadol compared to oxycodone/naloxone following orthopedic/trauma surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled prospective clinical trial had 2 co-primary endpoints: (1) Analgesic efficacy: Mean pain level on a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10 during exercise over 5&#x000a0;days. (2) Safety: Side effect sum score of the following events: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, sedation, vertigo, somnolence. The study was powered to detect superiority of tapentadol for at least one endpoint pending statistical proof of non-inferiority for both endpoints in a first step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Two hundred sixty-six trauma patients were randomized to receive either tapentadol (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;133) or oxycodone/naloxone (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;133). Analgesic efficacy: Mean (&#x000b1;SD) daily pain levels in the first five post-operative days were 2.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3 in both groups. Mean maximum pain intensity during exercise in the first 24&#x000a0;h after surgery was 3.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9 (tapentadol) and 3.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.1 (oxycodone/naloxone). Statistically tapentadol was non-inferior but not superior to oxycodone/naloxone. Safety: Vomiting on day 1 occurred in 11%, constipation in 35% of the tapentadol patients and in 16% and 30% of the oxycodone/naloxone patients (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.60 and 0.33), respectively. The incidence of sedation/ vertigo was &#x0003c;10%, that of somnolence &#x0003c;2% in both groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.3, respectively). The sum score of side effect events was 51% in the tapentadol vs. 49% in the oxycodone/naloxone group; risk difference 3% [95% CI, &#x02212;8 to 14%]; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6). Non-inferiority of tapentadol could not be concluded as the pre-defined non-inferiority margin was exceeded.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">With both concepts, mean maximum pain intensity during exercise within the first 24&#x000a0;h after orthopedic/trauma surgery was reduced to a score of &#x0003c;4. This analgesic efficacy came at the cost of mainly gastro-intestinal side effects. Thus, we now use a prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting and pre-emptive laxatives as part of these concepts.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">https://eudract.ema.europa.eu&#x000a0;(EudraCT- Nr. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/">2011&#x02013;003238-15</ext-link>); October 24th, 2012.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Post-operative opioid analgesia</kwd><kwd>Trauma surgery</kwd><kwd>Oral tapentadol</kwd><kwd>Oral oxycodone</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">A large prospective cohort study comparing the painfulness of 179 surgical procedures revealed that even &#x02018;minor&#x02019; operative procedures may be associated with considerable pain (mean maximum pain scores within the first 24&#x000a0;h of 6&#x02013;7 on the numeric rating scale (NRS) to 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The 40 procedures associated with the highest mean pain scores included 22 distinct orthopedic/ trauma surgery procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. So why was insufficient analgesia so common? Most participating hospitals routinely used multimodal pain concepts based on oral opioids in combination with non-opioids, but the study patients had received rather low cumulative oral opioid doses compared to studies reporting on postoperative patient-controlled i.v. (i.v. PCA) morphine administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, pain scores in musculoskeletal surgery patients may not decrease at all during the first 24&#x000a0;h after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, optimization of peri-operative analgesia regimens with respect to meeting procedure-specific opioid analgesic requirements on the one hand and minimizing opioid-related side effects on the other hand still constitutes an urgent medical need and a major clinical challenge.</p><p id="Par23">Previous studies have shown that preemptive analgesia regimens based on oral extended-release opioids (oxycodone or buprenorphine, respectively) -starting with the first dose as premedication- provided improved pain control with a lower rate of side effects compared to conventional i.v. morphine PCA in spine and orthopedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, when trauma surgery patients were treated with oxycodone, the rate of constipation was high (46%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One way of addressing this particular side effect is an oral post-operative pain regimen based on the fixed combination of oxycodone with the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Oral naloxone has a low bioavailability (&#x0003c; 3%) and, therefore, is supposed to exert its opiate antagonistic effects almost entirely in the gut to ameliorate opiate-induced bowel paralysis. However, the risk of nausea and vomiting was unaffected by naloxone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As an alternative, tapentadol, an opioid with a dual mode of action (&#x003bc;-receptor agonist/ norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) is now available for the treatment of medium to severe pain conditions. Efficacy/safety of tapentadol immediate-release (IR) in post-operative pain management have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In both acute and chronic pain, tapentadol was associated with less gastro-intestinal side effects compared to oxycodone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare an analgesic regimen based on extended-release (ER) oxycodone/naloxone (Targin&#x000ae;, Mundipharma GmbH, Germany) to a regimen based on extended-release tapentadol (Palexia&#x000ae;, Gr&#x000fc;nenthal GmbH, Germany) in trauma surgery patients with respect to (1) analgesic efficacy and (2) safety as revealed by the incidence of opioid-induced side effects (nausea, vomiting, constipation, sedation, vertigo and somnolence, respectively). The study was powered to detect superiority of tapentadol for at least one endpoint pending statistical proof of non-inferiority of tapentadol for both endpoints in a first step.</p><p id="Par24">The study design was based on equianalgesic starting doses &#x02013; either 10&#x000a0;mg oxycodone or 50&#x000a0;mg tapentadol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and study population</title><p id="Par25">This randomized controlled observer-blind prospective clinical trial was approved by the German Competent Authority (BfArM, Nr. 4,038,588) and the Ethics Committee of Hannover Medical School (Nr 5897&#x000a0;M), and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eudract.ema.europa.eu">https://eudract.ema.europa.eu</ext-link> (EudraCT number 2011&#x02013;003238-15) by Gertrud Haeseler October 2012. Principal investigator was Dirk Schaefers. The study was conducted at two hospital sites (Marien-Hospital Marl and St. Elisabeth-Krankenhaus Dorsten, later referred to as study sites 1 and 2) operated by one trust (Katholisches Klinikum Ruhrgebiet Nord GmbH, Marl, Germany) in cooperation with scientists affiliated at Hannover Medical School. Adult (&#x02265; 18&#x000a0;years) trauma surgery patients ASA I-III were enrolled after written informed consent.

Adjunctive long-acting intravenous opioids and PONV prophylaxis were at the discretion of the anesthetist and subject to secondary analysis. Risk factors for post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) like female sex, no smoking habit, anticipated post-operative opioid analgesia and history of PONV were documented.</p><p id="Par28">Post-operative pain in the recovery room was treated with intravenous piritramide and the second oral dose of study medication. The patient was observed for an hour following the second dose of study medication and discharged when he was comfortable without further opioid requirement. The cumulative dose of oral study medication (tapentadol or oxycodone/naloxone, respectively) established as effective (premedication dose plus eventual supplemental doses in the recovery room) was continued 2&#x000d7; daily on the surgical ward. Analgesia was supplemented with non-opioids dipyrone or acetaminophen, and/or a coxib, respectively, to achieve a residual pain score up to 3&#x02013;4. In case that this level of analgesia was not obtainable, a trauma surgery consultant was involved to address surgical reasons. If there were none, opioid doses were increased. The doses of coxibes were not standardized in this study as we included ASA I-III patients and had no restrictions with respect to higher age, cardio-vascular disease and /or moderately comprised renal function- which may represent contra-indications for the use of coxibes. Thus, coxibes were prescribed after individual risk/benefit-analysis.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Rescue-interventions</title><p id="Par29">

It is worth noting that mean NRS values for worst pain during exercise on the day of the operation (day 1) were &#x0003c;4 in our study in both groups- compared to 6&#x02013;7 for trauma/orthopedic surgery in the large prospective cohort study presented by Gerbershagen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">Our main hypothesis -non-inferiority of tapentadol compared to oxycodone/naloxone regarding pain during exercise- was confirmed, but neither non-inferiority of tapentadol with respect to side effect incidence nor superiority for analgesic efficacy and/ or side effect incidence could be established.</p><p id="Par81">Still, the remarkably low median level of pain at rest on day 1 in the tapentadol group seen in our study merits further attention as it has been suggested that adrenergic descending inhibitory systems might be of potential relevance in (1) attenuating remifentanil-induced post-infusion hyperalgesia and anti-analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and (2) in determining the time course of recovery from hypersensitivity after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">The lower incidence of nausea and vomiting seen in tapentadol-treated patients could in part be explained by confounding factors of PONV (patients in the tapentadol group received more frequently a prophylaxis). Due to the differing use of PONV prophylaxis we could not show superiority of tapentadol with respect to PONV in this study. It has previously been established that the prevalence of nausea and vomiting in patients requiring opioids for post-operative analgesia (i.e. that have at least one risk factor) ranges between 21 and 79% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The comparably high tolerability of both tapentadol and oxycodone/naloxone with respect to nausea and vomiting seen in our study may also be due to the extended-release formulation: The intermediate-release formulation of tapentadol was associated with an even higher incidence of nausea and vomiting (19% vomiting) when compared to oxycodone for acute post-operative pain relief after elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In trials using intravenous patient-controlled analgesia 20&#x02013;30% of patients presented with nausea and vomiting during the whole period of opiate requirement preventing patients from continuing opioid therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The observation that the extended-release formulations apparently increase tolerability reaffirm the well-established concept that opioids are more dose-effective when stable plasma concentrations can be achieved over the whole duration of the painful stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par83">Both oxycodone/naloxone and tapentadol were associated with a lower risk of constipation in trauma surgery patients compared to oxycodone without naloxone where the risk of constipation was 46% in trauma surgery patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">However, despite higher gastro-intestinal tolerability of oxycodone/naloxone and tapentadol compared to i.v. opioids or oxycodone without naloxone, the problem of opioid-induced gastro-intestinal side effects in trauma surgery patients is not yet solved. Thus, based on our results, we recommend that established principles for the prophylaxis against PONV and opioid-induced constipation are pre-emptively applied in trauma surgery patients receiving opioids. Severe central nervous side effects like somnolence and/or confusion were rare (&#x0003c; 2%) and probably unrelated to study medications as neurologic function recovered spontaneously while study medication was continued. Only in one patient receiving 20/10&#x000a0;mg daily dose of oxycodone/naloxone study medication had to be discontinued due to delirium. No patient had opioid induced respiratory depression that required reversal with iv naloxone. Anxiety, sleeplessness and agitation was only seen in patients allocated to oxycodone/naloxone- in one patient anxiety resolved when oxycodone/naloxone was discontinued, in four cases agitation and sleeplessness occurred when oxycodone/naloxone had been withdrawn. These results indicate that psychomimetic effects of oxycodone and oxycodone withdrawal might constitute a problem even during short-term use.</p><p id="Par85">The primary results on the effects of study medication were reproduced at two different study sites- despite the differences between the study sites with respect to duration of the operations and intra-operative opioid analgesic management. The fact that there was no association between sex, BMI and post-operative pain during exercise in trauma/orthopedic surgery is in accordance with a recent study showing no sex difference in post-operative pain in the joint surgery group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Non-responders</title><p id="Par86">In six /264 patients no acceptable pain relief (NRS&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;5) was provided by either treatment until day 4 or 5 of treatment duration. In three patients management has been inadequate (study medication discontinued at an early stage). In the three remaining patients, not responding to either tapentadol or oxycodone/naloxone was indicative of either a surgical problem or a wider, more complex medical issue (anxiety disorder/ neuropathic pain due to spinal stenosis) requiring particular attention by an experienced pain specialist. Thus, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], it seems important to achieve effective analgesia in the early postoperative period and continue post-operative opioid treatment only as long as the nociceptive input from the wound persists after surgery. Patients that do not get pain-free during that time should be evaluated by a specialist in pain medicine and receive specific, preferably non-opioid treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="Par87">The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of both opioid-based analgesic regimens under the conditions of daily practice in our trauma surgery departments. As a consequence, there was a considerable heterogeneity in the types of surgeries performed, even within one category (i.e. open reduction and internal fixation- radial vs. femoral fracture) which might constitute a confounding factor. The postoperative exercise protocols differed with regard to the degree of mobilization and pain intensity. Still, it is interesting to note that while joint procedures are usually predicted to have the greater post-procedural pain, the amount of morphine equivalents consumed within that surgical category was similar to all other categories. Reconstructions of ligaments and muscle like rotator cuff repair or anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were associated with the highest doses of study medication. However, the relatively small subgroup sizes limit the generalizability of these results. Another shortcoming of our study was the lack of patient blinding which might have biased the results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par88">Both the tapentadol- as well as the oxycodone/naloxone-based perioperative multimodal oral analgesia concept provided reliable post-operative pain relief with mean pain scores over five days below 2 at rest and below 3 during exercise. The most common side effects were gastro-intestinal implying that trauma surgery patients receiving opioids might benefit from a routine prophylaxis against PONV and constipation. Analgesic failure with high pain levels at the end of the observation period despite continuing opioid medication was low (&#x0003c;2%) &#x02013; and indicative of either a surgical problem or a complex pain condition independent from surgery. Severe anxiety and signs of withdrawl even after short-term use was only seen in oxycodone/naloxone- treated patients.</p><p id="Par89">This study supports the existing clinical evidence in favor of the peri-operative use of oral extended-release opioids. Severe opioid-induced side effects like respiratory depression resulting in hypoxemic brain damage or death have been shown to be almost entirely associated with parenteral routes of opioid administration or combinations of different opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For safety reasons, extended-release oral opioids should only be used in patients that have no restrictions for oral intake.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Appendix 1</title><p id="Par96">
