Introduction</title><p>Giving birth is one of the most amazing physiologic events in human life and it can be safe and pleasant in many circumstances, but in some situations it might end with known difficulties and complications for mother and her fetus. Preterm labor is one of these complications. It means regular uterine contractions with adequate frequency and intensity resulting in giving birth before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Preterm birth is the major reason of the neonatal death and it is responsible for about one third of neonatal mortality in the world [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. WHO publication mentions that each year more than 1 million babies die from complication of preterm delivery and the annual numbers of premature newborns are about 15 millions and this number is rising each year [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Based on WHO publications, UN Millennium Development Goal 4 is reduction of children mortality in two-thirds till 2015 by special attention to neonatal deaths in countries where the neonatal mortality is higher than other places. A great number of the global neonatal deaths happen in Asia [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Finding the ways to prevention of preterm birth is a very important issue for health care providers. There are a lot of modalities to achieve this goal but none of them has been introduced as the best way and the role of different methods in preventing preterm labor varies in different places.</p><p>Tocolytics are agents that can stop the uterine contraction. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) as the major tocolytic agent has been used by many medical centers as the first line therapy to inhibition of preterm labor. However, women receiving MgSO<sub>4</sub> should be closely monitored during treatment [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; also the severe pain and discomfort in injection site in case of IM administration is a problem with this item. On the other hand, some studies have mentioned that MgSO<sub>4</sub> cannot be so effective in suppression of preterm labor [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Uterine contractions are produced by the effects of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are a kind of paracrine hormones so they act where they produce. Prostaglandin producing by the decidua and fetal membranes might be one of the essential events of parturition that is followed by initiation of the uterine contraction. It seems likely that prevention of producing prostaglandins or suppression of their effects can stop preterm uterine contraction.</p><p>So in theory inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (including cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as celexib) are capable of arresting uterine contractility and they can prevent preterm birth [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Celecoxib is a sulfa nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and selective COX-2 inhibitor. It is known under the brand name Celebrex or Celebra and Onsenal used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and painful menstruation, menstrual symptoms, and so forth. Celecoxib is available by prescription in capsule form for oral use. Price of celexib significantly was less than MgSO<sub>4</sub> price.</p><p>A study was on the comparison between MgSO<sub>4</sub> and celecoxib to arrest preterm labor. Labor was arrested for 48&#x02009;h in 42 (81%) and 45 (87%) of the patients in the celecoxib and magnesium sulfate groups, respectively (p-0.298) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We<italic> aimed</italic> to use celecoxib as a cyclgenase inhibitor to suppression of preterm labor instead of magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) to prevent preterm labor.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Method</title><p>It was a single blinded randomized clinical trial study which had been done on 600 pregnant women with gestational age &#x0003e;24 weeks and &#x0003c;34 weeks; those had referred to Ahvaz Educational Hospitals from March to August 2013. Those patients had criteria for preterm labor diagnosis based on our Ob.-Gyn. textbook [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These criteria were as follows:<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>at least 4th uterine contractions during 20 minutes or 8th uterine contractions during 1 hour followed by progressive changes in the cervical dilatation and effacement,</p></list-item><list-item><p>the cervical dilatation of more than 2&#x02009;cm,</p></list-item><list-item><p>the cervical dilatation of more than 80% at the beginning.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects and they received preterm labor routine and maintenance therapy including bed rest and hydration (bolos infusion of 500 CC Ringer lactate during half and over, corticosteroid therapy) and if the uterine preterm contractions did not stop with these modalities, all patients were divided in two groups by simple random sampling; the first group has taken 4&#x02009;gr of MgSO<sub>4</sub> intravenously as loading dose and 1&#x02009;gr per hour as maintenance dose till suppuration of the uterine contractions or maximum 48 hours and in this period the patients were observed for signs of MgSO<sub>4</sub> toxicity by control of the urine output, deep tendon reflex, and respiratory rate. Fetal heart rate was checked regularly. Conditions of the uterine contractions were checked every 2 hours in 20-minute periods. Also the patients were observed for symptoms of headache; the patients' vital signs were checked as routine protocol. The second group had taken 100&#x02009;mg celecoxib (one capsule) orally every 12 hours till suppuration of the uterine contractions or for maximum duration of 48 hours. The patients in this group were checked for nausea and vomiting and skin rush and headache.</p><p>In all subjects if the uterine preterm contractions did not stop with those medications, so immediatry drug has been stopped.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1.

Discussion</title><p>About two-thirds of neonatal mortality are due to preterm birth, so preterm labor suppression is a big deal for health care providers. On the other hand decreasing childhood mortality is one of the WHO'S goals by 2015. Celecoxib as a cyclogenase inhibitor might be effective in preterm labor suppression.</p><p>A similar study has been done by Borna and Saeidi in 2007 and preterm labor was suppressed in 87% of MgSO<sub>4</sub> group and 81% of celecoxib group so their result was similar to our result. They concluded that celecoxib is as effective as MgSO<sub>4</sub> in preterm labor suppression [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In another study by McWhorter et al. in 2004 the effects of rofecoxib and MgSO<sub>4</sub> were compared with each other. They concluded that there was no difference between oral rofecoxib and intravenous magnesium sulfate in arresting preterm labor [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Another study compared safety of indomethacin and celecoxib to arrest preterm Labor. They reported that safety of short-term celecoxib in women with preterm labor was superior to indomethacin [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In this study 600 pregnant women with preterm labor criteria were randomly divided in two equal groups. MgSO<sub>4</sub> was used in one group for suppression of preterm labor and the other group took celecoxib instead of MgSO<sub>4</sub>. 80% of MgSO<sub>4</sub> group and 75% of celecoxib group showed positive response to these tocolytic agents and uterine contraction stopped at least for 48 hours and cervical dilatation and effacement did not progress in this period of time, but in this aspect; statistical calculation did not show any significant differences between two groups. In our study there were not any significant differences between cervical dilatation in two groups, but from the beginning, cervical effacement showed a significant difference between two groups; we found that although celecoxib group already had more cervical effacement, celecoxib effectiveness was as the same as MgSO<sub>4</sub> group. In this study, mean time duration for stopping the uterine contraction did not show any significant differences. Cost effectiveness of celecoxib is more reasonable than MgSO<sub>4</sub> and it can play a role in expenses reduction in health centers.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Study Limitations</title><p>We did not enroll the patients admitted at other hospitals especially private hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>6. Conclusion</title><p>Celecoxib is a good alternative for MgSO<sub>4</sub> as agents' tocolytic. Because it is cost less and there is better patient's compliance. Using Celecoxib no need for closes monitoring of the patients, and there are not invasive procedures such as injections and same effect of MgSO<sub>4</sub>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the Deputy of Research of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, and special thanks are due to participants for their participation and help during this research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>There is no conflict of interests for this study.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>World Health Organization; March of Dimes; The Partnership for Maternal</surname></name><name><surname>Newborn &#x00026; Child Health; Save the Children</surname></name></person-group><source><italic>Born Too Soon: The Global Action Report on Preterm Birth</italic></source><year>2012</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goldenberg</surname><given-names>R.
