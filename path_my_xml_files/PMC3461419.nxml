To detect a difference of 4 mm Hg Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), the individual randomization sample size has been calculated at 239 subjects per intervention arm (SD of 19.5 mm for SBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]), with a 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. Since, cluster randomization is being attempted in this study, the individual randomization sample size has to be adjusted by a design effect of 2.98 [design effect = 1+ (size of cluster -1) * Intra cluster Correlation (ICC)]. The ICC for the clusters among the Mahabubnagar district, AP, India (study site) has been calculated to be 0.02 (based on the Indian sentinel surveillance study done on a representative sample from 10 sites in India). Hence, the cluster adjusted sample size is 713 hypertensive patients (8 clusters with 125 subjects in each cluster to allow for a 20% loss to follow up) per intervention arm to detect a 4 mm Hg difference in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05. After adjusting for the coefficient of variation among the various clusters (CV = 0.25), the sample size per intervention arm is 741, i.e. a total of 8 clusters (with equal cluster size of 100 each) would be required per intervention arm.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>sample size calculations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th rowspan="2" align="center"><bold>Detectable difference in SBP between both the groups</bold></th><th colspan="4" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>80% power with an ICC of 0.02</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="4" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>90% power with an ICC of 0.02</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center"><bold>Sample size required for individual randomization per arm</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Sample size required for cluster randomization per arm (DE = 2.98)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Sample size required for cluster randomization with CV = 0.25 (DE = 3.1)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Minimum no of clusters with a cluster size of 100</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Sample size required for individual randomization per arm</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Sample size required for cluster randomization per arm (DE = 2.98)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Sample size required for cluster randomization with CV = 0.25 (DE = 3.1)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Minimum no of clusters with a cluster size of 100</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">4 mm of Hg<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">374<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1115<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1160<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">24<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">500<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1490<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1550<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">32<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">5 mm of Hg<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>239</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>713</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>741</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>16</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">320<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">954<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">992<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">20<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">6 mm of Hg</td><td align="center">166</td><td align="center">495</td><td align="center">515</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">222</td><td align="center">622</td><td align="center">689</td><td align="center">14</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>ICC</italic> = Intra Cluster correlation; <italic>DE</italic> = design effect; <italic>CV</italic> = coefficient of variation.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Randomly chosen 8 PHCs &#x02013; 4 urban and 4 rural (homogenous in age and gender distribution) for each intervention arm from a district in the State of AP, India would form the study centers.

Treatment however can be costly and health care providers are interested in both whether treatments can offer improvements in disease burden and whether they represent value for money. Economic evaluations seek to resolve this issue by producing results that can be used to inform and assist the decision maker in allocating scarce health care resources. DSS have been in place in the developed world to achieve a balance between quality and cost of chronic disease health care. To the best of the author&#x02019;s knowledge, there have been no randomized studies on DSS to enable policy makers to find out the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis (CUA) of DSS for hypertensive patients in India. The cluster randomised community trial aims to test a decision support system among Indian hypertensive patients. Most of the previous studies on decision support system have focused on physician performance, adherence and on preventive care reminders. The uniqueness of the proposed study lies in finding out the effectiveness of a decision support system on patient related outcomes.</p><p>There are no known risks attributable to DSS per se. If the participant is receiving DSS, the software assisting the Physician prompts him or her to prescribe a particular class of drug to manage and control blood pressure. If the participant is receiving the chart based algorithmic support system, the decision to start or continue a drug is entirely up to the Physician&#x02019;s judgement. The software will be developed and pilot tested and will be based on standard Indian Hypertension society guidelines (2007), which have been endorsed by the Association of Physicians of India and the Indian Cardiological Society. Adverse events that may arise due to the drugs will be monitored and any serious adverse events will be notified to the ethical committee within 24 hours. Should any serious adverse events arise the participants would be given the necessary care in the primary health care centre and if necessary will be transferred to the Rural Hospital. Substitution of the drugs causing adverse events is left to the decision of the Physician. Blood will be drawn by a qualified and an experienced phlebotomist, with due precautions. The quality of life questionnaire would be adapted from WHO BREF questionnaire which has been validated in India. Patient confidentiality will be maintained at data entry and data analysis stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This cluster randomised community trial aims to test effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis of a decision support system among Indian hypertensive patients in comparison to a chart based algorithmic support system (that will have the guidelines and lifestyle advices printed as a poster format). The utility of DSS in management of hypertension will be tested in this pilot study. Subsequent scale up of DSS and future studies of DSS in management of different domains of cardiovascular diseases are envisaged based on the results of this pilot study.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Approved by the (1) Human Biology Research Ethics Committee, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom and (2) Institutional Ethics Committee, Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, India.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>There is no conflict of interest between the funder and the authors.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RA and OHF had the idea for the study.
