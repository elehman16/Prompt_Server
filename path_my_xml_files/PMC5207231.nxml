The SMILE-2 showed that both zofenopril and lisinopril are safe and showed no significant differences in the incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) complications. In this pooled analysis of individual data of the SMILE studies, we evaluated whether the superior efficacy of zofenopril is maintained also in patients with &#x02265;1 CV risk factor (CV+, n = 2962) as compared to CV&#x02212; (n = 668). The primary study end point was set to 1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes. The risk of CV events was significantly reduced with zofenopril versus placebo either in the CV+ (&#x02212;37%; hazard ratio: 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.51&#x02013;0.78; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) or in the CV&#x02212; group (&#x02212;55%; hazard ratio: 0.45; 0.26&#x02013;0.78; <italic>P</italic> = 0.004).

The incidence of death or severe congestive heart failure during the study was 34% lower with zofenopril.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The SMILE-2 study was the first direct comparative study between 2 ACE inhibitors in post-AMI.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Overall, 1024 thrombolyzed patients with AMI were randomized to receive one or the other drug starting within 12 hours of completion of thrombolytic therapy and continuing for 6 weeks. The primary study end point was the incidence of severe hypotension, which was slightly but significantly lower with zofenopril than with lisinopril (6.7% vs. 9.8%). In this study, the 6-week mortality rate was not significantly different between the study groups. The anti-ischemic effects of zofenopril were documented in the SMILE-3 study which included 349 post-AMI patients with preserved left ventricular function.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The risk of combined occurrence of significant ST-T abnormalities on ambulatory electrocardiography, electrocardiography abnormalities or symptoms of angina during standard exercise test, recurrence of AMI, and need for revascularization procedures for angina was 44% lower under zofenopril than under placebo.</p><p>Finally, a 30% reduced risk of 1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes was observed in 365 post-AMI patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) treated with zofenopril versus 351 patients treated with ramipril, both combined with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the SMILE-4 study.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The results of the 4 SMILE studies were an important source of additional information regarding subpopulations of patients.

The selection of these patients was based on the presence of one or more of the following factors: previous angina pectoris or congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention, recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), or non&#x02013;ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with or without signs and symptoms of heart failure.</p><p>In this article, we report the results of the pooled analysis of the 4 SMILE studies in these patients at higher risk, specifically aiming at comparing the efficacy of zofenopril versus that of placebo, lisinopril, and ramipril in terms of prevention of major CV outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study Design and Population</title><p>The 4 double-blind, randomized, parallel-group SMILE studies, compared the efficacy and safety of zofenopril with that of placebo (SMILE-1 and 3),<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> lisinopril (SMILE-2),<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or ramipril (SMILE-4)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> in European men and nonpregnant women with AMI.

Treatments and randomization procedures were described in the original studies. Briefly, the first zofenopril dosing was 7.5 mg twice daily on days 1 and 2, followed by 15 mg twice daily on days 3 and 4, and 30 mg twice daily from day 5 onward. Uptitration was allowed if systolic blood pressure remained &#x0003e;100 mm Hg and if there were no signs or symptoms of hypotension. Similarly, uptitration scheme dosing was applied to lisinopril (up to 10 mg once daily) and ramipril (up to 5 mg twice daily). For all studies, duration of treatment and follow-up periods overlapped, except for the SMILE-1 Study. In this trial, the patients stopped the double-blind treatment with the study medication after 6 weeks, and continued AMI therapy with their other medications for additional 48 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Study End Point</title><p>Because all the 4 SMILE studies provided information on fatal and nonfatal CV events, the primary study end point of this retrospective analysis was set to the 1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes. The efficacy end point was calculated after weighing for the number of subjects contributing from each study. The primary objective of this post-hoc analysis was the comparison between zofenopril, placebo, and the other ACE inhibitors (lisinopril and ramipril) for the occurrence of major CV events in the 2 subgroups of patients with and in those without at least one additional CV risk factor. The presence of CV risk factors was confirmed in case of a positive medical history for at least one of the following: angina pectoris, previous AMI, congestive heart failure, coronary revascularization, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat population, made up of all randomized patients treated with at least one dose of study medication and documenting at least once the measure of the primary efficacy assessment, even in case of protocol violation or premature withdrawal from the study. To assess the study objectives, for each study subgroup (CV+ and CV&#x02212;) 3 treatment groups were considered: zofenopril-treated patients, placebo-treated patients, and those treated with the other ACE inhibitors pooled together (lisinopril or ramipril). The choice of pooling together the 2 active comparators (lisinopril and ramipril) was made to increase the size of patients in each subgroup, and thus, the power of the results. However, for exploratory reasons, the main outcomes were also computed and compared separately by the type of ACE inhibitors. The baseline characteristics and the distribution of variables in the study populations and subgroups were compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. To account for the different durations of follow-up among the 4 studies, the relative risk of CV morbidity and mortality was assessed using a time-dependent Cox regression model and corresponding survival curves were drawn. In addition, a survival analysis with log-rank (Mantel&#x02013;Cox) test was run by considering events at the time of their occurrence, without applying any missing handling procedure.</p><p>All <italic>P</italic> values are 2-sided and the minimum level of statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.

The major finding of this post-hoc study was the superior clinical efficacy of zofenopril compared with placebo and the other ACE inhibitors (in particular ramipril). The reduction of CV events at 1 year versus placebo was more marked than ramipril in CV+ and larger than that of lisinopril and ramipril in CV&#x02212; patients. Zofenopril treatment determined a longer survival time without CV events than the other ACE inhibitors in CV+ patients. The sample size reached in this pooled analysis, constituted by 2962 patients at high CV risk, notably strengthened the value of the results.</p><p>The role of ACE inhibition in post-AMI patients with 1 or more CV risk factors was extensively underpinned in several trials,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and the clinical development highlighted the different characteristics of the various ACE inhibitors. The importance of tissue selectivity among ACE inhibitors was already observed for its influence on lipophilicity, potency, binding affinity, and level of tissue retention.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Zofenopril showed significant benefits because of its distinguishing pharmacological and clinical features as an anti-ischemic drug suitable for high CV risk patients: high lipophilicity, selective cardiac ACE inhibition, antioxidant activity, and cardioprotective and vasculoprotective properties.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The antiremodelling effect after AMI of zofenopril, compared with placebo and ramipril, enables it to prevent the increase of LV mass and end-diastolic volume, altered hemodynamic parameters, wall thickness, and chamber diameter.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Moreover, the zofenopril treatment significantly reduced the postischemic contractile dysfunction of myocardium after ischemia relief.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> These hallmarks of zofenopril may contribute to explain the positive results achieved in post-AMI high CV risk patients.</p><p>The CV comorbidities or risk factors are highly prevalent in post-AMI populations, have a significant impact on patient outcomes, and several interplays among them.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thus, the knowledge of the clinical profiles of ACE inhibitors in these settings is essential. For example, congestive heart failure is frequently evident in post-AMI patients and significantly contributes to a high mortality and morbidity risk; the presence of renal dysfunction is a further negative complication increasing the 1-month and 1-year mortality and adverse cardiac events.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In an unselected population of patients with AMI, the treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant (24%) 1-year reduction of mortality in patients with a history or current signs of heart failure and a decreased by 7% of the risk of re-infarction especially in patients with ST-segment elevation AMI or LVD.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Heart failure after acute STEMI is one of the most frequent causes for rehospitalization or postdischarge death at 30 days after heart disease, chest pain, and gastrointestinal complications.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>As AMI and ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease is one of the atherosclerotic manifestations with a significant contribution to CV risk especially in the long-term. Indeed, the 5-year mortality rate caused by peripheral artery disease was showed to be lower than that by stroke but higher than AMI.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Moreover, the differences of mortality risk between patients with peripheral artery disease and AMI and patients with stroke and AMI were substantially reduced at 5 years.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In a population-based study, the patients with established peripheral artery disease who experienced AMI were at a significantly increased risk of dying during the first year after hospital discharge compared with patients without the disease.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Retrospective analysis of registries data showed that preinfarction angina pectoris was independently associated with lower 5-year mortality in patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding hypercholesterolemia, even in case of a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, post-AMI patients may still have a residual CV risk due to several types of factors: atherosclerosis, residual dyslipidemia, nonlipid factors, beyond suboptimal implementation of lifestyle therapy, and an appropriate pharmacotherapy.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In large clinical trials, ACE inhibitors largely proved to be effective and safe in post-AMI patients as cardioprotective agents against re-infarction even in patients with diabetes and nephropathy. In addition, they showed to be superior to angiotensin receptor blockers in reducing CV mortality, stroke, and new-onset congestive heart failure in high CV risk patients.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>Frequently associated with other CV risk factors, antecedent hypertension is often observed in patients with AMI and related to higher mortality and morbidity in the early and long-term after AMI.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The combination of diabetes and hypertension in patients with AMI after angioplasty showed a synergistic effect in terms of higher mid-term mortality rate compared with patients with only diabetes or hypertension.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>Acute coronary syndromes are known to alter the equilibrium between endothelial apoptosis and endothelial renewal; an in vitro study showed that ACE inhibition reduced the proapoptotic effect of serum on the endothelium and increased endothelial renewal in post-AMI patients.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Because of the progressive coronary atherosclerosis and accelerated atherosclerosis in saphenous vein grafts and the increasing population age, the number of patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft and STEMI is increasing as well. These patients perform less frequent acute reperfusion, show less favorable angiographic outcomes after primary angioplasty, and higher 90-day mortality than patients without previous coronary artery bypass graft, especially if the bypass graft is on infarct-related artery.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> In a long-term prognosis study, patients with AMI and previous coronary artery bypass surgery showed more ventricular fibrillation, heart failure, recurrent surgical reperfusion, re-infarction, and unstable angina than control patients (with AMI and without previous coronary artery bypass graft). In these patients, several independent risk factors played an important role: previous angina, diabetes and age, use of digitalis and diuretics, the combination of diabetes, and older age.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study carried on a large population of high CV risk patients after AMI, with a long-term follow-up, which deepened the favorable impact of zofenopril treatment already assessed in other subgroups of patients, and further valued the zofenopril and ACE inhibition treatment in post-AMI patients at high CV risk. Our study also confirms that control of CV risk factors reduces the progression of atherosclerosis and CV events, even under treatment with drugs known to have a favorable impact on prognosis of post-AMI patients. It also highlights the importance of achieving optimal targets for normal risk factors, as indicated in most recent guidelines for diabetes (HbA1c &#x0003c;7%), lipids (Low Density Lipoprotein &#x0003c;70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients and High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol &#x0003e;40 mg/dL in men and &#x0003e;45 mg/dL in women), blood pressure (&#x0003c;140/90 mm Hg), and smoking (total cessation).<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>The retrospective analysis of the SMILE studies, not prespecified in the protocols, represents the most important limitation of this study. The 4 SMILE studies had different treatment and observation durations, and different follow-ups, and there was heterogeneity across the patient groups regarding the eligibility to the thrombolytic therapy: nonthrombolyzed (SMILE-1), only thrombolyzed (SMILE-2 and SMILE-3), or both types of patients (SMILE-4). In addition, different study designs, end points, inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocols, preserved LV ejection fraction or the evidence of LVD, treatment with percutaneous coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft of the 4 studies may contribute to the limitations of this post-hoc analysis. Yet, the Cox regression analysis essentially adjusted the differences among the 4 studies taking into account the individual patients' data in place of the average values.</p><p>In addition, the favorable effect of zofenopril might be the results of the specific doses used. The different ACE inhibitors could have not been comparable in terms of dose response in the SMILE studies. However, all the ACE inhibitors were used at the doses proved to be effective in the large randomized trials based on the single drug components: the SMILE-1 for zofenopril,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico-3 for lisinopril,<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy Study for ramipril.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> We acknowledge that in the future direct comparative studies might be planned at higher drug doses for lisinopril or ramipril.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The high prevalence of at least one CV risk factor in patients with AMI and in the patients enrolled in the 4 SMILE studies attests the importance of an early detection and evaluation of factors that are predictive of negative prognosis in post-AMI patients. A prompt identification of the underlying CV risk factors of recurrent AMI and major CV events, and the appropriate treatment may substantially contribute to a good prognosis of high CV risk patients.</p><p>The ACE inhibitors are considered the first-line treatment of high CV risk patients by the worldwide guidelines as the most valuable secondary prevention treatment after AMI. Among the various options, the ACE inhibition carried out with zofenopril may represent an important support for guaranteeing a favorable prognosis of high CV risk patients after AMI.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by Menarini International Operations Luxembourg S.A. through an unconditional and unrestricted grant.
