However, people with stroke are not sufficiently active on return to the community after rehabilitation. We developed the Promoting Optimal Physical Exercise for Life (PROPEL) programme, which combines exercise with self-management strategies within rehabilitation to promote ongoing physical activity in the community after rehabilitation. This study aims to evaluate the effect of PROPEL on long-term participation in exercise after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. We hypothesise that individuals who complete PROPEL will be more likely to meet recommended frequency, duration and intensity of exercise compared with individuals who do not complete the programme up to 6&#x02009;months post discharge from stroke rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Individuals undergoing outpatient stroke rehabilitation at one of six hospitals will be recruited (target n=192&#x02009;total). A stepped-wedge design will be employed; that is, the PROPEL intervention (group exercise plus self-management) will be &#x02018;rolled out&#x02019; to each site at a random time within the study period. Prior to roll-out of the PROPEL intervention, sites will complete the control intervention (group aerobic exercise only). Participation in physical activity for 6&#x02009;months post discharge will be measured via activity and heart rate monitors, and standardised physical activity questionnaire. Adherence to exercise guidelines will be evaluated by (1) number of &#x02018;active minutes&#x02019; per week (from the activity monitor), (2) amount of time per week when heart rate is within a target range (ie, 55%&#x02013;80% of age-predicted maximum) and (3) amount of time per week completing &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; or &#x02018;strenuous&#x02019; physical activities (from the questionnaire). We will compare the proportion of active and inactive individuals at 6 months post intervention using mixed-model logistic regression, with fixed effects of time and phase and random effect of cluster (site).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>To date, research ethics approval has been received from five of the six sites, with conditional approval granted by the sixth site.

A typical exercise session will involve a 3&#x02013;5 min 'warm-up', 20&#x02013;30 min of aerobic exercise at a target heart rate determined from a submaximal or maximal aerobic capacity test and a 3&#x02013;5 min 'cool-down' of low-intensity exercise. The choice of exercise modality for the submaximal test and for training (eg, recumbent stepper, cycle ergometer or treadmill) will be individually prescribed based on patients' sensorimotor recovery, postural control, functional abilities and safety. Heart rate, blood pressure, rate of perceived exertion, workload and duration of training will be documented for each session. These data will be reviewed by the physiotherapist with appropriate progression of the intensity and/or duration of exercise as necessary. Participants may receive general advice to keep physically active after discharge and may receive an individualised home exercise programme, as is currently routine care at all sites. PROPEL programme (experimental): The PROPEL programme involves both group aerobic exercise (as described above) and group discussion aimed at enabling participation in exercise after discharge. Components of the PROPEL programme were developed according to the Transtheoretical Model of health behaviour change and Social Cognitive Theory. In addition to group exercise, participants will attend 1&#x000a0;hour small group discussion sessions once weekly to learn self-management skills for exercise in preparation for discharge from rehabilitation. These discussions include identifying and solving problems around barriers to exercise; understanding personal and general benefits of exercise; exploring appropriate community resources for exercise and finding individualised and realistic strategies for incorporating exercise in a regular routine. Participants will become comfortable with progressing their exercise and will set short-term and long-term goals for engaging in physical activity and exercise after discharge.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Key inclusion and exclusion criteria:</bold> Inclusion criteria: Adults with stroke who are referred to the group aerobic exercise or PROPEL programmes as part of their stroke rehabilitation.

Our secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of PROPEL on self-efficacy and outcome expectations for exercise, and barriers to exercise. We hypothesise that, compared with those who complete group aerobic exercise&#x000a0;(GAE) only, those who complete PROPEL will (1) be more likely to meet the recommended intensity and duration of self-directed physical activity in the community (ie,&#x000a0;&#x02265;150&#x02009;min/week of moderate-intensity exercise<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and (2) report higher self-efficacy and outcome expectations for exercise, and fewer barriers to community activity.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study involves a single-blind (assessor blinded), continuous recruitment short exposure, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled superiority trial (SWT).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Six sites will be involved in the study; at a randomly&#x000a0;determined time within the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>), each site will transition from the control intervention (GAE&#x000a0;only) to the experimental intervention (PROPEL).

In our pilot study,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> there was often a delay to start the group in order to have&#x000a0;&#x02265;3 people enrolled. Therefore, a study design whereby individual participants are randomly allocated to either GAE or PROPEL would be problematic as there would be even greater delays in starting the groups since twice as many people would be required to be enrolled in order to run concurrent groups. Likewise, a traditional cluster randomised controlled trial, where sites are randomly assigned to either complete GAE or PROPEL, would not be ideal due to the relatively low number of sites (6), and thus, reduced statistical power.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Therefore, the SWT is a pragmatic trial design that is suitable for evaluating interventions that are implemented routinely at the level of cluster.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> It balances the need for robust evaluation with logistic constraints in programme evaluation, particularly in cases of intersite variability.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Indeed, previous authors have argued that well-designed and executed SWTs can be as rigorous as traditional cluster randomised trials.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

The interventions will supplement, rather than replace, current practice; that is, patients will still complete their regularly&#x000a0;scheduled physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language pathology sessions, as required. However, for patients who are enrolled in the GAE or PROPEL interventions, PTs might choose not to complete individualised aerobic exercise during patients&#x02019; regularly scheduled physiotherapy sessions as this will be completed as part of GAE/PROPEL, and to spend this time instead focusing on other rehabilitation goals (eg, balance or gait retraining).</p><p>Both interventions involve supervised, individualised, GAE 3&#x02009;days/week for 6 weeks informed by a submaximal or maximal aerobic capacity test. Patients will be referred by their treating PT. The interventions will be delivered in a &#x02018;closed group&#x02019; format. That is, participants referred to the programme will be placed on a waiting list until there are a sufficient number of participants to form a group (&#x02265;3), and all participants in the group will start and end the programme at the same time. The closed-group format is essential for the PROPEL phase as the education and group discussion topics will be presented in a specific order. An open-group format could be used for GAE; however, this would result in participants in the GAE phase being recruited to the study, on average, sooner post&#x000a0;stroke than those in the PROPEL phase.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Therefore, using a closed-group format for both phases will help to ensure that the mean time post&#x000a0;stroke at study enrolment does not differ between the two phases of intervention.

We will document internally which participants&#x02019; data are associated with which accounts; therefore, there will be no information about study participants (eg, name, age, study ID number) stored on the manufacturer&#x02019;s servers. Activity data will be downloaded from the manufacturer&#x02019;s servers as soon as possible after collection. All other electronic data will be stored at each site on secure institutional servers.

If phases significantly differ at baseline on cohort descriptors, these measures may be used as covariates in the analysis. To test our primary hypothesis, we will compare the proportion of active and inactive individuals at the final assessment point (6 months post&#x000a0;intervention) using mixed-model logistic regression, with fixed effects of time and phase and random effect of cluster (site).<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> We will also examine between-phase differences in physical activity at the 1-month and 4-month time points, which could reveal short-term benefits of PROPEL, even if there are no differences at 6&#x02009;months. A similar mixed-model analysis of variance will be used to compare SSEE, SOEE and BBAQ scores between programmes to test the secondary hypotheses. Only individuals who complete at least a minimum amount of the intervention will be included in the study; therefore, analysis will necessarily be &#x02018;per protocol&#x02019;. All recruited participants who comply with data collection will be included in the analysis; participants with missing data for one time point will be excluded from analysis of that variable for that time point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Methods: monitoring</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>There is no data monitoring committee for this study as the safety of aerobic exercise has already been established for this population,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 10</xref> and the additional risk of the discussion components of the PROPEL programme and other study components (eg, questionnaires or activity monitoring) is minimal (see 'Potential harms and auditing'). Adverse events that meet all three of the following criteria will be reported immediately to the local research ethics board(s), as is routine practice: (1) unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency; (2) related or possibly related to participation in the research and (3) suggests a potential increase in risk of harm to research participants or to others. All adverse events will be collated and evaluated biannually by the principal investigator (AM).</p><p>There is no plan for any interim analysis; interim analysis is not feasible with an SWT design due to the fact that the experimental intervention is &#x02018;rolled out&#x02019; gradually to each site, which means that the number of participants per phase will be uneven until the end of the trial. The trial will be stopped when one of the following criteria is met: (1) we have recruited at least 120 participants per phase, (2) 6-month follow-up data are available for at least 96 participants per phase or (3) all site investigators (AM, DB, AT and DT) agree that continuing the trial will not be feasible (eg, due to lower-than-expected recruiting and lack of funding to continue the trial).</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Potential harms and auditing</title><p>Sites will implement two interventions as part of routine care (GAE or PROPEL). Some aerobic exercise is currently conducted at all sites, but might not be implemented in the systematic manner required for this study. However, aerobic exercise is recommended as part of stroke rehabilitation within the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Furthermore, with appropriate screening and prescription, aerobic exercise is safe and feasible early after stroke.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Treating PTs will screen patients, with appropriate consultation with the interprofessional team, and provide the exercise prescription following established guidelines for aerobic exercise after stroke,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> prior to referring them to GAE or PROPEL. Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured at rest at the start of each intervention session to obtain a baseline measure of cardiovascular function. The interventions will be supervised by a trained registered PT, who will continue to monitor patients&#x02019; response to exercise and may choose to adjust the intensity or duration of exercise to minimise risk to participants.</p><p>The Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations also recommend including a plan to enable patients to continue to exercise post&#x000a0;discharge, including addressing barriers to physical activity.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> However, the specific education, self-management and problem-solving components of the PROPEL programme are not part of routine care at all sites. The additional risk to participants in completing this component of the PROPEL programme is minimal. Participants can opt out of any part of the discussion if they feel uncomfortable.</p><p>The additional measures conducted as part of the study pose minimal risk to participants. The CMSA, NIH-SS and MOCA are frequently conducted as part of clinical care in stroke rehabilitation. Other measures are questionnaires which ask routine questions about physical activity behaviour and lifestyle. Despite the minimal risk involved in these measures, participants will be reminded that they can opt out of any testing and/or decline to answer any of the questions in the questionnaires. The activity monitoring also poses minimal risk to participants; the devices are available commercially and are worn daily by millions of individuals around the world. Participants may develop skin irritation from wearing the device daily; they will be instructed to remove the device if this occurs. Participants may feel burdened by donning and doffing the activity monitors each day.</p><p>The study PT will document any adverse events that occur during the interventions; the RA will document adverse events for participants who enrol in the study during the follow-up period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s6a"><title>Research ethics approval</title><p>Research ethics approval has been received by the Research Ethics Boards of Sunnybrook Research Institute (study ID: 472&#x02013;2016, approved 31 January 2017), the University Health Network (study ID: 16&#x02013;5916, approved 14 November 2016), which covers two sites (Toronto Rehabilitation Institute&#x02014;University Centre, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute&#x02014;Rumsey Centre), St. Joseph&#x02019;s Care Group (study ID: 2016011, approved 13 February 2017) and Hamilton Health Sciences (study ID: 2274, approved 6 April 2017).

The interventions are being implemented as part of routine care at each site. This also helps to increase the likelihood that the interventions will continue as part of routine care beyond the end of the study compared with implementing the interventions for study participants only.</p><p>The novel &#x02018;stepped-wedge&#x02019; trial design is appropriate for evaluating the group-based PROPEL intervention as it is &#x02018;rolled out&#x02019; as part of routine practice to each site.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, it is possible that factors that change over time will influence the study results. For example, stroke rehabilitation delivery in Ontario is supported by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care through the Ontario Health Insurance Program. During the course of the study, it is possible that the Ministry will dictate changes to care delivery, such as changes to lengths of stay. However, &#x02018;vertical&#x02019; comparisons between sites can be made at any point in time to account for such secular trends.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52 55</xref> An alternative approach would be to have some sites start with the PROPEL intervention and transition to GAE; however, there would be a risk of contamination as staff administering the GAE would have been trained in PROPEL, which might influence how they treat their patients.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 56</xref>
</p><p>Participants in the PROPEL phase will have one extra hour per week of interaction with the PT and with other participants in the group. It is possible that this extra attention/interaction alone, rather than the content of the PROPEL discussions, will influence the study results. We opted to not add an attention control activity to the GAE phase (eg, group discussion on a topic unrelated to physical activity) based on feedback from stakeholders. We designed the GAE phase to resemble clinical practice as closely as possible, while still maintaining controls and standardisation necessary for a research study. An unrelated discussion group would be contrived for the purpose of the study and would not reflect clinical practice.</p><p>This large multisite trial will determine if a simple clinical intervention, delivered during stroke rehabilitation, can increase participation in physical activity after discharge. This work addresses methodological limitations of studies aiming to increase exercise participation post-stroke<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> by (1) basing the intervention on principles of behaviour modification, (2) using objective measures of exercise participation and (3) evaluating long-term self-directed exercise (ie, 6 months post&#x000a0;intervention). If the study results are positive, translation of this programme into practice has the potential to reduce healthcare costs (by reducing risk of cardiovascular events) and increase independence for stroke survivors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e414" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015843.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e415" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015843.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AM conceived of the study and is the grant holder.
