In the practice of regional anesthesia neuraxial, opioids have been used extensively as an adjuvant to bupivacaine to enhance the potency and duration of sensory and motor block produced by bupivacaine with satisfactory results. However, delayed respiratory depression by opioids has prompted further research to develop nonopioid analgesics. This study was undertaken to assess the degree of sensory and motor block and postoperative analgesia provided by low dose 50 &#x003bc;g intrathecal clonidine admixed with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine as compared to bupivacaine alone in patients undergoing a total abdominal hysterectomy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Hundred adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologist Class 1 and 2 were randomly allocated to Group A and Group B. Group A patients received 15 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 50 &#x003bc;g clonidine intrathecally. Group B patients received 15 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with normal saline.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Observation and Results:</title><p>The mean duration of motor block was significantly higher in Group A (270.80&#x000b1; 66.0 min) as compared to Group B (184.60 &#x000b1; 72.03 min), with statistically significant difference. There was also statistically significant difference in the duration of sensory block between Group A (290.20 &#x000b1; 80.27 min) and Group B (190.83 &#x000b1; 86.90 min). The duration of postoperative analgesia was significantly higher in Group A as compared to Group B (541.06 &#x000b1; 130.64 min and 252.80 &#x000b1; 84.10 min respectively).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Addition of intrathecal clonidine 50 &#x003bc;g to bupivacaine (15 mg, 0.5%) prolongs the duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia, thus produces an effective spinal anesthesia and good postoperative analgesia for longer duration and reduced postoperative analgesic requirement.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bupivacaine</kwd><kwd>clonidine</kwd><kwd>postoperative analgesia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Neuraxial anesthesia greatly expands the anesthesiologist's armamentarium. In the hands of skilled anesthesiologists safe and satisfactory anesthesia can be achieved below the level of umbilicus to the mutual satisfaction of patients, surgeons, and anesthesiologists. However, with local anesthetic alone, duration of sensory and motor block does not last beyond 2.5&#x02013;3.0 h. Many drugs such as opioids have been used in the past to enhance the effect of local anesthetics. As opioids are associated with catastrophic adverse events like respiratory depression, therefore search continues for an ideal agent.</p><p>Clonidine has been introduced with newer hopes. Low-dose clonidine as an adjuvant has been used previously with bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Several studies conducted have found clonidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) as safe dose with spinal bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of 50 &#x003bc;g intrathecal clonidine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine on the duration of sensory block, motor block, and postoperative analgesia in panhysterectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After approval of Institutional Ethical Committee, prospective randomized double-blind trial was carried out in 100 normotensive adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status 1 and 2 undergoing a total abdominal hysterectomy. Exclusion criteria: patients of ASA Class 3 and 4, patients with significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic dysfunction, morbidly obese patients and patients having an allergy to either clonidine or bupivacaine or having a contraindication to subarachnoid block. After taking written informed consent, patients were randomly allocated to two groups by computer-generated randomization. Group A patients received injection bupivacaine 15 mg with 50 &#x003bc;g clonidine, and Group B patients received injection bupivacaine 15 mg with normal saline. All patients were fasted overnight (as per fasting guidelines) and premedicated with tablet diazepam 5 mg and ranitidine 150 mg night before surgery. In the morning patients were wheeled into operation theater, monitors attached and baseline parameters (electrocardiogram, SPO<sub>2</sub>, noninvasive blood pressure [NIBP], and heart rate [HR]) recorded. An intravenous line was established with 18-gauge cannula and patients were preloaded with 500 ml Ringer lactate. Under strict aseptic precaution lumbar subarachnoid block was given in L2&#x02013;L3 interspace Group A patients received 15 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 50 &#x003bc;g clonidine intrathecally. Group B patients received 15 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with normal saline. The anesthesiologists performing the block and collecting the data were unaware of the drug injected. Fall in mean arterial pressure of &#x0003e;20% from the baseline value was treated with 3 ml aliquots of injection mephentermine, and injection atropine was given in increments of 0.3 mg in case of bradycardia (pulse rate &#x0003c;20% from the baseline value). HR and NIBP were recorded after every 5 min initially and then after every 15 min. After completion of surgical procedure patients were observed in the postoperative ward for degree of postoperative analgesia, postoperative motor block, and return of sensory sensation. Degree of postoperative analgesia was assessed using 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) (where 0 is no pain, and 10 is maximum imaginable pain) at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The postoperative motor block was assessed using modified Bromage score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Return of sensory sensation was assessed by cold perception using ice packs. Duration of analgesia was calculated from onset of sensory block to the demand for first rescue analgesic.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Visual analog scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-340-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Description of the Bromage score for motor block</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-340-g002"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (paired and unpaired).</p><p>Sample size:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="AER-11-340-g003.jpg"/></p><p>Taking &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>=1.28, &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>=1.46, <italic>d</italic> = 1.28</p><p>Significant level</p><p>&#x003b1; = 5%</p><p>&#x003b2; = 10%</p><p>Power = 90%</p><p>Sample size comes out to be <italic>n</italic> = 25 per group</p><p>&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> = Standard deviation of Group 1</p><p>&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub> = Standard deviation of Group 2</p><p><italic>d</italic> = Mean standard deviation</p><p>&#x003b1; = Type I error (5%)</p><p>&#x003b2; = Type II error (10%)</p><p>Power = (100&#x02212;&#x003b2;) i.e., 90%.</p><p>The values were represented in number (%) and mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

In another study Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] evaluated the postoperative analgesic effect of equal doses (150 mg) of oral or intrathecal clonidine.

Studies conducted by Kaabachi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Elia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Saxena <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] similarly showed that addition of various doses of clonidine to bupivacaine intrathecally significantly prolongs the duration of analgesia of bupivacaine.</p><p>When hemodynamic parameters were compared, we did not notice any change in HR by addition of 50 &#x003bc;g clonidine to 15 mg bupivacaine intrathecally.
