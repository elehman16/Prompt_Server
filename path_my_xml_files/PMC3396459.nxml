Patients received two intravenous infusions separated by 14 days of OCR or placebo on days 1 and 15 (Course 1) and on weeks 24 and 26 (Course 2). Patients were scheduled to receive further infusions at weeks 52 and 54 and at weeks 76 and 78 but most did not due to termination of the study. All patients were started on MTX on day 1 at an initial dose of 7.5 mg/week, increasing to 20 mg/week by week 8, as tolerated. Intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg was administered 30 min before each infusion. Paracetamol (1 g) and antihistamine (diphenhydramine HCl 50 mg or equivalent) were recommended as additional premedications.

This study was considered to be supportive and not confirmatory following the early termination of treatment, and therefore no correction for type I error was deemed necessary. The sample size of 200 patients per treatment group was designed to provide at least 80% power to detect a difference in the distributions of &#x00394;mTSS at week 104 between the OCR and PLB/MTX groups using the Wilcoxon test, with a 0.025 two-sided significance level. The calculation was also based on a 0.60 probability that &#x00394;mTSS would be less in patients receiving OCR than in patients receiving PLB/MTX.</p><p>Clinical efficacy analysis was performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all patients who received any study treatment. Two patients with missing baseline CRP data were excluded from all stratified efficacy analysis. The safety population comprised all patients who received any study treatment and at least one safety assessment. Radiographic end points were assessed using a modified ITT (mITT) population, which included patients in the ITT population who had both a baseline radiograph and at least one postbaseline radiograph. All efficacy analyses were stratified by region and by CRP status.</p><p>Group comparisons for &#x00394;mTSS at week 52 were made using a non-parametric test statistic (Van Elteren) stratified for region and CRP status. For any patient receiving rescue therapy before week 52, the mTSS score was set to &#x02018;missing&#x02019; 8 weeks after rescue therapy was received. Missing mTSS data imputations were applied afterwards, primarily using linear extrapolation. The proportion of patients without radiographic progression (&#x00394;mTSS&#x02264;0) at week 52 was analysed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel (CMH) test, and the primary analysis method used observed data for mTSS. Any patient with missing data at the analysis time point was classified as having radiographic progression.</p><p>The proportions of patients achieving ACR20, ACR50 or ACR70 responses at week 52 were analysed using a CMH test statistic for comparing group differences. Results were expressed as proportions with an adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference and corresponding CMH p value.

All other serious infections were not associated with IgG, IgM or IgA levels below the lower limit of normal around the time of event.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s16"><title>Discussion</title><p>OCR dosing in the FILM study was terminated prematurely following the sponsor's reassessment of the benefit/risk of B cell depleting agents, including rituximab, for treatment of MTX-naive patients with early RA who have a wide range of therapeutic options available to them. This prevented assessment of the protocol-specified primary end point of radiographic progression at 104 weeks. Nevertheless, analyses of data from the 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period provide useful insights of general interest on the efficacy and safety of OCR+MTX versus MTX alone in MTX-naive patients with RA.</p><p>OCR with MTX substantially inhibited joint damage progression in early RA. At week 52, each dose of OCR significantly reduced mean &#x00394;mTSS and prevented radiographic progression in a greater proportion of patients versus MTX alone. These data are similar to those observed for rituximab in MTX-naive patients with RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and in two related OCR phase III trials, STAGE and SCRIPT. In STAGE, OCR 200 mg and 500 mg each significantly inhibited radiographic progression over 48 weeks versus placebo in patients with an inadequate response to MTX.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> In SCRIPT, which studied a more refractory TNF-IR population, only OCR 500 mg significantly inhibited structural damage progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> With regard to the 500 mg dose, the FILM data are consistent with other reports of biologics in MTX-naive populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p><p>OCR with MTX also improved the signs and symptoms of RA, as assessed by ACR and DAS28 response rates. A higher proportion of patients in the OCR groups than in the placebo group achieved high-hurdle end points such as DAS28 remission and LDA. This improvement was maintained over 52 weeks. The ACR response rates were comparable with those observed in a similar population treated with rituximab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>The overall rate of AEs was similar among the treatment groups. However, patients in the OCR500/MTX group experienced a higher rate of SAEs. The most common AEs were IRRs and infections. Mild-to-moderate IRRs (Grade 1 or 2) were reported in approximately a quarter of OCR patients. As observed with rituximab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and in other OCR RA studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> the incidence of IRRs was the highest during the first infusion of the first treatment course, before declining with subsequent infusions and courses.</p><p>The serious infection rate with OCR200/MTX was similar to that observed with PLB/MTX, whereas a threefold higher rate was observed with OCR500/MTX, consistent with results from other phase III trials of OCR in RA. A subgroup analysis suggested that patients in the 500 mg group recruited from the Asia-Pacific region had a higher rate of serious infections. This imbalance largely, but not entirely, drove differences in serious infection rates compared with the other two study groups. Similar trends were observed in the SCRIPT trial, where a higher rate of serious infections appeared to be driven largely by patients from Japan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>Both doses of OCR rapidly depleted B cells shortly after infusion. However, there were differences with regard to B cell repletion at week 24 and again at week 52 such that there appeared to be faster repletion in the peripheral blood in the lower dose group. While those differences between the two OCR groups were small, they were remarkably consistent throughout all phase III trials conducted with OCR. Because initial peripheral B cell depletion is profound and consistent in all patients, no correlation between peripheral B cell counts and response rates can be established. However, it could be hypothesised that subtle differences in peripheral B cell counts translate into much greater differences in secondary lymphoid tissues (eg, spleen, lymph nodes), as well as the synovium. This could help explain differences between the two doses with regard to efficacy, particularly the radiographic results, and potentially differences in safety, especially infections. No reliable biomarker of tissue B cell depletion in humans is available to date.</p><p>In conclusion, 52-week results from FILM indicate that OCR200/MTX in combination with MTX was effective and well tolerated in MTX-naive seropositive patients with RA. OCR500/MTX was associated with an increased risk of serious infections, with patients recruited in the Asia-Pacific region accounting for much of this increased risk. OCR at doses of 200 mg and 500 mg significantly inhibited the progression of structural damage and improved signs and symptoms of RA compared with MTX alone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Support for third-party writing assistance for this manuscript was provided by F.
