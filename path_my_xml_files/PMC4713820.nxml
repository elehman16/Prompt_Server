whole body vibration training on height and symmetry of the single leg vertical jump in
healthy men. [Subjects] Thirty males with no history of lower limb dysfunction
participated in this study. [Methods] The participants were randomly allocated to one of
three groups: the unilateral vibratory stimulation group (n=10), bilateral vibratory
stimulation group (n=10), and, no vibratory stimulation group (n=10). The subjects in the
unilateral and bilateral stimulation groups participated in one session of whole body
vibration training at 26&#x02005;Hz for 3&#x02005;min. The no vibratory stimulation group subjects
underwent the same training for 3&#x02005;min without whole body vibration. All participants
performed the single leg vertical jump for each lower limb, to account for the strong and
weak sides. The single leg vertical jump height and symmetry were measured before and
after the intervention. [Results] The single leg vertical jump height of the weak lower
limb significantly improved in the unilateral vibratory stimulation group, but not in the
other groups. The single leg vertical jump height of the strong lower limb significantly
improved in the bilateral vibratory stimulation group, but not in the other groups. The
single leg vertical jump symmetry significantly improved in the unilateral vibratory
stimulation group, but not in the other groups. [Conclusion] Therefore, the present study
found that the effects of whole body vibration training were different depending on the
type of application. To improve the single leg vertical jump height in the weak lower
limbs as well as limb symmetry, unilateral vibratory stimulation might be more
desirable.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Single leg vertical jump</kwd><kwd>Symmetry</kwd><kwd>Whole body vibration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lower limb asymmetry is highly related to damage of the lower limbs that causes changes in
lower limb function during daily or sports activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lower limb asymmetry causes
changes in the movement of the ankle, knee, and hip joints and in the combined
proprioceptive sensation and neuromuscular control required for change of direction<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the different movement pattern
of the non-affected or affected side could change the mechanism of alternating movements
such as walking, running, jumping, and landing and damage the lower limb during such
movements. Asymmetry after this damage exacerbates the condition, resulting in even greater
damage<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diagnostic tests to measure lower limb asymmetry are necessary. Diagnostic tests can help
identify healthy people who are at risk of lower limb damage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, diagnostic tests serve as a criterion for rehabilitation
of damage and are helpful in determining the appropriate time for a person to return to the
community<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study by Fitzgerald et
al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that the functional
performance test could predict the possibility of knee damage and serve as a tool to assess
postoperative improvement in patients. The functional performance test includes a single leg
hop for distance, single leg triple hop for distance, single leg internal/external jump, and
single leg vertical jump (SLVJ), all of which have been widely used both clinically and
academically<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SLVJ, in particular,
is one of the most common tests of functional performance and has been used to evaluate
lower limb performance by applying similar stimulations as those experienced during daily or
sporting activities; moreover, the SLVJ has a reported test-retest reliability of
0.88&#x02013;0.97<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. As an officially certified
assessment tool, the SLVJ comprehensively measures flexibility, balance, power, and
neuromuscular control and provides objective measurements based on subject performance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SLVJ can be used to assess the functional performance ability of both lower limbs, and
the results can be represented using the limb symmetry index (LSI). The LSI is the ratio of
the jump height of the measured lower limb to the jump height of the contralateral lower
limb. For classification of normal and abnormal limb symmetry, O&#x02019;Donnell et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that an LSI &#x02265; 90% should be
considered in the normal range. Therefore, functional ability as measured by the SLVJ is
abnormal, and asymmetry exists, if there is &#x0003e; 10% difference between the two lower
limbs.</p><p>To restore symmetry, a significant goal can be to improve the functional ability of the
weaker side of the asymmetric lower limbs. Elements related to functional ability include
muscle strength, power, lower extremity joint stability, endurance, muscle flexibility,
balance, proprioception, speed, and agility.</p><p>Diverse methods including muscular strengthening exercise, endurance training, balance
training, perturbation training, and agility training have been used to improve the
functional ability of a weaker lower limb. However, these exercises and training methods
only improve specific elements of lower limb functional ability at a time. In this sense, a
number of elements need to be trained to achieve sufficient capacity of the lower limb.</p><p>Over the most recent decade, WBV has emerged as a new training method that involves diverse
elements by improving bone density, blood circulation, muscular strength, endurance,
proprioception, and balancing ability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
WBV applies fast repeated, alternating concentric&#x02013;eccentric stimulations while the subject
is in a static standing posture; the external vibration affects the muscles and nervous
system<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other existing training
methods with stronger stimulation are more likely to harm the subjects, but WBV is
associated with only a low risk of such harm<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have investigated the potential of whole body vibration (WBV) to improve
subsequent performance. Traditionally, bilateral vibratory stimulation transmitted through
both lower limbs has been provided to enhance muscular activity and functional performance.
However, training using bilateral vibratory stimulation may not be proper in the case of
subjects showing a severe difference between both lower limbs. The amount of vibratory
stimulation accepted by each lower limb may differ while supporting body weight against
gravity and the magnitude of the effect depends on the condition of each limb. Therefore,
training using unilateral vibratory stimulation can be a way to improve the functional
ability of a weak lower limb and the symmetry of functional ability between both lower
limbs. But it is not well understood whether unilateral vibratory stimulation will cause
improvement in the performance of a trained lower limb and the other limb, and no studies
have examined the effect of unilateral vibratory stimulation compared with bilateral
vibratory stimulation in the same position.</p><p>Thus, in recognition of this, the present study aimed to differentiate the weaker and
strong lower limbs and identify the effect of unilateral WBV training on the SLVJ height as
well as limb symmetry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-five physically active men volunteered to participate. The subjects were volunteers
recruited from a university in Seoul, South Korea. All subjects were classified as
recreationally active, which was operationally defined as participation in regular
structured exercise training or competition. None of the subjects were exposed to WBV
training before participation in this study<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were excluded if they had pain, recent or possible
thrombosis, severe headache, vestibular disorder, advanced arthritis, lower limb implant,
lumbar disc disorder, medication that could interfere with the study, a recent sprain, a
recent fracture, a gall bladder or kidney stone, or a malignancy<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects were fully informed about the possible risk and discomfort that might result
from the investigations. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and
Ethics Committee of Sahmyook University, South Korea. Five subjects were excluded because of
knee joint pain (n = 3), recent sprain (n = 1), or lumbar disc disorder (n = 1). After
interviews for exclusion, thirty subjects were randomly assigned into one of three groups,
namely the unilateral vibratory stimulation group (UVSG, n=10), bilateral vibratory
stimulation group (BVSG, n=10), and no vibratory stimulation group (NVSG, n = 10). Random

strength training and were also instructed to avoid any vigorous activity 24 hours prior to
the intervention<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vibratory
stimulation was conducted by the following method. Based on the findings of Cochrane and
Stannard<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, each participant was
familiarized with the vibration platform. In the study by Cochrane and Stannard, vibratory
stimulation was provided for 5&#x02005;min; however, in the present study, the subjects could not
maintain the squat posture for more than 3 minutes because of calf muscle spasm.</p><p>The Galileo 2000 (Novotec, Pforzheim, Germany) was used for bilateral WBV training, and a
researcher provided a full explanation of the study purpose and methods, as well as the
proper exercise posture, to the subjects. The isometric squat posture was conducted as
described in the following paragraphs. Based on the methods of Cochrane and Stannard<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, the exercise posture was corrected, and
the subject stood on a foothold while barefoot and maintained a specific distance from the
rotation axis. The subject crossed his arms, and a researcher supported the subject&#x02019;s waist
to prevent falling. The vibratory stimulation was conducted as described in the following
sentences. The vibratory stimulation was administered once at a vibration frequency of 26&#x02005;Hz
for 3&#x02005;min. The amplitude of the vibration foothold was fixed at 3&#x02005;mm. The proper exercise
posture included maintenance of the knee and hip joint angles at 140 degrees and 90 degrees,
respectively. Both feet were placed on the vibratory plate to transfer vibratory stimulation
through both the lower limbs. For unilateral WBV training of the lower limb on the weak
side, all the conditions were the same as those for the isometric squat exercise with
bilateral vibratory stimulation. The foot of the strong side was placed on a foothold at the
same height as the vibration plate, and the foot of the weak side was placed on the
vibration plate so that the vibratory stimulation was transferred only through the weak
lower limb. Training without WBV was performed by the same method as bilateral WBV training
except for vibratory stimulation. Both feet were placed on the vibratory plate; however,
vibratory stimulation was not provided.</p><p>The SLVJ test was performed before and after the intervention. It was performed three times
for each lower limb. No attempt was made to randomize the order in which the lower limbs
were tested. Prior to the experimental procedure, assessors were trained regarding their
behavior and to be aware of the problems that could occur. The SLVJ test was used to assess
the lower-limb performance capacity. For the SLVJ, it was recommended that the subjects
stand on one leg and be unsupported at take off. The subjects then jumped as quickly and as
high as possible and landed on the same extremity. The subjects kept their hands on the
pelvis and were informed that they could swing their arms freely or use a selected
countermovement without stepping prior to jumping. The tests were performed with an OptoGait
system (OptoGait, Microgate Srl, Bolzano, Italy), which measured the flying time. An
OptoGait with high-density photoelectric cells that allows for quantification of
spatiotemporal gait parameters on basically all flat surfaces has recently been introduced.
The OptoGait system is composed of transmitting and receiving bars that are placed parallel
to each other. When a subject passes between the transmitting bar and receiving bar, the
system detects any interruption in light signal due to the presence of feet within the
recording area and automatically calculates spatiotemporal parameters. It has been shown to
have high concurrent validity and test-retest reliability<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ground contact and &#x0fb02;ight time during a jump or series of jumps
were measured. The flight time was used to estimate the height of the body&#x02019;s center of
gravity during the vertical jump. The average value of three measurements was used as the
test record. The &#x0fb02;ight time (T<sub>f</sub>) and acceleration due to gravity (g) were used to
calculate the vertical rise (h) of the center of gravity of the
body.<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3923-e001.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>The LSI was quantified and used to compare the involved and uninvolved limbs. Performance
in the weak limb (h<sub>1</sub>) and performance in the strong limb (h<sub>2</sub>) were
used to calculate for LSI. Thus, physical performance in the weak limb was expressed as a
percentage of the physical performance in the strong limb.<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3923-e002.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0
statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results are presented as the mean &#x000b1;
standard deviation. Prior to training, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check if the
distribution of all parameters was normal. When data were normally distributed, one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess differences in continuous variables among
groups. The paired t-test was used to assess differences in continuous variables within
groups before and after interventions for each group. Differences in categorical variables
were analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The SLVJ heights of the strong lower limb and weak lower limb were significantly different

an isometric squat exercise and unilateral vibratory stimulation applied only to the weak
side improved SLVJ height and symmetry.</p><p>A variety of functional performance tests have been described, including single leg hop
tests for distance or time, hop and stop tests, and vertical jump tests<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the SLVJ is typically used to assess
elements of lower limb function and the ability of the lower limb to perform challenging
tasks. Previous studies have described the relationships between hop test measurements and
physical impairments, such as muscle weakness, passive joint laxity, and knee joint
proprioception deficits<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SLVJ
height is a meaningful indication of functional performance capacity<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SLVJ height in both the UVSG and BVSG showed a considerably larger increase than that
in the NVSG. With an increase of 21% in SLVJ height in the weak lower limb, the UVSG showed
a considerably larger increase than the BVSG, which had an increase of 12%. Although the
present study resulted in only small improvements in the average SLVJ height after the WBV
training, the improvement was obvious. Torvinen et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated an improvement in isometric knee joint extension
torque after one 4-min WBV session. Pellegrini et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> also showed enhanced foot joint planter flexion torque. This
improved lower limb extension torque is likely because WBV constantly expands muscular
capacity<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The WBV stimulates the Ia afferent tendency of muscle spindles, and continued stimulation
of the stretch reflex mechanism activates motor neurons, increasing the sensitivity of
primary ending. Moreover, more muscles are recruited via the muscle spindles and neuron
bundles<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Small type I muscles are
first recruited under the muscle recruitment principle, followed by large type II muscles
thereafter, and the more large type II muscles are recruited, the better the improvements in
movements and muscle strength<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
all imply that brief WBV has a significant effect on muscle recruitment required for the
SLVJ.</p><p>As mentioned above, the neuron work and muscle enhancement elicited by both concentric and
eccentric contractions with the WBV also follows the process of the SLVJ. Each joint of the
lower limbs is flexed for instant extension for a jump, and the stretch-shortening cycle of
extended muscles activates the spinal reflex for a burst of concentric contraction, in which
the stretch receptors are activated in the eccentric loading phase<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This mechanism increases the SLVJ height such that it is
higher than that of the squat jump.</p><p>Therefore, the concentric and eccentric muscle contractions induced by WBV activates the
stretch reflex mechanism and increases the muscular recruitment required for jumping, and
the effect of the stretch-shortening cycle elicited by the eccentric contraction during the
SLVJ further increases the jump height. Of course, the NVSG also showed the effect of the
stretch-shortening cycle, but it did not improve, seemingly because there was no stretch
reflex mechanism, as this group did not receive WBV.</p><p>In contrast, based on the results of the present study, vibratory stimulation in the BVSG
was transmitted though both lower limbs, not only the weak lower limb. Therefore, a certain
amount of vibration was divided between the legs, and the vibratory stimulation transmitted
to the weak lower limb in the BVSG might have been less than that in the UVSG. This meant
that the stretch reflex mechanism and muscular recruitment were not sufficiently experienced
in the weak lower limb in the BVSG compared with the UVSG.</p><p>With an SLVJ height increase of 5% in the strong lower limb, the UVSG showed a considerably
larger increase than the NVSG but not a considerably larger increase than the BVSG, which
showed an increase of 10%. With unilateral vibratory stimulation, the strong side failed to
experience the stretch-reflex mechanism, as in the case of no vibratory stimulation.
Nevertheless, increased jump height was observed in the UVSG.</p><p>The aforementioned effects of improved lower limb extension torque of the non-stimulated
lower limb could be caused by supporting the body weight against external sway without
losing balance. In addition, the cross-training effect documented in a previous study also
enhances muscle strength in the untrained lower limb compared with unilateral resistance
training<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The gain in muscle strength
through the cross transfer of resistance training could be caused by modifications in neural
control. Neural modifications could be elicited from the cortical areas responsible for
excitatory responses of the appropriate cortex area during voluntary contraction<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The characteristics of the cross-training
effect indicated that it was likely to occur even though the untrained lower limb did not
participate directly in the interventions<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, improved lower limb extension torque as a result of supporting body weight
against external sway in addition to the cross-training effect during unilateral WBV
training led to enhanced function of the non-stimulated lower limb during performance of the
SLVJ.</p><p>With an increase in symmetry of 14%, the UVSG showed a considerably larger increase than
the other groups. Unilateral vibratory stimulation increases the stability of the
lumbosacral area and activates the muscles of the lower limb, improving SLVJ performance
compared with the pre-intervention performance. Accordingly, the ability of the weak lower
limb improves more than that of the strong lower limb, which did not receive vibratory
stimulation. Therefore, this increases the symmetry of the functional performance of both
lower limbs. Bilateral vibratory stimulation improves the capacity of not only the weak
lower limb but also the strong lower limb at the same time. Therefore, the symmetry of the
BVSG did not improve compared with that of the UVSG.</p><p>In this sense, for enhanced symmetry between the lower limbs, unilateral vibratory
stimulation applied to only the weak lower limb could be a good approach.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Myer</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>Paterno</surname><given-names>MV</given-names></name><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament
