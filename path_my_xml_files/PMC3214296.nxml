Patients were excluded from the study if each of the following criteria were existed: 1) age under eighteen; 2) previous colon resection; 3) presence of any contraindications for colonoscopy (uncontrolled congestive heart failure [American heart society class 3 and 4]); 4) major psychiatric disease; 5) pregnancy or breastfeeding; and 6) refusal to give consent.</p><p>All endoscopies were performed at Al-Zahra Hospital in the evening under the conscious sedation (Midazolam and Meperidine) by two expert gastroenterologists.</p><p>Sample size was calculated using statistical formula according to recent similar studies.

Detailed written instructions regarding the assigned bowel preparation were given to all patients.</p><p>Patients assigned to Senna group were instructed to take 24 tablets in divided doses, the first twelve at 2 P.M. and the other twelve at 10 P.M. the day before the colonoscopy. They were also advised to drink clear liquids. Each Senna tablet (Senamed, Iran Darvak, Tehran, Iran) contains 9-11 mg of Sennoside A and B.</p><p>In the PEG group, patients received 4 sachets in 4 liters of water the day before the procedure and were asked to drink 250 ml every 15 minutes beginning at 5 P.M. in the evening until 4 l were consumed. They were also instructed to begin a clear liquid diet on the morning of the day before colonoscopy and to fast after midnight.</p><p>The drug product which was used in this group was Pidrolax (produced by Sepidaj drug company, Tehran, Iran); each sachet contains 70 g of PEG.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome in this study was quality of overall colon cleansing; this was assessed using validated Aronchick scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> that has been used in previous studies for the same purpose.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included difficulty of the procedure, patients&#x02019; tolerance and compliance, and severity of adverse events.</p><p>Difficulty of the procedure was rated by the endoscopist (1 = easy, 2 = fairly easy, 3 = difficult, 4 = failure to complete the examination).</p><p>Patients&#x02019; tolerance was determined using a questionnaire. They were asked to rate their tolerance of the preparation with a scale from 1 to 4 (1 = very comfortable, 2 = comfortable, 3 = uncomfortable, 4 = very uncomfortable).</p><p>Compliance of the patients to the regiment was assessed by asking the patients if they completed the dosing regimen as prescribed or not.</p><p>In order to assess safety, patients were asked to rank the severity of side effects of the drugs, including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, dizziness, or headache during the preparation period, as follows: 1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe.</p><p>All outcomes were gathered by a questionnaire which completed by the study coinvestigators and a data collection form that was fulfilled by the endoscopists. In this study participants were aware of the preparation methods and only the endoscopist was blinded about the method. To prevent unbinding of endoscopist patients were also advised not to discuss about their preparation method with the endoscopist during the procedure.</p><p>Informed consents were obtained from all patients and the protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using thestatistical software SPSS XV.

However it should be considered that these adverse effects are uncommon and result of long term and large amount usage.</p><p>There are studies performed by Farca Belsaguy et al, Chilton et al, and Valverde et al showed that Senna solution alone or in combination with other cathartics was more effective than PEG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> On contrary, other studies by Dahshan et al and Arezzo et al showed that those other laxatives were better than Senna.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> Also Radaelli et al compared an oral high dose of Senna (24 tablets of 12 mg) with standard 4 l PEG-ES lavage solution in 388 patients undergoing elective colonoscopy. They found that high dose of Senna was more effective than PEG in achieving a successful preparation for elective colonoscopy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Our study revealed that 24 Senna tablets of 11 mg had no significant difference in colon cleansing results, and the overall colon cleansing was the same between two study groups.</p><p>However there is an important point to be considered; the bowel cleansing may be affected by other factors such as gender, age, race, and previous abdominal surgeries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">table 4</xref> show the frequency of adverse effects in both study groups. We found that the occurrence of adverse reactions was similar in both groups except for abdominal pain which was more severe in Senna group and nausea and vomiting that were more in PEG group. These were similar to other studies except for abdominal pain which was higher in Senna group in our study (23%). This might be in relation with race difference.</p><p>Also, we noticed that, despite adverse effects, patient convenience the day before colonoscopy in Senna group was better than PEG. The majority of patient could work or perform usual activities the day before colonoscopy in Senna group.</p><p>The limitation of this study was that we evaluated outpatients administered for elective colonoscopy and the result therefore cannot be generalized to other population or practice setting like urgent colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion we deduce that Senna has the same efficacy and compliance and adverse events as PEG solution and it could be prescribed as an alternative method for bowel preparation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>AS and MK designed the study.
