Sedation reduces pain, discomfort and stress, and can produce amnesia in patients undergoing unpleasant and prolonged procedures such as ERCP. On the other hand, there are adverse effects in sedation which we are trying to avoid such as patient aggravation, deep unarousable state, absence of purposeful response to physical and verbal stimulation, loss of protective airways reflexes, inability to maintain patent airway, hypoxemia/hypercarbia, and cardiovascular instability (arrhythmia or hypotension).</p><p>Suitable drugs and their dosage for sedation have been debated, and a variety of different drugs have been used around the world, consequently search for appropriate sedation regimen continues.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Available agents for sedation include benzodiazepines (midazolam, diazepam), narcotics (fentanyl, meperidine), propofol, neuroleptic tranquilizers (droperidol), antihistamines (diphenhydramine), and dopaminergic receptor antagonists (promethazine).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine, a synthetic phencyclidine derivative, has been pronounced as a safe and effective sedative agent. Ketamine produces a dissociative state, combination of analgesia, amnesia, and sedation at subanesthetic dose, with minimal effects on the airway and vital reflexes. Fentanyl, a short-acting opioid, is useful for upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures and produces analgesia and sedation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The study has shown a shorter recovery period for patients undergoing endoscopy if fentanyl and midazolam are used compared with the use of pethidine and midazolam, and there was no difference in pain perception.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Remifentanil is another short-acting opioid that is able to permitting a rapid transition from intense analgesia to minimal residual effect. Propofol with rapid recovery profile produces sedation and amnesia and has been increasingly used worldwide as a sedative agent for standard endoscopy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>As mentioned, combining a sedative with an opioid can provide effective moderate sedation, and most patients receive a combination of medications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Despite using different drugs and variant combinations of medications, still searching for the best drug combination with the minimum side effects is continued; accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare between two combined drugs, ketamine-fentanyl (KF) and propofol-remifentanil (PR) for sedation in patients undergoing ERCP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a double-blinded randomized clinical trial study that after getting permission from Ethical Committee was performed in St. Alzahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran in 2013-2014. The target population was patients who underwent ERCP in this center and consented to participate in this study.

In this study, 80 patients who had to have an endoscopy were randomly divided into two groups of 40 individuals. The groups were not significantly different in terms of demographical variables including age and sex distribution, therefore, destructive effect of the mentioned factors has been neutralized and obtained results are likely to be regarded as direct impact of drug combination used by two groups. Examination of hemodynamic criterion before endoscopy until 15 min after the end of procedure showed that BP and heart rate changes were not different while the respiratory rate was significantly different between two groups as it was significantly higher in KF users than PR group. Moreover, SpO<sub>2</sub> changes among the groups involved significant which was more considerable at the beginning and the end of the procedure. There was no significant difference in terms of sedation score between two groups. The frequency range of retching was not significant, but respiratory depression and apnea frequency in PR group were significantly higher. KF users required more repeated dose of the drug compared with PR group which can be the result of the maintenance dose of propofol at PR group and no maintenance drug at the other group. Moreover, they had to stay more in the recovery room and suffered more from severe pain and nausea. To summarize the disadvantages of KF group, more repeated dose of drug, poor pain control, and more nausea should be mentioned, when some advantages were existed, such as less frequency of apnea and need to oxygen. On the other hand, PF users took some benefits, consisting better pain control, less nausea, shorter recovery time, and less repeated dose of drug, while higher apnea frequency and more need to oxygen and longer recovery time were some disadvantages.</p><p>According to alternative studies, ketamine is categorized as the type of anesthetic drugs with immediate effect which sedation impact duration and depth is lower than propofol.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Providing patients with peaceful situation and reducing pain is among the key factors in performing the procedure successfully,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] thus it is rather recommended to use PR combination than KF exception in patients who have pulmonary diseases who oxygen desaturation and apnea are harmful for them and every patient who has low respiratory rate for any reason, so lower respiratory rate is harmful for him/her. Since the frequency of apnea in PR group was higher than the KF group as a preventive approach for apnea, it is advised to administer high oxygen via mask with reservoir rather nasal cannula. In 2012, Fabbri <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a similar study assessed ketamine, propofol and low dose remifentanil versus propofol and remifentanil for ERCP, indicating that respiratory depression was more frequent in patients who used PR. In addition, the average length of stay in the recovery room was significantly lower in the ketamine group which received ketamine-PR. Remifentanil with extremely rapid clearance and offset of effect has a very short half-life, ranging between 3 and 5 min. In the Fabbri <italic>et al</italic>. study, it is administered in both groups.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] But in our study, remifentanil is just administered in the PR group which can be the result of lower length of stay in the recovery room versus the other group.</p><p>In one study that done by Angsuwatcharakon <italic>et al</italic>., Cocktail sedation containing propofol provides faster recovery time and better patients&#x02019; satisfaction for patients undergoing ERCP.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, the results of Amornyotin study showed that sedation for gastroesophageal endoscopy procedure can be safely and effectively performed with a multi-drug IV regimen utilizing anesthesiologist or nonanesthetic personnel with appropriate monitoring. However, comprehensive presedation assessment and proper patient selection and preparation as well as availability of skilled professionals for sedation administration are key components to provision of quality patient care.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Also in Triantafillidis <italic>et al</italic>. study, the same results were achieved.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In 2013, G&#x000fc;l <italic>et al</italic>. compared fentanyl and remifentanil combination impact on children endoscopy in Turkey. According to this study, the frequency and duration of apnea in patients receiving remifentanil were significantly higher than the group receiving fentanyl. In this study, similar to the present study, respiratory rate and the duration of stay in the recovery room in remifentanil group procedure was significantly lower than the fentanyl group.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The main limitation of our study is that the study duration was short and there was no follow-up after discharge and also the duration of ERCP is not assessed in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ketamine-fentanyl and PR combinations are not significantly different in sedation score, but PR combination provides better pain control with less nausea, as well as shorter recovery time. On the other hand, it causes more respiratory side effects, that is, apnea and need to oxygen. While this study has its own limitations, more investigations with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods as well as using other combinations are suggested to determine the best choice for sedation prior to ERCP.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>SMH carried out the design and coordinated the study, participated in most of the experiments and participated in manuscript preparation.
