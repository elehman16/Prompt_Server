societies. In Korea, the frequency of low back pain is gradually on the rise, and 60 to 80%
of people experience low back pain at some time in their life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low back pain occurs most frequently in those in their 30s to 50s
in both men and women, and it occurs most in women aged 40 or older<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low back pain is
classified into acute (six weeks or shorter), subacute (from six weeks to three months), and
chronic low back pain (three months or longer) according to duration<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakening of the abdominal muscles among the trunk muscles
of low back pain patients is generally prevalent, and the strengthening of the abdominal
muscles is essential in recovery of the spinal neutral position<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. When imbalance between the abdominal muscles of the trunk
and extensor muscles occurs, it triggers low back pain and reduces stabilization of the
lumbar segment<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, low back
pain patients experience a decrease in trunk activity because of pain, structural damage,
and inhibition of the reflex muscle contraction mechanism, and due to decrease of the
activity of the trunk for a long time and disuse, muscle atrophy and a decrease in muscle
strength occur, which aggravate low back pain and bring about secondary lumbar segment
damage and physical disability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Regardless of the clinical causes, all those who complain of low back pain experience a
decrease in muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility, and limitation of lumbar and
lower limb joint range of motion<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The lumber muscles, which consist of deep stabilizer muscles; the multifidus muscle,
transversus abdominis muscle, and internal oblique abdominal muscle, and superficial
stabilizer muscles, the erector spinae muscle, rectus abdominis muscle, and external oblique
abdominal muscle-play a role in lumbar segmental stability and as a basic support, and for
lumbar segmental stabilization, strengthening of deep and superficial stabilizer muscles and
co-coordination are necessary<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
multifidus muscle and transversus abdominis muscle contract faster than the other muscles
engaged in lumbar segmental stabilization, thereby maintaining body balance in all movements
of the human body<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Adams<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that stabilization muscles of the
lumbar pelvic area were first mobilized involuntarily during movement of the lower limbs in
healthy people, while stabilization muscles of the lumbar pelvic area in low back pain
patients with unstable lumbar vertebrae were mobilized later.</p><p>In order to reduce such instability and increase stabilization of the waist, lumbar
stabilization exercise has been applied to low back pain patients in many cases, and lumbar
segmental stabilization exercise requires normal motor sensation so that the correct
alignment of the trunk can be perceived and incorrect alignment of the trunk can be
corrected<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The ability to actively control the muscles of the hip plays an important part in lumbar
segmental stability. As a function of the gluteus maximus muscle, the sacroiliac joint
delivers loads from the trunk to the lower limb, and if this joint moves excessively, it
results in pressure on the joints and disks between the L5&#x02013;S1 vertebral body, sacroiliac
joint, and pubic symphysis, which leads to functional failure of the sacroiliac joint and
low back pain. This causes the gluteus maximus muscle to contract, creating a self-locking
mechanism, thereby providing stability to the sacroiliac joint<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Those with low back pain have a decreased balance ability compared with healthy people<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the human body is exposed to an
unexpected load, the muscles should swiftly respond to maintain balance and posture against
the load, but low back pain patients have a delayed response time, triggering a problem in
postural maintenance and balance. Lumbar segmental instability resulting from low back pain
triggers a decrease in trunk mobility and balance ability due to damage to postural
adjustment and a decline in muscle mobilization ability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, a lot of research applying lumbar segmental stabilization exercise to chronic low
back pain patients is being conducted. Nonetheless, research focusing on the muscles of the
hip is insufficient, although there is a close association between low back pain and the
muscles of the hip and the muscle of the hip greatly and positively affect low back pain.
Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of exercise to strengthen the
muscles of the hip together with lumbar segmental stabilization exercise on the lumbar
disability index, lumbar muscle strength, and balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study randomly selected 40 subjects from among female low back pain patients aged
between 30 and 50, whose visual analogue scale score were 5 points or higher and whose low
back pain disability indices were 20% or higher. They understood the purpose of this study,
listened to an explanation about the experimental procedure, and voluntarily consented to
participate in this study. The participants were provided a written informed consent form in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study randomly
and equally assigned 40 participants who provided written consent to participate in this
study to a lumbar segmental stabilization exercise plus exercise to strengthen the muscles
of the gluteus group (SMG + LES group) and a lumbar segmental stabilization exercise group
(LSE group).</p><p>The same lumbar segmental stabilization exercise was applied to both groups, and the
exercise to strengthen the muscles of the hip was added to the SMG + LSE group. All the
subjects performed their respective exercise three times per week (for 50 minutes per day)
every other day. The test items included the Oswestry Disability Index which was used to
examine the degree of functional disability resulting from low back pain. In order to
measure lumbar isometric muscle strength, M3 (Schnell, Germany) isometric muscle strength
measurement equipment was utilized, and in order to examine balance, a Tetrax (Sunlight
Ltd., Israel) was employed. Test were carried out before the intervention and again after
six weeks of the intervention.</p><p>For all the exercises, in exercise of each step, the lumbar segment was located in the
neutral position, and the targeted muscles were coordinately contracted. The neutral
position here does not mean that the lumbar vertebrae lordosis angle was zero but instead
refers to the lumbar vertebrae posture in which the patient felt most comfortable. The
exercise to strengthen the muscles of the hip was conducted after thorough training of the
patients; the patients were trained to precisely trigger muscle contraction with a focus on
the muscles of the hip. For all the exercises, a therapist provided a demonstration in
advance.</p><p>In exercise of the SMG+LSE group, the exercise to strengthen the muscles of the gluteus
focused on the large gluteus muscle and the middle gluteus muscle. During the first to third
weeks, the subjects conducted each exercise 15 times each per set without resistance, and
two sets were performed for both the left and right sides; during the fourth to sixth weeks,
the subjects performed each exercise 15 times each per set, with resistance, for a total of
two sets for both sides.</p><p>Lumbar segmental stabilization exercise allows slight pelvic posterior tilt and increases
intra-abdominal pressure by pulling the abdominal wall inward, triggering activation of the
transversus abdominis muscle and internal oblique abdominal muscle, thereby promoting the
contraction action of the muscles<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
prone position, a biofeedback device (stabilizer) was located on the lower abdomen of the
patients. While relaxing the body, the pressure was increased to 70 mmHg, and the patients
were trained to pull the navel toward the waist while maintaining contraction and to breath
before the actual exercise.</p><p>From the first to third week, the patients conducted exercise in a supine position,
side-lying position, quadruped position, sitting position, and standing position on the wall
without resistance, and from the fourth to sixth week, the patients conducted exercise with
resistance in the same positions as in the first to third weeks. The abdominal muscle was
pulled toward the inside of the abdomen within 10% of maximal muscle contraction power<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the contraction time of the deep
muscles was 10 seconds per session, with 20 sessions per set.</p><p>The exercise was the same as the lumbar segmental stabilization exercise for the SMG+LSE
group and was conducted for 10 seconds per session, with 20 sessions per set; two sets were
performed.</p><p>Regarding the statistical processing in this study, means and standard deviations of all
the data collected for the purpose of this study were calculated using PASW Statistics 18.0
for Windows. A paired t-test was conducted in order to examine changes in lumbar disability
index, lumbar muscle strength, and balance before and after the experiment within each
group, and an independent t-test was carried out in order to compare homogeneity and changes
between the groups. The significance level was set at (&#x003b1;)=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subjects were as follows <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMG + LSE group<break/>(N=20)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LSE group<break/>(N=20)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.2 &#x000b1; 5.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.2 &#x000b1; 6.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.5 &#x000b1; 6.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.9 &#x000b1; 4.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.7 &#x000b1; 7.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.6 &#x000b1; 4.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SMG: strengthen the muscles of the gluteus; LSE: lumbar stabilization exercise</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.</p><p>The lumbar disability index changed by 9.9&#x000b1;3.2 in the SMG+LSE group and by 4.5&#x000b1;2.4 in the

the hip muscle together with lumbar segmental stabilization exercise on the low back pain
disability index, lumbar muscle strength, and balance.</p><p>At present in the clinical field, lumbar segmental stabilization exercise programs focusing
on deep muscles are being applied to many chronic low back pain patients for motor therapy.
For prevention and treatment of low back pain, excessive movement of the lumbar segment
should be decreased, and the body alignment of the spine and pelvis should be corrected; for
stabilization of the distal parts of the four limbs when the limbs start to move, proper
isometric contraction of the trunk muscles is necessary<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lumbar segmental stabilization exercise is drawing attention as a method for effective pain
management in chronic low back pain patients, and stabilization exercise has been shown to
improve lumbar stability through better muscle strength and improvement of muscle and
movement adjustment ability based on the sensory motor control mechanism. In order to reduce
instability of the lumbar segment and increase stability, this study applied the abdominal
drawing-in maneuver as a lumbar segmental stabilization exercise and conducted exercise
therapy.</p><p>Recently, studies of low back pain, the hip joint, and hip muscle strength have been
reported, and Reiman noted that for low back pain treatment, the causes and methods of
treatment of diverse types of lumbar pain should be considered, including movements of the
waist, pelvis, hip joint, and lower limbs<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Reiman also observed that functional disorder resulting from weakening of the hip muscles
and restricted hip joint range of motion has elements related to pathology of the waist and
the lower limbs and that there is some association between the weakening of the hip muscles,
functional disorder of the hip joint, and pathology of the waist<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As mentioned by leading researchers, there is a biodynamic relationship between low back
pain, the hip joint, and hip muscles, and when applying an exercise program for low back
pain treatment to chronic low back pain patients, stability of the pelvis and hip joints and
strengthening of the hip muscles are important.</p><p>This study applied hip muscle strengthening exercise and lumbar segmental stabilization
exercise to female chronic low back pain patients in their 30s to 50s and examined changes
in the low back pain disability index, lumbar muscle strength, and balance. The subjects
were divided into the SMG+LSE and LSE groups, and the SMG+LSE group conducted lumbar
segmental stabilization exercise (abdominal drawing-in technique) plus hip muscle
strengthening exercise, whereas the LSE group carried out lumbar segmental stabilization
exercise (abdominal drawing-in technique). It is not easy to perfectly maintain the
abdominal drawing-in technique. Therefore, prior to the experiment, the patients lay on a
prone position and were trained on how to utilize the biofeedback device (stabilizer), and
then the experiment proceeded.</p><p>The results showed that hip muscle strengthening exercise in addition to lumbar segmental
stabilization exercise increased the stability of the hip joint and pelvis, which was
conducive to increasing lumbar segmental stability. It was also more effective for
increasing the lumbar low back pain disability index, isometric muscle strength of lumbar
flexion and extension, and balance ability.</p><p>To sum up the results, both SMG+LSE and LSE were effective for improving the low back pain
disability index, lumbar muscle strength, and balance in chronic low back pain patients.
Comparison of the changes in the two groups revealed that there was a more significant
effect on low back pain index, lumbar muscle strength, and balance in the SMG+LSE group than
in the LSE group. It is considered that the lumbar segmental stabilization exercise
strengthened deep muscles, increasing lumbar segmental stability, and that hip muscle
strengthening exercise increased the stability of the pelvis and hip joint, thereby
positively affecting an increase in lumbar segmental stability.</p><p>The limitations of this study are that although the experiment was conducted with female
chronic back pain patients in their 30s to 50s as the subjects, the number of subjects was
small, and therefore it is difficult to generalize the results. Furthermore, physical
activities and environmental factors other than exercise were not completely controlled for
the subjects who participated in this experiment. Therefore, it is considered that
continuous research actively complementing the proposed limitation is necessary.</p><p>In conclusion, clinical application of exercise in this study showed that SMG+LSE resulted
in a greater decrease in the low back pain disability index and increase in lumbar muscle
strength and balance ability than LSE in chronic low back pain patients receiving the
exercise treatments duing the same period. In exercise therapy programs for chronic low back
pain patients, adding hip muscle strengthening exercise to lumbar segmental stabilization
exercise will be very helpful for rehabilitation and maintenance of smooth daily life. In
the future, research focusing on hip muscle strengthening as well as lumbar segmental
stabilization should be conducted continuously.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>van Middelkoop</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuijpers</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A systematic review on the effectiveness of physical and
