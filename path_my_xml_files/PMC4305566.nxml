combining self-massage and home exercise for patients with myofascial pain dysfunction
syndrome (MPDS). [Subjects and Methods] In this retrospective study, 63 patients were
allocated to the experimental (n = 32) and control (n = 31) groups. Both groups received 6
sessions of treatment with physical modalities over the course of two weeks. The
experimental group completed an additional program with a combination of self-massage and
home exercise. The outcome measurements included a pain scale, pressure pain threshold
(PPT), neck disability index (NDI), patient-specific functional scales (PSFS), and heart
rate variability (HRV). The interactions between the groups and over time were analyzed
using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. [Results] Only the experimental group demonstrated
significant improvements in the pain scale with varying conditions. The PPTs of the
trigger points increased significantly in the experimental group, and significant
functional improvements in NDI and PSFS were observed in the same group. There were
significant increases in high-frequency HRV and high-frequency % in the experimental
group. [Conclusion] Treatment with physical modalities plus combination of self-massage
and home exercise is more effective than the physical modalities treatment alone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome</kwd><kwd>Pressure pain threshold</kwd><kwd>Heart rate variability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS) is defined as chronic skeletal muscle pain
caused by multiple trigger points and fascial constrictions. People with MPDS have limited

When trigger spots are activated, referred pain and other autonomic nervous system (ANS)
reactions are induced<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ANS dysfunction
symptoms include abnormal sensation, neuromuscular function attenuation, and heart rate

increase the sympathetic nervous system activity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The goals of treating MPDS are reduction of muscle tension and
pain, amelioration of the myogenic dysfunction, recovery from muscle imbalance, increase of
muscle flexibility, and finally normalization of muscle activity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The common treatments for MPDS are analgesic drugs, dry
needle therapy, laser exposure, ultrasonic treatments, and physical therapy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Massage and exercise are excellent for improving muscle activity and flexibility. The
combination of massage and home exercise treatment programs helps to ensure continuous
improvement of patient symptoms<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, the literature mainly
focuses on the improvement in pain reduction, rather than addressing the improvements in
patients&#x02019; daily activities brought on by the reduction of pain<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Past research focused on how to increase treatment
efficiency and reduce the number of sessions required to treat MPDS patients. Additionally,
there has been little study on ANS dysfunction during treatment of MPDS patients<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. We repurpose a combination of
self-massage and home exercise as a teaching and therapeutic program to educate patients and
interns in clinical practice, and this program was implemented over a period of two weeks by
a guest lecturer, Professor Wang, who is an expert in massage techniques. We wondered if the
treatment program designed in this study would result in improvements in pain and daily
activities in MPDS patients. We also hypothesized that the combination program would enhance
parasympathetic nervous system activity and decrease sympathetic nervous system
activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a retrospective study. We enrolled patients from our data bank in the Department
of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Tri-Service General Hospital, from March 2009 to
March 2010. All of the patients were diagnosed as having MPDS for 6&#x02013;18 months and had
undergone physical therapy, combination therapy or physical modalities only, or both. The
inclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis confirming MPDS with 1) two consecutive weeks
of symptoms in the upper back, 2) symptoms painful enough to affect daily activities, and 3)
at least one active trigger point in the neck or upper back musculature.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were 1) patient age younger than 20 and older than 65&#x02005;years, 2)
previous surgery in the cervical/thoracic vertebrae or shoulder, 3) rheumatoid arthritis or
systemic lupus erythematosus, 4) medical history of cervical disc herniation, cervical
spondylolisthesis, nostalgia paresthetica, or cervical radiculopathy, 5) cognitive
dysfunction impairing cooperation with treatment and testing, and 6) incomplete recording of
outcome measurements.</p><p>The patients were categorized into two groups according to the treatment they received. The
control group only received 6 sessions of physical therapy modalities (heating and
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) over a period of 2 weeks (three times a
week)). The patients in the experimental group completed a program consisting of a
combination of self-massage and home exercise therapy, as well as the same 6 sessions of
heating and TENS as the control group. The self-massage performed by the patients themselves
was taught by our instructor. Each patient massaged the muscles known to have trigger points
with the aid of a baseball by rolling the ball on the specific neck and upper back muscles
and associated trigger points. This massage technique induces ischemic pressure at the
trigger point and also massages the adjacent taut band. The home exercise program consisted
of stretching the muscles specific to the trigger point locations on the patients&#x02019; upper
backs.</p><p>The study conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGHIRB No.
1-103-05-108). With the approval of our IRB, informed consent was waived due to the
retrospective nature of our study.</p><p>The treatment outcomes were measured using a pain scale, pressure pain threshold (PPT),
neck disability index (NDI), patient specific functional scales (PSFS), and heart rate
variability (HRV) before and after the therapeutic programs.</p><p>The patients were asked to indicate the highest level of pain they were experiencing on a
10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), where 10&#x02005;cm represented the maximum pain. Pain was
evaluated during rest and daily activities; additionally maximal pain intensity was
evaluated.</p><p>Nine trigger points on each side of the body were selected for the PPT measurements; these
points included one point on the pectoralis major, two points on the levator scapulae, one
point on the latissimus dorsi, two points on the subscapularis, and three points on the
infraspinatus. We used a pressure threshold algometer (FG-5005, RS232, Lutron Electronic
Enterprise, Taipei, Taiwan) to measure the PPT of all nine trigger points in the upper
back<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before starting, the procedure was clearly explained to the
patients. We applied the algometer to the trigger point area with a metal rod perpendicular
to the skin surface and performed compression slowly enough to induce MPDS symptoms or a
myotatic reflex. If any increase in pain intensity or discomfort occurred, and the procedure
was stopped immediately. The average value (expressed as&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) of three
repeated measurements was taken for each trigger point, and the average values for all nine
trigger points (expressed as&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) were used for PPT analysis. Measurement of
PPT for the nine trigger points was performed before and after treatment.</p><p>We used the NDI and PSFS to evaluate patients&#x02019; daily activity functions<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The total score for the NDI is 50 points
for 10 items, and each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 5, with the lowest score of 0
representing no effect on daily activities and the highest score of 5 representing the
greatest effect on daily activities resulting in the least daily activity function. The PSFS
assessed the three daily activities most affected by MPDS symptoms and asked patients to
assign points to the extent they were affected, with 0 meaning most affected and 10 meaning
unaffected.</p><p>To explore the relationship between MPDS and ANS dysfunction, heart rate variability (HRV)
was examined. To minimize the influence of other factors on HRV, all patients were
prohibited from using drugs, caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol for 4&#x02005;h before the measurements.
Before HRV measurement, patients sat in a room at room temperature (25&#x02005;&#x000b0;C) for 20&#x02005;min. HRV
was assessed before and after the treatment/control period. During measurement, the patients
were asked to refrain from talking, falling asleep, making exaggerated body movements,
and/or intentionally altering their respiration. HRV analyzed in the frequency domain can be
used to assess vagal activity. HRV was measured using an HRV analyzer (SSIC, Enjoy Research
Inc., Taiwan)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Analysis was based on a
10-min period of ECG signal acquisition, followed by computerized Fourier analysis of the
ECG waves. Patients were carefully monitored using the HRV analyzer to ensure there were no
significant respiratory pattern changes during ECG measurement. HRV parameters were then
obtained from the analyzer, which included high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), high
frequency percent (HF%), low frequency percent (LF%), and low frequency and high frequency
ratio (LF/HF). LF spectral power reflects the sympathetic influence, whereas HF power
reflects the parasympathetic influence; the LF/HF ratio reflects the global sympathovagal
balance. Increases in the LF/HF ratio signify sympathovagal predominance. HF% and LF/HF were
the main parameters of interest in our study.</p><p>The data processing and statistical analysis were performed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences software (SPSS 16.0). The independent t-test was used to determine
the differences in continuous variables between the two treatment groups. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
test was used to determine the differences in categorical variables between the two
treatment groups. Furthermore, two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) was
used to compare outcome measures before and after the treatments between the control and
experimental groups, and to observe any interactions between the two treatment groups. In
this study, the statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1; &#x0003c; 0.01.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 63 patients were enrolled in the study; the control group contained 31 patients,

exercise, patients experienced a reduced maximal pain intensity during daily activities when
compared with control patients. The PPT of the experimental group increased significantly
after treatment as well. The combination program showed a better outcome than the physical
modalities only. In view of pain reduction and change in PPT, our results were compatible
with previous similar studies<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hanten et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the application of relevant pressures to the
trigger points when holding a stretching posture will decrease the pain of MPDS patients. We
demonstrated that trigger point compression together with other common modalities would
increase the PPT and reduce pain in MPDS patients. Taken together, these studies indicate
that a combination of different therapies is more effective that utilizing only one type of
therapy to treat MPDS pain.</p><p>Our study showed that the home exercise and self-massage program effectively improved
patients&#x02019; daily activity functions. Additionally, the difference in the most pain
experienced during testing (pain index) correlated negatively with the NDI; thus, a
reduction in the maximal pain intensity effectively improved patients&#x02019; daily activity
functions. The PSFS results suggest that the application of heat and TENS stimulation
improved the PSFS in both the control and experimental groups. We did not make any
comparison with other studies because there are few, if any, reports on PSFS expression. The
difference in maximum pain intensity index correlated positively with the PSFS, which
indicates that a reduction in the maximal pain intensity effectively improved patients&#x02019;
specific activity functions.</p><p>The experimental group outscored the control group in both the PSFS and NDI. This result
suggests that the standard modalities, when combined with a program of home exercises and
self-massage, are more effective in improving patients&#x02019; daily activity functions than
treatments that consist solely of the standard modalities.</p><p>HRV has been demonstrated as a valuable tool for evaluation of ANS<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. A higher value for HF, one of the parameters of HRV, has
been demonstrated in patients with back pain associated with myofascial trigger points<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In that study, which investigated the
immediate effects of traditional Thai massage on HRV in 36 patients with back pain
associated with myofascial trigger points, the results indicated that Thai massage is
associated with significant increases in HRV (increased both LF and HF, but HF by more)<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study showed a significant difference
in the decrease in LF% (p &#x0003c; 0.001), increase in HF% (p = 0.008), and decrease in LF/HF (p
= 0.018) in the experimental group. We therefore confirmed that the combination program
enhanced parasympathetic nervous system activity and decreased sympathetic nervous system
activity. Our results are consistent with other studies conducted in healthy adults<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study also showed that there were significant relationships with
respect to the pain experienced daily activities, which correlated with the LF%, HF%, and
LF/HF differences. These results indicate that the enhancement in parasympathetic nervous
system activity and reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity together result in the
reduction in pain experienced by the patients in their daily activities.</p><p>The combination treatment program had several effects that increased muscle flexibility and
blood circulation and decreased the conditions of muscle guarding. We assumed that the
reason for the effect of the combination therapy being better than that of the
single-therapy treatment for MPDS was blockage of trigger point activation by the
combination therapy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The treatment was designed with suggestions based on comparable reports and included heat
application, electrical stimulation, exercise, and massage. Because our study combined
self-massage with home exercise in the experimental group, we could not clearly indicate the
source of the treatment effect nor could we compare our results directly with other studies.
Furthermore, the study period was short (2 weeks only), and no other follow-up was done
after treatments. Therefore, we cannot report the long-term effect of the combination
program with self-massage and home exercise.</p><p>The combination program in this study resulted in improvements in pain, PPT, pain during
daily activities, and ANS dysfunction. The physical therapy modalities plus combination
program with self-massage and home exercise was more effective than the physical therapy
modalities alone for improving pain-free daily activity functions. The assessments performed
in this study, for instance, those for pain, daily activity functions, and ANS function,
seem valuable references for MPDS studies that address the pain management of patients and
use at-home therapies as supporting therapies in treating MPDS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research project was supported by Scientific Research Grant No. TSGH-C100-174 (2011)
