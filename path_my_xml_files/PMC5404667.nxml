Pharmacists could help improve asthma control, reducing this burden. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Medicines Use Reviews provided by community pharmacists in asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This cluster randomised, multi-centre, controlled trial in adult patients with asthma was conducted in 15 of the 20 regions of Italy between September 2014 and July 2015. After stratification by region, community pharmacists were randomly allocated to group A (trained in and delivered the intervention at baseline) or B (training and delivery 3 months later), using computerised random number generation in blocks of 10. Each recruited up to five patients, with both groups followed for 9 months.</p><p>The intervention consisted of a systematic, structured face-to-face consultation with a pharmacist, covering asthma symptoms, medicines used, attitude towards medicines and adherence, recording pharmacist-identified pharmaceutical care issues (PCIs). The primary outcome was asthma control, assessed using the Asthma-Control-Test (ACT) score (ACT&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20 represents good control). Secondary outcomes were: number of active ingredients, adherence, cost-effectiveness compared with usual care. Although blinding was not possible for either pharmacists or patients, assessment of outcomes was conducted by researchers blind to group allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Numbers of pharmacists and patients enrolled were 283 (A&#x02009;=&#x02009;136; B&#x02009;=&#x02009;147) and 1263 (A&#x02009;=&#x02009;600; B&#x02009;=&#x02009;663), numbers completing were 201 (A&#x02009;=&#x02009;97; B&#x02009;=&#x02009;104) and 816 (A&#x02009;=&#x02009;400; B&#x02009;=&#x02009;416), respectively. Patients were similar in age and gender and 56.13% (458/816) had poor/partial asthma control. Pharmacists identified 1256 PCIs (mean 1.54/patient), mostly need for education, monitoring and potentially ineffective therapy. Median ACT score at baseline differed between groups (A&#x02009;=&#x02009;19, B&#x02009;=&#x02009;18; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Odds ratio for improved asthma control was 1.76 (95% CI 1.33&#x02013;2.33) and number needed to treat 10 (95% CI 6&#x02013;28). Number of active ingredients reduced by 7.9% post-intervention (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Adherence improved by 35.4% 3 months post-intervention and 40.0% at 6 months (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The probability of the intervention being more cost-effective than usual care was 100% at 9 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This community pharmacist-based intervention demonstrated both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. It has since been implemented as the first community pharmacy cognitive service in Italy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>TRN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN72438848">ISRCTN72438848</ext-link> (registered 5<sup>th</sup> January 2015, retrospectively).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Asthma control</kwd><kwd>Medicines use review</kwd><kwd>Community pharmacy</kwd><kwd>Effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Medway School of Pharmacy</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The prevalence of asthma has been increasing since the late 1990&#x02019;s and it has been estimated that about 400 million people will suffer from asthma by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to lack of control of asthma worldwide translates into a global loss of 15 million DALYs per year and an estimated one in every 250 deaths worldwide is caused by asthma. Asthma accounts for an economic loss of &#x020ac;72 billion annually in the 28 countries of the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; this includes the annual costs of health care (about &#x020ac;20 billion), the loss of productivity for patients (&#x020ac;14 billion), and a monetised value of DALYs lost of &#x020ac;38&#x02005;billion. In the UK the burden of asthma was estimated at a cost to the NHS of more than &#x000a3;1 billion/year, including prescribing, hospital admissions and primary care consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In Italy the latest estimate showed an asthma prevalence of 6.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with an economic loss of &#x020ac;5 billion annually<sub>.</sub> An Italian cost of illness study, published in 2000, reported a mean annual cost for an asthmatic patient of &#x020ac;741 (95% CI: 599&#x02013;884), ranging from &#x020ac;379 (95% CI: 216&#x02013;541) for well-controlled asthmatics to &#x020ac;1,341 (95% CI: 978&#x02013;1,706) for poorly controlled cases, the latter accounting for 46.2% of the total cost of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In 2006 the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) advocated a new asthma management approach, based on asthma control rather than asthma severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], since &#x0201c;the principal objective of asthma treatment is to achieve asthma control&#x0201d;. The GINA 2015 pocket guide for asthma management and prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] defines asthma control as the extent to which the effects of asthma can be seen in patients, or has been reduced or removed by treatment. While guidance on asthma control abounds in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and other countries, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] many patients do not achieve good asthma control, with negative implications for their health and quality of life, as well as increased health care costs and loss of productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Asthma control may be affected by co-morbidity, continued exposure to triggers, behavioural issues, patient preferences, ineffective treatment, poor adherence and costs for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Pharmaceutical care, defined in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as &#x0201c;&#x02018;the pharmacists&#x02019; contribution to the care of individuals in order to optimise medicines use and improve health outcomes&#x0201d;, could contribute to asthma management. Many studies report positive effects of pharmacist interventions in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Indeed, a systematic review published in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] looking at the impact of pharmacists&#x02019; intervention on clinical outcomes in asthma identified 21 studies. However of these, only nine adopted a randomised control or a cluster randomised control design, only ten measured asthma control as main outcome as suggested by GINA management approach in assessing effectiveness, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and only one included an economic evaluation of the pharmacy intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Pharmacy-led approaches to asthma management include both one-off interventions, such as Medicines Use Review (MUR), and longer-term provision of pharmaceutical care. In England, the MUR is a cognitive pharmaceutical service, funded by the government, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] where accredited pharmacists can undertake structured adherence-centred reviews with patients using multiple medicines, particularly those receiving medicines for asthma and other long-term conditions. Similar services exist in some European (Denmark, Switzerland) and other countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], whereas in Italy such services (for asthma or other conditions) have not been introduced. Therefore, no empirical research exists addressing the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of a MUR service in Italy.</p><p>This study describes the first attempt to deliver a novel community pharmacy intervention for asthma patients, adapted from the MUR service for chronic diseases in England, across the Italian territory and to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a cluster randomised controlled trial, with phased intervention, as defined by Gums et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], in order to avoid selection bias, with control clusters providing the intervention after the primary end point (primary outcome) was finished (T3). Therefore all pharmacists (intervention and control) provided the I-MUR service to patients with asthma, but at different time points during the study. The study protocol is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Community pharmacists were recruited from 15 out of the 20 Italian regions: Trentino Alto Adige, Lombardia, Sicilia, Puglia, Sardegna, Piemonte, Valle d&#x02019;Aosta, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Toscana, Emilia Romagna, Marche, Abruzzo, Lazio and Campania. It was conducted between September 2014 and July 2015 with data collection at 3-months intervals (at baseline (T0); at 3&#x000a0;months (T3); at 6&#x000a0;months (T6); at 9&#x000a0;months (T9)). Pharmacists were randomly allocated to two groups after stratification by region: group A were trained to provide the I-MUR immediately after completion of the baseline ACT score at T0; group B received training and provided this service 3&#x000a0;months later, at T3.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intervention</title><p>The I-MUR consisted of a systematic, structured interview, conducted in a private room within the pharmacy, which covered asthma symptoms, medicines used, attitudes towards medicines and adherence. The pharmacists were trained to identify pharmaceutical care issues (PCIs) which could impact on optimal medicines use or asthma control and provide advice to the patients and recommendations to their GP, as necessary. As a process measure, the number of PCIs identified by pharmacists during the I-MUR service provision, classified using the method of Krska et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcome measure: Asthma control at baseline (T0) and at 3-months intervals (T3, T6 and T9), assessed using the ACT score. This measure has previously been used in Italy, in a study conducted by the Italian Society of General Medicine (Societ&#x000e1; Italiana di Medicina Generale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It was defined by international guidelines as: ACT&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;14&#x02009;=&#x02009;not controlled, 15&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;ACT&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;19&#x02009;=&#x02009;partially controlled, and ACT&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20 controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment, inclusion criteria, randomization and blinding</title><p>The study was conducted with the support of the Italian Pharmacists&#x02019; Federation (FOFI), which supported pharmacist recruitment in each region. Eligible pharmacists, working in pharmacies with private consultation facilities and internet connection, were identified by FOFI and invited to participate in the study. Those who agreed received training in providing the I-MUR, patient recruitment and data collection by AM. Each pharmacist was instructed to recruit five adult patients with an asthma diagnosis or at least 6 months consecutive use of medicines indicating asthma.</p><p>Pharmacists within each region were randomly allocated to Group A (intervention) or B (control) by JK, using computerised random number generation in blocks of 10. AM provided training at either T0 (Group A) or T3 (Group B), thus neither the research team nor the pharmacists were blind to delivery of the intervention. All data, comprising both primary and secondary outcome measures, were collected by the pharmacists and entered anonymously onto a web-based template, to which the researchers remained blind until an interim analysis took place at T6, which was required by the funders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size, training and study-timeline</title><p>The study aimed to involve 360 pharmacists and 1800 patients, with each pharmacist recruiting five patients. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria for both pharmacists and patients are described in the trial protocol, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] along with details of the training provided to pharmacists and the study timeline.</p><p>Neither the pharmacist nor patient numbers anticipated were achieved, therefore it was necessary to determine the post-hoc power of the study. In the light of the number of pharmacists and patients enrolled and remaining in the study from T0 to T9, (see results), the actual power of the study was calculated maintaining the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) value of 0.02 and level of significance (two-tailed alpha) at 0.05 as originally proposed (SPSS Sample Power 3, IBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data sources</title><p>ACT score was obtained at all four time points, adherence and number of active ingredients on three occasions and PCIs once; more detail is available in the protocol.</p><p>Due to budget constraints primary data on cost and utility outcomes were not collected.

Data were not normally distributed therefore non-parametric techniques were used for analysis. Differences between groups A and B were compared using Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for continuous variables and <italic>X</italic>
<sup>2</sup> (Chi square) for categorical variables. Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test was used for continuous variables within the same group at different time points (T0, T3, T6 and T9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Variation of ACT score across T0, T3, T6 and T9 was conducted using Friedman&#x02019;s ANOVA, instead of one way repeated measure ANOVA as anticipated in the protocol. Correspondence analysis (CA), a multivariate analysis technique which allows graphical representation of data showing how variables are related, was used to assess the relationship between ACT scores and adherence. The primary outcome (ACT score) was analysed using two separate approaches: intention to treat (ITT) analysis, applying the last observation carried forward (LOCF), and per protocol analysis (PP). A separate analysis of primary outcome at T3, using generalised estimating equations (GEE), was conducted as recommended by Consort Statement 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and Galbraith et al. (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] for cluster data, because GEE is a semiparametric technique used for continuous non-normal, binary and categorical responses. Moreover the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) suggests using GEE to either repeated measures at fixed intervals or for a single measure accounting for the clustering effect (multi-site study) as in our case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Binary logistic analysis was used, dichotomising outcomes into not-controlled (ACT&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;19) and controlled (ACT&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20). The GEE model was adjusted for the ACT score at baseline using age and gender. The relative risk (RR), the relative risk reduction (RRR), the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated using the PP results. An online calculator provided by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Toronto was used to confirm the results calculated manually, which also provided significance levels (p value) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>Secondary outcomes (number of active ingredients used, number of PCIs, adherence) were analysed only for patients completing the trial (PP). All analyses were conducted using SPSS software v22.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cost effectiveness analysis</title><p>Published data from European [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and Italian population-based studies monitoring the annual cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] in terms of EQ-5D relating to ACT score were used for this analysis. Average annual cost and utility estimates per patient were extrapolated for not controlled, partially controlled, and controlled patients (see ACT score categories above) and linked to the individual patient ACT scores reported at all four time points (T0, T3, T6, and T9). Group B patients were defined as receiving usual care by keeping ACT scores measured at T3 (prior to receiving the I-MUR service) constant across time. A sensitivity analysis was conducted keeping Group B ACT scores at T3 constant across time (T6, T9). As mean ACT score values differed between the groups at baseline, changes in costs and QALY over the follow-up period considering three separate scenarios, (T3, T6 and T9) were analysed.</p><p>The primary economic analysis compared I-MUR service and usual care from the public healthcare perspective whereas the secondary analysis considered both direct and indirect costs. For the primary analysis we used Vervloet et al. (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] cost data on scheduled healthcare visits to their usual physician and specialist, unscheduled healthcare asthma related in-patient admissions, emergency visits, and emergency contacts with a physician. The secondary analysis included indirect costs on productivity losses (working days lost) and leisure time forgone (days with limited, not work-related activities) as well as direct costs on doctor visits, clinical and laboratory tests, pharmacological treatment, emergency visits, and hospital admissions, using data from Accordini et al. (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Costs were actualised to 2015 values using the appropriate consumer price index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The cost for delivering the I-MUR service to Group A at T0 was &#x020ac;40, calculated based on data available in the international literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The summary cost-effectiveness statistic calculated was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Uncertainty and variation around the ICER mean are represented by the cost effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), obtained by re-sampling the data 1000 times to generate a mean cost and life year or QALY gain from each group, using a nonparametric bootstrap approach. The proportion of re-sampled datasets for which the calculated ICER lies below a given threshold is interpreted as the probability that the ICER of the intervention is below that threshold. Due to the lack of an official willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold in Italy, we used a threshold of &#x020ac;30,000 (&#x000a3;24,017) per QALY, which is within the values recognized by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence range of acceptable cost effectiveness (&#x000a3;20,000&#x02013;30,000 per QALY). Data analysis was performed using STATA v 13.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><p>There were 360 pharmacists randomised, of whom 283 started the study, recruiting 1263 patients at T0, with 201 pharmacists and 816 patients completing the study and having data at each time point. The median number of patients enrolled by each pharmacist was four. The overall drop-out rate from T0 to T9 was 29% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;82) for pharmacists and 35% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;447) for patients.

Based on a 20% increase in the proportion of patients with controlled asthma (ACT score &#x02265;20), considering the number of individuals per cluster (4), the ICC (0.02), the calculated design effect (DE) was 1.06, which provided an effective sample size of 758 patients, and the power attained by the study was 90%.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram describing the flow of participants though the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2017_2245_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>In the economic analysis we have used mean rather than median values, as this is more informative for planners of healthcare services. As the patient cost data were skewed, the confidence limits around the means were generated using non-parametric bootstrapping techniques. The incremental cost-effectiveness plane (CEP) showed 60.50% of the plots falling into the south-east quadrant, indicating that I-MUR service dominated the usual care option (less costly and more effective). Considering a WTP threshold of &#x020ac;30,000 per additional QALY gained, the probability that I-MUR was more cost-effective is 71.50%. For the secondary analysis, the incremental CEP showed about half of the plots falling into the south-east quadrant.

There was a statistically significant improvement in the proportion of patients with controlled asthma in both groups over the 9 months of follow-up and the median ACT score moved from partial to good control after the I-MUR intervention, at T3 in Group A and T6 in Group B. The NNT was 10, thus indicating a potentially useful intervention. Relatively few studies of pharmacist interventions report NNTs, however of those which do, values are similar to that found here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>The I-MUR intervention was shown to reduce the number of active ingredients being used and to improve patients&#x02019; adherence to their medications. In addition, a clear link was demonstrated between adherence and ACT score, suggesting that this may be one mechanism whereby asthma control was improved. Adherence increased overall by 35.4% 3 months post-intervention and by 40.0% at 6 months. The types of pharmaceutical care issues identified by the pharmacists during the I-MUR were primarily related to the need for education, monitoring and potentially ineffective therapy. Hence the provision of advice on use of medicines and how to optimise their effectiveness, together with frequent monitoring is likely to be the mechanism whereby adherence and thus asthma control were improved. The continuous improvement in both asthma control and adherence in both groups suggests that regular contact with the pharmacist and completion of the ACT score was in itself an important factor.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness analysis supported the hypothesis that I-MUR is more cost effective than usual care and the probability of I-MUR being cost-effective doubled across time (from 51.50% at 3&#x000a0;months to 100% at 9&#x000a0;months). Moreover it was demonstrated that the key factor influencing asthma control was adherence, which pharmacists are well placed to influence, and the resultant improvements in both were sustained over at least 6&#x000a0;months (9&#x000a0;months in Group A).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Similar results have been found in RCTs of community pharmacists&#x02019; intervention in asthma in other countries, across Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with the largest studies to date being conducted in Australia, Belgium and Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Further strengths are that it adopted the ACT score as a measure of asthma control, as recommended by GINA, which allowed measurement of both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (by translating ATC scores into QALYs) of the novel I-MUR intervention. The large number of pharmacists involved throughout the country supports the generalisability of the results at national level.</p><p>Standard practice in community pharmacy in Italy involves little clinical input, being mainly a supply function, therefore the patients were unused to a pharmacist taking an interest in their clinical status and providing information about optimising medicines use, which may have contributed to the effectiveness of the intervention. The pharmacists providing the I-MUR were responsible for both selecting patients and entering the data collected onto the electronic template, possible sources of bias. The population overall included more females than males (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and, more importantly, the proportion of patients not controlled differed between groups A and B, with median ACT scores at baseline of 19 and 18. The assessment of adherence did not use a validated tool, but instead used only two patient-reported questions, in the interests of brevity, which were similar to the questions used in the English MUR template. Also the initial follow-up period before the usual care group received the intervention was only 3 months. This meant that we had to assume no change in ACT control from T3 onwards for the economic analysis. In addition it was necessary to use secondary data rather than primary data collection on cost and utility, which were derived from different sources and were old estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], actualised at 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that the I-MUR service, which is the first cognitive pharmaceutical service to be delivered in Italy, was both effective and cost-effective. The Italian Government/Ministry of Health have since promoted a change of community pharmacy practice, with the I-MUR being the first nationally funded cognitive pharmaceutical service in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The work has therefore supported a significant cultural shift in Italian community pharmacy practice, promoting the change from a mainly logistic to a more patient-centred and clinically-oriented role of the community pharmacist in delivery of health care. Consideration is being given to extending the service to other respiratory conditions, but the successful service model applied here could enable community pharmacists in Italy to support the care of patients with a wide range of long-term conditions in the future. Moreover, it adds to the evidence base world-wide demonstrating the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of community pharmacy medication reviews.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>95% CI</term><def><p>95% Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Asthma control test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AHRQ</term><def><p>Agency for healthcare research and quality</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARR</term><def><p>Absolute risk reduction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CA</term><def><p>Correspondence analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEAC</term><def><p>Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEP</term><def><p>Cost-effectiveness plane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DALYs</term><def><p>Disability-adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DE</term><def><p>Design effect</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESS</term><def><p>Effective sample size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EuroQol-5D</term><def><p>Survey instrument for describing health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FOFI</term><def><p>Italian Pharmacists&#x02019; Federation/Federazione Ordini Farmacisti Italiani</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>General estimating equations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GINA</term><def><p>Global initiative for asthma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IBM</term><def><p>International business machine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intra-cluster correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>I-MUR</term><def><p>Italian medicines use review</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOCF</term><def><p>Last observation carried forward</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>m</term><def><p>Number of units (patients) per cluster</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMAS8</term><def><p>Eight item morisky medication adherence scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MUR</term><def><p>Medicines use review</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>Number needed to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>Odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCIs</term><def><p>Pharmaceutical care issues</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p>Principal investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p>Per protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality-adjusted life-year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>Relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RRR</term><def><p>Relative risk reduction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIMG</term><def><p>Italian Society of General Medicine/Societ&#x000e1; Italiana di Medicina Generale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>Statistical package for the social sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STATA</term><def><p>Statistics data analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T0</term><def><p>Time zero</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T3</term><def><p>Time at three months</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T6</term><def><p>Time at six months</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T9</term><def><p>Time at nine months</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WTP</term><def><p>Willingness-to-pay</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Italian pharmacists, general practitioners and consultants, patients and all other people who have been involved in this study.
