PCH is similar to well-child care in the US, but is free of charge for all families and is far reaching (&#x0003e;90%). FCC-JointStart consists of a family-centered way of communicating with parents (as further detailed in the Methods section), in combination with a checklist regarding the child&#x02019;s social-emotional wellbeing and developmental context. We previously showed that FCC-JointStart leads to better attunement of care to parents&#x02019; preferences[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and to the identification of those families who need additional care, as reflected by higher problem scores on a range of contextual problems.[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, there is lack of evidence on whether this type of FCC indeed leads to <italic>earlier</italic> identification and to better child outcomes, which are the core of well-child care.</p><p>Therefore, in this study our aim was first to assess whether FCC-JointStart leads to a better and earlier identification of social-emotional problems as compared to care-as-usual (CAU). Better and earlier identification regarded more identification, earlier identification, and identification of the more severe problems. Second, we assessed whether FCC-JointStart leads to fewer child psychosocial problems at age 18 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Design and setting</title><p>We conducted a non-blinded quasi-experimental study within a Dutch PCH organization, which implemented an FFC approach in one region, but not in others. This led to an intervention region (FCC-JointStart; 7 Well-Child Centers, WCC) and a care-as-usual (CAU; 5 WCC) region; WCC were assigned top-down to either condition. The FCC-JointStart and CAU regions were comparable regarding socio-demographic variables, including income, employment, ethnicity, and household composition. PCH professionals did also not differ between regions regarding gender, age, and years of experience. Randomization per child was not possible because professionals worked only in one of both regions. The Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen approved our study and all participants provided written informed consent (METc2008.272 dated August 5, 2009). The authors confirm that they neither perform nor have performed any other trial for this intervention. Registration of the study in the trial register was delayed until the study had started because originally we did not think registration was needed as it involved a non-commercial intervention. Further details of the study design are described elsewhere.[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants</title><p>Parents were eligible if they had sufficient mastery of the Dutch language and had a well-child PCH visit with their newborn child in the regions concerned (parts of the Dutch provinces of Drenthe and Overijssel). Between October 2009 and June 2011, PCH professionals, i.e. nurses and medical doctors, asked 8280 parents to participate, (84%) of all eligible parents, with no exclusions. Inclusion was ended because of obtaining the required number of case. Of those asked, 5658 (68%, in both regions) agreed to participate. Participants were followed for 18 months, with final follow-up assessments in December, 2012. Differences in background characteristics (employment status, educational level, country of birth and age of the parents) were small between parents who were and were not invited to participate, and between parents who agreed and refused to participate (Cramer&#x02019;s V varying from .05 to .13). At 18 months, 5478 families (97%) were still participating; details are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187750.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0187750.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0187750.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow of participants through the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0187750.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Intervention group</title><p>FCC-JointStart was used during all routine well-child visits (from 2 until 18 months). It strongly focuses on building rapport with parents. PCH professionals have to attune their care to the unique needs and wishes of each family by taking their point-of-view as basis for the well-child visit, and treat them as equal partners and experts on their child. Professionals aim to further enhance parents&#x02019; confidence and parenting skills by motivational and empowering communication. Furthermore, FCC-JointStart provides a guideline for conversation with parents on five domains associated with children&#x02019;s social-emotional development, i.e. Competence of the primary caretaker; Role of the partner; Social support; Perceived barriers and life events in the context of the child; and Wellbeing of the child (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Appendix 1</xref>).</p><p>For each domain, professionals can register in the child&#x02019;s medical record <italic>not discussed</italic>, <italic>protective</italic>, <italic>indistinct</italic>, or a <italic>risk</italic>, with details if needed. After assessment of all domains, PCH professionals jointly decide with parents to rate the situation as &#x0201c;<italic>fine</italic>,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;<italic>not optimal</italic>&#x0201d; indicating that no additional care is needed currently, or &#x0201c;<italic>a problem</italic>&#x0201d; i.e. an additional service needs to be provided by PCH. The FFC-JointStart group had 15 minutes extra for the well-child visit at two months, but not for any other contact. All contacts in the CAU group and all other contact in the FCC JointStart groups lasted 15 minutes.</p><p>Before using FCC-JointStart, PCH professionals participated in four days of training by a certified trainer. The training regarded background information on FCC, work instructions, role-play sessions, and discussion of case-vignettes. Within one month after training, PCH professionals had to provide two videotaped well-child visits to the trainer, who assessed the quality of the service delivery using standardized guidelines (with questions like whether all parts of the FCC were discussed and whether PCH-professionals used empowering communication).[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This procedure was repeated until performance was rated as adequate by the certified trainer. Participating PCH professionals attended supervisory sessions every three months, in which a recording of one of their well-child assessments was assessed based on the afore-mentioned criteria. These supervisory sessions lasted two hours and involved four to six PCH professionals.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Care-as-usual (CAU) group</title><p>In the CAU group, PCH professionals monitored children&#x02019;s general health and social-emotional development during routine well-child visits according to the guidelines of the National Center for Child Health.[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] These guidelines pay attention to PCH professionals&#x02019; communication skills and the importance of children&#x02019;s development context.

In the FCC-JointStart group, this involved 114 parents (3.8% of total), out of which 87 (76% of those asked) agreed. In the CAU group, this involved 71 parents (2.6% of total) out of which 60 (86% of those asked) agreed.</p><p>One week before the child reached the age of 18 months, all participants received a Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5&#x02013;5,[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] at their e-mail address, if available, or by paper, with the request to fill in the questionnaire. If parents did not return the questionnaire within two weeks, they received a reminder, and, after two weeks, parents were contacted by phone.

For both the FCC an the CAU groups, PCH professionals were instructed to rate the situation as &#x0201c;<italic>fine</italic>&#x0201d; if no intervention was needed; as &#x0201c;<italic>not optimal</italic>&#x0201d; if there were some concerns, but no intervention was needed; and as &#x0201c;<italic>a problem</italic>&#x0201d; if an additional activity was needed aimed at the social-emotional wellbeing of the child, like an additional appointment or a referral to a child psychologist. For the FCC-JointStart group, these ratings are likely to be based on a joint decision with parent, since this is an important feature of FCC-JointStart. In the CAU group ratings are likely to be based solely on these criteria; in CAU no extra instruction was given to come to a joint conclusion with parents.</p><p>The second primary outcome was the parent-assessed psychosocial development of their child by the Dutch version of the well-validated CBCL 1.5&#x02013;5.[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The CBCL 1.5&#x02013;5 consists of 99 problem items which are scored as 0 (not true), 1 (somewhat or sometimes true), or 2 (very true or often true), and can be used to compute Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total problems scores.</p><p>The additional questionnaire for participants receiving additional care included a series of measurements on the five domains associated with children&#x02019;s social-emotional development that were covered by the FCC-JointStart guideline for conversation with parents.

We found that an FCC approach (FCC-JointStart) may contribute to more and earlier identification of risks for social-emotional problems, and of families that needed additional care, but not to fewer child psychosocial problems at age 18 months.</p><p>Identification of children at risk was more frequent and earlier in the FCC-JointStart group than in the CAU group. A somewhat similar study compared trained to non-trained PCH professionals regarding the identification of psychosocial problems in early school-age children (5&#x02013;6 years).[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] It found that trained professionals, who used a structured method to assess psychosocial problems, identified moderate and severe problems more accurately than non-trained professionals.[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The most likely explanation for our finding of earlier and more identification of problems is that the core components of FCC may add to the identification of risks. Potentially, a structured approach may add to that, and should thus be seriously considered in any FCC approach in well-child care.</p><p>We found more children at risk with an at average greater risk, and identified them earlier. We previously showed that those identified by the FCC JointStart approach had more severe problems on 6 out of the 15 developmental domains and a similar problem severity on the other domains, compared to CAU. [<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This suggests that early identification was more accurate and, therefore, interventions were provided to families who actually needed it. This may be due to the extensive training of professionals in working with FCC-JointStart. It also suggests that FCC-JointStart may empower parents in such a way that they can handle problems themselves, causing only the more severe cases to still require additional care.</p><p>At 18 months of age, we found no differences between the FCC-JointStart and CAU group regarding children&#x02019;s psychosocial problems, which contrasts with the earlier identification of more and more severe risks for social-emotional problems. An effective handling of these problems might be expected to lead to a reduction of the level of problems at 18 months in the FCC-JointStart group as problems would have been treated earlier and more extensively. However, findings on the CBCL at 18 months did not show this. Reasons may be that the CBCL is not sufficiently sensitive to detect these problems at this age, that attrition was selectively different between the two conditions, or that FCC-JointStart has no effect. Regarding the first potential reason, previous research has shown that the CBCL focusses on relatively severe problems which may not fully reflect the domain that is addressed by well-child care.[<xref rid="pone.0187750.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Regarding the second explanation, we did not find major differences in loss to follow-up which might lead to such a selective attrition. This definitely deserves additional study with other outcome measures and a longer follow-up.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Major strengths of our study are the inclusion of a large group of children with a rather long follow-up in routine well-child care and a small loss to follow up, in a well-powered quasi-experimental design. Moreover, our study concerned routine well-child care and full communities, which highly adds to the generalizability of the findings. However, our study also has some limitations. First, background characteristics of the two groups differed somewhat, as well as participation rates. These differences were small and were adjusted for in the analyses, but unmeasured factors may still have affected our findings though a significant impact is unlikely given the large differences that we found. Second, we had no golden standards for the appropriateness of risk identification, but we used the best available valid proxies for this. Third, PCH professionals in the CAU group may have had some knowledge about family-centered care, for example through the Internet. If so, this may have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of FCC-JointStart, but effects are probably small as we avoided any publicity on this project. Fourth, PCH professionals in the FCC and CAU groups may have differed in performance in advance of the study. This is rather unlikely given the very uniform training of PCH professionals, the similarity of the groups of participating professionals in both regions, and the highly standardized way of working, but evidently we cannot exclude this fully. Finally, PCH professionals in the FCC and CAU groups may have labeled the severity of problems in a different way. This may have been in part an intervention outcome as aimed for. The simultaneous increase of the number and the severity of identified problems suggests that this indeed may lead to a better identification and not just to the labeling of more children as having problems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>FCC-JointStart may contribute to the identification of more risks at an earlier age, with relatively small effects which, however, apply to all children. Therefore, potential population benefits are rather large. Furthermore, FCC-JointStart also seems to be associated with a better identification of risks for socio-emotional problems and problems that need additional care. Further research is needed to assess whether early identification and intervention improve child health outcomes in the long-term.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Appendices</title><sec id="sec025"><title>Appendix 1 Overview of the contents of the family-centered approach; its five domains and corresponding questions</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Competence of the primary caretaker</bold>
