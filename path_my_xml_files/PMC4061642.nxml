Considering that pomegranate juice (PJ) is known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of PJ consumption on markers of inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial study, 50 patients with T2D (40-65 years old) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in each group received either 250 mL/day PJ or a control beverage for 12 weeks. Biochemical markers including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin and inflammatory markers were assayed on the baseline and follow-up blood samples.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In all, 44 patients in two groups were included in the analysis: PJ (<italic>n</italic> = 22) and placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 22). After 12 weeks of intervention, in the PJ group, there were 32% and 30% significant decreases in plasma C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and Interlukin-6, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The mean &#x000b1; SD plasma interlukin-6 (7.1 &#x000b1; 5.6 vs. 11.9 &#x000b1; 14.4 mg/L) and hs-CRP (1791 &#x000b1; 1657 and 1953 &#x000b1; 1561 ng/mL) concentrations in the PJ group were significantly lower than the placebo group after intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>PJ consumption by patients with T2D does not affect FPG or the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), whereas it does reduce Interlukin-6 and hs-CRP concentrations in plasma. Therefore, PJ consumption may have an anti-inflammatory effect in patients with T2D.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>pomegranate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the main noncommunicable chronic diseases, and its complications have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The increase in adipose tissue mass observed in obesity can lead to chronic activation of the innate immune system, which can lead to insulin resistance and T2D.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] All of the following, heart disease, metabolic syndrome and T2D, have in common the increased concentration of circulatory cytokines as a result of inflammation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Low-grade systemic inflammation is characterized by a two- to threefold increase in systemic plasma concentrations of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The cytokines produced by adipose tissue have a key role in promoting atherosclerosis and, therefore, cardiovascular disease (CVD).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Pomegranate juice (PJ) contains diverse groups of polyphenols, including ellagitanins, gallotannins, and ellegic acid, as well as flavonoids, such as anthocyanins.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, its antioxidant activity is mainly due to hydrolysable tannin, including punicalagins, anthocyanins and ellagic acid.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] PJ antioxidant activity was found to be three times higher than that of red wines and green teas, and two- to six-folds stronger than the other natural beverages.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Evidence for the clinical benefits of PJ has been reported in some studies,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but few studies that have assessed its impact on inflammation have been conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> or used pomegranate extract.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although patients with T2D are exposed to severe systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, data on the effect of PJ intake among these patients is limited. In this study, the effects of PJ consumption on markers of inflammation in patients with T2D were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects and ethical aspects</title><p>T2D patients, aged 40-65 years, with a diagnosis of at least 1 year, were recruited from the Charity Foundation for Special Diseases and Health Center of District 2 of Tehran, Iran. All the patients controlled their diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents. Patients were excluded from the trial if they were smoking, suffering from any other chronic diseases and taking estrogen or progesterone (if female) or antioxidant supplements or used insulin as diabetes medication.</p><p>At baseline, patients were stratified by sex and randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A (PJ, <italic>n</italic> = 25) and group B (placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 25). Random allocation of patients to treatment groups was performed by sequentially numbered containers. Randomization was performed by an assistant and the group allocation was blinded for the investigator and participants.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Ethic approval for the trial was obtained from the ethical committee of the National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute (Tehran, Iran). This clinical trial has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials at htpp://www.irct.ir with the following identification: IRCT201206144010N8, and was conducted between November 2012 and March 2013.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Protocol</title><p>At baseline, patients were stratified by sex and randomly assigned to consume 250 mL/day PJ or a control beverage of similar color and energy content for 12 weeks. The study product was packaged in single-serving bottles labeled such that neither subjects nor staff members were aware of the treatment assignment.</p><p>Subjects were advised not to change their dietary habits, physical activities or drug medication. The dietary intakes of subjects were assessed using a 3-day dietary recall (two weekdays and one weekend day) at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks. Patients&#x02019; diets were analyzed by the Nutritionist IV software (N Squared Computing, San Bruno, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Measurements</title><p>At baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention, 10 mL blood was collected from each patient after a 12-14-h overnight fasting. Blood samples to which an anti-coagulating agent was added were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The plasma samples were separated into aliquots and were frozen at -70&#x000b0;C until they were assayed. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration was assessed using the enzymatic colorimetric method using glucose oxidase by commercial kits (Pars Azemoon, Tehran, Iran) and a Selectra 2 auto-analyzer (Vital Scientific, Spankeren, the Netherlands). The coefficient of variation (CV) for FPG was 1.3%. Plasma insulin and inflammatory markers were assessed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (ELISA). Insulin was measured using a commercial kit (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden), with a CV of 5.0%. The plasma concentration of TNF-&#x003b1; and high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) were assayed by related kits (Komobiotech Inc., Gangseo-gu Seoul, Korea) and Diagnostics (Biochem, Canada Inc., Ontario, Canada), respectively. Interlukin-6 was measured using commercial kits (Biolegend, CA, USA). All immunoassays were performed by an ELISA reader Sunrise, Tecan Co. Salzburg, Austria. CVs for TNF-&#x003b1;, hs-CRP and IL-6 were 6.7, 6.3 and 7.1, respectively.</p><p>Weight and height were measured using a balance Seca scale with a stadiometer at the baseline and at the end of the intervention. Weight was measured while the subjects were minimally clothed and not wearing shoes, and was recorded to the nearest 100 g. Height was measured while subjects were standing without shoes, with their shoulders in a normal position, and was recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by square of height (m).</p><p>In addition, HOMA-IR was calculated as: [Glucose (mmol/L) &#x000d7; Insulin (&#x003bc;U/mL)]/22.5.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Compliance</title><p>To ascertain patient compliance, we provided each patient with a fixed number of PJ bottles and instructions to return the unused bottles at the end of the study.

Moreover, PJ and placebo were provided for all patients. This study had limitations because we could not measure plasma polyphenol derivatives&#x02019; levels nor did we evaluate the level of TNF-&#x003b1; in the blood mononuclear cells. Hence, it is suggested these two be measured in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that PJ, which is a source of natural sugars, does not affect FPG and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) in patients with T2D, and it also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, lowering some inflammatory factors including IL-6 and hs-CRP. Further studies with a longer intervention period as well as a bigger sample size or using PJ with different polyphenol contents are needed in order to evaluate its protective role against diabetes and its complications and the anti-inflammatory effects of PJ.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by the National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute of Iran and The Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences with research project number of 435.
