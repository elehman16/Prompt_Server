balance by using Medicine-ball and Swiss-ball exercises. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-six
normal adults who agreed to participate were included in the study. Subjects were randomly
assigned to the Medicine-ball (n=18) and Swiss-ball groups (n=18). The participants
performed the exercise for 6 weeks. Balance error scoring system and one leg standing test
were performed to determine static balance, and functional reach test and timed up and go
test were performed to determine dynamic balance. [Results] A significant improvement was
observed from the Medicine-ball and Swiss-ball exercises, but no difference was found
between the groups. In addition, a significant difference was found between balance error
scoring system, one leg standing test and functional reach test after pre- and
post-exercise of the Medicine-ball and Swiss-ball. [Conclusion] The findings of this study
showed that the Medicine-ball and Swiss-balls were effective in improving static and
dynamic balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Medicine-ball</kwd><kwd>Swiss-ball</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Balance is an essential functional element of activity of daily living (ADL), such as
sitting, standing up, and walking<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
Medicine-ball and Swiss-ball exercises can be used to promote balance in ADL. Swiss-ball
exercises are widely used because they can improve strength, endurance, flexibility,
coordination, and balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast,
Medicine-ball training is effective in improving exercise speed, agility, strength, and
endurance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, because it can improve
physical function by integrating lower and upper body training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is not only effective in flexibility and strength, but also in
its own way<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>; hence, it is suitable for
sports, such as baseball, tennis, golf, and hockey, with many rotational movements wherein
momentary strength and speed play a major role<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Particularly, it is possible to safely perform high-intensity
movements in the form of force acting on the ground, such as upper limb movement<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many validation exercises improve balance by using the popular Swiss-ball. In contrast,
Medicine-ball exercises have been mainly used for training in sports activities, but
research on improving balance ability in ADL is lacking. Therefore, this study was conducted
to compare the effects of two exercises by evaluating balance ability before and after
exercise with the Medicine-ball and Swiss-ball in 20-year-old adults. In addition, we will
also investigate Medicine-ball exercises that normal adults can effectively perform ADL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-six normal adults who agreed to participate in S university students in Korea were

The Medicine-ball was 19&#x02005;cm in diameter, and considering muscle strength, the
ball weighed 2.5 and 1.25&#x02005;kg for males and females, respectively. The Swiss-ball was of a
suitable size for exercise, considering the subject&#x02019;s height. 6&#x02013;9 REPS intensity three times
a day, three times a week for 6 weeks was performed. After warm-up for 5&#x02005;min, exercise with
Medicine-ball and Swiss-ball was performed for 35&#x02005;min, and cool down was performed for
5&#x02005;min. The Medicine-ball exercise program consisted of nine exercises, including a one-leg
squat, Romanian de-drift, one leg standing, step-jumping, circulating squat, twisted lunge,
superman posture, v posture, and ball squat between legs. The Swiss-ball exercise program
consisted of the following nine exercises: drawing a Swiss-ball, climbing a wall, pushing a
thigh, turning a bridge, turning a ball, kneeling, lifting a leg, raising a body on a ball,
and lifting a torso from a ball.</p><p>Balance error scoring system<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> (BESS) and

Medicine-ball and Swiss-ball and to compare the effects of the two exercises. Static balance
was measured with BESS and OLST, and dynamic balance was measured using FRT and TUG.</p><p>A significant increase in balance ability in both groups was shown in BESS. The lower the
BESS score, the better the balance ability. In contrast, an average score of 1.34 points was
shown in the Swiss-ball group. The elasticity of the ball was speculated to act as unstable
ground. A significant increase in balance ability in both groups was shown in OLST. However,
the Medicine-ball group was increased by an average of 2.88 seconds, and ball weight and
squat movement seemed to influence muscle strength. This is consistent with previous studies
wherein Swiss-ball exercises had a positive effect on OLST<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A significant increase in dynamic balance ability in both groups was shown in the FRT. This
is consistent with previous studies that Swiss-ball exercises have a positive effect on FRT.
Swiss-ball exercise has been speculated to contain many exercises to stimulate the core
muscle. A significant increase in balance ability in the Medicine-ball group was shown in
TUG, but no significant difference was found in the Swiss-ball group. TUG was found to be
more effective with Medicine-balls. This is a different result from previous studies wherein
exercise with the Swiss-ball had a positive effect on TUG<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, if the duration of the study is prolonged, the same
effect is expected to be seen.</p><p>Both the Medicine-ball and the Swiss-balls were shown to be effective in balancing ability.
Particularly, in the case of Medicine-balls, the size is small; hence, it is useful in a
narrow space. In addition, because it has a heavy weight and affects muscle strength
enhancement, it is considered effective for dynamic balance ability. Therefore, it is
speculated that the Swiss-ball exercise can be partly replaced with the Medicine-ball
exercise. In this study there was a limit even though it consisted of several exercise
programs to promote balance. In future research, additional research set up with a
combination of various exercise programs is necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by Eulji University in 2017.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Yavuzer</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Eser</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Karakus</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of balance training on gait late after stroke:
