LABA has been associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes, including severe exacerbations and deaths,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> although these events were relatively rare. These results suggest that LABA treatment may mask ongoing airway inflammation, leading to more severe asthmatic exacerbations, even with regular use of ICS. This study was designed to compare the effects of combination therapy (LABA plus low dose ICS) on airway inflammation in asthmatic patients to those of medium dose ICS therapy alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible patients had a documented history of asthma treatment for more than 6 months at Samsung Medical Center. Patients at 16 to 70 years of age with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of more than 60% of the predicted normal value were screened for enrollment. Each patient was assessed to establish his or her current treatment regimen, adherence to the current regimen, and level of asthma control. Asthma control was monitored using a simplified scheme, which included daytime symptoms, limitation of activity, nocturnal symptoms, need for reliever treatment, and lung function, as set forth by international guidelines.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patients were enrolled if their asthma was either uncontrolled, or only partly controlled by administration of low dose ICS (budesonide 200 &#x000b5;g, twice per day) for at least 3 months.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had received treatment for acute asthma exacerbation within the previous 12 weeks, if they were smokers, pregnant, or lactating. All patients provided written informed consent prior to the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>)</title><p>This randomized, prospective, crossover study was carried out in an outpatient setting. Following an initial run-in period of 2 weeks, patients were randomly assigned to either of 2 treatment phases: one received medium-dose budesonide (400 &#x000b5;g twice per day; ICS phase), and the other received a combination therapy of budesonide/formoterol delivered by a single inhaler (160 &#x000b5;g budesonide plus 4.5 &#x000b5;g formoterol twice per day; LABA phase). Each treatment phase lasted for 6 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout period, after which patients were crossed over.</p><p>All patients completed asthma control test (ACT) questionnaires for their symptoms at the end of each treatment phase. The ACT contained 5 questions, each scored on a 5-point scale, with higher scores reflecting better asthma control.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> FEV1, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and induced sputum eosinophil percentile were measured following completion of each treatment phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Induced sputum examination</title><p>Sputum induction and processing were performed as described previously.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Differential cell counts from sputum samples were recorded as the average of counts performed by 2 examiners on separate occasions in a blinded manner. Eosinophilic inflammation of airways was defined as an eosinophil percentage of &#x02265;3% in the sputum.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary outcome was mean sputum eosinophil percentile following completion of each treatment phase. Secondary variables included FEV1, morning PEFR, and ACT scores.</p><p>Sample size was determined by assuming a standard deviation for repeated induced sputum eosinophil percentile of 0.69% for each patient. Thirty participants would therefore provide 90% power to detect a change of 2% or greater in sputum eosinophil levels. Due to recruitment difficulties, only 24 subjects were recruited, which reduced the power to 70%.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Individual parameters including FEV1, PEFR, ACT score, and eosinophil percentage in the induced sputum were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All values are presented as means&#x000b1;standard deviation [SD]. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twenty-four asthmatic patients were enrolled, with 23 patients (12 males and 11 females; mean age, 57.9 years; range, 34-68 years) initially randomized into either the LABA phase (12 subjects) or ICS phase (11 subjects); following completion of the initial study phase patients were crossed over into the alternative study phase. All subjects completed the study; however, adequate sputum for downstream analyses was obtained from only 17 patients (9 males and 8 females; mean age 54.5 years; range 35-68 years). No adverse events were reported during the study period.</p><sec><title>Comparison of lung function and asthma symptoms between study phases</title><p>Baseline measurements were collected following completion of the initial run-in period; mean FEV1 was 86.8&#x000b1;16.2% of the predicted value, morning PEFR was 371.0&#x000b1;75.5 L/min, and mean ACT score was 23.2&#x000b1;1.2 in the 23 subjects.</p><p>No differences in the 2 secondary outcomes, FEV1 and PEFR, were seen between the LABA and ICS phases. ACT scores were also similar in both phases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of airway eosinophilic inflammation between study phases</title><p>After 6 weeks of treatment, the mean sputum eosinophil percentage was 5.07&#x000b1;3.82% in the LABA phase, significantly higher than that seen in the ICS phase (1.02&#x000b1;1.70%, <italic>P</italic>=0.007). Sputum eosinophilia (&#x02265;3%) was present in 6 subjects during the LABA phase, compared to only 2 during the ICS phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Two patients showed a substantial increase in sputum eosinophil during the LABA phase (22.6% and 14.0%), which was decreased following completion of the ICS phase (0% and 3.66%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>When control of asthma is not achieved with low-dose ICS, the addition of a LABA is recommended, according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, our results suggest that increasing the dosage of ICS provides better control of airway inflammation than addition of LABA, although asthma symptoms and lung function were comparable between the 2 strategies. Six of the 17 asthmatic patients had persistent airway eosinophilia during the LABA phase. Two patients showed a substantial increase in sputum eosinophil (more than 10%) using a combination of LABA plus low-dose ICS, which was decreased following treatment with medium-dose ICS alone. However, these changes in eosinophilic airway inflammation did not translate into differences in either lung function or asthma symptom scores between the ICS and LABA phases.</p><p>Traditional asthma management guidelines focus on symptoms, lung function, and the use of short acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonists rescue therapy.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, these features do not address underlying airway inflammation.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Several studies have demonstrated that asthma treatment decisions which focus on reducing eosinophilic airway inflammation can reduce the risk of acute exacerbations.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>A recent meta-analysis of clinical trials found that use of LABA increased the likelihood of life-threatening asthma exacerbations and death, leading the United States Food and Drug Administration to issue warnings regarding regular use of LABA.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although the risk of adverse events is reduced with concomitant use of ICS, the overall safety of LABA remains controversial. A large-scale cohort study demonstrated a higher risk of severe exacerbations and hospitalization after combination therapy with LABA and ICS compared to increased dosage of ICS alone.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>LABA may worsen asthma symptoms as a result of continuous stimulation of &#x003b2; adrenergic receptors, leading to uncoupling and internalization of receptors, followed by a decrease in receptor density and receptor gene expression.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In patients with uncontrolled asthma, the addition of LABA may also mask progression of inflammatory processes, allowing the disease to worsen before symptoms appear.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>To date, few studies have compared the anti-inflammatory effects of addition of LABA to those of medium-dose ICS alone. In this study, neither treatment strategy resulted in measurable clinical deterioration, despite differences in airway inflammation. However, it is uncertain whether these findings are the result of limitations of the present study, such as the short duration or the small number of patients enrolled.</p><p>In conclusion, a combination of LABA and low-dose ICS could result in masking of eosinophilic inflammation in some patients, compared to medium-dose ICS alone. These results suggest that before or during the step-up with LABA add-on therapy, an evaluation of airway inflammation may be necessary to prevent persistent airway inflammation. Further studies of the effects of airway inflammation on clinical outcomes are required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by a Samsung Medical Center Clinical Research Development Program grant [#CRS-107-56-2].
