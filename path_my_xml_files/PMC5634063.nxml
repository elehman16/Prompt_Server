Although DXA is an expensive and immobile method and also causes the exposure of the bones with rays.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In a study aimed to identify a cheaper and simpler method rather than DXA for evaluating BF in obese and overweight adolescent, it was recommended that bioimpedance analyzer compared with DXA could be the simplest and most exact fat tissue state in obese adolescents.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] On the other hand, BMI is considered as the most popular method for the assessment of weight status. The persons younger than 20 with percentile of 95 and higher in BMI standard curves for this age was considered to be obese.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, the main purpose of weight loss intervention in children and adolescents is decreasing the fat mass (FM) and maintain BM well regardless of its effect on their weight.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence, the purpose of this study was the implementation of a comprehensive health promotion intervention and the evaluation of its effects on different anthropometric measurements in 12&#x02013;15-year-old adolescent boys. Furthermore, the focus of this paper is to compare of two assessment methods of physical health and fitness in adolescents: BMI and body composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, controlled, school-based trial and carried out as a comprehensive health promoting school program involving 96 students in two boys&#x02019; high schools (including the grades 7&#x02013;9) of a randomly chosen district of Tehran city (the district 5). Two schools were randomly allocated as the intervention and control schools.</p><p>The selection criteria of the schools included enrolled students were 12&#x02013;15-year-old, they were similar regarding the implementation of health and sanitary programs and far enough physical distance from each other to reduce the possibility of interaction of students of case and control school. Considering that both schools were chosen from the same district, it was expected that the students were similar in terms of socioeconomic class and ecological and social backgrounds.</p><p>After conducting required coordination with schools, identifying obese and overweight students and obtaining consent forms from students and parents, 96 obese and overweight students (52 students in intervention school and 46 students in control school) participated in this study and all of them completed the study.

Omron-BF511 bioimpedance analyzer (this device is a digital, mobile, and nonaggressive device that have eight electrodes that transfers the weak electrical currents [50 kHz and lower than 500 &#x003bc;A] through hands and feet) was utilized to measure weight, BMI, BF, and BM. The validity of this device has been confirmed in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] All measures have been taken between morning and noon at the beginning and after 12 weeks of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention was implemented in school for 12 weeks (from February to May 2016) in two levels: in the first level, the environmental and lifestyle changes were applied to the school level, so all the students in the intervention school were covered. The five dimensions of Ottawa Charter[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were used for systemic implementation of interventions in school level. Our intervention objects were (1) modify the health policy at the school level to influence weight and BMI, (2) creating supportive environment to weight reduction, (3) strengthen community action to achieve a healthy weight, (4) developing personal skills to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and (5) reorienting health services to prevent and treatment of obesity.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] We had some strategies for every object and many operational activities for every strategy.

The personalized diet was adopted with free snacks offered in school days by researchers.</p><p>Furthermore, a high-intensity interval training[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was carried out for improving the physical activity at the schools. In this method, students warmed up for 10 min under supervision of an exercise physiologist and they were involved in high-intensity exercise for a minimum of 30 min.

Furthermore, in the study of hospitalized obese children and adolescents, the significant reduction in BF tissue percent was observed through the implementation of similar intervention.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In another study, one-dimensional and traditional intervention was considered unsuccessful in fat tissue loss and the multidimensional intervention was considered effective for useful changes of body tissue compositions.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The traditional obesity interventions have been focused on weight loss and its related indicators such as BMI to evaluate the success of the intervention. However, according to these criteria, many interventions reported limited successes in obesity management. In two intervention studies on weight loss, aligned with the present study results, the physical activity (along with calorie intake limitation or without it) resulted in fat-free mass gain and fat tissue loss, while BMI did not show the significant changes.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Moreover, Evans <italic>et al</italic>. reported that small changes in BF percent may not be accurately reflected in BMI.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>In a longitudinal study of white children, there was a direct relationship between total BF-free mass index and BMI percentile, whereas FM index and BF percent had more complicated relationships with BMI percentile depending on gender and age and whether BMI percentile was high or low. The results also suggest that BMI percentile changes may not accurately reflect changes in and BF percent in children over time, particularly among male adolescents and children with lower BMI.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Chung reported that BMI has limitation in differentiating changes in BF mass and changes in fat-free mass.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Among overweight children, higher BMI levels can be a result of higher fat-free mass (not FM). It has been shown that BMI is not an ideal indicator of obesity since it is significantly influenced by the fat-free mass, especially in obese individuals.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Generally, there is a doubt in regard to using BMI for evaluation and decision-making in control of the obesity. It is suggested that to achieve the best personalized obesity interventions, BF percent has to be considered.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Previous studies have reported that the precision of BMI as an indicator of fat tissue depends on the severity of obesity.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] BMI is related to FM in healthy adults and it can be responsible for 75% of BF changes, but such relation in some of other age groups such as children is weak.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Hence, it is recommended to consider other anthropometric measurements (e.g., bioimpedance analyzer) in children.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Short-time period of the intervention and the absence of adolescent girls in this study can be considered as limitations. Hence, it is recommended to run the next studies with longer intervention and on both boys and girls to increase generalizability of the data.</p><p>At the end of this article, it should be noted that this study was the first study in Iran that evaluated the effects of comprehensive health promotion intervention project (based on the Ottawa Charter) on obesity and anthropometric indices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study showed that the implementation of a comprehensive intervention for obesity management may result in improvements in the body composition indices although these changes may not be reflected in BMI.
