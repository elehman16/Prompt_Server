Local anesthetic agents are deposited in the neurofascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscle. The block, first described by Rafi in 2001,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] is a simple and safe technique for analgesia after cesarean section, whether guided by anatomic landmarks or by ultrasound.</p><p>Transversus abdominis plane block in cesarean section has been given with local anesthetics like bupivacaine and ropivacaine with a limited duration of action.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Additives to local anesthetics like opioids, ketamine and &#x003b1;2 agonists like clonidine and dexmedetomidine have been successfully used in peripheral nerve blocks and field blocks to increase the duration of postoperative analgesia. The present study was planned to investigate whether addition of 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg clonidine bilaterally to 0.25% bupivacaine in TAP block increases the duration of postoperative analgesia in lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) or not compared to 0.25% bupivacaine alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After institutional ethical committee approval, this randomized, double-blind controlled trial was conducted in 100 healthy parturients (ASA I and II) scheduled to undergo LSCS under spinal anesthesia (SA). The patients were recruited between August 2012 and January 2013. Patients who refused SA, had any contraindication to regional anesthesia, history of drug allergy or chronic pain, a coagulation disorder or infection at the needle insertion site, a body mass index of &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or were unable to communicate in either English or Hindi language were excluded from this study. Patients in whom SA was inadequate for the conduct of surgery were also excluded from the study. The study was registered with Clinical Trials Registry of India (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ctri.nic.in">www.ctri.nic.in</ext-link>; CTRI/2013/10/004042).</p><p>Patients were divided into two equal groups of fifty each to receive either:</p><p>Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 50): TAP block with 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine bilaterally.</p><p>Group BC (<italic>n</italic> = 50): TAP block with 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine + 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg clonidine bilaterally (total dose-2.0 &#x000b5;g/kg).</p><p>Patients were allocated to the respective groups using a computer-generated random number table. Group allocation was concealed in serially numbered sealed, opaque envelopes that were opened in the operating theatre just prior to the administration of SA. The study drug was prepared and coded by an anesthesiologist not involved in the study. The patient and the anesthesiology resident administering the TAP block and involved in data collection were also blinded to group assignment. The code was broken after the completion of the study and statistical analysis.</p><p>After written informed consent, patients were made familiar with 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing worst imaginable pain before administering the block. Patients received a standard SA comprising hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine 1.8 ml with 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl. TAP block was performed under all aseptic precautions, in the lumbar triangle of Petit bilaterally once the surgery had ended, and the sensory block had receded to T10 level by pin prick. A loss of resistance (LOR) to air technique was used to locate the TAP. An 18G disposable Tuohy needle (<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> B Braun) was inserted perpendicular to the sagittal plane, behind the mid-axillary line in the triangle of petit, and the fascial planes localized with LOR to air.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The first LOR indicated that the needle had pierced the external oblique aponeurosis and the second LOR indicated entry into the transversus fascial plane. Patients in Group B (control group) received 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine followed by 2 ml of 0.9% saline bilaterally, after negative aspiration for blood. Patients in Group BC (study group) received 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine followed by 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg (total dose 2.0 &#x000b5;g/kg) of clonidine bilaterally. The clonidine dose was loaded in a separate 2 ml syringe in a volume made up to 2 ml with 0.9% saline for each side. After completion of the surgical procedure and block, patients were transferred to the postanesthesia care unit.</p><p>The duration of postoperative analgesia, defined as the time (in hours) from the giving of the TAP block to the time to the first analgesic request in the postoperative period was recorded. Degree of pain was observed using the VAS every 30 min for the first 2 h, then every hour for next 10 h and thereafter every 2 h till the patient demanded first dose of analgesia. The TAP block was deemed a failure if the patient requested analgesia within the first 2 h of administering the block, and the case was not included in analyses. Patients were given injection diclofenac 1 mg/kg intravenous (to a maximum of 3 mg/kg/day) on demand or if the VAS score was &#x02265;3. Sedation was evaluated along with VAS using a four-point ordinal scale (1 = Wide awake and alert, 2 = Awake but drowsy, responding to verbal stimulus, 3 = Arousable, responding to physical stimulus, 4 = Not arousable, not responding to physical stimulus). The presence of sedation was defined as a sedation score &#x0003e;1 at any postoperative time point. A four point patient satisfaction score (1 = Extremely satisfied, 2 = Satisfied, 3 = Dissatisfied, 4 = Extremely dissatisfied) was also noted. Other associated side effects such as dryness of mouth, hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;20% of baseline), and bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;60 bpm) were also observed. A note was made of the total analgesic consumption in the first 24 h after the block. All the observations were made by an anesthetist who was unaware of group allocation and blind to the study drug.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Outcome</title><p>The primary outcome was the duration of postoperative analgesia. Secondary outcomes were the total requirement of analgesics in the first 24 h postoperatively, patient satisfaction and possible clonidine side effects (dryness of mouth, sedation, hypotension, and bradycardia).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Based on 20 pilot cases done prior to the study, the duration of analgesia in Group B was 6.5 &#x000b1; 1.1 h and 12.5 &#x000b1; 4.5 h in Group BC. Sample size calculation based on this data had indicated that at least 25 patients in each group will be required to demonstrate a clinically significant difference (4 h) in the duration of postoperative analgesia with an &#x003b1; = 0.05 and a power of 99%. However, 50 patients were recruited in each trial arm in an attempt to collect data on side effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Analysis</title><p>The data were compiled, tabulated, and statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17 (Chicago, IL, USA). Unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for analysis of duration of analgesia and VAS at the time of administration of injection diclofenac.

Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 has been considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred patients were enrolled and randomized for the study. One patient from Group B was excluded after randomization due to conversion to general anesthesia. Groups were comparable in terms of age and body mass index. The triangle of Petit was located easily on palpation, the transversus abdominis neuro-fascial plane was localized after one to two attempts, and the TAP block performed without complication in all patients. The TAP block failed in three patients in Group BC and in two patients in Group B. These patients were excluded from the analysis. Thus, a total of 47 patients each were analyzed in Groups B and BC. Duration of analgesia was significantly longer in group BC (17.8 &#x000b1; 3.7 h; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17&#x02013;19 h) as compared to Group B (7.3 &#x000b1; 1.15 h; 95% CI: 7&#x02013;7.5 h; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

Belavy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and McDonnell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] investigated the effect of TAP block with 0.5% ropivacaine 20 ml bilaterally in patients undergoing cesarean section and reported improved postoperative pain scores, reduced postoperative opioid consumption and higher patient satisfaction. In a recent study, Eslamian <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that bilateral TAP block with 0.25% bupivacaine decreases postoperative pain and analgesic consumption with a longer time to the first analgesic rescue.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A meta-analysis by Abdallah <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that TAP block can provide effective analgesia when spinal morphine is contraindicated or not used in patients undergoing LSCS under SA.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>However, a few investigators, who have used long-acting intrathecal opioids, have not found TAP block to be advantageous as a modality for the multimodal analgesic regimen.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This may be due to the limited duration of action of TAP block and the superiority of intrathecal morphine over a TAP block in relieving the visceral component of cesarean delivery pain.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials has demonstrated that the addition of clonidine to local anesthetics significantly prolongs the duration of the motor block and postoperative analgesia when used for peripheral nerve and plexus blocks.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The reason for the prolonged effect seen with clonidine is not clear because &#x003b1;2 adrenoreceptors are not present on the axon of the normal peripheral nerve.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Laboratory studies have suggested that clonidine exerts an effect directly on the nerve fiber, as a result of a complex interaction between clonidine and axonal inotropic, metabolic, or structure proteins (receptors).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Another hypothesis that may explain prolonged analgesia with clonidine is the systemic absorption of the drug from TAP.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] This may explain sedation in 13 of the 47 patients in this group. Although the difference between the two groups was statistically significant, clinically, it was not relevant. Quite a few patients had been given a trial of labor and had prolonged labor pains. Also many were delivered at odd hours in the night. Although the patients were drowsy, they were responding to verbal commands and were able to breastfeed the babies. Thus, even with the use of clonidine, sedation did not in any way pose a clinical problem. Long hours of fasting and prolonged labor pains may have also contributed to dryness of mouth, which was comparable in the two groups. However, other systemic side effects of clonidine like bradycardia and hypotension were not observed. An extensive search of the literature revealed only one study describing the addition of clonidine to bupivacaine for TAP apart from ours. Bollag <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated wound hyperalgesia and long-term pain descriptors after cesarean delivery in women receiving an ultrasound guided bilateral TAP block with 0.375% bupivacaine with 75 &#x000b5;g clonidine on each side. They concluded that performing a TAP block with or without clonidine does not appear to confer any benefits in wound hyperalgesia or analgesic consumption.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>There are a number of limitations of this study. First, was limited the assessment of PO analgesia to the time patient first demanded analgesia in the postoperative period. Second, the inter-group VAS was not compared at different time points, thus limiting the objective assessment of the quality of anesthesia. Third, the study was not large enough to assess safety. There is a risk of inadvertent peritoneal puncture with this block, however small. We, however, have not encountered this complication in the TAP blocks we now routinely perform. The use of ultrasound to confirm needle position further reduces the risk of this complication, besides increasing the success rate and efficacy of the block. But many centers, including ours, still do not have access to this facility. The patients who were unable to communicate either in English or Hindi were not enrolled for the trial, thus limiting the patient base. Finally, we did not perform a dose-response study to determine if a lower dose of clonidine would lead to the same results.</p><p>We conclude that addition of clonidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg to 20 ml bupivacaine 0.25% in TAP block bilaterally for cesarean section provides 17&#x02013;19 h of postoperative analgesia, decreases postoperative analgesic requirement, and increases maternal comfort compared to 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% alone with minimal side effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carney</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonnell</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Ochana</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhinder</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Laffey</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The transversus abdominis plane block provides effective postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2008</year><volume>107</volume><fpage>2056</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19020158</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McMorrow</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Ni Mhuircheartaigh</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Aslani</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Conrick-Martin</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Comparison of transversus abdominis plane block vs spinal morphine for pain relief after Caesarean section</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2011</year><volume>106</volume><fpage>706</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21498494</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McDonnell</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Curley</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Heffernan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Power</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Laffey</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The analgesic efficacy of transversus abdominis plane block after abdominal surgery: A prospective randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2007</year><volume>104</volume><fpage>193</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17179269</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdallah</surname><given-names>FW</given-names></name><name><surname>Halpern</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Margarido</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Transversus abdominis plane block for postoperative analgesia after Caesarean delivery performed under spinal anaesthesia?
