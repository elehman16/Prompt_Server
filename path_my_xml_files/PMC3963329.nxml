Hydroxyethyl starch (hetastarch) is a synthetic colloid solution with adverse effects on blood coagulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of hetastarch in reducing thromboembolic events in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a double-blinded clinical trial, 60 brain tumor surgery patients were randomly divided into two groups and given 10 mL/kg hetastarch or normal saline during surgery. Blood coagulation was compared before and after infusion of these fluids within and between groups by thromboelastography (TEG).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There were no significant differences in bleeding (<italic>P</italic> = 0.126), duration of surgery (<italic>P</italic> = 0.504), and fluid intake (0.09L) between the two groups. Percentage of changes in R (R: Time to initiate fibrin formation), K (K: Measure of the speed taken to reach a specific level of clot strength), and Ly30 (Ly30: Percent of fibrin distraction after 30 minutes of clot formation) in the crystalloid group were -20.61 &#x000b1; 26.46, -30.02 &#x000b1; 49.10, and 1.27 &#x000b1; 22.63, and that in the colloid group were 22.10 &#x000b1; 26.11, 41.79 &#x000b1; 37.15, and 59.09 &#x000b1; 37.12, respectively. Deterioration in hemostasis during and after surgery was not observed.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>There was a reduction in the speed of clot formation and increase in clot lysis in the hetastarch group. Coagulability was decreased in the colloid group. Infusion of 10 mL/kg hetastarch in brain tumor resection surgeries can probably decrease susceptibility of these patients to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and thromboembolic events.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Brain tumor</kwd><kwd>hetastarch</kwd><kwd>hypercoagulability</kwd><kwd>thromboelastography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hypercoagulability is a well-known state in primary brain tumors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Inadvertent clot formation or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been reported during brain tumor surgeries.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Thrombotic complications [deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolization (DVT/PE)] occur in 18 to 50% of the patients harboring brain tumors who undergo neurosurgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Clinical risk factors associated with venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are paresis, prior thrombotic disease, chemotherapy, location, and histology of tumor.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Studies involving brain tumor tissue cell cultures have implicated factors released by the tumor or surrounding neural tissues that activate the coagulation system or inhibit fibrinolysis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>During surgeries, crystalloid and colloid solutions are used as volume expanders or for the replacement of blood loss.
