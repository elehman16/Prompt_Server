Randomized clinical trials evaluating the optimal glycemic level in T2D HF patients are lacking. Data from the UKPDS <xref rid="pone.0053247-Stratton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> trial showed that the risk of developing HF rose with increasing HbA1c in T2D patients. In contrast, the ACCORD trial <xref rid="pone.0053247-ACCORD1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> reported a significant increase in fluid retention and a non-significant increase in incident HF among T2D patients on strict glycemic control. Previous studies have investigated the effect of myocardial glucose (MGU) and FFA uptake modulation on left ventricular function by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamping or by reducing circulating FFA. However, these results have been conflicting <xref rid="pone.0053247-Halbirk1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0053247-Wiggers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of different glucose levels in HF and T2D patients remains scarce.</p><p>We hypothesized that short-term hyperglycemia by lowered insulin treatment as opposed to normoglycemia would have detrimental effects on left ventricular contractile function in T2D patients. Thus, in the present open-labeled, randomized cross-over-designed trials we aimed to investigate the cardiovascular effects of short-term hyperglycemia induced by insulin discontinuation as opposed to normoglycemia in T2D patients, and whether patients with HF responded differently than patients without HF. We studied left ventricular systolic and diastolic function by 2D- and tissue-Doppler echocardiography, hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and hall walk test. We found that insulin discontinuation is associated with an increase in myocardial systolic contractile function in T2D patients with and without HF and with prolonged walking distance in T2D-HF patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>The present investigation was conducted as two separate trials for safety reasons. We sought to determine whether short term hyperglycemia could cause clinical adverse effects (shortness of breath, dizziness etc.) before subjecting HF patients to these conditions. Moreover, we chose to investigate the HF patients in our Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark with staff specialized in cardiology if any severe adverse effects should occur. The T2D patients without HF (T2D-nonHF) were investigated at the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Thus, we enrolled T2D-nonHF patients between 2008 and 2010 in one trial, whereas T2D-HF patients were enrolled during 2010 in a second trial. The interventions and examinations described below were performed similarly in patients regardless of LVEF unless stated otherwise. However, additional investigations of whole-body and muscular metabolism were performed in the T2D-nonHF patients and have been published elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0053247-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

The present results argue against our hypothesis and were in part unexpected as deranged whole body metabolism is considered harmful in HF patients, particularly when HF coexists with diabetes <xref rid="pone.0053247-Haffner1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>The cardiovascular effects of reducing circulating FFA <xref rid="pone.0053247-Halbirk1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053247-Tuunanen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and modulating whole body and myocardial metabolism <xref rid="pone.0053247-Khoury1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053247-Wiggers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053247-Parsonage1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> have been inconsistent.

Prior investigations have mainly applied hyperinsulinemia and kept plasma glucose at approximately 5 mM <xref rid="pone.0053247-Khoury1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053247-Wiggers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053247-Parsonage1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, in the present studies, a rise in plasma glucose levels was accomplished by reducing insulin dosage by app. 70%. This increased plasma glucose by app. 100%, lowered insulin levels by app. 35%, and increased FFA by app. 35%. Hence, the resulting increase in myocardial contractile function supports that in the presence of circulating insulin, a short-term, ample glucose and FFA supply may have beneficial short-term effects. Catecholamines did not differ between normo- and hyperglycemia, and we observed no changes in systemic hemodynamics, which demonstrates the absence of any difference in vascular resistance. Weight and plasma volume were similar in both the study arms. This argues against any diuretic effect biasing our results.</p><p>We observed a negative correlation between glucose levels and myocardial contractile function during hyperglycemia. This we believe is due to the fact that T2D-nonHF had lower glucose levels and higher myocardial contractile function per se as opposed to T2D-HF patients in whom the glucose levels were highest and contractile function lowest.</p><p>In a previous study, we found no influence of circulating FFA and insulin on left ventricular contractile function in HF patients <xref rid="pone.0053247-Wiggers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We therefore find it less likely that the increase in circulating FFA and the reduced insulin levels contributed considerably to the present findings. Hence, we suggest that a short-term rise in plasma glucose levels induced by insulin discontinuation can improve the cardiac contractile function in T2D patients with and without HF independently of other major metabolic changes. This effect may be ascribed to an increase in MGU because of the glucose mass effect <xref rid="pone.0053247-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and a simultaneous reduction in FFA uptake and oxidation as described by Randle <xref rid="pone.0053247-Hue1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that MGU rises steeply during normoglycemia in parallel with insulin levels up to approximately 100 pmol/l <xref rid="pone.0053247-Botker1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Above this level, the increase in MGU is small; and we therefore hypothesize that the combination of short-term hyperglycemia and the presence of circulating insulin of app. 160 mmol/L as found in the present studies could further increase MGU by the glucose mass effect <xref rid="pone.0053247-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and increase the contractile function through metabolic effects. In addition, hyperglycemia increases intracellular calcium levels in cardiomyocytes independently of insulin. This could also have contributed to the present findings <xref rid="pone.0053247-Smogorzewski1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It is intriguing that a similar contractile response to hyperglycemia was observed in both patients with and without HF in spite of a larger increase in glucose levels in T2D-HF. This observation may be due to myocardial contractility increasing less in T2D-HF patients as compared toT2D-nonHF in response to hyperglycemia or due to a &#x0201c;saturation&#x0201d; of myocardial contractility in response to increasing glucose levels. Moreover, this finding also suggests that similar mechanisms are involved in the two patient categories.</p><p>A previous study reports that glucose levels acutely increased by glucose infusion in T2D patients with normal LVEF had no effect on global LV function <xref rid="pone.0053247-Frati1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, in the present studies more sensitive measurements based on tissue-Doppler velocity unambiguously demonstrated that left ventricular contractile function was higher during hyperglycemia than during normoglycemia.</p><p>Whether hyperglycemia induced by insulin discontinuation affects the function and performance of other organs, i.e. the lungs or muscles, and thereby improves walking distance and thus causes the present difference cannot be excluded <xref rid="pone.0053247-Gosselink1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, we chose to add both bicycle exercise test and 6-minutes hall walk test in the T2D-HF group as the latter is believed to reflect daily activity as opposed to laboratory exercise capacity <xref rid="pone.0053247-Olsson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, these tests contribute with different information. This, and the fact that nearly all TD2-HF patients ceased the exercise test due to knee/leg pain, may explain that the exercise capacity was not affected whereas the hall walk distance increased during hyperglycemia in the T2D-HF patients.</p><p>LVEF was unchanged. However, the effect on S'max may have clinical relevance. S'max has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in the general population <xref rid="pone.0053247-Mogelvang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The present studies therefore support that short-term ample availability of glucose and FFA caused by insulin discontinuation does not depress LVEF and may, as previously hypothesized <xref rid="pone.0053247-Taegtmeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, have beneficial short-term effects in patients with T2D and HF. Our present studies show that the glycemic level in T2D patients biases tissue-Doppler-derived indices of myocardial contractile function and should therefore be taken into account during the interpretation of such measurements in future clinical trials.</p><p>It should be emphasized that the present studies address short-term diabetic dysregulation, whereas long-term dysregulation involves different pathophysiological processes <xref rid="pone.0053247-Hue1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, previous long-term studies indicate that achieving tight glycemic control in diabetic patients does not significantly improve cardiac function. It may either have no beneficial effect or even paradoxically decrease LVEF in T2D-nonHF patients with coronary heart disease <xref rid="pone.0053247-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and increase death from cardiovascular disease although the number of microvascular complications is reduced <xref rid="pone.0053247-ACCORD1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053247-ADVANCE1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The present results are in accordance with these previous long-term findings and argue against the beneficial effects of tight glycemic control in T2D patients during an acute setting if increased myocardial contractile function is vital. However, based on the present studies we cannot conclude whether normoglycemia is detrimental or hyperglycemia is beneficial. This needs to be addressed in future trials.</p><p>The design of the studies resulted in variable glycemic levels during hyperglycemia as opposed to the well-controlled normoglycemic situation. Nevertheless, we find the design to be of clinical relevance as these opposite scenarios (hyperglycemia vs. normoglycemia) correspond to a lenient or tight glycemic strategy during hospitalization of T2D patients with reduced left ventricular contractile function. However, whether the long-term effect of tight as opposed to lenient glucose control on LVEF or contractile function is beneficial in T2D-HF patients requires a long-term randomized study.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>The possibility of a type 2 statistical error on LVEF must be considered. We used a cross-over design and sensitive echocardiographic techniques with two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements to address myocardial contractile function. This approach eliminated inter-patient and minimized intra-patient variation between study arms. Nevertheless, the present investigation is composed of two minor trials and thus it should be interpreted with caution. It is possible that the echocardiographic techniques used to assess volumes were insensitive to subtle changes in LVEF. However, our data consistently demonstrated that myocardial systolic contractile function was higher during hyperglycemia than during normoglycemia in T2D patients irrespective of whether the patients had normal or reduced LVEF.</p><p>Measurements of left ventricular contractile function were performed on two different versions of the Vivid GE echo-machines. To our knowledge no evidence suggests that this could bias the present results. Moreover, each patient was examined using the same echo-machine at both visits, the applied technics were similar, and all analyses were performed in the same matter and on the same platform (EchoPac 9).</p><p>We report on several correlations between myocardial contractile function, substrates and hormones. However, the present studies were designed to evaluate on the effect of overall metabolic derangement occurring during hyperglycemia due to insulin discontinuation. Thus, these correlations should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Euinsulinemic hyperglycemia at glucose levels of 12&#x02013;13 mM increases blood pressure and lowers heart rate and cardiac index in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0053247-Fugmann1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Such changes could potentially have affected our results. However, this seems unlikely since we observed no differences in heart rate or blood pressure between the study arms. Hyperglycemia could have caused diuresis and fluid depletion and thus have affected our measurements due to preload differences between the study arms. However, neither weight, plasma volume, E-wave nor e' velocity differed between the study arms which indicates that there were no differences in preload <xref rid="pone.0053247-Quintard1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>None of the T2D-HF patients as opposed to most of the T2D-nonHF patients were on metformin (biguanide) treatment. Metformin has been shown to have beneficial effects on left ventricular function in experimental models <xref rid="pone.0053247-Cittadini1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Whether this could have biased our results are unknown. We sought to lower the risk of this potential bias by pausing metformin 2 days prior to the investigations. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the long-term effects of metformin affected our results.</p><p>C-peptide differed between the study arms. It has been shown that C-peptide increases LVEF and myocardial perfusion in patients with type 1 diabetes and normal LVEF. Nevertheless, increased C-peptide levels had no vascular effects during preserved endogenous C-peptide production <xref rid="pone.0053247-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053247-Rigler1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Since all patients in the present studies had endogenous C-peptide production in both study arms, we find it unlikely that different C-peptide levels have biased our results.</p><p>Only 2 females were included. We cannot exclude that acute insulin discontinuation and hyperglycemia have different effects in males and females. However, at present, no study supports that there are any gender difference in myocardial contractile function in response to short-term hyperglycemia.</p><p>We did not apply the hall walk test in the T2D-nonHF group as we did not expect it to be compromised. However, we cannot exclude that hyperglycemia as opposed to normoglycemia would have caused an effect on this low-grade exercise test in T2D-nonHF patients. It should be emphasized that the T2D-HF patients primarily ceased the exercise test due to knee/leg pain and not due to dyspnea or physical exhaustion. Therefore, we believe the 6-MWT to be a better test of exercise in the present T2D-HF patients even though it is a low-grade exercise test reflecting daily life activity <xref rid="pone.0053247-Olsson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, these results should be interpreted with caution as the test was not applied in both study groups.</p><p>The T2D-nonHF group spent 3 hours more in each study arm as opposed to the T2D-HF group. Thus, we cannot rule out that the effect of hyperglycemia as opposed to normoglycemia may take longer to occur in the T2D-nonHF group. However, we believe the actual &#x0201c;interventions&#x0201d; were considerably longer than 9 and 12 hours as insulin dosage was reduced by app. 50% on the day of admittance and glucose levels already differed at time of the first glucose measurement at 12.00 midnight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053247-g003">figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We did not measure MGU. However, the feasibility of myocardial FDG-PET is known to be low if hyperinsulinemic clamp is not applied in T2D patients. Since we intended to investigate hyperglycemia as a result of insulin discontinuation as opposed to normoglycemia, we chose not to use FGD-PET in the present studies.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acute hyperglycemia induced by short-term insulin discontinuation surprisingly increases tissue-Doppler-derived indices of left ventricular contractile function in insulin-treated T2D patients with and without heart failure. Furthermore, acute hyperglycemia had no negative effects on LVEF or exercise capacity, and hyperglycemia was associated with a slight prolongation of walking distance by 6-minute hall walk test in T2D-HF patients. The exact mechanism of these findings and their potential clinical impact require further studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s7"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053247.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053247.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053247.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053247.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the staff at M-lab (Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark) and B4 (Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark) for skillful technical assistance and Associate Professor Bo Martin Bibby (Department of Medical Statistics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark) for statistical counseling.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0053247-Murarka1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
