One possible mechanism by which short sleep may predispose to weight gain is through alterations in appetite-regulating hormones, leading to increased food intake. Indeed, short-term experimental studies have consistently shown that sleep restriction increases caloric intake when free access to food is allowed (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, findings regarding the direct effects of sleep restriction on appetite-regulating hormones have been inconsistent. Although some studies have shown increased levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and decreased levels of the satiety hormone leptin (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) during controlled caloric intake, the majority of studies have reported that sleep restriction is not associated with these hormonal changes, as measured by a single morning blood sample (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or under <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding conditions (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These inconsistent findings may be due to methodological variations in feeding conditions during hormonal measurements (e.g. standardized vs. <italic>ad libitum</italic> caloric intake) or the timing and frequency of blood sampling. Likewise, it is possible that the effects of sleep restriction on appetite-regulating hormones may be undetectable when measurements are taken during uncontrolled caloric intake.</p><p id="P6">In the present study, we have first examined the effects of sleep restriction on frequently sampled 24-hour blood profiles of appetite-regulating hormones ghrelin, leptin and pancreatic polypeptide during standardized meals.

All participants had self-reported habitual bedtimes between 7.5 to 8.5 hours. Exclusion criteria were: history of any acute or chronic medical condition, current or past shift work, travel across time zones during the past 4 weeks, depressed mood (as assessed by a score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale above 16), use of any medications or supplements known to affect sleep or glucose metabolism, current smoking, excessive alcohol (&#x0003e;2 drinks per day) or caffeine (&#x0003e;300mg per day) consumption or abnormal findings on physical examination or routine laboratory testing. Sleep disorders were excluded by laboratory polysomnography. Normal glucose tolerance status was confirmed with a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. All participants had normal findings on routine laboratory tests (complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, lipid panel and hemoglobin A1c), as well as a 12-lead electrocardiogram. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Chicago approved the protocol and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. We previously reported the effects of sleep restriction on insulin signaling in adipocytes, total body insulin sensitivity, and 24-hour profiles of free fatty acids and lipolytic hormones from the participants who are included in this report (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Study protocol</title><p id="P8">Participants were studied under normal sleep and sleep restriction conditions in a randomized order spaced at least 4 weeks apart. Participants were admitted to the University of Chicago Clinical Research Center for the entire duration of the study. The normal sleep condition involved four consecutive nights of 8.5 hours in bed (2300 - 0730h) and the sleep restriction condition involved four consecutive nights of 4.5 hours in bed (0100 &#x02013; 0530h). During each sleep condition, body weight was measured with a digital scale (Scale-Tronix, Model 5002, Wheaton, IL) in the morning following all experimental nights except on the day of 24-hour blood sampling. Percent body fat was assessed by bioimpedance (Quantum X, RJL Systems, Clinton Township, MI) at the beginning of each sleep condition.</p><p id="P9">Sleep was recorded each night by polysomnography, as previously described (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Under both sleep conditions, participants remained in the laboratory and engaged in only sedentary activities (e.g. reading, watching TV, computer work, board or card games, etc.). Activity levels were measured continuously using accelerometer-based monitors attached to the wrist (Actiwatch; Philips-Respironics, Bend, OR) and waist (Actical; Philips-Respironics, Bend, OR). Research staff was continuously present to monitor wakefulness during scheduled wake periods. During the week preceding each laboratory period, participants maintained standardized bedtimes at home in accordance with their usual habits. Naps were not allowed. Compliance with this schedule was verified by continuous wrist activity monitoring and sleep diaries.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Standardized diet and 24-hour blood sampling</title><p id="P10">Blood samples were collected at 15 to 30 min intervals for 24 hours (from 2130h starting on the evening prior to the 3<sup>rd</sup> night of each condition) as previously described (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) for measurements of ghrelin, leptin and pancreatic polypeptide. At 1000h on the day following the 4<sup>th</sup> night of each sleep condition, a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed as previously described (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Diet was strictly controlled and caloric intake was identical under both sleep conditions from admission until the <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding period starting at 1500h on the day following the 4<sup>th</sup> night of each sleep condition. During the screening process, each study participant met with a registered dietitian to review the standardized diet and to determine if they had any food allergies or intolerances. Subjects&#x02019; individual energy requirements were determined using the Schofield equation (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The standardized study diet consisted of a two-day cycle menu of three isocaloric meals per day (55&#x02013;60% carbohydrate, 15&#x02013;20% protein and 30&#x02013;35% fat). Participants received identical carbohydrate-rich meals (68% carbohydrate, 12% protein and 20% fat) at 1900h prior to 24-hour blood sampling and at 0900h, 1400h and 1900h during blood sampling.

Participants were given a 1-hour period during both buffet meals without any distraction by the research team to eat as much as they wanted. Participants also had unlimited access to a snack bar between the two buffet meals. To allow for <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake, participants were presented with excessive portion sizes of all food items. A registered dietitian met with each participant to plan the buffet meals based on individual food preferences. For each buffet meal, participants were required to choose three entrees (e.g. hot or cold sandwich, pizza, pasta, hot meat, poultry or fish), two breads (e.g. bread, dinner roll), one raw vegetable (e.g. salad or raw vegetable plate), one cooked vegetable, one starch (e.g. rice or potato), two fruits, two dairy products (e.g. milk, cheese or yogurt), two desserts (one of which was chocolate), one non-caffeinated beverage and condiments. For the snack bar, participants were asked to choose a variety of ten items that they found appealing from the following food categories including sweets (e.g. cookies, candy, ice cream), salty snacks (e.g. chips, popcorn), starches (e.g. bread, bagels), dairy (e.g. yogurt, cheese), protein and meats (e.g. hummus, nut butter, beef jerky), fruits and vegetables (e.g. fresh, canned or dried fruit, fresh vegetables), and beverages (e.g. juice, soda). The same individually customized assortment of foods was given for all buffet meals and the snack bar in both sleep conditions.</p><p id="P12">Food was weighed before and after the buffet meals and snacking period to determine food consumption. The Food Processor SQL software (ESHA Research, Salem, OR) was used to calculate total caloric content and macronutrient composition of each food item. Food categories for snacks were defined as sweets, salty snacks, starches, fruits and vegetables, dairy, protein/meat, beverages and condiments/fats/oils. Participants were only permitted to consume food and beverages that were provided by the metabolic kitchen. Beverages containing caffeine were not allowed. All meals were prepared under the supervision of a registered dietitian from the metabolic kitchen at University of Chicago Clinical Research Center.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Hormonal Assays</title><p id="P13">Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C.

Plasma pancreatic polypeptide levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Alpco, Salem, NH) with the limit of sensitivity of 3 pmol/L with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of less than 3%.

The meal-related peak values for ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide were defined as the maximum concentration measured during the 60 min after each meal. The post-meal nadir values for ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide were defined as the minimum concentration measured between 60 and 240 min after each meal. The meal responses for ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide were calculated as the areas under the curve (AUC) during the 2.5 hours after each meal using the trapezoidal method. Nocturnal mean values for each hormone were calculated from the overnight fasting period between 2130h and 0900h. To quantify the 24-hour profiles of serum leptin, a best-fit curve was fitted for each individual profile using a robust locally weighted regression procedure with a 4-hour window (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The leptin amplitude was defined as half of the difference between the acrophase (maximum of the best-fit curve) and the nadir (minimum of the best-fit curve).</p><p id="P15">The effects of sleep restriction on all variables were assessed using a mixed model ANOVA with restricted maximum likelihood estimates of variance components.

Importantly, we have demonstrated that the increase in ghrelin levels during sleep restriction is associated with more consumption of calories when free access to food is allowed. This finding suggests that elevations in ghrelin may be a potential mechanism by which sleep restriction increases food intake. Ghrelin can activate homeostatic and reward-related pathways, leading to increased food intake (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, the current study was not designed to distinguish between the homeostatic vs. non-homeostatic pathways, and thus future studies will be needed to address this question. In support of the hypothesis that hedonic eating may be involved in overconsumption of food during sleep loss (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), neuroimaging studies have shown alterations in reward-related brain regions in sleep-deprived individuals (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Taken together, it is likely that multiple neural and hormonal systems are involved in the alterations in appetite and food intake in the context of sleep loss (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Additionally, due to the acute nature of our study, it remains unknown whether our current findings can be applied to chronic or repeated sleep restriction over a longer period or time.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, we have demonstrated that experimental sleep restriction in healthy young lean men results in elevated ghrelin levels, promoting increased food intake. These findings provide evidence for potential factors by which sleep loss may lead to increased weight gain and the development of obesity. Future mechanistic studies are needed to identify potential mediators in the link between increased food intake and insufficient sleep.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><p><bold>Funding</bold>:
