Prenatal leave taken routinely in uncomplicated pregnancies may protect against obstetric complications during labor and delivery, low birth weight and small for gestational age infants. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Maternity leave taken in the ninth month of pregnancy has been associated with a reduced risk of a primary cesarean section. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Similarly, delaying a return to work for at least 12 weeks postpartum has been shown to be associated with more timely well baby visits and infant immunization schedules, [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] longer duration of breastfeeding [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and with lower rates of postpartum depression and maternal depressive symptoms. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Despite the importance of maternity leave, many American women fail to take adequate advantage of this option. Nationally, most pregnant mothers work full time into their last month and about 40% return to work within three months after giving birth. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This amount of leave is short compared to that taken by women in most of the developed world. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This is not surprising because the United States (US) is the only industrialized country that does not offer paid leave. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) grants workers who meet strict eligibility requirements 12 weeks of unpaid, job protected leave, during which time they can prepare for, deliver and care for the newborn. In contrast, paid leave benefits in all other industrialized countries range from 13 weeks in Iceland to 45 weeks in Norway. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Given the lack of a universal maternity leave entitlement and wide variability of state and employer provisions, many American mothers lack information and support to make maternity leave decisions. Maternity leave requires weighing potential advantages and disadvantages of leave-taking and choosing between alternative courses of action for which there is no right or wrong answer. As a result, decision-making may pose a dilemma or conflict. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Inadequate knowledge, unrealistic expectations about leave, unclear values, social pressure, inexperience with negotiating in the workplace, and lack of financial and childcare resources may also contribute to decisional conflict. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Complex regulations that govern maternity leave benefits and the need to navigate these regulations can also interfere with decision-making. FMLA applies only to employees who work at companies with 50 or more employees and who have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the year preceding childbirth. Consequently, only about 20% of new mothers and 50% of all mothers are covered by FMLA. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] State laws vary in coverage of workers in government and small companies and in the generosity of leave. California is one of five (out of 50) U.S. states that offer mothers paid prenatal and postnatal leave through temporary disability insurance (State Disability Insurance (SDI) in California). Funded through employee contributions, SDI provides partial pay up to 4 weeks prior to delivery and 6 to 8 weeks after childbirth with an extension for up to an additional 6 weeks postpartum through the Paid Family Leave program (PFL). SDI is not job-protected leave, although in many cases leave-takers get additional protections under FMLA. For mothers covered by these laws, job-protected (unpaid) and paid leave must be taken concurrently. Employees also must coordinate sick pay and vacation pay from the employer with pay from the state through SDI and PFL. While some companies voluntarily provide paid time off for maternity leave or offer the opportunity to purchase maternity leave coverage from insurance providers, these practices are limited. Evidence shows that public awareness of SDI and PFL programs in California is low, especially among low income, minority and young respondents,[<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggesting need for education and outreach to promote maternity leave uptake. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Although some decision-making tools that promote awareness of maternity leave options are available online, we could not find any that covered information about California-specific maternity leave laws or the health benefits of taking leave that have been formally evaluated. Responding to this gap, the objective of our project was to develop an easy-to-use, evidence-based educational resource and evaluate whether it raised awareness about maternity leave and mobilized users to plan and take leave. The tool was developed through a cooperative agreement between University of California, Berkeley&#x02019;s School of Public Health and the March of Dimes (a national non-profit organization that promotes healthy birth outcomes), California Chapter. The intent was to integrate this tool into national worksite wellness programs and resources offered by the March of Dimes. In this paper we 1) describe the participatory development of the maternity leave educational tool; 2) present the results of a pilot evaluation of the tool with pregnant women using a low-exposure, low-cost intervention intended to elicit interest in reading the tool and facilitating decisions about prenatal and postnatal leave; and 3) discuss challenges and recommendations for future dissemination and evaluation of the tool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Five Steps Towards the Development of the Maternity Leave Educational Tools (<xref rid="pone.0129472.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>)</title><fig id="pone.0129472.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0129472.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Development and Evaluation of the Maternity Leave Tool.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0129472.g001"/></fig><sec id="sec008"><title>Literature review and content of tool</title><p>We reviewed the literature about the health impact of taking prenatal and postnatal leave on both mother and child.

In addition, information that is more comprehensible and actionable should emphasize what people can do, rather than just what they should know and provide information about where they can get help. A second important recommendation is that materials should be created and tested with the participation of the intended beneficiaries and relevant stakeholders. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Such participatory design processes include engaging users and stakeholders to identify problems about understanding and acting on health issues, and to work with experts to co-develop and test information that meets their needs. Participatory, or &#x0201c;user-centered&#x0201d; design processes usually require several rounds of developing and refining prototypes before a testable version is produced. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Health communication materials created with participatory design and with health literacy principles have shown significantly improved decisional outcomes.

Pilot evaluation findings from the randomized controlled trial show that the tool helped to raise awareness about maternity leave and effectively mobilized participants to take action. Concretely, over half of the online intervention group participants read the tool and almost two-thirds reported learning something new from the tool. Furthermore, for nearly half of the intervention arm participants, the tool helped them plan their leave, nearly 40% reported calling a telephone number listed in the tool to find more information, and 11% took the tool to confer with doctors or human resource representatives. Raising awareness about maternity leave and mobilizing participants to take action are important first steps in a country like the U.S., and even in a progressive state like California, where maternity leave uptake is much lower than many other industrialized countries. In addition, the results of the intervention can be considered positive in the context of evidence about the effects of &#x0201c;low-touch,&#x0201d; mass media, online health communication and considering that the trial enrolled primarily highly educated, affluent participants, many of whom knew about maternity leave prior to receiving the tool.</p><p>Results also indicate that both prenatal and postnatal leave uptake and duration were higher overall among intervention than control participants, but did not reach statistical significance, perhaps because the sample was too small. Unlike changes in awareness, changes in maternity leave uptake may be more difficult to achieve given that choices in California are constrained by eligibility laws, informational barriers and economic factors in so far as paid programs only offer up to 55% of wage replacement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.edd.ca.gov">www.edd.ca.gov</ext-link>) and there is lack of job protection for employees not covered by FMLA. Alternatively, among the more educated women in our sample, most of whom worked for large employers covered by FMLA, we may have observed a reduced responsiveness to change because these women may have already received information and made decisions about maternity leave.</p><p>Nonetheless, the tool did achieve some modest results in improving maternity leave uptake. Among participants who delivered at term and said the tool helped them plan their leave, 89% took more than one week of prenatal leave, a significantly higher proportion than among controls who did not receive the tool. Previous studies have shown benefits of prenatal leave uptake for healthy women who deliver at term, including lower risk of primary cesareans and other obstetric complications [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and lower risk of preterm delivery among women employed in physically strenuous jobs. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Because in California paid prenatal leave cannot be transferred to the postpartum period, taking leave before the child is born does not limit opportunities for maternal-infant bonding after birth.</p><p>The study had several limitations. The tool is designed to raise awareness and utilization of maternity leave in California and its value to other industrialized countries where maternity leave is paid and widely accepted as the norm, may be limited. Application in other states within the US will require adaptation to state-specific laws. Our sample size for evaluating the tool was small. We now estimate that in order to detect a seven-day difference in postpartum leave between intervention and control group (as observed in this pilot), a larger study of approximately 1000 to 1300 women will be required. We found it very difficult to engage health care providers as partners in recruiting participants and relied on various community sources and online venues for recruitment. Our screening procedures were not initially able to detect false online enrollment information provided by enrollees, requiring us to drop them from the online study after enrollment once reliability checks could be performed. As a result, the online survey sample size was smaller than intended.</p><p>Although we used health literacy principles to ensure that questions were easy to understand and answer, the online survey instrument was not validated. Survey participants tended to be well-educated, English speakers and not fully representative of Californian pregnant, working women. Although we recruited a diverse group of women, online participants who read the tool tended to be young, non-Asian and part-time workers. Future evaluations will require assessing the impact of the tool among full-time workers and non-affluent, multi-racial, and non-English-speaking, working pregnant women. Furthermore, it is possible that more intervention participants would have used the tool in planning the length and timing of their leave if it had been provided earlier.</p><p>A further issue, supported by the findings of health communication studies, is that having information from a trusted source is often important when people need to understand and make decisions about health risks and benefits. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] A stand-alone website, like the one used in this study, would not meet that criterion. Therefore, providing this information in a &#x0201c;mediated&#x0201d; way&#x02014;given out by a trusted health care provider, an employer, a human resource representative, or some other way that connects the recipient to a person or organization&#x02014;might encourage more women to read it and to trust the information that they read. [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The tool could be posted on websites where pregnant women might seek out information about pregnancy and maternity leave, e.g., the March of Dimes website or a legal aid center website. The tool could also be incorporated into larger scale information campaigns for pregnant women, such as the California First 5 Kit for New Parents (educational resources disseminated to hundreds of thousands of expectant and new parents each year in California). [<xref rid="pone.0129472.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Furthermore, the tool could be incorporated into human resources materials for employees, including a company&#x02019;s internal website or wellness program for employees. Future studies will need to evaluate the impact of the tool on employer readiness and employment-related behaviors.</p><p>In summary, this maternity leave tool showed promising results for use, reported learning and planning leave among pregnant women who used it during their late second and third trimesters. By developing and evaluating a California-specific maternity leave tool that provides information on laws and health benefits of taking leave, this study succeeded in filling a gap in the health educational materials currently available to pregnant, working women.</p><p>Based on these study findings, we recommend that the tool be distributed to pregnant women earlier, perhaps as early as their first trimester and that it be distributed in a mediated way through a health or work organization to which women are connected or embedded in other motivating materials about pregnancy. We also recommend that this first phase evaluation be followed up with research to test the tool using mediated distribution among a larger sample of pregnant working women. Reducing informational barriers and allowing women to more easily navigate the complicated regulations that govern maternity leave in California, might help women access a benefit that is far less available than it is for working women in other industrialized countries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the assistance of Nap Hosang, MD who worked closely with Dr. Guendelman on developing the initial content of the maternity leave educational tool, as well as Shayla Livingston, Dora Alvarez, Beccah Rothschild, and Kathy Simpson for their contributions to the development and evaluation of the tool.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0129472.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
