Renal involvement is one of the most serious and most common problems of patients in lupus susceptibility so that in America, approximately 35% of patients with SLE blurt lupus nephritis symptoms at the time of initial diagnosis, and 50&#x02013;60% during the first 10 years of their disease.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Today, the World Health Organization classification methods for lupus nephritis have been accepted by most renal and pathology experts and severity of lupus nephritis which is assessed with SLEDAI-2K standard is the estimator of patients&#x02019; future, but for the diagnosis of lupus nephritis patients we can&#x02019;t only rely on clinical findings such as proteinuria, increases in serum creatinine, and urinary active sediment, since clinical signs are not sufficient and reliable predictors to determine the nature of lupus nephritis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Other kidney diseases that damage the kidneys tissue and create clinical symptoms should be evaluated and ruled out.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Renal biopsy is an essential step in determining the nature of renal involvement in SLE. The classification of lupus nephritis decision of treatment is strongly related to renal biopsy findings of these patients. According to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification, six conflict classes are defined for lupus nephritis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, some physicians believe that the clinical diagnosis of lupus nephritis is easily possible and without having histological evidences, we can evaluate the treatment and patient's prognosis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Of course, this issue is controversial, and another group of physicians consider repeated renal biopsy as an obligatory for the certainty of disease even on proven lupus nephritis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In addition, relapse occurs even after an initial complete remission in lupus nephritis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A group of experts suggests renal biopsy as a proper approach for recurrent lupus nephritis[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and others consider the need for repeating the biopsy, depending on the lupus nephritis in initial biopsy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Patients with proliferative lesions in the initial biopsy rarely in recurrent lupus nephritis change into pure non-proliferative lesions and therefore do not need re-biopsy. But in patients with non-proliferative lesions on initial biopsy in the recurrence of lupus nephritis transfer to other classes is commonly observed and repeated biopsy is justifiable.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In addition, from the view point of treatment guidelines, there is no distinction between classes III and IV, thus class change of proliferative has no significant impact on treatment proceedings. Similarly, the addition or unperceptive of class V in second biopsy in a person who has a previous proliferative injury does not have significant impact on the treatment of choice.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Thus, the disease prognosis depends largely on proliferative lesions,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] so only changing from proliferative form into non-proliferative forms i.e. class III to class V or vice versa which has treatment differences and different consequences and doing a biopsy enhance the chances of their detection and reinforces the biopsy theory. When attempt to re-biopsy is still controversial, continuous follow-up of patient along with periodic review (urine protein/creatinine ratio, increased creatinine and increased proteinuria) has great importance.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, based on the controversies that exist about the effectiveness of biopsy repetition, the present study was performed to determine the impact of treatment decisions and outcome of patients with lupus nephritis relapsed disease and its comparison with clinical symptom-based decisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study is a descriptive analytical study which was conducted in 2012&#x02013;13 in the Alzahra hospital. The population studies included patients with lupus nephritis who had referred to the rheumatology clinic of this center due to nephritis relapse treatment. Inclusion criteria were known risk for SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, lupus nephritis on biopsy, relapse after previous remission, renal insufficiency at the time of reference, non-pregnant and the patient agreement to participate in the study. Also, in the case of patient withdrawal from further participation in the study and the absence of patients before the end of the treatment (e.g., death, immigration, etc.) they were excluded.</p><p>In this study, 52 patients with lupus nephritis who previously treated during the year 2012 and 2013 and their disease had relapsed again were divided into two groups of 26 each and assessment of disease severity and treatment program in the first group was determined based on clinical and laboratory feature and in the second group was determined based on re-biopsy of the kidney. All patients were studied after 3 and 6 months.</p><p>All lupus nephritis patients were diagnosed with renal biopsy and had gone into remission by treatment but due to the discontinuation of treatment and other causes have relapsed. The relapse of disease was determined due to the existence of proteinuria more than 0.5 g per day or more than 3+ on dipstick, cell casts like red blood casts in the survey of urinary sediment, random samples of urine protein to creatinine ratio was greater than 0.5 and active urinary sediment. The procedure was in a way that at the beginning, demographic data, clinical and laboratory symptoms and pathology results were extracted from the patients&#x02019; files and registered in the special check list.</p><p>The first group was treated based on clinical and laboratory symptoms and the second group was treated based on re-biopsy.

In this method, a dose of cyclophosphamide 0.5&#x02013;0.75/m<sup>2</sup> up to 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> with maintaining the levels of white blood cells higher than 3000/ml (for 7 to 10 days after infusion) for 6 months or mycophenolate mofetil MMF (cellcept) with doses of 250 to 500 mg started twice daily and increased to the dose of 2&#x02013;3 gram per day. Then for the maintenance treatment of patients CsA (cyclosporin A), MMF, and AZA drugs were used. In order to treat of class V in the case of mild to moderate (pure membranous and proteinuria &#x0003c; 2 g/day), low dose corticosteroids + ACE inhibitor and if mixed membranous and proliferative histology or the amount of creatinine in plasma during relapses increased 30% than before offensive treatment started. Then their relationship with laboratory findings (BUN, Cr, ANA, ds-DNA, C3, C4, CH50, U/A, cast and proteinuria), and treatment and recurrence outcome were compared between the two groups.

Previous studies and experiences have shown that renal biopsy due to the invasive nature, time consuming and expense is hardly accepted by the patients. Many rheumatologists believe that initial biopsy is necessary to determine the pathology of kidney tissue, the grade of disease and extent of damage to the kidney tissue and the patient's treatment plan is arranged according to laboratory findings, pathologic and physical examination of patients due to various reasons such as the lack of continuity of treatment and follow-up release, etc. In many patients with lupus nephritis, the disease re-ignites and causes acute symptoms such as urea and creatinine and proteinuria and reduced renal function (GFR).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>According to our study, transforming from relapse to remission in 3 months after intervention, in the one or two biopsy groups was similar but 6 months later, in the one biopsy group was higher than the two biopsy group. Various rheumatologists believe that kidney re-biopsy is necessary in order to determine the severity of disease but there is no consensus since other rheumatology specialists believe that therapeutic decisions on recurrence level based on clinical and laboratory findings is sufficient for controlling the disease and pushing it to remission mode. On the other hand, studies have shown that approximately 35% of patients with SLE, show the symptoms of lupus nephritis at the time of initial diagnosis, and 50 to 60% at first 10 years of their disease[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and for the detection of lupus nephritis usually one cannot only rely on clinical findings such as proteinuria, increase in serum creatinine, urinary active sodium in other words, these are not reliable clinical predictor for lupus nephritis nature.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Based on the results of our study, the severity of the disease in both single and double biopsy regarding to treatment programs in the 3 and 6 months after the treatment was almost similar in the two groups, therefore, renal re-biopsy was not significant in the adoption of treatment provided to patients, thus according to the clinical findings and laboratory one can adopt an appropriate treatment for the patient and no need is felt for re-biopsy of the kidney. A study conducted by Yazdi <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) has also shown no significant difference between laboratory findings and histological findings of renal involvement in lupus nephritis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Other results of our study showed that class switches during lupus nephritis flares were more frequent in patients with non-proliferative lesions in their re-biopsy but no proliferative lesions in the original biopsy switch to pure non-proliferative lesions in re-biopsy and no statistically difference between the first and second biopsies. One study that done by Daleboudt <italic>et al</italic>. showed that patients with proliferative lesions in the original biopsy rarely switch to a pure non-proliferative nephritis during a flare.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, a repeat biopsy during a lupus nephritis flare is frequently not necessary if proliferative lesions were found in the reference for over 25 years to perform a biopsy before treating renal flares.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Our study showed that decrease in the severity of proteinuria, urine sediment and SCr and increase in GFR during the treatment period had similar results in both groups.</p><p>Providing a treatment program based on repeated biopsy or based on laboratory and clinical findings had no effect on patient remission. However, similar results were also obtained by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. and according to their study, repeated biopsy had no effect on the outcome of patients and no need was felt to repeat it. However, in the study of Wang, Yao and Hsieh it has been concluded that re-biopsy in patients with lupus nephritis may be beneficial in adopting the proper treatment.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Urinary parameters such as proteinuria, hematuria, WBC, RBC, and cast in both groups showed during the treatment period that there are no significant changes in these parameters. Finally, providing treatment based on renal re-biopsy in first group and clinical and laboratory findings in the second group had the same results in the treatment of patients, so that 3 months after treatment 13 patients from a single biopsy group and 9 of the twice biopsy group had gone on complete remission and review on 6 months after the treatment showed that in one biopsy group 19 patients and in two biopsy group 24 patients had gone into complete remission and in this interval the non-responders were 5 patient in the biopsy group and 6 patient in the two biopsy group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Therefore, the overall conclusion that can be driven from this study is that treatment decisions based on re-biopsy of the kidney or clinical and laboratory findings in patients who relapsed after initial treatment had no significant effect on the recovery of patients and based on the results of this study the outcome was similar in the two groups and since re-biopsy damage the tissue of kidney thus is hardly accepted by patient and in addition to the expenses sometimes consumes the time and cause the resumption of therapy, adoption of a treatment plan in patients with lupus nephritis is recommended based on clinical and laboratory finding and the discretion of the physician and if possible, kidney re-biopsy should be avoided.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of
