Similar to other resource-poor nations facing the integration of PMTCT into routine pregnancy and infant care, efforts in South Africa to scale up PMTCT and reduce transmission to &#x0003c; 5% have fallen far short of the UN goal of 50% reductions in paediatric HIV by 80% coverage of mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Bringing transmission rates below 5% represents potentially saving 75,000 babies of the 300,000 exposed to HIV annually. Mpumulanga Province, the focus of the current application, has consistently had one of the lowest rates of PMTCT; 69% of pregnant women received PMTCT services in 2009. Despite increases in uptake in other regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] Mpumalanga has the highest HIV prevalence (4.5%) among children (0-18 years) in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. PMTCT program failure occurs at all stages of the process in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Implementation of PMTCT programs in already overburdened clinical settings presents multiple challenges, including systemic (e.g., failure to offer ARV prophylaxis, home delivery), social (e.g., stigma, lack of disclosure), individual (e.g., maternal failure to ingest medication or provide it to the infant, failure to obtain antenatal testing) and interpersonal (e.g., lack of male involvement, intimate partner violence) factors. Increasing male participation as a method to enhance implementation of PMTCT and increase uptake of and commitment to the medical protocol for pregnancy and newborn care has been identified as a potentially critical strategy for PEPFAR countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This application proposes an implementation strategy to test whether male involvement will increase PMTCT uptake utilizing the existing public health program linking antenatal HIV Counselling and Testing (HCT) and PMTCT services.</p><p>Male involvement is also essential due to a related issue, the disturbingly high rate of HIV seroconversion (3%) during pregnancy in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This suggests the continuation of unprotected high risk sex during the middle to latter stages of pregnancy may go undetected for the purposes of PMTCT unless women are re-tested just prior to delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Again, male involvement in the antenatal/HCT process may also influence and reduce risk of HIV exposure during this critical period. Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) has played the major role in reducing child mortality associated with HIV/AIDS and improving maternal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral therapies to reduce transmission have been implemented in the most HIV affected countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The PMTCT program in South Africa consists of comprehensive counselling, HIV-testing and the offer of ARV prophylaxis for seropositive mothers and their newborns and referral of HIV positive mothers and their families for CD4 count assessment for antiretroviral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, despite the widespread availability of PMTCT, not all mothers provided with medication take it themselves or provide it to their newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] due to a variety of circumstances, including unwillingness or perceived inability to disclose their HIV status to their partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Mother to child transmission rates range from 12% to &#x0003e; 20% in South Africa and drop out is high at all stages of the PMTCT process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>To date, HCT for pregnant women has largely been organized on an individual and sex-specific basis in PMTCT programs, typically ignored by male partners. However, a couples approach to HCT and antenatal care facilitates communication about HIV serostatus, thereby reducing one of the major barriers to acceptance of ARV prophylaxis by mothers for themselves and their newborns, as well as encouraging adoption of preventive behaviours within couples to reduce HIV incidence during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] The need for male involvement in the PMTCT process has been increasingly encouraged to improve adherence to ARV prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] though no randomized clinical trials of the influence of male partners as key contributors to acceptance and PMTCT uptake have been conducted. HCT and prevention strategies for couples in stable relationships could also strengthen HIV prevention efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in Southern Africa, where the majority of HIV infections occur in stable relationships. Prevention programs to increase male involvement in Tanzania, Botswana and Zambia have met with some success, e.g., Tanzania found male involvement increased NVP uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], Botswana utilized a media campaign and increased male involvement from 4% to 11%, and Zambia utilized monetary incentives and couples counselling and increased male involvement in PMTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In Cote d'Ivoire, prenatal couple counselling and testing improved couples' communication on sexual risks among both HIV positive and negative women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In Kenya, partner participation in HCT and couples counselling increased Nevirapine and formula feeding uptake among women attending antenatal clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and partner attendance to 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In Rwanda and Zambia, couples HCT led to enhanced follow up among pregnant women at both sites but did not increase Nevirapine uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, while PMTCT attendance by both members of a couple is feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], uptake remains limited by lack of male participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] highlighting the need to increase communication within the couple about reproduction and sexual health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]</p><p>Men's attitudes regarding involvement in PMTCT and antenatal care (ANC) programs have been linked to cultural barriers, including the perception that male participation in ANC/PMTCT services is superfluous and that ANC is "a woman's responsibility" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Additionally, men in Tanzania were found to have general HIV knowledge but to lack specific information regarding PMTCT and unable to attend PMTCT programs due to timings which conflict with their work schedules. Similarly, in Zambia, men were perceived as decision makers in the home and felt their position was undermined if they were expected to attend a "women's clinic program", leading them to decline to attend ANC and PMTCT with their partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], with as few as 2% attending urban ANC (personal communication, Provincial Health Office, Lusaka, Zambia). In Botswana, men regarded ANC health facilities as being "generally unfriendly" to them. Most recently, a review of studies incorporating men suggested that male "support" as well as "involvement" is key to increasing PMTCT uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]</p><p>As noted, 3% of women in South Africa seroconvert during pregnancy following receipt of HIV negative test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Following diagnosis, partners may not disclose their serostatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or protect an uninfected partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] These data highlight the urgent need to incorporate strategies in conjunction with the PMTCT process to prevent HIV transmission to mothers during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This team's previous research in the US and Zambia has found that a gender specific group, sexual behaviour intervention designed to increase couples communication, <italic>the Partner Project</italic>, enhanced the acceptability and use of sexual barrier products (male and female condoms) among HIV seropositive men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We also increased need for multiple session interventions among those in serodiscordant relationships, who appear to represent a unique population within those couples living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The Partner Project, currently being implemented in community health clinics across Zambia by CDC Zambia, has achieved 95-100% retention of enrolled couples over 6 months and 90-95% over 12 months and maintained comparative levels of participation by both men and women throughout the intervention.</p><sec><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of combining two evidence-based interventions: a couple's risk reduction intervention with an evidence based medication adherence intervention to enhance male participation in combination with improving medication and PMTCT adherence in antenatal clinics (ANCs) to increase PMTCT overall reach and effectiveness.

Gert Sibande district had the highest antenatal HIV prevalence (38.9%) in Mpumalanga; 52% of those mothers identified as positive took Nevirapine to prevent vertical HIV transmission in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. HCT uptake overall is 70% in Mpumalanga province and below 50% in Gert Sibande District. The delivery rate in health facilities is approximately 70%, well below the South African average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Clinic sites will be comparable by South African criteria for PMTCT sites: on-site counselling and testing for HIV &#x00026; private room for HCT; daily availability of HCT; referral to ARV site &#x00026; CD4 count testing; ARV prophylaxis; antenatal counselling on infant feeding; postnatal counselling and support for infant feeding &#x00026; free infant formula; PCR testing for infants for HIV; at least two trained PMTCT staff and two lay counsellors; and a support group specific to HIV-positive mothers and pregnant women.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a group-randomized controlled trial using a 2 &#x000d7; 6 comparison (Clinic, Experimental, Control &#x000d7; Time, Baseline, Post-Intervention, Pre-delivery 32 weeks, Pre-delivery day, Delivery, Post Partum). Twelve community health centres in communities within the Gert Sibande and Nkangala Districts in Mpumalanga, South Africa will be randomly assigned to condition in a 1:1 ratio. Six usual care condition clinics will provide the standard of care, PMTCT; six experimental condition clinics will offer PartnerPlus to mothers completing HIV testing, regardless of serostatus, who are willing to enrol with their male partners and participate in the integrated PartnerPlus intervention. This study will recruit 240 couples (n = 480 individuals); community clinics will recruit 2 cohort per clinic over 3 months (10 couples per cohort, n = 40, 120 individuals per condition) (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PartnerPlus Study Flowchart</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-11-778-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Study hypotheses</title><sec><title>Hypothesis 1</title><p>Community clinics implementing PartnerPlus will have more effective PMTCT program adherence, as measured by maternal and paternal ANC and PartnerPlus visits, maternal and paternal HCT uptake, maternal and infant Nevirapine and AZT dose uptake, infant PCR, maternal and infant HIV serostatus.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis 1a</title><p>Community clinics implementing PartnerPlus will have reduced sexual risk behaviour, as measured by participant sexual barrier use.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Principles for recruitment</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p><bold><italic>Community health centres </italic></bold>with a high antenatal care clinic case-load (based on statistics collected by the Department of Health) in each of the two study districts with a high burden of antenatal HIV will be included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Eligible participants will be male and female. Women: a) pregnant women age 18 and older who have received HCT at the ANC, b) willing to attend PartnerPlus or PMTCT visits with their male partners, c) male partners must also be available to participate and d) both partners must be willing to participate in the study. Men: a) men aged 18 and older who are partners of pregnant women enrolled in the study, b) willing to attend PartnerPlus or PMTCT visits with their female partners, c) female partners must also be enrolled in the study and available to participate. All female participants must have received HIV counselling and testing. In the event that a participant has refused to know their status, they will continue to be eligible as long as the results of testing are provided to the study through clinic records. All participants will be current adult residents of Mpumalanga Province and agree to attend four group sessions, 2 psychosocial assessments and 1 within 7 days post-delivery assessment (maternal and infant only - blood sample assessment).</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Women who are not currently pregnant or are unwilling to receive HCT are not eligible for this study. Women whose partners are not willing to participate are not eligible for this study. Men whose pregnant partners are unwilling to participate are not eligible for this study. Women and men who are not couples are not eligible to participate. Participants unable to provide informed consent will not be eligible.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Clinics will be randomly assigned as PartnerPlus sites or standard of care sites, stratified by antenatal care clinic case load. Randomization will be conducted using a secure remote randomization service. Each of the 2 communities will have six community health centre sites participating in the study. PartnerPlus community health centres will offer the PartnerPlus (Partner plus PMTCT standard of care); standard of care community health centres will offer the standard of care, PMTCT, and a time matched session. The time matched group session will consist of a video on health education issues. Participants in both conditions will receive time matched interventions and identical compensation. Each clinic will recruit a total of 1 cohort during a 3 month period.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants (clinic staff members and clinic patients) will not be blind to their intervention status. However, to protect against information biases in reporting sexual behaviour and ARV adherence behaviour, the data collection team who will assess the outcomes will be blind to the clinic's status as intervention or control intervention arm.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Men and women in the local community will be recruited to work as "Peer Mentors" (men) and "Lay Counsellors" (women) in the project. Recruitment of Peer Mentors and Lay Counsellors will be done with the assistance of nurses at the clinics, community leaders, and HIV/AIDS coordinators at the district level, who will be briefed on the objectives of the project. After recruitment, Mentors and Counsellors will be trained over five days on PMTCT, gender issues and facilitation skills and 10 days in HCT, and will participate as group leaders.</p><p>Participants (N = 240 couples) will be recruited in 2 communities through six community health clinics in each community. At the ANC, following VCT, participants will be informed about the study and referred for participation if interested. Following initial contact with prospective participants, study staff will obtain a medical and social (couple) history to determine initial eligibility for the study. Couples will complete a couples status verification questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] Couples are interviewed separately for couple eligibility, and are asked a short series of rotating questions related to couple-specific issues e.g., "who sleeps next to the window? What colour is your blanket?" Staff will compare responses to access couple responses and qualify or disqualify couples at this point. Couples are not notified of the reason for ineligibility but are advised that they have not met eligibility requirements, and are compensated for the visit and thanked for their interest in the study. Those meeting basic study criteria will be invited to provide and sign the Informed Consent form. Participants will then complete a baseline psychosocial and behavioural assessment and be scheduled for their next visit. All questionnaire data are obtained by being read to the participants to eliminate potential confounds related to literacy.</p><sec><title>Consent</title><p>As participants can choose to participate in the intervention or continue to receive the standard of care, it is not necessary to consent the entire ANC patient population in each clinic. Only women who have completed HCT will be approached to participate in the study with their male partners. Informed consent will be obtained which will include permission to give the contact details to the research staff, access to medical file information, participate in the experimental or control condition, tape recording of intervention sessions and psychosocial interview and blood specimen collection assessment procedures. To ensure comprehension of both literate and illiterate participants, the informed consent will be reviewed in detail (<underline>actually read </underline>to the prospective participant in their primary language) and each study candidate will be asked to sign the form after agreeing to its terms. Witnesses to consent will be drawn from study staff. Participants will have been briefed on the nature of the study prior to referral for informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Standard of Care and health education videos</title><p>According to the South African guidelines for standard of care all pregnant women should be routinely offered HIV counselling and testing and encouraged to have partner or spouse testing.</p><p>HIV seronegative. Following a negative HIV test, women should have post-test counselling and counselling on risk reduction interventions including involvement of partners or spouses, focusing mainly on how to maintain their HIV-negative status. They should continue to receive routine antenatal care, and should be encouraged to use condoms. They should be offered a repeat HIV test at or around 32 weeks gestation, to detect those who may have sero-converted during pregnancy.</p><p>HIV seropositive. Following a seropositive HIV test, pregnant women should be assessed for CD4 at the laboratory. Women are routinely counselled on safer sex, family planning, postnatal contraception and partner testing. Women are provided with ARV regimens for PMTCT. This is followed by a second visit, at which time the clinic Physician may prescribe ARVs if WHO guidelines for ARV introduction are met (CD4 &#x0003c; 350). HIV seropositive patients are monitored by the healthcare worker at the antenatal clinic until 6 weeks post-partum, at which time they are referred to the appropriate facility.</p><p>Study participants, women and men, will view educational videos currently being used in the community that address healthy living issues (e.g., nutrition, exercise, relaxation). Participants in Usual Care will receive the PMTCT protocol plus the time matched group administered presentation of health education videos.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Cognitive Behavioural Risk Reduction (CBRR) Group Counselling Intervention</title><p>The Group intervention employs a closed, structured, group intervention limited to 10 participants (women or men). Four weekly, 11/2-2 hour sessions are led by a trained gender-congruent counsellor and a peer facilitator and emphasize group participation, cognitive-behavioural skill building, sexual negotiation and experimentation with products. The impact of alcohol and drug use as direct and indirect contributors to high risk behaviours is addressed. Participants receive cognitive behavioural skill training on HIV/STD prevention and transmission, risk reduction strategies including circumcision and reproductive choice issues, communication, conflict resolution, sexual negotiation and an educational/experiential program to increase use of and adherence to sexual barriers. Information is presented through multiple modalities (i.e., visual, auditory, experiential) with ample opportunities for practice, feedback, and reinforcement (e.g., discussion of methods of circumcision, reproductive choice, sharing experiences using products with their partners, questions on product use, opportunity to handle and examine products). Participants are introduced to sexual barrier products (male and female condoms) for the purpose of determining cultural acceptability of such products to increase their uptake. The content of the women's and men's interventions include gender-relevant issues (e.g., relationships and sexual negotiation), self management techniques (e.g., learning to recognize antecedents of conflict and to control impulses to engage in maladaptive and unproductive coping responses) and assertiveness training (e.g., role plays to teach appropriate communication strategies).</p><p>The intervention is guided by the theories of reasoned action (intentions influence attitudes and subjective norms which influence beliefs about behaviour; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and planned behaviour (perceived behavioural control influences intentions and behaviour; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] as predictors of sexual barrier use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Within this model, it is hypothesized that sexual behavioural intentions and HIV-related knowledge influence attitudes and perceived norms regarding barrier use and partners, maladaptive coping strategies, substance use and medication adherence. Perceived sexual self efficacy, control of sexual behaviour and barrier use will influence risk reduction strategies and future sexual behaviour.</p><p><italic>Session One </italic>addresses HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), safer sex, barrier use, reproductive choice and communication. Participants are advised of standard rules regarding within-group confidentiality for both participants and staff, stressing the restriction on information overlap between gender groups. The use of gender concordant therapists reduces the risk of disclosure of group information. The HIV/STI and safer sex segment informs the participants about the need for safer sex regardless of serostatus (HIV transmission, infection with HIV/STIs) and the health implications for participants and their partners. This segment includes a discussion of the hierarchical method of sexual barrier use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Male and female condoms are introduced as the most effective forms of sexual protection. This is followed by "hands-on" demonstrations of both products, including practice with placing male and female condoms on/in models. The female condom is also illustrated with anatomical charts to clarify procedures for insertion. All available options for protecting against HIV infection are discussed in this session. For example, male circumcision will be noted as one means of reducing risk of HIV infection. Cognitive/behavioural skill training and communication skills in relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] are introduced in the context of awareness building and cognitive reframing, heightening participants' awareness of their reactions to barrier use in their sexual relationships and reframing automatic thoughts that may impede barrier use and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Participants will learn self management techniques (e.g., learning to recognize antecedents of conflict). At the conclusion of the session, participants complete a confidential sexual diary to record their sexual behaviour and use of barriers. Sexual diary entries are not discussed during groups. Participants receive and are encouraged to use a week's supply of male and female condoms; handouts are provided on male and female condoms and reproductive choice.</p><p><italic>Session Two </italic>begins with participants' completion of sexual diaries and a questionnaire assessing the acceptability of male and female condoms. The session follows a similar format to Session One Cognitive/behavioural skill building focuses on sexual negotiation and open communication techniques in relationships and the influences of family. At the end of the session, participants receive a week's supply of male and female condoms.</p><p><italic>Session Three </italic>begins with participants' completion of sexual diaries and a questionnaire assessing the acceptability of the products. Participants are encouraged to discuss their experiences with the products, and the reactions of partners and problems encountered. The group process facilitates the sharing of experiences by those who have tried the products to encourage those who have not. The session addresses the potential for engaging in high risk sexual behaviour when under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Skill building focuses on sexual negotiation, influencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and positive communication (e.g., expressing appreciation, avoiding blaming and contempt, domestic violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Cognitive/behavioural skill training exercises and role plays use the experiences of the participants in problem solving and cognitive restructuring, and participants are guided in applying cognitive restructuring skills to practicing safer sex and improving communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].

This session focuses on conflict resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] communication and sexual negotiation within the relationship. Videos and role playing are used to illustrate elements of open successful communication and elements of negative communication, such as negativity, escalation and invalidation. Participants are trained in communication with empathy, increased positive messages and the reduction of negative verbal messages. At the close of the session, participants receive a month's supply of their most preferred products.

All study materials, e.g., consent, assessment and intervention, will be translated into the major local languages (Zulu, Swati, Ndebele). Both participants and clinic sites will be assessed (see Assessment Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Participant assessments will include both biological (clinic data) and psychosocial assessments at study entry, post-PartnerPlus intervention, 32 weeks prior to delivery, immediately prior to delivery, 3 days post-delivery and 6 weeks post-delivery. All assessments are based on barriers to PMTCT uptake and will be interviewer administered to avoid exclusion based on literacy. Participants will receive R100 per assessment and R50 per intervention session for time and transportation.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Assessment Measures: Individual Participants [Maternal, Paternal, Infant]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Assessment</th><th align="center">Time (mins)</th><th align="center">PMTCT<break/>Protocol</th><th align="center">Pre-enrolment<break/>Screen</th><th align="center">Base-line</th><th align="center">Post-<break/>Interven-tion</th><th align="center">32 wks pre delivery</th><th align="center">Deliv-ery</th><th align="center">3 days Post- Delivery</th><th align="center">6 weeks post- Delivery</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>PMTCT Standard of Care Protocol</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="10"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">HCT maternal</td><td align="center"><bold>20</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>X</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Maternal CD4</td><td align="center"><bold>5</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>X</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">ART</td><td align="center"><bold>30</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>X</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">ARV prophylaxis</td><td align="center"><bold>5</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>X</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td align="center"><bold>X</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Paternal HCT</td><td align="center"><bold>20</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>X</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Paternal CD4</td><td/><td align="center"><bold>X</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Maternal 32 wk.

The sample size has been estimated as 1 + (m-1) p, m being the average cluster size and p being the intracluster correlation coefficient. All comparisons will use an alpha (two-tailed) of 0.05. Baseline characteristics will be described using medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and percentages with binomial confidence intervals for categorical variables.

A linear mixed model will be used to compute a repeated measures analysis of variance to compare pre and post sexual risk scores between the intervention and control groups adjusting for cluster effects (Secondary Hypothesis).

This intervention presents a method to implement a couples-based PMTCT intervention that simultaneously decreases sexual risk and increases adherence to PMTCT uptake by increasing male involvement. The intervention, PartnerPlus, combines an evidence-based behavioural HIV risk reduction intervention, the Partner Project, with an effective pharmacologic adherence intervention to prevent mother to child transmission, PMTCT. The findings will impact public health and will enable the health ministry to formulate policy related to male involvement in PMTCT, which will result in PMTCT.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>ACTG: AIDS Clinical Trial Group; ANC: Antenatal Care; ARV: antiretroviral drugs; ART: Antiretroviral Therapy; AZT: Azidothymidine or Zidovudine; DBS: Dry Blood Spots; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; PMTCT: Prevention of HIV Transmission from Mother to Child; HCT: HIV Counselling and Testing; STI: Sexually Transmitted Infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KP, DJ and SW were the main contributors to the conceptualization of the study.
