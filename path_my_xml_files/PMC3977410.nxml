It's estimated that prevalence of diabetes in population is about 2.3%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Diabetes can be controlled by creating awareness of diabetes risk factors and symptoms, and counseling patients on diet, exercise, blood sugar monitoring, oral medication taking, and tablets or insulin use.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Control of diabetes requires the normalization of carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Patient lifestyle and health behavior changes, and patient self-management in agreement with professional treatment guidance, are cornerstones of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Diabetic Patients are expected to carry out daily self-management activities to help to avoid diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. Self-management is a basis of diabetes care, and it is believed that improving patient self-efficacy is a crucial pathway to improved self-management.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Educational programs are a significant demand on health care providers, requiring large blocks of time (generally uncompensated), specific training, teaching and communication skills, a supportive attitude, and a readiness to listen and negotiate. Therefore, effective education requires training in its delivery.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The American diabetes association estimates that the complications, and the costs of diabetes can be reduced dramatically by increasing awareness and improving prevention.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In order to understand and predict fulfillment, the patients&#x02019; attitude toward diabetes has been studied since more than twenty years by means of the health belief model (HBM).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] At first, the HBM was designed to understand why people at risk to a disease did not contribute in the disease diagnosis program. According to the HBM, a subject is more likely to take a &#x0201c;health action&#x0201d; if he perceives; he is at risk; the disease is severe; health action is beneficial; understands limited barriers to the health action and receives a cue to get the health action.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] So; people with diabetes will adhere to treatment plans if they be worried about their health and believe that they are susceptible to problems, diabetes could have serious consequences, and following medical recommendations will reduce threats, and believe that the benefits outweigh the costs of not adhering.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Becker and Janz[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have urged researchers to use the HBM as a framework for understanding and enhancing patient adherence to the diabetes treatment regimen. They concluded that focusing on relevant identified attitudes, and beliefs will aid in the treatment of people with diabetes. Diabetes management and education programs have been shown to have a significant impact on improving health outcomes.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The purpose of this study is evaluating self-management promotion educational program intervention efficiency among Type 2 diabetic patients in Gachsaran, Iran during 2009 and HBM was applied as the theoretical framework.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was conducted among Type 2 diabetics patient in Gachsaran, Iran. Four health centers randomly selected within all health centers in Gachsaran, Iran. Of the 406 Type 2 diabetic's patient enrolled at the four health centers, 120 (29.5%) patient participated in this study. Sixty participants as intervention and 60 as control groups were enrolled at the baseline survey, of who all were followed up after 2 month intervention. This study was conducted with approval from Tehran University of Medical Sciences&#x02019; institutional review board. Informed assent and consent were obtained from participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measures</title><p>Prior to conducting the main project a pilot study was carried out. Initially, the relevant questionnaires were administered to 30 diabetic's patients who were similar to participants in the main study to obtain feedback about the clarity, length comprehensiveness, time of completion, and also internal reliability of the measures. Moreover, participants were instructed about how to fill questioners before gathering information. Participants responded to the standard writing questionnaire. Information was collected from an interview.</p><p>Questionnaire included three sections that comprised of 58 questions: Seven questions for demographic features; 36 questions for HBM variable; 15 questions about self-management behavior (including: Smoke use, physical activity, foot care, measurement of blood glucose, dietary intake, weight regular monitoring, and using medical advice).</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Demographics</title><p>Background item was designed to gather information related to age (years), gender (men, women), job (housewife, farmer, unemployed, others), duration of diabetes (years), complications of diabetes (yes, no), educational status (elementary, guidance, diploma) and marital status (single, married, widow).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Health belief model variable</title><p>The items which assessed components of the HBM with use two standard questionnaires[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and 36 items were composed under four major constructs, (1) perceived susceptibility; (2) perceived severity; (3) perceived benefit; (4) perceived barrier; (5) perceived self-efficacy. Four items were designed to measure perceived susceptibility (e.g. &#x0201c;I do not get diabetes complications&#x0201d;). Ten items were designed to measure perceived severity (e.g. &#x0201c;I think that diabetes is a serious disease&#x0201d;). Six items were designed to perceive benefit of self-efficacy to self-management (e.g. &#x0201c;Proper diabetic diet is effective for control blood sugar&#x0201d;). Ten items were designed to evaluate perceived barrier to self-management (e.g. &#x0201c;Diet for diabetics is annoying me&#x0201d;). Six items were designed to perceived self-efficacy to self-management (e.g. &#x0201c;How you sure the ability to diabetic diet?&#x0201d;). In order to facilitate respondents&#x02019; responses to the items, all items were standardized to a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). For self-efficacy scale, ranging from 1 (very little) to 5 (very much). Estimated reliability coefficients for each HBM constructs questionnaires were as follows: Severity (&#x003b1; = 0.69); susceptibility (&#x003b1; = 0.71); barrier (&#x003b1; = 0.62); benefit (&#x003b1; = 0.75); self-efficacy (&#x003b1; = 0.76), and knowledge (&#x003b1; = 0.66). These results demonstrated that questionnaires were internally consistent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>This was a longitudinal randomized pre- and post-test series control group design panel study to implement a health education based intervention to improved self-management behaviors among a sample of Type 2 diabetic's patient recruited from four health centers randomly selected within all health centers in Gachsaran, Iran. After obtaining informed consent participants were enrolled in the study, a 58-item, structured questionnaire with the aforementioned measures was distributed to the patient to complete. Prior to the self-administration of the questionnaire, study staff explained the logistics of answering the different type of questions and clarified any concerns and questions that were raised by participants. Most participants have a low education, so data collection was based on an interview with them.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Educational program</title><p>The course included 6 weekly teaching (a lecture and group discussion) units (45-60 min each). An educational program was adjusted based on HBM. For education needs assessment in participation linear regression analysis was performed. Our result showed susceptibility, severity, and self-efficacy were the best factor to prediction self-management [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Thus, education programs were focused on these structures. The first and second teaching unit acquainted patients with the interactive group method, and education abut Type 2 diabetes complications (to improve patients&#x02019; susceptibility). The main topics discussed during the third teaching unit were foot care (to improve patients&#x02019; severity). The main topics discussed during the fourth teaching unit were regular physical activity (to improve patients&#x02019; self-efficacy). The fifth teaching unit were discussed about smoking complications in diabetic patients (to improve patients&#x02019; severity). The sixth teaching unit were discussed about nutrition and diet education (to improve patients&#x02019; self-efficacy).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Predictors of the health belief model variables in self-management among the participant</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEHP-3-14-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Educational planning for this study was based on active learning through educational intervention was attempted to patients actively participate in educational programs.

Hence, improvement of patients&#x02019; knowledge and their self-care skill is a fundamental strategy for controlling diabetes and its complications.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a self-management education program among Type 2 diabetic patient. The HBM was conducted as a theoretical framework to assess educational need assessment among participants. Even though the duration of the educational intervention in this study was short, it was found significant improvements after manipulation. Analysis of the baseline and 2 months follow-up clearly demonstrated significant intervention effects on the participants&#x02019; severity, susceptibility, benefit, barrier, self-efficacy, and self-management among the intervention group.</p><p>Previous studies show that understanding the symptoms&#x02019; severity and susceptibility to these effects can lead to adopt a higher level of self-care among diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Our results show usefulness of the educational intervention program for increased susceptibility and severity among diabetic patients and consistent with similar studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Aalto[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Bernal[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported a significant relationship between perceived benefits and perceived barriers and diabetes self-care behaviors our findings indicated that improve benefit and reduce barrier to self-management among participants, and these outcomes is consistent with similar studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Also Bernal[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported presence in the diabetes education class is associated with perception of self-efficacy. In this regards our findings showed that education program could improve average response for participants&#x02019; self-efficacy.</p><p>One reason for the poor outcomes in individuals with diabetes is the lack of participation in the treatment of the disease. This participation is a key success factor in the treatment of diabetes that demands motivation, knowledge, and compliance to a difficult and complex lifetime regimen. Diabetes self-management education is a key element in preventing and treating diabetes,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and promotion of self-management the main objective of programs among diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Our result shows a significant increase in mean scores of self-management (6.06-7.25) among patient's intervention group, and it is similar to others study.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Overall, findings of the current study supported that implementing the self-management education programs among Type 2 diabetic patient would be effective to improve self-management among them.</p><p>Although our study has several strengths, such as theory driven, interventional study, and educational program was adjusted based on educational need assessment the study are few limited. First, data collection was based on an interview with diabetic patients; this is maybe prone to recall bias. Second, the internal consistency the questionnaire was relatively low (&#x003b1; =0.62) for assessing perceived barrier to self-management. Focused on the specifically self-management behaviors and the use of other behavior change model in predicting health-related behaviors in Iranian patients recommended at future research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This article is a part of the research project supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
