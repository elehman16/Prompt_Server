Inclusion criteria for this study were unilateral DMCFs (AO classification B1 and B2) with a displacement of more than shaft width, shortening by over 2 cm or threat of skin perforation at the fracture ends. Our exclusion criteria were (1) Patients with preexistent morbidity concerning arm, shoulder or hand (2) moderate to severe head injury (Glasgow coma scale &#x0003c;12) (3) multitrauma patients (4) open fractures (5) pathological fractures (6) fractures of &#x0003e;1 month duration (7) bilateral clavicle fractures (8) segmental fracture (9) fractures with associated neurovascular injury.</p><p>Allocation into plate fixation group or TEN fixation group was done alternatively (i.e. every even number patient underwent TEN fixation).

Involved shoulders were prepared and draped free. Incision was made transversely just under the fracture site. Supra clavicular nerves were identified and spared wherever possible. Soft tissue dissection was kept to a minimum. After reduction of fractures, a small fragment locking plate was fixed on the anterosuperior surface of the bone, starting medially using bicortical screws. In oblique or complex fractures, inter fragmentary lag screws were used to achieve compression [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The fascia and skin were closed in layers.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Skiagrams of a left clavicle of 20 years old male patient showing (a) midshaft clavicle fracture (b) immediate postoperative x-ray with plate <italic>in situ</italic> (c) 3 months postoperative with fracture union, (d) after implant removal</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-48-587-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>(b) TEN fixation</title><p>After anesthesia, patients were placed in supine position. The sternoclavicular joint was palpated and marked on the affected side. We used image intensification in 45&#x000b0;-cephalad and 45&#x000b0;-caudal directions. This provided us with images in two-planes, 90&#x000b0; apart. A small incision was made approximately 1 cm lateral to the sternoclavicular joint. The anterior cortex was opened using a sharp, pointed awl. A TEN was inserted (the diameter varied from 2 to 3 mm depending on the width of the bone). Before introduction, the original curvature of the small and flattened nail tip was straightened slightly to allow better gliding in the small medullary canal [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Closed reduction was performed under fluoroscopic control using two percutaneously introduced pointed reduction clamps [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. If closed reduction failed, an additional incision (miniopen) was made above the fracture site for direct manipulation of the main fragments. The nail was then advanced manually until it was just medial to the acromioclavicular joint. Accurate maneuvering of the nail tip was necessary under fluoroscopic control to avoid penetration of the thin dorsal cortex. After reaching the end point, the fracture was compressed and the nail was cut close to the entry point to minimize soft tissue irritation, at the same time leaving sufficient length behind for easy extraction later on. The fascia and skin were closed in layers.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Skiagrams of left clavicle of a 15 years old male patient showing (a) clavicle fracture (b) immediate postoperative x-ray with IM TEN <italic>in situ</italic> (c) fracture united 3 months postoperatively, (d) after implant removal</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-48-587-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>A 21 year old male patient with left clavicle fracture treated by titanium elastic nailing.

After 7 days, active range of movement exercises were started, however, overhead shoulder abduction was allowed only after 2 weeks. Activities of daily living were started thereafter, but those requiring lifting heavy objects were delayed until union was achieved. All patients were reviewed in the outpatient department at 2 and 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery. At each visit, patients were assessed clinicoradiologically for primary and secondary outcome measures.</p><p>Functional outcome was assessed by the Constant score. Radiographic union was defined as evidence of bridging callus or obliteration of fracture lines. Clinical union was considered as absence of tenderness at the fracture site. Time to achieve union was recorded. After union, shortening of clavicular length was measured clinically as the linear difference of clavicle lengths from sternal end to acromial end between operated and normal side.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures include perioperative data like operative time, amount of blood loss and size of the surgical wound; complications such as neurovascular injury, wound infection, nonunion, malunion, implant migration, implant failure, soft tissue irritation, refracture after implant removal and cosmetic outcome with regards to visible deformity, hypertrophic scars and hardware prominence under the skin. Implant removal was not done routinely in our study. It was done as per need and will of the patient after fracture union. The number of days to return to normal activities after implant removal was noted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>During analysis of data, only those patients were considered who attended at least 4 of the 6 followup visits starting from 6 weeks after surgery.

Neer<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and Rowe<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> in the 1960's recommended conservative treatment for clavicular fractures in view of very small incidence of nonunion rates in their studies (0.1% and 0.8% respectively). No one has been able to reproduce these results so far. However, more recent studies have shown significantly higher nonunion rates in conservatively treated patients (ranging between 10% and 15%). Hence, current recommendation for treatment of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures is operative fixation.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Plating is the standard operative procedure for DMCF. It can be done anterosuperiorly or anteroinferiorly. Another emerging mode of fixation is IM fixation with TENs (antegrade or retrograde). In this study, we compared the results of anterosuperior plating vs antegrade IM fixation with TEN.</p><p>In the plate group good to excellent results were achieved in 35 of 37 patients, compared with all good to excellent results in 34 patients of the TEN group. Overall, there were no unsatisfactory results in our study, whereas the incidence of unsatisfactory results after operative treatment of DMCFs is 5.3% in literature.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The average time to achieve union in this study was significantly faster in the TEN group than in the plate group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025). This can be explained by the less soft tissue dissection in the TEN group. The plating provides absolute stability resulting in primary bone healing, whereas TEN provides relative stability leading to secondary bone healing by callus formation.</p><p>Clavicular lengths were significantly better maintained by plating<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) than by TEN in our study, especially in AO type-B2 fractures [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. However, this much of clavicular shortening does not affect functional outcome significantly, because as per Lazarides and Zafiropoulos, only final clavicular shortening of more than 18 mm in males and of more than 14 mm in females are significantly associated with unsatisfactory results.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Eventually, in comminuted DMCF or those with large butterfly fragments plate fixation remains the operative procedure of choice as it offers better clavicular length maintenance.</p><p>We encountered 5 major complications in the plate group [infection (<italic>n</italic> = 4), nonunion (<italic>n</italic> = 1)]. The incidence of infection after plating in our study was 10.81%, whereas the reported rates in literature range from 0% to 18%.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>An important, although minor, complication of TEN group was the medial prominence of hardware [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>] causing skin irritation or perforation, which was noted in 11 patients (32.35%).

The first cause, being a surgeon related factor, may be tackled after primary surgery by adequately cutting the nail. The second cause is somewhat difficult to address however can be minimized by anatomical reduction, intraoperative compression and avoiding shoulder abduction beyond 90&#x000b0; in the first 2 weeks postoperatively.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Another option for reducing medial protrusion is the use of medial end caps.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The limitation of our study was a small sample size. However, from this study, we recommend the use of minimally invasive antegrade TEN for fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures in view of faster fracture union, lesser morbidity, easier implant removal and fewer complications; although for comminuted fractures plating remains the procedure of choice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>O&#x02019;Neill</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hirpara</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Briain</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>McGarr</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaar</surname><given-names>TK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clavicle fractures: A comparison of five classification systems and their relationship to treatment outcomes</article-title><source>Int Orthop</source><year>2011</year><volume>35</volume><fpage>909</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21088834</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Postacchini</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Gumina</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>De Santis</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Albo</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of clavicle fractures</article-title><source>J Shoulder Elbow Surg</source><year>2002</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>452</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12378163</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nordqvist</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Petersson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The incidence of fractures of the clavicle</article-title><source>Clin Orthop Relat Res</source><year>1994</year><volume>300</volume><fpage>127</fpage><lpage>32</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8131324</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Neer</surname><given-names>CS</given-names><suffix>2nd</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Nonunion of the clavicle</article-title><source>J Am Med Assoc</source><year>1960</year><volume>172</volume><fpage>1006</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14426324</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rowe</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An atlas of anatomy and treatment of midclavicular fractures</article-title><source>Clin Orthop Relat Res</source><year>1968</year><volume>58</volume><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>42</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5666865</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jeray</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute midshaft clavicular fracture</article-title><source>J Am Acad Orthop Surg</source><year>2007</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>239</fpage><lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17426295</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lazarides</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Zafiropoulos</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Conservative treatment of fractures at the middle third of the clavicle: The relevance of shortening and clinical outcome</article-title><source>J Shoulder Elbow Surg</source><year>2006</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>191</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16517363</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society</collab><article-title>Nonoperative treatment compared with plate fixation of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures.
