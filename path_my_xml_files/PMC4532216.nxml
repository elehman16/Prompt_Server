Yueju, an herbal medicine used to treat mood disorders was recently found to exhibit rapid antidepressant effects. The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of Yueju in rapidly acting on major depressive disorder (MDD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were MDD patients with scores of 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-24) &#x02265;20 and without history of antidepressant use. They randomly received daily oral doses of Yueju (23 g/day) plus fluoxetine (20 mg/day) (experimental group) or placebo plus fluoxetine (control group) for 7 days. HDRS-24 was used as the primary outcome measurement at baseline, and on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Concentrations of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assessed at baseline and on days 1 and 7.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 18 participants met the criteria for data analysis. Compared to baseline level, only experimental group showed significant decrease of HDRS-24 score from day 3 to day 7 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Experimental group also showed significant improvement compared with control group from day 3 to day 7 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). No correlation between treatment outcomes with serum BDNF levels was observed. However, experimental group showed significant correlation for serum BDNF level on day 1 with day 7 (<italic>r</italic>=0.721, <italic>P</italic>=0.028), whereas the control group did not.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Yueju likely contributes to fast-onset antidepressant effects on MDD. Further investigation is necessary to firmly establish the ancient formula as a safe, efficacious, and rapidly acting alternative medicine for MDD treatment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Yueju</kwd><kwd>major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>HDRS-24</kwd><kwd>MADRS</kwd><kwd>rapid-onset</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characteristic with the presence of loss of pleasure or interest in usually pleasurable activities (anhedonia), together with a set of other features, including anergia, changes in sleep and appetite, sadness, and suicide ideation.<xref rid="b1-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As one of the most prevalent forms of mental illness worldwide, about 10%&#x02013;30% of women and 7%&#x02013;15% of men likely to suffer from depression in their lifetime.<xref rid="b2-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Coupled with its high rate of relapsing, depression is a serious mental disorder that imposes substantial and spiritual burden on the patients as well as on public health and society.<xref rid="b4-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Conventional antidepressants, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), take several weeks to achieve therapeutic effects.<xref rid="b6-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Additionally, almost 1/3 of MDD patients have no response to the conventional medications.<xref rid="b7-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The delayed onset time and the low remission rate of conventional antidepressants remain major challenges.<xref rid="b8-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Consequently, new medications that have rapid onset of antidepressant effects are urgently needed nowadays.<xref rid="b6-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Recently, ketamine, one of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, draws an army of attention for its high potential to ameliorate depressive symptoms within a few hours<xref rid="b9-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and last for as long as 2 weeks.<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Ketamine rapidly increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus.<xref rid="b11-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Serum BDNF levels were intimately associated with MDD and antidepressant responses.<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Serum BDNF levels are increased by ketamine in treatment-resistant MDD patients,<xref rid="b14-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in agreement with some findings that higher BDNF levels were associated with treatment with antidepressants.<xref rid="b15-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Yet, the psychotomimetic and dissociative side effects of ketamine may restrict its wide use clinically.<xref rid="b16-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Presently, a critical need remains for new treatments that act rapidly as ket-amine but well-tolerated.<xref rid="b16-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Some evidence supports herbal medicine for effective and safe treatment of depression,<xref rid="b17-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> for monotherapy or in adjunct with conventional antidepressants.<xref rid="b18-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The famous Chinese herb medicine prescription, Yueju (namely, depression-overcoming) pills, an oriental herbal formula originally prescribed 800 years ago by a pioneer Chinese medical doctor Zhu Dan-xi, is still used to treat depression, anxiety, and irritability.<xref rid="b20-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Recently, results from an experimental investigation using animals &#x02013;

Furthermore, in a chronic mild stress model that mimics clinical depression, a single administration of Yueju also showed rapid and lasting antidepressant effects similar to ketamine (Tang and Chen, unpublished observation, 2015). These findings suggest that Yueju may be potentially used as a rapid antidepressant in the clinical setting.</p><p>The aim of the present work was to assess the rapid-onset efficacy of Yueju on the treatment of MDD in a 7-day, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and randomized pilot clinical trial. Fluoxetine, a well documented late-onset SSRI, was used in adjunct with Yueju or placebo. BDNF levels in the serum before and at different times after treatment were also assessed as a putative biomarker. In the present study, 3 days of treatment with fluoxetine plus Yueju produced a modest but significant improvement, compared to unaltered clinic outcomes in patients treated with fluoxetine plus placebo. These data suggest that Yueju was crucial to induce relatively rapid antidepressant effects in MDD treatment. Additionally, the serum BDNF level on day 1 and day 7 was significantly correlated only in the experimental group, likely indicating responsiveness to the treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study funding and setting</title><p>The study was supported by Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.

Because these symptoms occurred with comparable frequency in both groups, they likely arose from the side effects of fluoxetine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Rapid antidepressants are urgently needed clinically. As preclinical findings indicated an herbal medicine Yueju showed ketamine-like rapid antidepressant effects, we tested whether Yueju had antidepressant potency in a relatively rapid manner clinically. In the present study, we used fluoxetine combined with Yueju or placebo to ensure patients received adequate conventional antidepressant therapy. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, which requires more than 2 weeks for observable antidepressant effects<xref rid="b27-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and with high rates of side effects such as nausea and headaches.<xref rid="b28-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our study focused on the first 7 days after treatment, a time when fluoxetine was incapable to elicit antidepressant effects. This was supported by the observation that in the patients receiving placebo plus fluoxetine, there were no significant changes of HDRS-24 scores over the first 7 days of treatment. In contrast, treatment with Yueju plus fluoxetine resulted in an early onset of antidepressant effects starting at 3 days and lasted for the rest of the days of testing, compared to the pretreatment baseline level, and control group. Additionally, the response rate for experimental group (Yueju plus fluoxetine) was significantly higher than the control group (placebo plus fluoxetine). The rapid antidepressant effect thus is likely owed to Yueju in the present study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the relatively rapid antidepressant effects of an herbal medicine clinically.</p><p>The onset time of antidepressant effect of oral Yueju and fluoxetine appeared not to be as early as a single infusion of ketamine, which can exhibit antidepressant effects within hours.<xref rid="b9-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Additionally, the response rate of oral Yueju and fluoxetine was lower than ketamine infusion in the previous study: 12 (71%) of the 17 subjects treated with ketamine met response criteria (defined as 50% reduction of the scores compared with baseline),<xref rid="b6-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> whereas we found a 50% responding rate here using less stringent criteria. However, recently a study using daily oral ketamine showed a significant reduction of the depression-scale scores starting at the 14th day throughout the 28-day study.<xref rid="b29-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Thus, the onset time for a significant improvement of the mood ratings within the first few days of the treatment with fluoxetine and Yueju was still considerably quick. Although infusion of low dose of ketamine is more efficacious in quickly relieving the depressive symptoms, it can induce the side effects at the very beginning and may lead to spatial memory impairment.<xref rid="b30-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In contrast, no psychometric effects have been noticed in the present study. Therefore, Yueju plus fluoxetine may still be a promising alternative medicine to treat depression in a fast and safe manner, as well as to be used for a trial to treatment-resistant depression therapy as ketamine.<xref rid="b6-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Serum BDNF has been used as a putative maker for antidepressant responsiveness. However, different results have been reported on BDNF serum level after antidepressant treatments. Some studies failed to detect increased BDNF levels after antidepressant treatments.<xref rid="b31-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Deuschle et al reported a decline of serum BDNF level in venlafaxine-treated patients, but an increase in mirtazapine-treated patients.<xref rid="b32-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We did not find a significant change of overall serum BDNF levels at 7 days in experimental or control groups, nor did we find significant correlations of serum BDNF levels with HDRS-24 scores. Observations in ketamine-infused patients showed similar results: despite a significant improvement in MADRS scores after subjects received ketamine infusion, no changes in BDNF levels were observed compared to baseline. Also, no association was found between antidepressant response and BDNF levels.<xref rid="b31-ndt-11-2013" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The link between serum BDNF level and rapid antidepressant response remains to be established. Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between the 1st day and the 7th day serum BDNF levels in experimental group but not the control group. This may indicate a consistent serum BDNF level over time following Yueju plus fluoxetine treatment but not fluoxetine plus placebo treatment, suggesting responsiveness to Yueju Further clinical and preclinical studies should investigate how changes in serum BDNF level are associated with behavioral outcomes and whether BDNF can be used as an early indicator of the drug responsiveness.</p><p>The present study for the first time demonstrated a plausible role of an ancient herbal medicine in eliciting relatively fast antidepressant responses in MDD patients. There were, however, several limitations. First, the sample size of the present study was small. This was partially due to the relatively restrictive inclusion criteria: patients were required to be previously unexposed to psychotropic drugs, to exclude the plausible impact from the history of antidepressant administration. Also, we only included patients with relatively higher baseline HDRS-24 scores (&#x02265;20) to test the antidepressant effects of the drugs on patients with typical symptoms of depression. Nonetheless, our preliminary results with small sample size should be interpreted with caution and prevent us from analyzing important factors influencing antidepressant responses, such as sex and estrous cycle. Second, our study is a single-center research, which may restrict generalization of our findings. Third, the study was carried out in a relatively short time, with focus on the rapid antidepressant efficacy. Future study should address the short-term and long-term therapeutic effects and with larger sample size. Fourth, although the shape and color of the placebo were similar to Yueju, the smells of Yueju and placebo were not exactly identical, which may lead to the plausible incomplete blind treatment to patients. Lastly, it would be better to include a single fluoxetine or Yueju group in order to clarify whether patients only treated with Yueju also display rapid-onset antidepressant actions. A study of monotherapy with Yueju is needed to directly test the rapid antidepressant efficacy of Yueju.</p><p>In summary, the present work suggests Yueju is potent to induce relatively rapid antidepressant effects in MDD patients with few adverse events. Further investigation with multicenter, large sample sized, randomized, long-term, and placebo-controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of oral Yueju for the treatment of MDD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-ndt-11-2013"><table-wrap id="ts1-ndt-11-2013" position="float"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Key efficacy-related data based on HDRS-24</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D1</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D3</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D5</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D7</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MC</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RR</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Re</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp (ng/mL)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.80&#x000b1;4.78</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.40&#x000b1;3.80</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.90&#x000b1;5.47</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.60&#x000b1;5.87</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.50&#x000b1;7.09</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.30&#x000b1;2.47</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50%</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTL (ng/mL)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.37&#x000b1;4.10</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.00&#x000b1;4.54</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.88&#x000b1;4.94</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.00&#x000b1;5.32</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.50&#x000b1;5.90</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.88&#x000b1;5.90</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25%</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tfn3-ndt-11-2013"><p><bold>Note:</bold> All data were presented with mean &#x000b1;
