High sugar intake is associated with weight gain and increased incidence of diabetes and has been linked with increased cardiovascular mortality. Reducing the health impact of dietary sugar and poor quality carbohydrate intake is a public health priority. IminoNorm&#x000ae;, a proprietary mulberry leaf extract (ME), may reduce blood glucose responses following dietary sugar and carbohydrate intake by reducing absorption of glucose from the gut. Previous research has shown that ME can reduce blood glucose and improve insulin responses in healthy subjects and also in subjects with raised fasting blood glucose levels. Mulberry leaf has an excellent safety profile. This pilot study will test a novel, safe, water soluble product in normoglycaemic adults in the UK to determine if it can reduce glucose absorption without increasing plasma insulin concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The trial will be a double-blind, individually randomised, four-arm single-dose crossover design to test the effect of three doses of ME in order to determine efficacy, dose response relationship and gastrointestinal side effects with respect to placebo. A total of 40 subjects will participate in this study and attend for four visits receiving each of the four interventions in random order.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We aim to test the evidence that mulberry leaf extract can reduce blood glucose without a disproportionate increase in blood insulin responses in healthy individuals in a high-quality research study based in the UK. It is hoped that this will lead to further randomised controlled trials and an effective dietary supplement to lower blood glucose concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14597438">ISRCTN14597438</ext-link> (21 April 2015)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mulberry</kwd><kwd>Glycaemic response</kwd><kwd>Insulinaemic response</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Excess calorie intake including those from sugar can make a significant contribution to becoming overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and thus increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2013 a large long-term European study investigating the effect of diet on health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] found an association between the amount of sugary soft drinks people consumed and their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this study weight gain had a large effect on diabetes risk, and sugary drinks had a small effect on diabetes risk even after correcting for body mass index (BMI). The global rise in T2DM is linked to the metabolic syndrome (dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance), and obesity is thought to be one of the greatest risk factors for metabolic syndrome and T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Dietary sugars and carbohydrates play a significant role, as calories from these foods promote fat storage and hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A recently completed review of nutrition and its impact on T2DM concluded that dietary restriction of carbohydrate intake is the single most effective approach to manage T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is estimated that more than 1 in 17 people in the UK have diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and thus reducing the health impact of dietary sugar and poor quality carbohydrate intake is a public health priority. Herbal agents could be quite effective in the management of carbohydrates in the normal diet and in reducing postprandial blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Mulberry (<italic>Morus alba</italic>) leaves have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for several millennia; its use was first recorded in around 500&#x000a0;AD in the <italic>Divine Husbandman</italic>&#x02019;<italic>s Classic of the Materia Medica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has also been used for more than 750&#x000a0;years in Japan as an infusion tea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is used by some human communities for food purposes and in several Asian countries as a herbal tea. Reports have shown that the leaves are nutritious and non-toxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The Chinese Ministry of Health and the Taiwanese Bureau of Food Safety recognise <italic>Morus alba</italic> leaves as both a food and a medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Mulberry leaf extracts (ME) have a long history of safe use globally for normalising postprandial blood glucose, and it is thought that iminosugars such as 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), a reversible, competitive natural <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibitor, are the main active components responsible for the activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>ME can significantly reduce peak blood glucose levels and insulin response levels (Kimura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; Mudra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]), providing protection to the blood glucose metabolic function of healthy and hyperglycaemic subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. ME can reduce oxidative stress, glucose fluctuations during postprandial periods and, more generally, glucose swings triggering effects on oxidative stress. By reducing oxidative stress, ME has the potential to slow down the process of prediabetes to diabetes and diabetes to developing complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Long-term administration of ME produced a dose-dependent decrease in body weight and hepatic lipid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], stimulated skeletal muscle 5&#x02032;-AMP-activated protein kinase activity acutely without changing the intracellular energy status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], suppressed the elevation of postprandial blood glucose and cholesterol in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and exhibited potential hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effects in patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, ME may help reduce blood glucose peaks caused by the ingestion of sugary or carbohydrate-rich foods and drinks. Mulberry tea has been shown to suppress the postprandial rise of blood glucose levels after 90&#x000a0;minutes of its consumption in subjects with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of three doses of a proprietary water extract of mulberry leaves standardised to contain 5&#x000a0;% DNJ (IminoNorm&#x000ae;) versus placebo on blood glucose and insulin responses when co-administered with 50&#x000a0;g maltodextrin in normoglycaemic healthy adults. We also aim to determine the gastrointestinal tolerability of the mulberry extract using normal (250&#x000a0;mg IminoNorm&#x000ae; containing 12.5&#x000a0;mg DNJ), half (125&#x000a0;mg IminoNorm&#x000ae; containing 6.75&#x000a0;mg DNJ) and also double (500&#x000a0;mg IminoNorm&#x000ae; containing 25&#x000a0;mg DNJ) the normal dose. Maltodextrin is a dietary starch with a high glycaemic index, is commonly added to many foods and beverages and has been used as a test carbohydrate in similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We hypothesise that ME will reduce glucose excursions without causing a disproportionate increase in insulin release, and thus its ingestion may confer protection against the development of diabetes, although further trials would be required to determine its long-term efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to determine the effect of three doses of mulberry extract (IminoNorm&#x000ae;) versus placebo on blood glucose and insulin responses when co-administered with 50&#x000a0;g maltodextrin in normoglycaemic healthy adults.

Blood measurements will be taken at &#x02212;5&#x000a0;minutes and 0&#x000a0;minute before consumption of the reference product/test products and the baseline value taken as a mean of these two values. Further blood measurements will be taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120&#x000a0;minutes after starting to eat. Blood glucose will be measured using the HemoCue Glucose 201+ analyser (HemoCue&#x000ae; Ltd). The same time points will be used for determining insulin levels.

The presence/absence of gastrointestinal symptoms in the 24&#x000a0;hours following the study visit will be assessed using logistic regression models. We anticipate a low likelihood of missing data (as sufficient blood is taken for a second analysis to be performed if the first analysis fails), and our glucose values will be measured in real time. We anticipate monophasic or biphasic glucose and insulin curve responses and will use a second order interpolation method for missing data, provided that no other data is missing from the two neighbouring time points at either side of a missing data set and that the baseline and end data values are obtained. If the baseline or endpoints are missing or more than one data point within five neighbouring time points, this data set will be deemed unsuitable and will not be included in the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we have suggested the clinical trial design of a dietary supplement to reduce glucose excursions without a disproportionate increase in insulin release. This pilot study will influence further work on a larger scale RCT. In this study we aim to confirm the standard dose of IminoNorm that can be consumed with food. In addition, we aim to determine the magnitude of clinical effect and to measure the frequency and intensity of any gastrointestinal side effects. Based on the results, we will aim to design a larger RCT to investigate the protective effect of ME on the development of prediabetes and diabetes in at-risk individuals or the population as a whole. The treatment effect size may be used to determine the sample size of a larger study based on similar studies on the prevention of T2DM. As mentioned previously, ME may also have a positive effect on lipid profiles, and we may decide to include further endpoints in future larger trials. Glucose-lowering agents show ethnic variations; thus, future work should include assessment in more ethnically diverse populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p>We have now finished recruiting and most of the participants have completed all four visits.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DNJ</term><def><p>1-deoxynojirimycin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GR</term><def><p>glycaemic response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iAUC</term><def><p>integral Area Under the Curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IR</term><def><p>insulinaemic response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ME</term><def><p>mulberry extract</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2DM</term><def><p>type 2 diabetes mellitus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCM</term><def><p>Traditional Chinese medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UREC</term><def><p>University Research Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors are funded by a Technology Strategy Board/Innovate UK grant to undertake this work with Phynova (as the applicant), and our role is solely that of researchers.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>RF, AG and GL participated in the initial design of the study.
