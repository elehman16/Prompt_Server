There is evidence that such interventions lead to meaningful weight loss [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], particularly relative to no-intervention control groups or minimal interventions [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, attrition is typically high in Web-based interventions [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In any longitudinal eHealth study, there are two different types of attrition, namely, dropout attrition, or losing participants to follow-up; and nonusage attrition (not using the intervention or low usage of the intervention). Determining nonusage and dropout attrition is an essential part of analysis of Web-based interventions, as the attrition curve may indicate the underlying cause of attrition [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, there may be steady attrition, with a consistent proportion of users discontinuing usage. Alternatively, there may be an initial phase where usage is high, followed by rapid attrition, after which a stable group of regular users remains. Further, even among regular users, some Web pages are used by almost all users who log on to the website, whereas others are never used. Although higher use of website features may be associated with weight loss, it is not clear which features improve this effect or reduce attrition [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is also possible that not all users may need to complete an Internet intervention to obtain positive results&#x02014;different doses may be necessary for different people [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Several recent studies have attempted to identify the relationship between Web usage and benefit from weight management interventions. For example, Funk and colleagues [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] categorized users of a Web-based weight loss intervention as having &#x0201c;consistent usage,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;some usage,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;minimal usage.&#x0201d; The mean weight change was significantly higher in the &#x0201c;consistent usage&#x0201d; category, and significantly more consistent users maintained clinically important weight loss than those in the other groups. Within Internet interventions, more logins, weight and exercise entries, and use of additional features of the website after weight entry have been associated with better weight outcomes [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More specifically, use of website feedback features, such as progress charts, have been shown to be the best predictors of initial 6-month weight loss, whereas social support features, such as Web chats and participant profiles, have been related to weight maintenance at 12 months [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, greater use of a weight tracker was associated with greater weight loss [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, no study has assessed in detail whether certain Web pages are more frequently used than others, or whether certain groups of people are more likely to use particular pages. This would enable researchers to refine the content of their Web-based interventions, for example, to enable easier access to the most useful Web pages, or encourage greater use of useful but underused Web pages by identifying and addressing barriers to usage.</p><p>Positive Online Weight Reduction [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] was developed as a Web-based weight management intervention for use in primary care that aimed to result in sustainable weight loss. It was tested in a feasibility trial that consisted of 4 groups, namely: Web only, Web plus basic nurse support, Web plus regular nurse support, and usual care, to assess the extent to which weight loss was maintained at 12-month follow-up. It was designed to provide support for self-management of weight based on either a low-calorie or low-carbohydrate eating plan. Analysis revealed that average website usage, defined as duration of page viewing, was similar across the intervention arms, but extremely variable within groups. Although participants completed a mean of nine goal and weight reviews, this ranged from none to 43 completed during the 12-month trial.</p><p>Usage log data have been used to examine the relationship(s) between use of specific intervention components and subsequent outcomes/effectiveness [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such analyses can reveal useful insights about the impact and relevance of particular components over the time course of an intervention. However, such analyses typically rely on making a priori assumptions about the specific intervention components that are expected to have an effect on uptake, adherence, or outcomes. By contrast, visualizations use aspects of exploratory sequencing techniques to summarize and plot the participant&#x02019;s usage of every intervention component over time [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].Using visual analysis allows differences in usage to emerge from the data and ensures that unanticipated relationships between usage and outcomes are not overlooked. Freely available visualization tools have been developed and argued to be useful for detecting patterns of usage and how they vary across individuals/groups; detecting usability or content issues, and thereby enable researchers to edit content for use in future Web-based interventions; and performing exploratory analysis to support the design of statistical queries to summarize data regarding whether use of particular pages is related to benefit [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Existing visualization tools provide a useful means to explore each individual participant&#x02019;s usage of an intervention, or particular aspects of all participants&#x02019; usage of an intervention (such as days/dates of logins, start and end points of each login). However, to our knowledge, these tools do not allow for a detailed comparison of how all components of an intervention have been used by all participants within one sequence plot. Our research team has therefore developed a visualization tool to examine each individual participant&#x02019;s temporal usage of a Web-based intervention by illustrating what pages they have viewed, for how long, and in what order. Usage sequences for each individual are stacked within one visualization plot to facilitate comparison across all participants. This makes analysis quicker and easier compared with standard data analysis.</p><p>This paper first describes how the visualization tool works. We then illustrate the insights the visualization tool can provide by a detailed analysis of usage of the Positive Online Weight Reduction (POWeR) intervention.

The trial was approved by the UK National Health Service National Research Ethics Service, and was registered with Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN 31685626).</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and Procedures</title><p>Participants were recruited between May 2011 and December 2012 from five general practices in southern England. Inclusion criteria included being aged over 18, and having a body mass index (BMI)of 30 or more (or 28 with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes) documented in medical records. Exclusion criteria included being pregnant or breastfeeding, having current major mental or physical health problems, or self-reported inability to walk 100 m. Participants were followed up at 6 months and 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The POWeR intervention [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] consisted of 12 weekly online sessions, in which users were taught active cognitive and behavioral self-regulation techniques (eg, POWeR Tools) and provided with evidence for their effectiveness and examples of how other users had successfully used them. The sessions did not differ between groups. Session 1 provided an overview of the intervention, advice on choosing the low-calorie or low-carbohydrate eating plan, helped users to set eating goals and plan how to implement them, asked users to identify personal reasons for losing weight, and explained how to use weekly weighing as a form of self-monitoring. All subsequent sessions began by asking the users to enter their current weight and report how often they had achieved each of the goals set the previous week (goal and weight review). Following this, users received automated advice based on their progress, and were able to set new goals and plans. This advice did not differ between groups. Session 2 covered getting support from the website (eg, setting automated motivational messages), friends and family, and the nurse. Session 3 helped users choose and implement a physical activity plan (walking or mixed physical activity). Sessions 1-3 were defined as core sessions, and became available weekly in sequence. After completing the first three sessions, users could then choose any one optional session each week after their goal and weight reviews from the following selection: cravings, slipups, stretching physical activity, tough times (emotional eating), busy lives (eating when busy), setting up your environment (environment restructuring), alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, eating out, and maintaining weight loss. The final session was a review. In addition to the new weekly sessions, users could also reaccess content from previous sessions at any time via the main home page, using either their POWeR Tools or a weight graph plotting their progress.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection and Analysis</title><p>All data were stored using the LifeGuide intervention authoring software [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], an online software that enables researchers to create Web-based interventions. This software automatically captures data regarding all Web pages accessed, and length of time spent viewing each Web page. A visualization tool was created using R to enable us to determine patterns of Web usage. The tool enables researchers to visually compare when particular parts of the intervention were viewed, for how long, and in what order, across all participants. A Web-based interface for the visualization tool was developed using the Shiny Web application for R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>). A user guide for the visualization tool will be made available shortly, and both the tool and user manual will be made available free of charge via the LifeGuide website.</p><p>In brief, to run the tool, one needs to feed it 4 types of files: a page flow file (which shows the order in which participants have looked at pages and the time they have spent on them); a user data file (which contains data on participant characteristics and outcomes or data participants have entered into the intervention), a coding file (which assigns each intervention page a numerical code), and a color file (which assigns each intervention page code a specific color). At the top of all the interfaces, there is the option to sort participants by sequence length (the amount of time a participant has spent viewing the intervention) and choose the type of visualization plot (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) the viewer wants to see.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Different types of plots shown in a visualization.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="638" border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0"><col width="88" span="1"/><col width="522" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Plot type</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">What it shows</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Normal</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Default option, shows which pages were viewed by each individual participant, in which order</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shows usage by all participants by groups of pages, so the researcher can see which groups of pages are most used</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clustered</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Groups participants into statistically similar usage patterns</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Allows you to see two or more visualizations next to each other, split into different types of usage patterns or users</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The visualization can be filtered based on variables in the dataset (eg, user characteristics or outcomes) or which groups of pages users have/have not seen.

These were as follows: (1) to see patterns of Web usage, (2) to carry out a moderator analysis of patient characteristics related to Web usage, and (3) to determine which pages were related to benefit from the Web-based intervention. These results are discussed in the following section in relation to these aims.</p><p>First, the visualization tool was extremely helpful in enabling us to determine patterns of Web usage. A first key observation is that the vast majority of participants who went online accessed the first session, but there was a drop of approximately 20% of participants from the first session (n=132 in part 1 and n=120 in part 2) to the second session (n=104). This is similar to the rapid attrition rate reported in similar Web-based weight loss interventions [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Dropout then continued at a rate of approximately 10% per session. Breaking down the first session into two parts based on content covered (as it was very long and each part had a similar length to the other full sessions) and checking how many participants accessed the last page of session 1 enabled us to see that almost 90% of participants completed the first session (n=120/132). To ensure all essential information is covered, each session should be presented as early as possible in the intervention. Interventions that aim to also prioritize physical activity should present this as early on as possible.</p><p>A second key observation is that only half the participants accessed any of the optional sessions, and each optional session was viewed by less than 25% of participants. Nevertheless, nearly half the participants continued to use the weekly goal and weight review, despite deciding not to access new optional content. In retrospect, this pattern of usage could have been unintentionally prompted by the design of the page following goal review, as the logout option was prominently placed. Alternatively, it could mean that participants felt the additional sessions were neither necessary nor particularly novel (as they covered topics that are commonly addressed by other weight management interventions). In support of this interpretation, there were no differences in weight loss between participants who did and did not use the optional sessions, indicating that the optional content was indeed not necessary for weight loss. In addition, those who chose not to access the optional content had a higher BMI at baseline, so may have been more likely to have encountered similar content in previous weight management attempts. This finding justifies the decision to make these sessions optional, and also suggests that for many participants the goal and weight review (which provided individualized progress-relevant feedback messages as well as a weight loss graph) was more important and rewarding to access than the generic weight management advice.</p><p>The eating plan tools were the most reused, especially the weekly food diary, and information about the low-calorie eating plan and the low-carbohydrate eating plan. Thus, explorations of usage patterns using visualization tools can help to identify the particular intervention tools that participants are keen to reuse online. Such insights can help design hybrid interventions that enable access to selected intervention content through multiple digital devices (eg, mobile phone apps). For example, a mixed-methods evaluation of a supplemental POWeR mobile phone app also showed that participants particularly valued being able to reaccess food lists associated with their eating plans on the go via their mobile phone [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The eating plan tools were the most basic weight management tools, and less essential tools such as the motivational &#x0201c;reasons to lose weight&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;sending motivational emails&#x0201d; support tools were not reused. However, this does not necessarily mean that the less essential tools were not valued by participants. It could be that participants engaged with these tools at their first presentation during the core session (eg, by printing out their reasons to lose weight card or setting up support emails there and then) and did not need to reuse them via the POWeR website.</p><p>Those who reused the food diary were older and had completed more goal and weight reviews than those who had not. It is possible that these participants may have been more conscientious in their attitude to weight loss, or that younger participants could have been using alternative tools. However, it is important to note that those who reused the food diary did not lose more weight than other participants. To minimize the intrusiveness and burden of weight management, POWeR specifically encourages users to employ food diaries only occasionally, as diagnostic tools when necessary, and not to rely on them for long-term weight management[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Those who reused the getting support tools had completed more sessions and goal and weight reviews and lost more weight than those who did not. This suggests that the support tools were helpful in enabling weight loss. The challenge now is engaging with those users who did not use the support tools. Interestingly, very few people reused the &#x0201c;ask the nurse&#x0201d; function, which allowed users to send queries or messages to the nurse providing them with support. Some POWeR users have indicated in our follow-up interviews that they would like to be able to access human support when they feel the need [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but it appears that the facility to send the nurse an email may not meet this need. This could be because email is an insufficiently personal medium to access support [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but it could also indicate that the opportunity to contact the nurse should be presented differently in future interventions; for example, perhaps offered as an immediate option in goal feedback if participants are not meeting their goals (rather than requiring users to access the option from their tools). Alternatively, these findings may indicate that people did not feel the need to contact the nurse, although they felt that it was helpful to have the option there.</p><p>Very few people reused the physical activity tools, suggesting that physical activity may not have been seen as an important part of weight management by POWeR users. However, of the physical activity tools, the steps diary was the most widely reused, and was associated with greater weight loss. Users of the steps diary may have used pedometers. They may also have had increased levels of autonomous motivation as this has mediated the effect of self-monitoring and diary usage on weight loss in previous studies [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It may therefore be beneficial to find ways to increase repeated and regular usage of the steps diary [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is important to note that participants could only reuse the steps diary if they had chosen to follow the walking plan. From these results it is therefore not clear whether it was specifically the steps diary that was useful, or whether the walking plan was more beneficial than the mixed physical activity plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study had several limitations. First, the results described here are based on a single feasibility study, and it is unclear how widely they would apply to a wider population. In particular, the sample participating in POWeR included fewer men and very few members of ethnic minorities. However, the sample was not young or highly educated, and as such could be considered broadly representative of the population eligible to enroll in such an intervention in primary care [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Second, although our exploratory analyses identified a number of possible patterns in Web usage and associations with outcome, further research is needed to confirm these patterns and test the hypotheses arising from this study. Third, the results regarding use of the steps diary and weight loss were based on a small number of users of the steps diary, and should therefore be interpreted with caution. This needs to be replicated with larger populations. Fourth, we considered the intervention groups from POWeR as a single population. It is possible that nurse support may have influenced Web usage. We were not able to determine this due to the small sample size.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The visualization tool provided a useful and efficient method for interpreting and exploring a very large dataset on usage of a Web-based weight management intervention. Specifically, the visualization tool helped to determine aspects of the intervention design and content that seem to encourage and discourage repeated use. Insights gained from a visual analysis of usage data also helped to determine the associations between usage patterns, participant characteristics, and weight change in subsequent statistical analyses. The visualization tool complements the work of Morrison and Doherty [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] by enabling an in-depth analysis of all participants&#x02019; usage of EVERY intervention component within one sequence plot. Different visualization tools are likely to be more or less useful depending on the intervention architecture and research questions of interest. The visualization tool presented here may be particularly useful for inductive analyses of tunneled interventions. By contrast, the toolkits developed by van Gemert-Pijnen and colleagues [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] may be particularly beneficial for usage analyses following a priori assumptions about key intervention components. The toolkit developed by Morrison and Doherty[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] may be particularly beneficial for individual-level analyses or group-level analyses of nontunneled interventions that do not have a clear start and end point. Visualization toolkits can be used as part of a mixed-methods approach for developing and evaluating digital interventions that seek to arrive at a more complete picture of the differences in the way in which participants use an intervention, supplemented by qualitative insights about participants&#x02019; subjective experiences of using the intervention [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and quantitative data on the effect of the intervention on health-related outcomes. Further usage of visualization techniques is highly recommended in order to (1) guide the design (redesign) of future interventions so that they enable easy access to valued intervention content, and (2) unlock the active ingredients in Web-based interventions, so they can be enhanced to reach and engage the maximum eligible population.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The development of the visualization tool was funded by the UK Economic and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/I032673/1: UBhave: ubiquitous and social computing for positive behaviour change).
