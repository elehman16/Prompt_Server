exercises on pelvic floor muscle strength could be detected via ultrasonography in
patients with urinary incontinence. [Subjects and Methods] Of 282 incontinent patients,
116 participated in the study and were randomly divided into a pelvic floor muscle
training (n=65) group or control group (n=51). The pelvic floor muscle training group was
given pelvic floor exercise training for 12 weeks. Both groups were evaluated at the
beginning of the study and after 12 weeks. Abdominal ultrasonography measurements in
transverse and longitudinal planes, the PERFECT scheme, perineometric evaluation, the stop
test, the stress test, and the pad test were used to assess pelvic floor muscle strength
in all cases. [Results] After training, the PERFECT, perineometry and transabdominal
ultrasonography measurements were found to be significantly improved, and the stop test
and pad test results were significantly decreased in the pelvic floor muscle training
group, whereas no difference was observed in the control group. There was a positive
correlation between the PERFECT force measurement scale and ultrasonography force
measurement scale before and after the intervention in the control and pelvic floor muscle
training groups (r=0.632 and r=0.642, respectively). [Conclusion] Ultrasonography can be
used as a noninvasive method to identify the change in pelvic floor muscle strength with
exercise training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pelvic floor muscle</kwd><kwd>Transabdominal ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>Urinary incontinence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Urinary incontinence (UI) has been defined as the complaint of any involuntary loss of
urine. The published prevalence rates of UI in adult women vary from 5 to 69%<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physiopathology of UI is
multifactorial, and it is known that weak pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) represent a problem
encountered in patients with UI<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PFMs
play an important role in the maintenance of continence. Therefore, the purpose of PFM
training is to increase strength and endurance as well as to provide neuromuscular
facilitation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. PFM training is generally
recommended as the first choice of treatment for stress and mixed UI in women<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several subjective and objective methods have been used to assess PFM function in women
attending physical therapy and exercise programs. The most commonly used tool in physical
therapy seems to be digital palpation (modified Oxford Grading Scale)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PERFECT scheme (Power, Endurance, Repetition, Fast
contractions, Every Contraction Timed) was developed to assess the primary components of PFM
contractility via digital palpation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Real-time ultrasound imaging is a rapidly developing technique that is used by physical
therapists to assess muscle structure, function, and activation patterns<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unlike other methods that require
intravaginal application, transabdominal ultrasonography (TAUS) has the advantages of
noninvasiveness, comfort, and appropriateness in a specific population in which vaginal
assessment may not be favorable (children, adolescents, victims of sexual abuse, men, and
certain ethnic groups) with quick and easy applications<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. TAUS has been found to be a valid and reliable method to measure
the movement of the bladder base as an indicator of PFM activity during muscle
contraction<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, only patients
with a score of 3 and above in muscle strength according to digital palpation were included
in these studies<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the
correlation between TAUS measurement and the parameters of the PERFECT scheme.</p><p>Therefore, our aim was to measure the PFM strength objectively by TAUS before and after PFM
training in patients with all levels of PFM strength (0&#x02013;5) and to compare the findings of
TAUS with digital palpation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial with testing performed before
and after training. Approval was obtained from the Dokuz Eylul University Human Ethics
Committee (Number: A 38 GOA 385 1.12.11) prior to this study, and written informed consent
was obtained from subjects.</p><p>The patients of this study included 282 incontinent women selected from the individuals
observed at a urogynecology unit. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, pelvic organ
prolapses, low back pain, spinal or pelvic fracture, urinary tract infection, vaginal
infection, known neurologic disorders, respiratory diseases, menstruation at the time of
assessment, history of spinal surgery, or history of PFM training (PFMT) during
physiotherapy within the last two years. One hundred forty-two patients were excluded from
the study. The remaining 140 patients who agreed to participate in the study were randomized
to the PFMT group (n=70) or the control group (n=70) and were evaluated before and after the
intervention. Randomization was carried out by the study coordinator using a
computer-generated random number table by the prelabeled sealed envelope method. Based on
random number table, patients were assigned to the two interventions.</p><p>Data with regard to age, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, duration of urinary
incontinence, number of pregnancies, and heaviest birth weight were collected from the
medical records at the initial visit. All patients underwent a vaginal examination in the
lithotomy position with an empty bladder. A preliminary assessment of PFM function was
performed by an experienced pelvic floor physiotherapist using the palpation method<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PERFECT, perineometric, and
ultrasonographic measurements were performed three times, and the average of the three
measurements was calculated. After these measurements, the stop test, pad test, and stress
test were performed. A 30-minute rest period was given after each muscle strength test.</p><p>The strength of the PFM was measured via palpation with one to two fingers, and PFM
function was evaluated according to the PERFECT scheme, which includes assessments of power,
endurance, number of repetitions, and number of fast (1&#x02005;s) contractions. Additionally, every
contraction was timed. Power was graded from 0 to 5, according to the Oxford grading system.
The PERFECT scheme of PFM evaluation was recorded and used as an exercise program for the
PFMT group<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A Peritron 9300V perineometer
(Cardio Design, Victoria, Australia) was used to measure the strength of PFM
contractions.</p><p>A diagnostic ultrasound imaging unit set in B mode (Ultrasonix ES500, Ultrasonix Medical
Corporation, Richmond, BC, Canada) with a 3.5-MHz curved array transducer was used for TAUS
measurement. Two investigators with at least two years of experience in using TAUS examined
all of the patients. A marker (X) was placed on the image of the central portion of the
bladder base at the junction of the hyper- and hypoechoic structures. The patients were
asked to perform three PFM contractions with a 10-s rest between each contraction, and each
image was captured at the point of maximal displacement and again marked with an X. The
displacement was measured as the distance between the two points marked with X (mm). A
physiotherapist confirmed the correctness of PFM contraction by examining any undesirable
movement or contraction of other muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Only contractions with cephalic movement of the bladder base were
accepted as correct.</p><p>The stop test was performed by slowing or stopping urine flow after initiation of voiding
with a full bladder. The one-hour pad test was performed by measuring the weight differences
of pads after completion of recommended types of exercises. The stress test was performed by
having the individual relax and then cough vigorously while the examiner observed them for
urine loss from the urethra<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The patients in the PFMT group participated in a 12-week exercise program. PFM exercises
were practiced two days per week for the first three weeks with intravaginal digital
palpation in different positions and monitoring by a physiotherapist. The patients performed
the exercise program at home for the remaining 9 weeks. The exercises were individualized
according to the degree of pelvic floor weakness, loss of proprioception, and the patient&#x02019;s
tolerance. The exercise program included the positions in which the exercise would be done,
the number of repetitions of slow and fast contractions, the duration of rest between the
contractions, and the number of repetitions in a day and in a week. After isometric
exercises, concentric and eccentric exercises were then respectively performed with a
frequency of 2&#x02013;7 sets per day with maximal voluntary contraction.</p><p>The data analysis was performed using a statistical analysis software (SPSS, v15.0, SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The variables were investigated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to
determine whether they were normally distributed. Descriptive analyses are presented using
the means and standard deviations for normally distributed PERFECT, ultrasonography,
perineometry, and demographic variables. The independent samples t-test and chi-square test
were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, to test the difference
between the pre- and posttreatment values in the study and control groups. The association
among TAUS measurements, perineometry results, and three components of the PERFECT scheme
(endurance, repetitions and fast) was assessed using Pearson&#x02019;s coefficient of correlation,
while Spearman&#x02019;s rho was used to determine the association between TAUS measurement and
digital palpation testing. A priori analysis for power indicated that 51 patients in each
group were needed to produce 80% power for detecting a large-size effect (assuming a
correlation &#x003c1; of 0.50 and population correlation &#x003c1; of 0.72) based on a one-tailed alpha
value of 0.05. A post hoc statistical power analysis showed that with the effect size (r) of
0.47, this study has 85% power to detect a significant correlation between the TAUS
measurements and perineometry with an overall 5% type-I error level. The G*Power 3 computer
program was used for the power analysis<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. An overall p-value of less than 0.05 was considered a statistically
significant result.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Among the 282 incontinent women, 91 were excluded from the study due to the exclusion
criteria, and 51 did not agree to participate in the study. The remaining 140 patients were
randomly divided into 2 groups. Each group initially had 70 patients, but 24 women did not
complete the study, resulting in a drop-out rate of 17.14%. Five patients in the exercise
group were excluded from the study because they did not participate in at least 75% of the
treatment sessions. Nineteen patients in the control group who did not attend their
secondary assessments due to personal reasons were also not included in the study (one woman
had a change in her work situation, two women had other health problems, 16 women did not
accept a second vaginal evaluation). Ultimately, the study was completed with 65 patients
(27 with stress UI, 23 with urge UI, and 15 with mixed type UI) in the exercise group and 51
patients (21 with stress UI, 17 with urge UI, and 13 with mixed type UI) in the control

group was detected by measurement of power (average difference between pre- and

and post-exercise TAUS measurements: 5.06&#x000b1;2.64&#x02005;mm). A statistically significant relationship
was found between the two measurement systems regarding strength increase (p=0.014,
r=0.303). There was no difference between power and TAUS with regard to pre- and
posttreatment strength values. When the strength values measured by power increased, the
values measured using TAUS also increased in the two groups (p&#x0003c;0.01, r=0.632; p&#x0003c;0.01,
r=0.642).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the strength of the PFM
after training in patients with all levels of PFM strength. This increase was detected by
using the PERFECT and perineometric measurement methods and by TAUS, which is a noninvasive
method. In addition, it was found that TAUS could detect the difference in strength even in
PFM strengths of 0&#x02013;2.</p><p>Regular PFM reassessment is suggested so that new exercise programs can be established and
for monitoring progress<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Correct
assessment of PFM strength is crucial when prescribing an exercise program according to
patient needs, when determining the correct exercise load, and when demonstrating the
effectiveness of the exercise. For suitable progression, frequent assessments must be
performed due to changes in strength related to exercise training. Understanding how to
correctly perform PFM contraction and giving biofeedback to the patient via TAUS during an
exercise session could be helpful for women who are reluctant to receive an internal
examination as well as for a continence physiotherapist.</p><p>The effects of pelvic floor rehabilitation on PFMs have been evaluated in previous reports
that measured PFM strength directly by TAUS. However, there have been few studies with
two-dimensional ultrasonography that have assessed changes in PFM strength after exercise
training. Ariail et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a case
in which TAUS was used for PFM rehabilitation, muscle reeducation, strength assessment, and
setting of the parameters of exercise prescriptions. However, unlike our study, not only the
strength of the muscles but also the duration of contractions was detected using TAUS.
Therefore, it seems that a patient&#x02019;s exercise prescription could be formed with the
parameters obtained from TAUS. Braekken et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> assessed the differences in PFMs after PFM training with
transperineal three-dimensional ultrasonography. The PFM thickness, levator hiatus
dimensions, and pubovisceral muscle length were measured using three-dimensional
ultrasonography at rest, during contraction, and during the Valsalva maneuver. At the end of
the study, it was determined that the effects of the training program could be easily
evaluated with three-dimensional ultrasonography<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PFMT method, patient motivation method, and results of
treatment in our study were the same as those in the study by Braekken et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. A significantly more detailed assessment
can be performed with three-dimensional ultrasonography; however, two-dimensional ultrasound
that we used in our study is a cheaper and more common method that could be used in all
obstetrics and gynecology clinics.</p><p>Our results are consistent with some studies that have demonstrated a significant
correlation between TAUS and digital palpation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in the study by Sherburne
et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, no significant correlation
between these two methods was identified. We propose that the result of that study was due
to the use of different US measuring techniques. In addition, our results for the mean
bladder base movement do not appear to be fully comparable with those of other reports
because we had a mixed population and we accepted a contraction as correct if the pelvic
floor was elevated.</p><p>Supervised, individually prepared PFMT programs are the most effective methods to relieve
the symptoms of urinary incontinence. PFM rehabilitation is applied in 12- to 14-week and
6-month programs. A significant increase in PFM strength has been observed after 12-week
programs<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. When home program applications were compared with long-term pelvic
floor rehabilitation applications in a physiotherapy clinic, no difference was found between
the results of the two applications in terms of a pad test or strength measurements<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we prescribed an individual
12-week home exercise program coordinated by an experienced physiotherapist. Tsai and
Liu<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> taught a group pelvic floor
exercises via intravaginal digital palpation, while their other group learned them via a
brochure. They compared the efficacy of the two methods by examining the change in the
1-hour pad test results between before and after a 12-week intervention period. The pad test
results were significantly better in the group that received one-on-one training by
intravaginal digital palpation. Confirming the findings of the study of Tsai et al., we
observed a statistically significant decrease in the pad and stop test results of the PFMT
group, which was taught PFM exercises intravaginally.</p><p>Previous studies have found that TAUS can be used reliably in women with some degree of PFM
activity on PFM grading with digital palpation (PFM grade &#x0003e;0)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study,
we determined an upward bladder base displacement by TAUS in some women with a PFM strength
grade of 0 according to the modified Oxford scale. The mean displacement was approximately
1.2&#x02005;mm to 1.3&#x02005;mm and was higher than the previously reported standard error of measurement
(0.13&#x02013;0.57&#x02005;mm) or minimal detectable change (0.36&#x02005;mm) of the TAUS technique in both
planes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is the first to note women with a PFM strength grade of 0 in a study
population. We assert that TAUS can be a valuable tool in determining minimal or no PFM
contraction and could replace or augment digital palpation. TAUS can be a reliable tool in
planning an exercise program and in determining even slight progress in muscle contraction
strength, especially in women with weaker PFMs.</p><p>There are several limitations of the current study. Firstly, the movement of the transducer
in both planes during TAUS measurement can cause measurement errors. However, the examiner
held the US transducer firmly against the abdominal wall to control and restrict excessive
movement. Secondly, the lack of a fixed bony reference point can make TAUS less reliable
than transperineal ultrasonography because the measurement of the bladder base elevation
with TAUS is expressed relative to a movable starting point. Finally, although the group
assignment was randomized, another limitation of the study was that the therapist that
carried out the evaluation and treatment was not blinded; this could have influenced the
results.</p><p>In conclusion, increments in force that occur with PFM training can be effectively
demonstrated via noninvasive methods such as TAUS as well as by invasive methods. TAUS
imaging without internal examination can be an alternative objective method for PFM
assessment in UI populations in which internal or transperineal methods are not appropriate,
in women who are reluctant to undergo an internal examination, and in women with low levels
of (0&#x02013;2) PFM strength. Therefore, measuring PFM contraction with TAUS may be clinically
useful when planning an exercise program, during an exercise session, and to examine the
patient&#x02019;s current status objectively to observe and plan the progress of continence
therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Buckley</surname><given-names>BS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lapitan</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group>, Epidemiology Committee of the Fourth International Consultation on
