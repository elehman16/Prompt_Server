Both interventions had the same content and duration (~4 h). Applicability was assessed by the number of subjects who completed the assigned intervention in each group. Insulin-prescribing competence (factual knowledge, problem-solving skills, and attitudes) was self-assessed through a questionnaire applied before, immediately after, and 3 months after the interventions. Acceptance of the intervention (satisfaction and perceived importance for clinical practice) was also assessed immediately after and 3 months after the interventions, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Subjects&#x02019; characteristics were similar between groups (mean age 38, 51.4% [69/134] male). In the game group, 69 of 88 (78%) completed the intervention, compared with 65 of 73 (89%) in the control group, with no difference in applicability. Percentage of right answers in the competence subscale, which was 52% at the baseline in both groups, significantly improved immediately after both interventions to 92% in the game group and to 85% in control (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001). After 3 months, it remained significantly higher than that at the baseline in both groups (80% in game, and 76% in control; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001). Absolute increase in competence score was better with the game (40%) than with traditional CME (34%; <italic>P</italic>=.01). Insulin-related attitudes were improved both after the game (significant improvement in 4 of 9 items) and after control activity (3 of 9). Both interventions were very well accepted, with most subjects rating them as &#x0201c;fun or pleasant,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;useful,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;practice-changing.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The game InsuOnline was applicable, very well accepted, and highly effective for medical education on insulin therapy.

In most countries, most patients with DM are followed and treated by doctors who are not specialists in Endocrinology or diabetes, mainly primary care physicians (PCPs) [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, only 24-56% of patients with DM present good glycemic control [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], defined as plasma levels of glycated hemoglobin A1c&#x0003c;7% [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Many factors may be implied in the low frequency of good metabolic control among patients with diabetes, but it is likely that one of the main reasons may be PCPs&#x02019; lack of knowledge and confidence on several aspects of DM management [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], specially regarding insulin use [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>This gap in PCPs&#x02019; competence to treat diabetes with insulin contributes to the problem known as clinical inertia, &#x0201c;the failure to advance therapy when indicated,&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] resulting in underuse of insulin [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and poor glycemic control. In fact, previous reports show that there is an average delay of about 3-5 years between the first demonstrations that a patient with DM requires insulin and the actual initiation of insulin therapy [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Continuing medical education (CME) on DM and insulin is often advocated as a solution to optimize the knowledge and the practice of PCPs [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; however, traditional CME activities (such as lectures and group discussions) have small and short-lasting efficacy [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, new educational methods are urgently required. Electronic games are a powerful tool for education [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], as they &#x0201c;create a tight marriage among content, game play, and valued ways of thinking and acting&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Reasons for using games include the familiarity of most college students with this medium [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and their favorable views on the matter [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, the 2 most compelling arguments sustaining the adoption of games for learning are (1) their potential educational effectiveness [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and (2) their flexibility and easy dissemination [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Good learning games are usually built following the same rules that guide the design of effective learning activities, which include stimulus to players&#x02019; intrinsic motivation, practice and repetition, effective feedback, arousal of positive feelings, intensity of the experience, and learner choice and involvement [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the medical area, allowing students to practice their skills in a game may increase the safety for real patients [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Also, electronic games are learning resources much more flexible than traditional onsite educational activities, as they can be used in learners&#x02019; own equipment, location, and time schedule, rendering them more scalable [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In the field of diabetes, some games for education of patients [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and a few technology-based initiatives for education of health professionals [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] have been described, but to our knowledge, no game has been previously reported for education of health professionals on diabetes or insulin.</p><p>We have previously described the process of design and development of InsuOnline, the first electronic serious game intended for medical education on insulin therapy for diabetes [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and a formative assessment of usability and playability of its prototype [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>A previous pilot study with medical students and residents has shown that InsuOnline was applicable and well accepted as a tool for medical education on insulin therapy, in what we called &#x0201c;real-world conditions&#x0201d; for self-directed distance learning activities: as a stand-alone resource, played in learners&#x02019; own equipment, in learners&#x02019; own time schedule, with minimal or no external guidance [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The next step in InsuOnline validation process is assessing its educational effectiveness.</p><p>Thus, the objectives of this study were to assess applicability, user acceptance, and effectiveness of InsuOnline for education of PCPs on insulin therapy for diabetes, as compared with a traditional onsite CME session with the same content and duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>We performed an open-label randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of InsuOnline as a method for education of PCPs on insulin therapy for diabetes, as compared with a &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; onsite educational activity with the same content and same duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility Criteria</title><p>Subjects were eligible if they were medical doctors with an active register at a regional Council of Medicine in Brazil, were not specialists in Endocrinology or diabetes, were currently working at a public health care unit as a primary care physician (PCP), and were directly involved in the treatment of patients with diabetes in those facilities, with any degree of computer or gaming literacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Researchers contacted local public health authorities of some cities from the states of Paran&#x000e1; (Londrina and other cities from the 17th Health Regional, Curitiba and S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; dos Pinhais) and Santa Catarina (Blumenau), who agreed to help with recruitment. Those authorities have enlisted PCPs in their area to attend a training session about diabetes, and then we contacted those PCPs via phone, mail, or email to invite them to participate in the study.</p><p>Those who agreed to participate were informed of the research procedures and were sent by email a link to an online informed consent form stored on Google Drive (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>). Respondents were allocated to groups by simple randomization using an online random number generator [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] by the first author. Due to our expectancy of a higher attrition rate in the game group, allocation was made at a 2:1 ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Settings and Locations Where Data Were Collected</title><p>After filling the informed consent form, participants were randomized and informed about the group they were allocated to and received an email with a link to the baseline questionnaire (stored on Google Drive). Also, participants allocated to control group were sent an email with information about the time and location of their scheduled onsite learning activity. A printed questionnaire was applied to those participants of the onsite learning activity immediately after its ending.</p><p>Participants allocated to game group received an email with instructions on how to download and install the game, after filling the baseline questionnaire, and then were contacted (weekly, if needed) to check if they have finished the game. After that, they were sent the link to another Web-based questionnaire.</p><p>After 3 months, a link to the third questionnaire was sent to participants of both groups.</p><p>If the participants did not answer the questionnaire after a few days, reminders were sent at 3-7&#x02013;day intervals (initially by email, then by text message, and finally by phone). If they did not answer after up to 6 consecutive reminders, they were considered as loss of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Game</title><p>InsuOnline was developed by transdisciplinary collaboration from a team composed by clinical endocrinologists, game designers, and experts in medical education, with the help of other professionals (programmers, graphic designers, sound editors, etc) when needed at specific points of the process, using the methodology of iterative prototyping [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The game was designed to be a tool for education of PCPs on how to best use insulin in the treatment of patients with DM, in a primary health care setting. Educational objectives of the game are presented in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Textbox 1</xref>. InsuOnline was developed as a 3D app, with simple commands (all player actions were made using a mouse); game engine was built using Unity, and visual elements (scenarios, characters, animations) were designed on Blender 3D creation suite. A detailed description of InsuOnline design and development process can be found in [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The version used in this study was a code release (version 1.6.1); screenshots (in Portuguese) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">2</xref>.</p><p>Participants allocated to the game group received a personal login and password to access a website from where the game could be downloaded and installed in players&#x02019; own desktops or notebooks with Windows or MacOS, without any cost for study subjects.</p><p>During the game, players take on the role of a young doctor in a primary health care unit, whose mission is to improve glycemic control of an increasing-complexity series of 19 patients with diabetes, usually by means of initiating or adjusting insulin. Patients and situations presented in the game were designed to be similar to scenarios most commonly seen in a primary health care unit. The game gives immediate feedback after each player&#x02019;s decision, and the player&#x02019;s progression in the game is only possible if the most adequate decisions are made.</p><p>Several pedagogical elements were included in the game, aiming for the best educational effects [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These were based on the principles of adult learning and problem-based learning, including motivation, goal-orientation, relevancy-orientation, self-pacing, timely and appropriate feedback, contextualization, and practical (ie, hands-on) approach with active participation of the learner [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Recommendations about how to use insulin were selected from main clinical guidelines [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and adapted to the reality of Brazilian public primary health care. Only the insulins commonly available in Brazilian public primary health care units (NPH and regular) were made available in the game. The software recorded players&#x02019; progress in the game. Participants were allowed to play the game in their preferred time and place, in the number of sessions they wanted. The amount of time necessary to finish the game was about 4 h in a previous study [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Usability, playability, and preliminary educational effectiveness of previous versions of the game were previously assessed and reported [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; development was &#x0201c;frozen&#x0201d; during the trial.</p><p>Players were sent minimal written instructions on how to download and play the game, and most did so with minimal or no external guidance.

Most available games for health professionals&#x02019; education have not passed through an objective validation process, and many of the published studies on the field are biased [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. So, there is a great need of good quality studies which can provide solid evidence to support the fast-growing science of games for health. Our randomized-controlled trial was designed to contribute to this body of evidence by following the guidelines for research on health games effectiveness as proposed by Kato, who suggested that studies in this area should attempt to apply the same scientific rigor typical of health sciences [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>As there is a variety of proposed methods for validating games for health, we opted to use multiple methods for validation of InsuOnline. One of the simplest validation approaches was proposed by Olsen [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and includes only 3 aspects: usability, playability, and educational effectiveness. The first two aspects were very well rated for InsuOnline, as previously reported [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and our current results support the third one. However, the best method to validate a game that was designed for CME is the approach to validation of CME activities described by Moore [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], that proposes a continuum of 7 levels: (1) applicability (user participation), (2) user satisfaction, (3) gain of factual and procedural knowledge (learning), (4) gain of competence, (5) improvement of learner&#x02019;s performance, (6) improvement of patient health, and (7) improvement of community health. InsuOnline has already met the first 4 criteria. The following 3 steps (change in PCP&#x02019;s professional performance and improvement of their patients&#x02019; glycemic control, and, hopefully, improvement of populational risk of DM complications) will be the focus of future research.</p><p>Attitudes and beliefs of PCPs in our sample were similar, at the baseline, to the ones of family doctors in United States [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and in Arab-speaking countries in the Middle East [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], although the Brazilian doctors who participated in our study seem to be more often inclined to perceive the initiation of insulin therapy and the training of the patient with DM for using insulin as difficult and complicated tasks (78% and 54% of our subjects, respectively, compared with 66% and 42% in United States, and 48% and 25% in Middle East), which underscores the urgent need for effective educational interventions.</p><p>Reasons for the better results observed with the game than with the onsite learning activity, in this study, can be related to characteristics of the games that foster learning and attitude (and behavioral) changes [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]:</p><p>1. The inclusion of behavioral change procedures into the game, such as: goal setting, decision-making, problem solving, goals re-evaluation, social rewards; and</p><p>2. The use of a story (the game plot), and the inclusion of behavioral change concepts into that story. Players&#x02019; identification and empathy for the story protagonist may contribute to change players&#x02019; attitudes, reflecting the attitudinal change that occurs with the protagonist character in the game, in a process known as &#x0201c;modeling&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Also, the higher emotional involvement of the learner with a game than with a traditional CME activity is another likely factor, as affection is a powerful determinant for changing attitudes and behavior [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Intrinsic motivation, a very effective learning catalyst, probably is one of the biggest advantages of games in relation to more traditional modalities of education [<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Our game was designed to produce a high level of players&#x02019; engagement, by careful disposition of different game elements (realism, identification with context and characters, increasing-difficulty challenges, humor, clear objectives, immediate and intense feedback for each players&#x02019; action, progress monitoring, and rewards). With that, the majority of participants stated that the game was &#x0201c;fun&#x0201d; and that it captured their attention all the time.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations of our study should be pointed out. First, blinding of the participants (and researchers) was not feasible due to the nature of the interventions, and that may have affected some of our results, especially the subscales of evaluation of the activities, as many subjects may have found it exciting or unusual to play an electronic game to learn about a medical topic. However, we think that our primary outcome (competence for prescribing insulin) was not compromised, as it was objectively assessed by standardized multiple-choice questions.</p><p>Second, the instruments used in this study were not previously validated, because they were developed by our team to assess the specific outcomes we addressed in this study. The use of customized instruments is strongly recommended by Moreno-Ger [<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], who argues that generic questionnaires are usually not useful for assessing games that can be very different in their objectives, target audiences, and needs. At our favor, we can say that our instruments were extensively reviewed by our team of experts in endocrinology and medical education, which warrants their face and content validity, and our subscales have shown acceptable reliability, as measured by their Cronbach alpha in the range of .7 to .8, with an exception of the attitudes subscale, which had very poor internal consistency [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The authors decided to maintain this subscale because it had questions similar to the ones used in previous surveys [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], allowing their comparison with our results.</p><p>In third place, this study shows only intermediate outcomes (PCPs&#x02019; knowledge, skills, attitudes, competence regarding insulin initiation, and adjustment for diabetes), but we don&#x02019;t know yet if the game will have any impact on actual health professionals&#x02019; performance or on their patients&#x02019; measures or outcomes (&#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; outcomes), which we expect to assess in future studies.</p><p>Finally, although PCPs&#x02019; competence for prescribing insulin is essential, it is very likely that a simple intervention on the education of medical doctors may be insufficient to induce a significant change in the process of care delivered to patients with DM in primary care. A multifaceted intervention, aiming at several aspects of DM management, should probably be more effective to improve care and control of DM on a primary health care level, but it would demand conjugated efforts from government and society to improve issues such as availability of multiprofessional teams, availability of better insulins and oral drugs, availability of reagent strips for self-monitoring of blood glucose, better access to diabetes education, and others.</p></sec><sec><title>Generalizability</title><p>We think our results can be generalized for most primary care physicians worldwide, as our sample included medical doctors from different geographic areas, different age groups, different levels of specialization and experience, and any degree of computer or gaming literacy. Also, our game was tested in what we believe to be the &#x0201c;real-world conditions&#x0201d; for the use of an electronic game for distance CME: in players&#x02019; own computers (with a wide range of possible equipment configurations), with very little or no external help from our team, and in their own spare time. Our results show that InsuOnline is a flexible, applicable and scalable option for large-scale CME on diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this &#x0201c;real-world conditions&#x0201d; randomized controlled trial, InsuOnline, the first electronic serious game designed for medical education on insulin therapy for diabetes, was applicable, very well accepted, and highly effective for education, with even better results for improving primary care physicians&#x02019; competence and attitudes related to diabetes and insulin than a gold-standard onsite CME activity with the same content and duration. For this reason, we believe InsuOnline is a valid tool for large-scale CME on DM, with advantages manifested in its easy Web dissemination, customizable content, and accordance with Adult Learning principles. We hope it can contribute to improve PCPs&#x02019; performance and optimize the quality of care offered to patients with DM in primary care, eventually improving patients&#x02019; glycemic control and reducing the risk of DM complications.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>All authors helped with the writing and review of this manuscript.</p><p>These data (preliminary results of baseline and immediately post-intervention assessments only) were partly presented at the 75th American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, at Boston Convention Center, Boston, MA, June 5-9, 2015.</p><p>The authors acknowledge the support of public health authorities in all the cities where this study was performed.
