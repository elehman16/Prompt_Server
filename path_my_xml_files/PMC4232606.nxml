The correct sentence is: The protocol was 6x5 s on, 10 s off, 150 &#x000b5;s impulse width, 30 Hz above the individual CTF, and was at 85% of the maximal tolerated stimulation energy.</p><p>There is an error in the first sentence of the &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d; subsection of the Abstract. The correct sentence is: After 3 w, the CTF had significantly (p&#x0003c;0.001) increased in CT calves from 21.5&#x000b1;1.4 Hz to 33.3&#x000b1;6.9 Hz, while it remained unchanged in nCT (pre: 23.6&#x000b1;5.7 Hz, mid: 22.3&#x000b1;3.5 Hz) and in both legs of the CG (pre: 21.8&#x000b1;3.2 Hz, mid: 22.0&#x000b1;2.7 Hz).</p><p>There are multiple errors in the last three sentences of second paragraph of the &#x0201c;Interventions&#x0201d; subsection of the Materials and Methods. The correct paragraph is: Each set consisted of 6 x 5 s contractions, separated by a 10 s break - resulting in a duty cycle of 0.33. These 5 s contractions induced muscle cramps only in the shortened calf muscles of the CT. That is, a total of 18 cramps per training session were induced in CT.</p><p>There is an error in the fifth sentence of the Results. The correct sentence is: After a period of three weeks, the CTF of the calf muscles stimulated in a shortened position (CT) was significantly increased from 21.5&#x000b1;1.4 Hz to 33.3&#x000b1;6.9 (p&#x0003c;0.001) after three weeks and 35.3&#x000b1;6.0 (p&#x0003c;0.001) after six weeks of intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114108-g001">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0114108-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0114108.g001</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cramp threshold frequencies (CTF) of calf muscles (m. gastrocnemius medialis) measured at pre-, mid- (3 weeks), and post- (6 weeks) tests following an electrical muscle stimulation protocol that was applied in a shortened (circles) or a neutral position (squares).</title><p>Further, CTF values of the non-trained legs of the control group (diamonds) are displayed.

The correct sentence is: The main finding of the present investigation was that stimulating calf muscles in a shortened position (CT) was able to significantly increase the individual CTF of subjects from 21.5&#x000b1;1.4 Hz to 35.3&#x000b1;6.0 after a period of six weeks.</p><p>There are multiple errors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114108-g001">Figure 2</xref>.
