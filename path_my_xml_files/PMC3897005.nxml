The sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the main mediators of stress response, which might negatively affect the cardiovascular system by alterations in blood pressure (BP) and lipids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Most allostatic mediators have a biphasic role with protective effects in the short run and damaging effects under chronic stress. Experimental studies have found that acute stress leads to pathophysiological changes in cardiac risk profile and thereby more directly explain a link to cardiovascular disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Stress releases free radicals which results in oxidative stress damage, resulting in imbalance between oxidant/antioxidant systems. Generation of free radicals is an integral feature of normal cellular functions. In contrast to excessive generation, inadequate removal results in destructive and irreversible cell damage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Antioxidants play an important protective role against reactive oxygen species.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Research indicates that there is an inverse relationship between the dietary intake of antioxidant rich foods and the cardiovascular morbidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic>, also known as <italic>Emblica officinalis</italic> (Family: <italic>Euphorbiaceae</italic>) is used in Ayurveda as potent rasayanas, a class of plant derived drugs reputed to promote health and longevity by improving defense against diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] <italic>P. emblica</italic> is a rich source of vitamin C, which plays an important role in scavenging free radicals, thus attenuates stress induced cardiovascular changes through its antioxidant action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] <italic>E. officinalis</italic> has been reported to reduce arterial BP and heart rate (HR) in rats with deoxycorticosterone acetate/1% sodium chloride high salt-induced hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of <italic>P. emblica</italic> on cold pressor stress test induced changes on cardiovascular parameters and aortic wave reflections in healthy human subjects.

The study was registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (2013/05/003656). All subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation in the study. The cold pressor stress test model equipment used in the present study was designed and validated by the department of clinical pharmacology and Therapeutics, NIMS, Hyderabad.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study participants</title><p>The 15 healthy male participants aged between 20 and 30 years, were screened following a full medical history, physical examination, hematological, hepatic, renal, biochemical, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray. Urine drug screening was done, for drug of abuse. The volunteers were selected from departmental database, which includes some of them working with the institute and some with private firms. Volunteers were excluded if there was any evidence of physical illness, drug abuse or abnormal laboratory parameters. Subjects were trained on the test procedure on two prior occasions so as to introduce them to the test procedure and to make them familiar with the testing device.

Each placebo capsule contains microcrystalline cellulose (49.7% w/w), lactose (49.5%) and magnesium stearate (0.69% w/w). Both study medications were supplied by Natreon, Inc. USA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study procedure</title><p>The study was a double-blind placebo controlled crossover design. All eligible subjects were randomized to receive either two capsules of proprietary <italic>P. emblica</italic> extract 250 mg twice-a-day or two capsules of placebo twice-a-day for 14 days. Subjects were housed in the department and after an overnight fast and abstinence of caffeine containing beverages, alcohol and smoking for at least 12 h, the study procedures were initiated. Before any testing, each subject rested in a supine position for 20 min in a quiet, temperature-controlled (26&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C) room. Subjects were asked to breathe normally and to remain at rest during the cardiovascular measurement. Subjects were permitted to listen to music and to read, except during periods of cardiovascular measurement. After stabilizing in an ambient environment the baseline arterial stiffness was recorded with sphygmocor, after which cold pressor test (CPT) was performed as described below. Then the arterial stiffness was again recorded within 2 min of performing CPT. Then the subject was given study medication and asked to take two capsules twice-a-day of the study medication allocated to them as per prior randomization schedule with 240 ml of water. The same procedure was repeated after 2 weeks of treatment. A washout period of 14 days was given between the treatments. Subjects then crossed over to receive the second formulation two capsules twice daily for 2 weeks. All the same test procedures were repeated before and after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Recording of vital parameters</title><p>Brachial BP and HR were measured with an automated digital BP monitor (OMRAN, SEM-1) and a mean of three readings was taken.

Increased aortic stiffness, enhanced wave reflection, increased systolic pressure and pulse pressure (and especially central pulse pressure) have been identified as independent components of cardiovascular risk.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] <italic>E. officinalis</italic> has been reported to produce cardiovascular adaptation by augmenting endogenous antioxidants and protects heart from oxidative stress in animal models.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The antioxidant and cardioprotective effect of <italic>E. officinalis</italic> was also elaborated by Bhattacharya <italic>et al</italic>., in animal models.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Cold pressor stress is an experimental stress paradigm based on a short-term painful stimulation by immersing the hand into ice-cold water. This paradigm has been frequently used in stress research and is known to be associated with substantial activation of the autonomic nervous system as well as mild to moderate activation of the HPA axis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Studies have shown that CPT model can be used to examine the cold induced sympathetic activation on vascular function. The cold exposure results in sympathetic activation, vasoconstriction and increased systolic and diastolic BP and also increases aortic augmentation index (AIx), a measure of wave reflection, leading to augmented central systolic pressure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] The increase in AIx induced by CPT in the present study was significantly reduced on treatment with <italic>P. emblica</italic> extract.</p><p>Tapas <italic>et al</italic>., in their study demonstrated that immersion of the right hand up to the wrist in 4&#x000b0;C cold water for 60 s stressed the healthy subjects. Stress exerted through the CPT for a minute stimulated the sympathetic nervous system and produced an acceleration of the HR and rise in BP, both systolic and diastolic, in comparison to those recorded before the foregoing test in all the normotensive volunteers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Our study observations are in agreement with these published reports. In the present study, there was increase in, radial and aortic systolic and diastolic BP after CPT. These stress induced changes on cardiovascular parameters were attenuated on treatment with <italic>P. emblica</italic> extract, whereas the placebo group did not show any significant change in response to CPT induced stress. The effect of CPT on HR response and BP is less well-defined, more variable on an individual basis and not homogeneous for the entire CPT period as reported by Mourot <italic>et al</italic>., in normal subjects and the similar variations in HR and BP in response to CPT was also observed in the present study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] This explains the variability in vascular reactivity in response to cold pressor stimulation in healthy volunteers.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Chart 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PR-6-29-g004"/></fig><p>SEVR is an index of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Low SEVR has been shown to be associated with coronary artery disease, severity of Type I and Type II diabetes, decreased renal function and a history of smoking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Estimation of SEVR by using applanation tonometry may provide a reliable tool for the assessment of coronary microcirculation in essential hypertensives with indications of myocardial ischemia and normal coronary arteries. The decrease in SEVR observed in the present study after cold pressor induced stress, is due to vasoconstriction and decreased myocardial perfusion.</p><p>Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress and associated cardiovascular changes.
