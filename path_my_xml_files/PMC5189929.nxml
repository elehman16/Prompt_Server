Preproghrelin, the protein product of the <italic>Ghrl</italic> gene, is acylated by ghrelin-<italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase (GOAT), the product of the <italic>Mboat4</italic> gene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> to produce the active acyl-ghrelin that binds GHSR and hence activates the orexigenic pathway in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.</p><p>Counteracting ghrelin, leptin, produced by the adipose tissue at proportional levels to the stored fat, acts through hypothalamic LEPRbs to both inhibit food intake and promote lipid mobilization.

The weight of the sham-operated animals, however, recovered and increased by 90 days, relative to the weight at the time of the surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The significant differences in body weight between SG- and sham-operated animals, documented at 30 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) or 90 days (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) post surgeries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), were most likely due to the greater loss of the excess fat mass seen in SG animals relative to their sham counterparts (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SG suppressed the gastric expression of key molecules involved in acyl-ghrelin homeostasis</title><p>To investigate whether changes in the ghrelin-producing system in the remnant stomach could be involved in the maintenance of lower plasma levels of acyl-ghrelin following SG, we examined the expression of the preproghrelin gene. We observed a significant reduction of preproghrelin at both the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, left) and the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, right) at 30 days post SG, as compared with post sham surgery (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, respectively). By 90 days post SG, preproghrelin mRNA levels had partially recovered, but still were significantly lower than those in post sham (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01); preproghrelin protein levels of SG rats did not, however, significantly differ from that of sham-operated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><p>The levels of <italic>Mboat4</italic> were significantly suppressed in rats subjected to SG relative to those subjected to sham surgery, at both 30 or 90 days post surgery (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Therefore, suppression of <italic>Mboat4</italic> expression may be part of the same transcriptional program that reduces the production of acyl-ghrelin post SG. This downregulation was, however, more profound than the one observed with ghrelin, indicating even lesser acylation of the available ghrelin molecules.</p><p>Reduced plasma ghrelin levels are linked to blockade of CB1R signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> thus, we examined the expression of CB1R mRNA in the stomach. We found a trend towards lower CB1R mRNA levels by 30 days, which reached significance by 90 days post SG (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). This decrease in CB1R expression correlated well with the increase at preproghrelin protein levels of SG animals at 90 days, compared with 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Thus, in addition to lower ghrelin acylation, downregulation of CB1R expression may also contribute to decreases in the availability of acyl-ghrelin from the remaining stomach in the periphery.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential control of energy homeostasis-related receptors at the hypothalamus in sleeve gastrectomized rats</title><p>In the hypothalamus of SG animals, we found a significant downregulation of <italic>Ghsr</italic> transcription, as compared with the sham-operated or the obese animals, in the long term (90 days; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, left). We observed an increase in GHSR protein levels 30 days post SG, relative to those of the obese animals (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). By 90 days post SG, however, this upregulation declined and reached the same levels as in the sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, right).</p><p>When we examined the message levels of LEPRb, we found that at 30 or 90 days postsurgeries, the expression of this mRNA was significantly lower in the SG group as opposed to the sham group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, left). A similar pattern was observed for the protein levels of the receptor, which declined accordingly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, right).</p><p>We documented a persistent downregulation of CB1R message levels in SG, as opposed to sham animals, throughout the study period (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In the protein levels of the MC4R, we observed a paradoxical regulation. More specifically, whereas mRNA levels did not change (data not shown), an initial trend towards upregulation of MC4R protein expression became significant by 90 days (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><p>To better portray these differential regulations in the mRNA or protein levels of the energy-related receptors in the hypothalamus, we plotted mRNA vs protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Apparently, no significant differences were observed for the ratio of protein/mRNA levels of the GHSR, LEPRb and MC4R at 30 days post SG in comparison with sham. By 90 days post operations, however, in SG animals, depletion of ghrelin led to increased abundance of GHSR, as the protein/mRNA ratio post SG was 2.5-fold higher than that seen after sham surgery. Likewise, LEPRb and MC4R exhibited increased ratios of threefold and twofold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Collectively, these data may indicate that mechanisms that regulate protein availability, such as the rate of ligand-dependent endocytosis and/or degradation, may be altered in the long term after SG to increase protein abundance.</p></sec><sec><title>The expression of appetite-related receptors was influenced by SG at extra-hypothalamic areas</title><p>We investigated the expression of energy-related receptors in extra-hypothalamic areas post SG and detected changes in the hippocampus and the cerebellum, but not in the amygdala, the brain cortex and the olfactory bulbs.</p><p>In the hippocampus, a significant effect of SG at the levels of MC4R was documented. Although, the mRNA levels were not significantly altered (data not shown), a prominent reduction in MC4R protein levels was sustained for up to 90 days post SG relative to sham animals (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

On the contrary, the protein levels of LEPRb, initially reduced by SG after 30 days in comparison with sham surgery (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), but were not significantly affected in the long term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>In the cerebellum, comparison of the GHSR message levels between SG animals at 30 and 90 days post surgery revealed a significant decrease in the SG group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), which correlated with a drastic decrease in GHSR protein abundance (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d and e</xref>). Moreover, at 30 days following surgery, an increase of LEPRb mRNA was detected in the cerebellum of SG animals as compared with sham (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Although this difference dissipated, a significant time-depended decrease was documented in the SG group between the studied time points (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The molecular mechanisms that act in the gut-brain axis to sustain the weight loss in the long term following SG remain unclear. To address these questions we have studied the expression of receptors that control energy homeostasis in rats who have undergone SG, a model that simulates the human post SG condition. Indeed, the weight of the SG animals in our study, kept in chow diet post surgery, was 15&#x00025; less than their obese weight, even at 30 days post SG, mostly due to an &#x0223c;80&#x00025; loss of their excess fat mass. In the long term, no further significant weight/fat loss or regain was observed in SG animals, in line with the observations that the greatest losses usually occur acutely by 2 weeks post SG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> These findings suggest that by 30 days post SG, a new lower body weight &#x02018;set point' was established and maintained thereafter.</p><p>In addressing the mechanism of this sustained fat loss, we found overall that the acute SG-induced loss of ghrelin-producing tissue and the lower circulating acyl-ghrelin levels post SG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> initiated changes into receptors expression in a temporal fashion that hierarchically, from the stomach to the brain, modulated the orexigenic and anorexigenic pathways. Specifically, when we investigated the ghrelin-producing capacity of the endocrine cells in the remnant stomach, we found that expression of preproghrelin, the non-secreted form of ghrelin, was significantly decreased by 30 days post SG. Although mRNA levels remained significantly lower than their sham-operated counterparts, in line with previous observations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> protein levels recovered after 90 days post SG, most likely due to lack of adequate acylation by GOAT and intracellular retention. Indeed, the significant reduction in GOAT expression was the most permanent effect post SG, hence the low plasma levels of acyl-ghrelin reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Secretion of acyl-ghrelin by the stomach is also under the regulation of CB1R, as activation of CB1R elevates its secretion into the circulation, and blockade reduces it, whereas genetic ablation of CB1R diminishes the orexigenic effect of ghrelin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> In turn, ghrelin prevents the downregulation of CB1R mRNA, as for example, when it counteracts the effects of postprandial cholecystokinin in nodose ganglion neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Therefore, we attribute the suppressed CB1R expression in the stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) to lower acyl-ghrelin and to higher postprandial cholecystokinin plasma levels known to occur post SG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Moreover, ghrelin may act indirectly on the transcription of CB1R through the modulation of ECs synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Thus, our data outline a temporal hierarchy in the reciprocal regulation of ghrelin secretion and CB1R expression in the stomach, whereby acute loss of stomach tissue and thus circulating ghrelin downregulates CB1R expression in the stomach, which in turn reduces the secretion of the already lower acyl-ghrelin, with the net result by 30 days, the maintenance of low acyl-ghrelin levels in the circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the long-term, both the reduction in EC signaling and the permanent reduction of GOAT expression may lead to even lesser acyl-ghrelin in the periphery. These data highlight the role of the EC system as an effector of ghrelin actions and emphasize its importance in the success of bariatric procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p><p>In the hypothalamus, CB1R expression was also impaired after SG, simulating region-specific decreases of CB1R mRNA during long periods of low circulating ghrelin levels, like obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Indeed, ghrelin promotes its orexigenic role through CB1R signaling by increasing the hypothalamic concentration of the ECs, as established in CB1R-knockout mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Our finding that GHSR mRNA levels decreased by 90 days in the SG animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) further supports the hypothesis of a hierarchy, controlled by ghrelin, as its persistent low levels were needed to produce transcriptional neuroadaptations in the hypothalamus. Although this has been previously suggested by the low expression of hypothalamic GHSR in obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> ghrelin administration has been shown to reduce or increase the expression of GHSR mRNA in primary pituitary cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> or in rat arcuate nucleus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> respectively. These findings are not necessarily contradictory but rather suggest that this ghrelin-GHSR regulation is cell-type specific and may depend on the neuronal cellular content. In further support, we found that GHSR protein levels in the cerebellum were downregulated in parallel with its mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), whereas the decrease in GHSR mRNA levels in the hypothalamus paradoxically did not correlate with its protein levels. Maintenance of hypothalamic GHSR abundance persisted throughout the 3-month study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and presumably reflects an expected attenuation of the degradation of GHSR due to acyl-ghrelin scarcity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Low leptin levels following SG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> are established in parallel to the progress of fat and weight loss post- SG, as the loss of fat, but not lean mass accounts for the reduction of weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The amount of weight loss at 3 weeks post SG was sufficient to reverse leptin resistance, a significant and permanent effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> This leptin reduction may affect LEPRb expression in the hypothalamus post SG, as previously reported for weight loss produced by caloric restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> or after leptin administration that increases the expression of LEPRb in responsive but not in leptin-resistant animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> In our model, the fat mass of SG animals was significantly lower by 30 days and the loss of excess fat sustained at similar levels in the long term, thus, stably low leptin levels should be expected. The LEPRb mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) of the SG animals were constantly lower than the sham, probably due to the fact that sham animals remained leptin resistant for longer time period. In similar studies, such changes in LEPRb mRNA expression were not recorded at least at the medio-basal part of the hypothalamus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> We assessed the whole hypothalamus and thus recorded contributions from all hypothalamic areas.</p><p>Leptin resistance may also develop in the hippocampus, at least following HFD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> The decreases in the hippocampal LEPRb protein levels after SG, resembling those in the hypothalamus, indicate that leptin may regulate important aspects of feeding behavior controlled by the hippocampus. Indeed, whereas hippocampus-specific ablation of LEPRb does not affect weight gain, adiposity or leptin levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> leptin signaling in the hippocampus reduces food intake and memory consolidation for the spatial location of food.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> In contrast to what we observed in the hypothalamus, LEPRb mRNA levels could not predict the protein levels in the hippocampus or cerebellum post SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This fact demonstrates that LEPRb regulation by leptin is different in these two areas, possibly due to different affinity transportation systems of leptin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> and predicts region-specific mechanisms for resistance to leptin.</p><p>In line with the observations by Stefater <italic>et al</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> we show that central nervous system mRNA expression of MC4R remained unaltered post SG. However, the protein levels of MC4R were elevated, suggesting that MC4R activity is controlled by protein availability mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> This upregulation of MC4R was a late event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and correlated with increased LEPRb protein availability, that is with the leptin resistance reversal. Leptin resistance reversal restores the leptin positive effects on a-MSH and the negative ones on AgRP production,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and, together with the low acyl-ghrelin levels, drives the net effect towards increased MC4R levels to promote the anorexigenic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In turn, the hypothalamic neurons that express high levels of MC4R release, in response to a-MSH, the anorexigenic corticotropin-releasing hormone, which may contribute through actions on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> in glucocorticoid-driven maintenance of lower body weight post SG.</p><p>We found a striking downregulation of MC4R in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), where its actions include improvements in memory and neuroprotection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> These features are suppressed during obesity, as a significant decrease of hippocampal neurons is observed in humans along with a reduction in inhibition of appetitive behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Bariatric surgery improves memory in humans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> whereas animals subjected to SG perform better than sham animals when tested for hippocampal-dependent memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> The significant downregulation of MC4R that we detected may signify a rapid turnover of the receptor in hippocampal neurons, which is restoration of a-MSH signaling, a major mechanism in reestablishing the inhibitory memory of excess food intake, which the patients report after SG.</p><p>Summarizing, post SG and with the limitation of postoperative diet choice to only healthy low-fat diet, we observed long-term changes in the expression of appetite- and metabolism-controlling receptors, which are compatible with a reprogramming of the energy homeostasis-related pathways in the gut-brain axis to a new balance that sustained the lower body weight. We propose that: (a) both the short- and long-term changes of the acyl-ghrelin-CB1R axis primarily affected the maintenance of low EC signaling to sustain the weight loss, and (b) the changes in the leptin axis were defined by the loss of weight and had a secondary role into this new balance, as the impact of leptin signaling remained stable over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, peripheral intervention into the ghrelin-CB1R axis should be considered as an additional therapeutic target for human obesity in patients subjected to SG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>NA and DM conceived, and with CF designed the study.

The acute loss of gastric tissue by SG decreases the expression of both ghrelin and GOAT in the remnant stomach, leading to reductions in acyl-ghrelin in the circulation. In the hypothalamus, lower acyl-ghrelin signaling reduce both the GHSR usage and thus degradation, as well as the hypothalamic levels of endocannabinoids (ECs), the endogenous agonists of the orexigenic CB1R, resulting in increased levels of GHSR and in CB1R expression decreases, by 30 days post SG. In parallel, the acute loss of fat mass decreases leptin plasma levels, which in turn, and after the establishment of leptin resistance reversal (LRR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> downregulate LEPRb and the levels of MC4R agonist, a-MSH. The expression of the anorexigenic MC4R did not change significantly at this time point, where the maximal weight loss is achieved post SG in humans. By 90 days post SG, a downregulation of CB1R expression in the remnant stomach results in retention of proghrelin into the A-like cells, and along with the stably low levels of GOAT sustain even lower levels of plasma acyl-ghrelin. In the hypothalamus, this effect further reduces the levels of the ECs and AgRP (endogenous MC4R antagonist); leptin levels remain stably low,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> so do the levels of LEPRb and the rest of the positive or negative effects on a-MSH or AgRP and ECs, respectively. Therefore, initiated by the downregulation of the acyl-ghrelin-CB1R signaling in the remnant stomach and the hypothalamus and followed by the increases in MC4R, the energy homeostasis system balances to an anorexigenic &#x02018;set point' maintaining the lower body weight post SG (black letters illustrate results of these studies, categorized by a system where events were scored in an additive manner: one arrow was received for significant expression differences between expression in SG animals at 30 days vs starting point (0 days), 90 days or sham (SH) animals at 30 or 90 days, and two arrows for long-term significant differences, that is between expression in SG animals at 90 vs 0 days; direction of arrows indicates down or upregulation.
