Stressors may arise from family-system disturbances, peer conflicts, school context, socio-cultural challenges, vulnerabilities to physical and mental health problems, or from living in the fast-paced, media-saturated and multi-tasking world that sets high demands for performance, success and competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Research suggests that sustained stress in childhood and adolescence has negative influence on mental health, general functioning, and specific learning-related factors, such as executive function and working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Approximately one fourth of youth suffers from at least one mental disorder during the past year, and respectively, about one third suffers from any lifetime mental disorder. Anxiety disorders are the most frequent mental disorders in children and adolescents, followed by behavior disorders, the mood disorders and substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Finland, approximately 14&#x000a0;% of children aged eight to nine years suffer from some kind of mental health problems, and this share steeply arises along with the onset of puberty to 15&#x02013;25&#x000a0;% in adolescent population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Psychiatric disorders are the most important disorder group that impairs adolescents&#x02019; functional ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and perceived stress is shown to increase the risk of subsequent mental disorders and their symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for effective, disseminable strategies to protect children and youth from dysfunctional effects of stress.</p><p>During the last few years, research on mindfulness has increased, and extended from initially focusing only on adults to including children and adolescents as well. However, studies with methodologically sound designs are still lacking. To be able to indicate the significant beneficial effects of mindfulness practice also on children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; health and well-being, research needs to shift toward large, well-designed studies with robust methodologies, and adopt standardized formats of interventions, allowing for replication and comparison of studies, to develop a firm evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mindfulness and health</title><p>Mindfulness refers to a non-condemning state of awareness and readiness to pay attention to the stream of experiences in the present moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The concept is rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions and was later developed as part of therapeutic applications in psychology and medicine, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], dialectic behavior therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The beneficial elements of mindfulness are suggested to include e.g. attention regulation, body awareness, emotion regulation, and change in perspectives on the self and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Research among adults has shown that mindfulness practices reduce negative states of mind, such as stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and symptoms of anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], as well as alleviate various medical conditions, such as chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] , type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, research among adults has shown promising positive associations between mindfulness practice and health behaviours, such as smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], decreased binge eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and decreased alcohol and substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Finally, practicing mindfulness has also been shown to produce positive effects on psychological well-being in healthy participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Recently, also brain imaging has been utilized to study the neural level effects related to mindfulness based practices or meditation. Changes are reported both in structural properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and in brain functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], especially related to attentional control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and emotion regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>In the previous decade, interest started to spread to mindfulness based approaches with children and adolescents and international research has shown promising preliminary results both in clinical context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and in non-clinical, school context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mindfulness among children and adolescents in school setting</title><p>It has been reported that mindfulness interventions are acceptable for children and adolescents, as well as feasible, and that they improve for example attention, emotional reactivity and some areas of meta-cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Mindfulness-based programs have improved school-aged children&#x02019;s attention and teacher-rated social skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A school-based (RCT) study showed significant improvements in post-treatment measures of self-rated test anxiety, teacher rated attention, social skills, objective measures of selective (visual) attention but no sustained attention, as well as improved behavioral regulation, metacognition, and overall global executive control among children who started out with poor executive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Correspondingly, in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] adolescents with lower pre-intervention self-regulation were observed to experience greatest improvements in behavioral regulation, meta-cognition and executive function. Preliminary research has shown that school-based mindfulness intervention programs may also result in beneficial outcomes regarding the interaction and pedagogical atmosphere among both students and students and their teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>In the school setting, mindfulness interventions reach the whole age group, and through the equal reach may even act as a counterforce for the prominent development of increasing inequality between different groups (based on e.g. gender, learning difficulties, health challenges, or socioeconomic background), yet empirical evidence is lacking.</p><p>While cost-effectiveness and ease of implementation of mindfulness programs in schools are notable advantages, sufficient evidence is still lacking on the role of mindfulness in fostering resilience, mental health and well-being among children and adolescents, over and above existing approaches such as relaxation. The previous studies conducted among youth are still few in number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and their methodological shortcomings (e.g. small sample sizes without control groups and/or unstandardized mindfulness intervention programs) prevent making generalizations of the efficacy of these interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For instance, it is not well understood whether the observed changes persist or what the short and long-term effects of mindfulness intervention are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Further, the role of mindfulness in improving health behavior among adolescents is not well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>It might be at place to state here also that the Finnish school system offers exceptionally good possibilities for examining between-individual variation as the school-related variance is minimized due to the homogenous schools system of our country: All schools follow the national curriculum, private schools are almost non-existent, and majority of students go to the nearest school in their residential area. Also areal segregation is still rather low compared to other countries. Furthermore, all teachers receive university education which reduces the teacher-related variance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The aim of the study</title><p>The comprehensive aim of this ongoing trial is to examine the effects of mindfulness practices in strengthening children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; internal resources that promote mental wellbeing, cognitive functions, psycho-physiological responses, academic achievement, health behavior, motivational determinants of practice compared to a standard relaxation program and a non-treatment group (waiting-list). The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of the school-based mindfulness program on three main outcomes: resilience (RS14), existence or absence of depressive symptoms (RBDI), and experienced psychological strengths and difficulties (SDQ). Secondary outcomes include mindfulness, happiness, satisfaction with life, quality of life, positive and negative affects, compassion/self-kindness, the rumination, and stress. Other explored factors among children and adolescents are cognitive functions, psycho-physiological responses, academic achievement, health behavior, motivational determinants of practicing mindfulness, and class room social environment. The study will also explore equity of distribution of the primary outcomes in terms of social background, gender, and learning difficulties of the students. The results of the study will be presented according to the 2010 CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and its extension to cluster randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is an ongoing cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three arms. Eligible schools were randomly allocated either to an intervention, control or non-treatment groups. Clusters were school classes (grades 6, 7 and 8) and age gap was from 12 to 15&#x000a0;years olds. The data collection started in the spring 2014, and finishes in the autumn 2016. The analyzing and reporting of the data starts in the autumn 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization procedure</title><p>The recruitment started by listing all the schools in a Southern part of Finland. After choosing the schools (including as many classes of the same grade as possible), a letter explaining the study procedure was sent by e-mail to the head masters. Within few days after sending the information letter, the research team members called the headmasters by telephone. In most schools the decision to take part to the study was made collectively by the head master and the class teachers (of the chosen grades). The schools were enrolled from 14 cities/municipalities during the collection of the data (years 2014&#x02013;2016). Altogether 247 schools were contacted, 59 of those participated in the study participation percentage being 24. In each municipality we aimed at an equal number of intervention and control classes. In order to achieve balanced intervention and control groups, schools participating in the study were randomized using the available background variables. The selection of intervention-control pairs was primarily based on the language being used for teaching (Finnish, Swedish or English, the grade, the school location, the number of classes participating in the investigation and, if necessary, the average apartment price per square meter in the school&#x02019;s neighborhood).</p><p>The classes were randomly assigned to mindfulness intervention classes (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;85) and control classes (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;79) and non-treatment classes (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28). Due to practical reasons, in spring 2014 and in autumn 2015 schools were divided into two arms (intervention and control) and in spring 2015 and spring 2016 into three arms instead of two: intervention, control and non-treatment groups. First, the schools were divided into three groups based on the school location and the average apartment price per square meter. Within each of these groups, the total number of schools and classes varied. Next, the schools for these groups were divided into three subgroups including approximately same number of classes (some schools were combined into one subgroup to achieve an as even distribution of classes as possible).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection timeline</title><p>The data from intervention and control groups have been collected during four academic terms: In the beginning of spring term in 2014 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;523), in the beginning of autumn term in 2014 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1090), in the beginning of spring term in 2015 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;821), and in the beginning of spring term in 2016 (on going, baseline including <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;203). Hence the last follow-up will be collected in spring 2017 (12&#x000a0;months follow-up of the spring 2016). Among intervention and control groups data have been collected at baseline, in the middle of the intervention (the fifth week of the intervention, a short formula), within 1&#x000a0;week after the intervention, and 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after baseline from the same participants.</p><p>Due to practical reasons, the data from non-treatment group have been collected during two academic terms: In the beginning of spring term in 2015 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;254), and in the beginning of spring term 2016 (ongoing, baseline including <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;109).

The measurement includes skin conductance response, heart rate and electrocardiography.</p><p>Skin conductance response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] method for measuring the electrical conductance of the skin which varies with moisture level. Sweat glands are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, so skin conductance is used as an indication of psychological or physiological arousal. Therefore, if the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is highly aroused, sweat gland activity will also increase, which in turn increases skin conductance. In this way, skin conductance can be used as a measure of emotional and sympathetic responses. A pair of electrodes is attached to palm or fingers to measure the response over a period of time.</p><p>Electrocardiography is a transthoracic interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by an electrocardiogram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

The clustering of outcomes within schools was taken into account, assuming an intra-cluster (intra-school) correlation coefficient of 0.03 and assumed that on average 60 children in each school will complete the study.
