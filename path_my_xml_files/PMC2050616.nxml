Only 9 subjects (18%) produced a single joint crack, the majority of the subjects (82%) produced either two (22 subjects) or three (10 subjects) distinct joint crack signals, while seven subjects produced four and two subjects five separate joint crack signals. Frequency analysis was performed on a total of 122 individual wave forms. Peak frequencies for all analysed crack signals ranged from 1,830 Hz to 86 Hz with an mean of 333 Hz (95% C.I., 285-380 Hz), a mode of 215 Hz and a median of 215 Hz. Statistical analysis for recorded signals revealed 95% Confidence Interval for the mean of 285-380 Hz. No statistically significant differences were found for peak frequencies between the sexes or for a previous history of trauma and no trauma and for pre-manipulative and manipulative joint cracks.
