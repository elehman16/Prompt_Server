Amoxicillin significantly reduced the proportion of children with i) perforation at the end of therapy (27% to 12% RD = -16% [-31,-1]), ii) recurrent perforation during therapy (18% to 4% RD = -14% [-25,-2]), and iii) reduced the proportion of examinations with a diagnosis of perforation during therapy (20% to 8% adjusted risk ratio 0.36 [0.15,0.83] p = 0.017). During therapy, the proportion of examinations with penicillin non-susceptible (MIC &#x0003e; 0.1 microg/ml) pneumococci was not significantly different between the amoxicillin group (34%) and the placebo group (40%).

In most settings the pain or fever of acute OM (AOM) is of principal concern. However, in disadvantaged and Indigenous populations, where symptomatic AOM is less often reported, AOM with tympanic membrane perforation (AOMwiP) and progression to chronic suppurative OM (CSOM) can lead to hearing impairment and educational disadvantage. CSOM is estimated to currently affect between 65 and 330 million people, 60% of whom have a significant hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] This global burden mainly affects South East Asia, Western Pacific, Africa and ethnic minorities. A 2001 cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal children aged 6 months to 2.5 years living in 29 remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory of Australia, showed perforation rates varying from 0% to 60% (mean rate 24%) between communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In longitudinal studies of Aboriginal children, OM has been shown to commence within weeks of birth, shortly after nasopharyngeal colonisation with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, non-capsular <italic>Haemophilus influenzae </italic>(NCHi) and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] This link between bacterial colonisation and early onset of persistent OM suggested to us that long-term antibiotic therapy could be of benefit for Aboriginal infants and others in high-risk populations. The impact of antibiotics has been unclear in populations where rates of CSOM exceed 4%, although systematic reviews demonstrate that antibiotics do prevent some episodes of AOM in more affluent populations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and are particularly beneficial for children with more severe OM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the effects of long-term antibiotics and placebo on otitis media with effusion (OME) and nasopharyngeal carriage of antibiotic-resistant OM bacterial pathogens in a high-risk population.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and Setting</title><p>The study was conducted in three Aboriginal communities located 70 Km from Darwin, in tropical northern Australia. During the study period breastfeeding was universal, parental smoking extremely common, and formal childcare was unavailable. Data collection commenced in 1996 and was completed in 2001, when pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was about to be licensed in Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility and exclusion criteria</title><p>Enrolled infants were Aboriginal, less than 12 months of age and resident in a study community. Infants were enrolled as soon as possible after birth, examined every two weeks, and those with unilateral or bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME) were eligible for randomization. Infants were excluded on the basis of prematurity (&#x0003c;34 weeks), chronic infection requiring prophylactic antibiotic therapy, craniofacial abnormalities or immune deficiency syndromes.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical and Funding Issues</title><p>The study was approved by the Top End Human Research Ethics Committee and Aboriginal Sub-Committee, and the Tiwi Health Board. Funding was provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council, which had no involvement in study design, management, or reporting of results.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent procedures</title><p>Written informed consent was sought before enrolment and also before randomization; families were given at least 2 weeks to consider consent. Initially, consent for microbiological assessments prior to randomisation was not requested.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomised Intervention</title><p>Randomized participants received either amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day bid) or placebo equivalent volume for 24 weeks or until bilateral normal middle ear status was detected at two consecutive monthly examinations (success). Block randomisation was stratified by age. Allocation was concealed from children, family, investigators, and those providing routine clinical care. Blinding was achieved by using a placebo similar in packaging, colour, consistency and smell to amoxicillin suspension. Intercurrent illnesses were managed according to local community treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Further details of randomisation [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnosis and Outcome assessments</title><sec><title>Eligibility and scheduling</title><p>Baseline characteristics and pre-enrolment ear disease were assessed from clinical records.

Clinic notes were reviewed to assess inter-current illness and side effects.

Bilateral normal ears were detected in 6% and 2% of visits in amoxicillin and placebo infants, respectively (adjusted risk ratio = 2.7 [0.78, 9.13] p = 0.116). OME was the worst ear diagnosis at about half the visits in each group, AOMwoP was detected in about one quarter of visits. AOMwiP was less often diagnosed in children receiving amoxicillin (8%) than placebo (19%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.36 [0.16, 0.84] p = 0.017). For combined diagnostic categories of any suppurative OM, any perforation, and any active perforation, significant differences in perforation were found. Antibiotic prescribing for a clinical indication was less often required at examinations of amoxicillin children (55%) then placebo children (68%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.67 [0.36, 1.22] p = 0.190).

There were non-significant differences in 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes (42% versus 48% in amoxicillin and placebo swabs, respectively, data not shown) and <italic>M. catarrhalis </italic>(85% versus 90%). Fewer amoxicillin swabs cultured all 3 pathogens simultaneously (46% versus 58%), but this was not statistically significant (adjusted risk ratio = 0.64 [0.34, 1.23] p = 0.183). During therapy, children in the amoxicillin group also carried fewer penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci (34% versus 40% in amoxicillin and placebo, respectively), and fewer macrolide non-susceptible (16% versus 20%, data not shown) and multi-drug resistant (15% versus 20%, data not shown) pneumococci. Beta-lactamase producing NCHi were detected more often in amoxicillin (10%) than placebo (5%) swabs; these latter differences did not reach statistical significance.

The primary outcome from our double-blind RCT is that amoxicillin significantly increased the proportion of children achieving normal middle ears (bilaterally aerated) at consecutive monthly examinations. Amoxicillin also reduced the proportion of children with any perforation. The proportion with any suppurative OM was also less in the amoxicillin group at the end of therapy, but not significantly so (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The proportion of children on amoxicillin experiencing at least two episodes of AOMwiP during therapy was less than for placebo children (4% versus 18%, respectively). There was no difference between placebo and amoxicillin in the proportion of children with OME (~52% in each group) or AOMwoP (~22%) at the end of therapy. Risk differences during therapy (supplementary material) were consistent with the end of therapy findings. Pneumococcal non-susceptibility was similar in amoxicillin and placebo groups, however a greater proportion of children in the amoxicillin group were colonised by beta-lactamase producing <italic>H. influenzae </italic>at both baseline and at end of therapy.</p><p>Our findings can be understood in terms of the natural history of OM in high-risk populations. In Aboriginal children, AOM is usually asymptomatic with parents unaware that their child is unwell. In community-based screening, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] some 20% to 30% of Aboriginal children have bulging eardrums. Only a minority have the typical symptoms (sudden onset of middle ear effusion with pain or fever) which define AOM in low-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To explain our findings in this high-risk population, we suggest that in placebo recipients, asymptomatic middle ear infection often progresses to AOM with perforation, whereas continuous amoxicillin helps to prevent that progression. This is consistent with our previous study of short-term antibiotics for asymptomatic AOM which indicated that the majority of children still satisfy the criteria for AOM despite treatment for 7 to 14 days. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] The present study suggests that therapy can be more successful if it is maintained long-term. We believe that this can be explained by the association of bacterial load with increased severity of OM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It may be that continuous antibiotics maintain bacterial load below a critical threshold for more severe disease.</p><p>Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; this has not been emphasised in the AAP and AAFP guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3&#x02013;7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), the NNT would be about ten for normalisation of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome. If compliance could be guaranteed in Aboriginal children, each NNT would likely be reduced.</p><p>What are the microbiological implications of long-term amoxicillin? Our study shows a significant reduction in pneumococcal carriage during amoxicillin therapy. Despite the positive results from our RCT it is unclear whether withholding antibiotics in an asymptomatic child at risk of perforation will result in a clinical deterioration that outweighs the theoretical risk of increasing antibiotic resistance should the child be treated. It is reassuring that in our RCT there was no increase in the carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci as a result of treatment, nor any difference in antibiotics prescribed for intercurrent illnesses between amoxicillin and placebo children. Indeed there was a tendency for <italic>fewer </italic>children in the amoxicillin group to be colonised by penicillin-resistant pneumococci. On the other hand, although beta-lactamase producing <italic>H. influenzae </italic>were uncommon in both groups, they were detected more frequently in children receiving amoxicillin; however, as this non-significant trend was also present before the start of trial therapy, it could be a chance finding.</p><p>Empirical studies of resistance are not available from other randomised controlled trials of long term antibiotics for otitis media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The study of perforation in Alaska natives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which also found that long-term antibiotics were beneficial, did not report on antibiotic resistance. We note that by 1997, 25% of Australian clinical isolates were penicillin non-susceptible, and high levels of penicillin resistance were reported from Aboriginal communities from the mid 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that OM is more advanced when multiple pathogens colonise the nasopharynx simultaneously and at high density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] We suggest that the effect of long-term amoxicillin is to reduce the density and multiplicity of bacterial carriage by reducing the rate of acquisition of new strains and/or the rate of proliferation of those already acquired. In the Finnish OM study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] 28% of new pneumococcal acquisitions were associated with pneumococcal AOM, compared with only 11% for established carriage.</p><p>We believe that our study of long-term antibiotic use is very relevant for Aboriginal and other populations at high risk of tympanic membrane perforation. Unfortunately conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has not significantly reduced ear disease in Australian Aboriginal children. A recent pediatric outreach program in Far North Queensland confirms that CSOM is the most prevalent health problem in Aboriginal children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The poor school achievement of Aboriginal children, already disadvantaged by poverty, has been partially attributed to the chronic hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had fewer perforations, more normal ears, less pneumococcal carriage and fewer resistant pneumococci than children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for acute illnesses but without continuous amoxicillin. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears, fewer perforations and less pneumococcal carriage.
