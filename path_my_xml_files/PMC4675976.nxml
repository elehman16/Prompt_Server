Salvinorin-A is found in <italic>Salvia divinorum</italic>, a psychoactive plant traditionally used by the Mazatec people of Oaxaca, Mexico, for medicinal and spiritual purposes. Previous studies with the plant and salvinorin-A have reported psychedelic-like changes in perception, but also unusual changes in body awareness and detachment from external reality.

<italic>Salvia divinorum</italic> (Labiatae) is a rare perennial herb endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental of Oaxaca, Mexico. The Mazatec people who inhabit this area have been using the leaves of the plant for centuries in the treatment of headaches, rheumatism, gastrointestinal diseases, and as a general medicinal tonic (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Vald&#x000e9;s et al., 1983</xref>). The Mazatec also use <italic>S. divinorum</italic> leaves for spiritual purposes, divination, and as a catalyst for knowing the causes of illnesses and the adequate cures for their patients (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Vald&#x000e9;s et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Ott, 1995</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">During the last decade, interest in <italic>S. divinorum</italic> has increased in Europe and North America. Users of the plant in these areas have found new ways of administration that lead to stronger and more efficient effects, compared to the traditional intake routes used by the Mazatecs (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2006</xref>). These new administration routes include the sublingual route, and the smoking of dry leaves and fortified extracts (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Siebert, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Ott, 1995</xref>). Retrospective studies in non-traditional users indicate that <italic>S. divinorum</italic> is mainly consumed by smoking leaf extracts. Use is occasional and experimental. Subjects reported consuming the drug an average of only two times. This low frequency of use has been attributed to intense somatic-dysphoric effects (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Salvinorin-A, the main psychoactive constituent in <italic>S. divinorum</italic>, is a non-nitrogenous neoclerodane diterpene with an affinity for the kappa opioid receptor (KOR; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al., 2002</xref>). Despite its intense perception-modifying effects in humans, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that salvinorin-A does not bind to 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, the molecular target of classic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, psilocybin, and dimethyltryptamine (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Prisinzano, 2005</xref>). The combination of intense perceptual and somatic effects is characteristic of salvinorin-A. Older nitrogenated KOR agonists such as enadoline are known to induce unpleasant reactions, and modifications in perception usually appear at high doses (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 2001</xref>). The distinct effects of salvinorin-A are probably due to its high potency and selectivity at KOR (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Previous reports of subjective effects include prominent somatic modifications. These range from tactile effects to a marked loss of control over the body (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Addy et al., 2015</xref>). These modifications have been quantitatively demonstrated, for instance, as significant increases in scores on the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS) somaesthesia subscale (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Addy et al., 2015</xref>), which measures tactile, visceral, and interoceptive effects (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Strassman et al., 1994</xref>). These somatic and tactile effects may be related to altered interoception, but this has not been directly assessed. &#x0201c;Interoception&#x0201d; refers to the primary internal representation of the physiological condition of the body (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Craig, 2009</xref>). This facet of awareness encompasses a series of processes that can range from somatic sensations to dissociation, and is related to the visceral state of the body and emotional experience. Altered interoceptive abilities have been implicated in addiction (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2012</xref>), anxiety, and depression (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Paulus and Stein, 2010</xref>), and their restoration is at the center of body-focused therapies (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Mehling et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In the present study we wished to comprehensively assess the pattern of subjective effects of increasing doses of salvinorin-A, with a special emphasis on interoception. For safety reasons, we recruited a small number of participants who had extensive experience with psychedelics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declarations of Helsinki and its updates concerning experimentation on humans, and was approved by the hospital&#x02019;s ethics committee and the Spanish Ministry of Health. All participants gave their written informed consent prior to participation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Participants</title><p>We contacted circles of individuals interested in the altered states of consciousness induced by psychoactive substances and explained to them the goals and methods of our study. We asked our contacts to pass the information to their acquaintances and we finally recruited a group of eight healthy volunteers (three males, five females). They all had a minimum experience with psychedelics of ten times and no history of adverse effects from their use. The volunteers were interviewed by the principal investigator (Dr Riba), who recorded their previous experience with perception-modifying drugs and explained the goals and methods of the present study. Exclusion criteria included a current or past history of psychiatric disorders, alcohol or other substance dependence, evidence of significant illness, and pregnancy. Participants underwent a complete physical examination that included a medical history, laboratory tests, ECG, and urinalysis. Participants received detailed information about the nature of salvinorin-A and the general psychological effects of psychedelics and their possible adverse effects as they are described in the psychiatric literature.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Drug</title><p>Three doses of pure (&#x0003e;99%) salvinorin-A of 0.25, 0.50, and 1 milligrams were administered via inhalation after vaporization. Using previously described procedures (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>), individual doses were prepared in vials that contained the salvinorin dose dissolved in 1ml of acetone vehicle. Placebo vials contained the 1ml acetone vehicle only. No other substance was added. Prior to administration, the content of the vial was placed in a round-bottom flask and the acetone allowed to evaporate. The residue was heated, vaporized, and administered to the participants as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Study Design and Experimental Procedure</title><p>The study was carried out in a double-blind fashion. Volunteers were informed that they would receive three doses of salvinorin-A (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0mg) and placebo over four experimental days, with the sequence of drug conditions randomized. In order to control for expectancy, participants were told that administration would be made in a balanced fashion. For safety reasons, doses were actually administered in increasing order. The low dose of 0.25mg always preceded the medium 0.50mg dose and the medium dose always preceded the high 1mg dose. The position of the placebo was randomly determined for each volunteer. Experimenters were aware of the ascending order of the active doses but did not know the position of the placebo in the sequence. Two weeks before the beginning of the experimental sessions, volunteers were instructed to abstain from all medications and illicit drugs, and remain drug-free throughout the study. Urinalysis for illicit drug use was conducted before each experimental session; volunteers tested negative for cannabis, opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and amphetamine. Additionally, volunteers were instructed to abstain from alcohol 24h before each experimental day, verified by breath analysis, and from tobacco and caffeinated drinks on the experimental day. Experimental days were 24h apart.</p><p content-type="indent">Upon arrival in the morning to the research unit, breath analysis for alcohol, urinalysis for illicit drug use, and a urine pregnancy test (for women only) were administered. Then salvinorin-A or placebo was administered by vaporization and inhalation. The administration method followed that previously developed and described in detail by Johnson and coworkers (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2013</xref>). The round-bottom flask was connected to a vacuum adapter, which was connected to a rubber tube to allow the inhalation of the vaporized salvinorin-A. The flask was kept from the participant&#x02019;s view using an aluminum foil screen. The volunteer was seated in a recliner bed while performing a sustained inhalation for 30 seconds while the base of the flask was heated with a butane flame for 30 seconds. After the 30-second period, they were instructed to exhale. Immediately thereafter, the bed was reclined until the volunteer was in a recumbent position. The room was kept dimly lit but the eyes of the participants were not covered. No music was used during the sessions. During the acute salvinorin-A effects, at regular intervals between 0 and 45 minutes, the investigator asked the participant to rate the intensity of subjective effects. After 60 minutes, the participant left the room and answered the battery of subjective effects questionnaires and instruments (see below). If they had experienced any noticeable effects, they were also asked to write in their own words a report of their experience. Four hours after drug administration, they were discharged and allowed to leave the research unit.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Measurements</title><p>The psychological effects elicited by salvinorin-A were measured using a battery of subjective effects questionnaires and visual analog scales (VAS) administered in each experimental session.</p><p content-type="indent">The Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS) was designed to measure the effects of dimethyltryptamine (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Strassman et al., 1994</xref>). It has previously shown sensitivity to inhaled salvinorin-A (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>) and to smoked <italic>Salvia divinorum</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Addy et al., 2015</xref>). The HRS measures psychedelic-induced subjective effects on six subscales: somaesthesia, reflecting somatic effects; affect, showing sensitivity to emotional and affective responses; cognition, describing modifications in thought processes or content; perception, measuring visual, auditory, gustatory, and olfactory experiences; volition, indicating the volunteer&#x02019;s capacity to willfully interact with his/her &#x0201c;self&#x0201d; and/or the environment; and intensity, which reflects the strength of the overall experience. The range of scores for all scales is 0&#x02013;4. In the present study, a Spanish version of the questionnaire was administered (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Riba et al., 2001a</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 1971</xref>) consists of five scales or groups: the morphine-benzedrine group (MBG), measuring euphoria; the pentobarbital-chlorpromazine-alcohol group (PCAG), measuring sedation; the lysergic acid diethylamide scale (LSD), measuring somatic-dysphoric effects; the benzedrine group (BG), measuring subjectively experienced intellectual efficiency; and amphetamine (A), which is sensitive to stimulants. The range of scores is 0&#x02013;16 for MBG, -4 to 11 for PCAG, -4 to 10 for LSD, -4 to 9 for BG, and 0&#x02013;11 for A.

The range of scores is 0&#x02013;13 for OSE, 0&#x02013;22 for AIA, and 0&#x02013;14 for VUS. A Spanish version of the questionnaire previously used in clinical studies involving psychedelic drugs was administered (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Riba et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Self-administered Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) were used to retrospectively rate peak effects during the session. They were 100mm horizontal lines with which volunteers retrospectively indicated the intensity of the drug effects (from 0, no effects, to 100, extremely intense effects). There were ten labeled VAS lines. &#x0201c;Any effect&#x0201d; indicated any effect, either physical or psychological, that the volunteer attributed to the administered dosage. &#x0201c;Good effects&#x0201d; indicated any effect the volunteer assessed as good. &#x0201c;Bad effects&#x0201d; indicated any effect the volunteer assessed as bad. &#x0201c;Sudden start of the effects&#x0201d; indicated a rapid onset of the effects. &#x0201c;Fear&#x0201d; indicated apprehension or psychological discomfort. &#x0201c;Time&#x0201d; indicated modifications on the perception of time. &#x0201c;Changes in dimensionality&#x0201d; indicated alterations on the perception of dimensionality of the body. &#x0201c;Changes in external reality&#x0201d; indicated changes in perception, with eyes open, of external reality. &#x0201c;Loss of contact with external reality&#x0201d; indicated separation from the surroundings. &#x0201c;Visions&#x0201d; indicated visual modifications with eyes open or closed.</p><sec id="s8"><title/><p>Experimenter-administered VAS were used during the acute effects. The experimenter verbally asked the participant to rate the overall intensity of the experienced effects on a scale that went from 0 (no effect) to 100 (extremely intense effects). This &#x0201c;intensity&#x0201d; VAS was administered immediately before drug inhalation (baseline) and at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes after administration. This allowed assessment of the time course of effects. In cases of unresponsiveness by the participant, the maximum score (100) was assigned to that time point.</p><p content-type="indent">The Multidimensional Assessment for Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) is a 32-item, four-point Likert scale designed to measure interoceptive awareness. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted with 325 individuals trained and experienced in mind-body therapies such as yoga and Tai Chi (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Mehling et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis revealed eight subscales: noticing (NT), awareness of uncomfortable, comfortable, and neutral body sensations; not distracting (ND), tendency not to ignore or distract oneself from sensations of pain or discomfort; not worrying (NW), tendency not to worry or feel emotional distress with sensations of pain or discomfort; attention regulation (AR), ability to sustain and control attention to body sensations; emotional awareness (EA), awareness of the connection between body sensations and emotional states; self-regulation (SR), ability to regulate psychological distress by attention to body sensations; body listening (BL), active listening to the body for insight; and trusting (TR), experiencing one&#x02019;s body as safe and trustworthy (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Mehling et al., 2013</xref>). The MAIA showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas of 0.66 to 0.87), low intra-scale correlations (Person&#x02019;s coefficients of 0.16 to 0.6), and good construct validity. A later confirmatory factor analysis with 435 patients with chronic low back pain (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Mehling et al., 2013</xref>) confirmed the essential factor structure of the MAIA with similar internal consistency (0.48 to 0.9) and intra-scale correlations (0.16 to 0.7). In the current study, the MAIA was translated into Spanish (Ds Riba and Maqueda). Participants completed the written assessment at the end of each test day based on their acute experience in the laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Personal narratives</title><p>Participants were requested to write in their own words a description of the effects they had experienced, if any had been noticed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS software.

For the experimenter-administered VAS, the maximum score obtained in each session was used for comparisons between doses. Means and standard errors of the mean were used in the figures. However, given the small sample size, the obtained scores were analyzed by means of non-parametric statistics. First, we used Friedman tests for related samples with dose (placebo, 0.25mg, 0.5mg, and 1.0mg) as a factor. When a significant effect was found, we performed pair-wise comparisons between doses using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

At the doses used, salvinorin-A showed a pattern of subjective effects with fast onset and short duration. At all doses, peak effects were reached at 2 minutes after the inhalation (second measurement time point), followed by a progressive decrement, to almost disappearing after 20 minutes. This pattern is analogous to those reported previously (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The 0.25mg of salvinorin-A chosen in the present study as the lowest dose was psychoactive (i.e. rated as significantly different from placebo on some measures) in all volunteers. The effects were dose-dependent, with the medium and higher doses leading to more, greater, and longer-lasting perceptual, affective, and somatic effects. The fact that salvinorin-A was psychoactive below doses of one milligram places it in the potency range of LSD. Salvinorin-A induced perceptual and cognitive effects that are typical of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists such as LSD and other classical psychedelics, but with intense somatic effects and a strong dissociative component. Some of the somatic modifications showed a biphasic pattern. At low and medium doses, salvinorin-A increased ratings of bodily sensation. However, at the high dose body awareness was strongly decreased, leading to a depersonalization and loss of sense of body ownership.</p><p content-type="indent">Assessment scores compare with those obtained by other laboratories. Scores on the HRS subscales confirm the psychedelic profile of salvinorin-A, being in concordance with previous studies both with smoked <italic>S. divinorum</italic> extracts and pure salvinorin-A. The intensity subscale of HRS shows the high intensity of effects perceived at medium and high doses, consistent with the results of <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al. (2013)</xref>.

For instance, the uniqueness of salvia compared to other psychedelics was reported in the present study by two volunteers: &#x0201c;The experience was surprising, how weird it is!,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;This was a completely new experience for me.&#x0201d; This is in concordance with the KOR agonism profile of the substance.</p><sec id="s25"><title>Perceptual Effects</title><p>In the present study, significant dose-related effects were found in the instruments measuring alterations in visual and auditory perception. Auditory experiences were quite prominent and included hearing music and being verbally addressed by presences or beings. Visions were also reported frequently in the medium and high doses. These appeared as tunnel or window-like visions, luminous walls and surfaces, metallic objects, geometric patterns, and other worlds of multiple colors: &#x0201c;I was in an immense forest full of fluorescent trees.&#x0201d; As in previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Addy et al., 2015</xref>), one participant referred to carnival imagery: &#x0201c;There were magical beings in that world, wearing garish dresses, similar to the clothes of a royal court jester.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Synesthesia</title><p>A particular type of visual-proprioceptive synesthesia was experienced that has been previously reported from smoking <italic>S. divinorum</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Addy et al., 2015</xref>). While visual-auditory synesthesia is common with serotonergic and non-serotonergic substances, visual-proprioceptive synesthesia is rarely described (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Luke and Terhune, 2013</xref>). This was experienced here by two volunteers in three experimental sessions (two in low dose and one in high dose). Objects perceived with eyes open or closed were felt as being associated with the body. For example, seeing external modifications in reality, like a wave, that affects or folds the volunteer&#x02019;s body: &#x0201c;The effects of the substance were approaching me, like an air blast, from the left. (&#x02026;) they were distorting the objects in the room and also my body and sensations&#x0201d;. One volunteer described the concept of a square present in the mind that was felt with the body: &#x0201c;A force was pressing the right side of my body (...), so my sensation was being a square.

This could be due to the ascending order in which active doses were administered, but could also reflect a ceiling effect. There are no direct references in the written reports to moments of anxiety or fear during the experience.</p><p content-type="indent">One volunteer reported feelings of being isolated due to not being able to feel the presence of the experimenter in the room, and another volunteer expressed confusion of not being able to understand what was happening. Our results are similar to previous research (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Ranganathan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2013</xref>) which reported a lack of negative affect and low anxiety ratings. In contrast, Gonz&#x000e1;lez and coworkers found above average anxiety levels, which could be related to expectancy, previous experience with psychedelics, or the uncontrolled environment of non-laboratory drug use (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Interoceptive Effects</title><p>Our results suggest biphasic effects of salvinorin-A upon certain aspects of interoception. Results from the MAIA show that salvinorin-A reduced participants&#x02019; ability to sustain and control attention to their bodily sensations. Low and medium doses of salvinorin-A acutely led to increases in experiencing one&#x02019;s body as safe and trustworthy. Increased Trusting scores have been inversely correlated with experiencing chronic low back pain, perceived stress, depression, and trait anxiety; and have been directly correlated with having a mind-body practice and having strong body-listening skills (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Mehling et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Thus, in our sample low and medium doses of salvinorin-A produced effects that could be viewed as adaptive, while high doses of salvinorin-A produced maladaptive effects (decreased body awareness).</p></sec><sec id="s29"><title>Dissociative Effects</title><p>We observed a strong profile of dissociative effects and disconnection with reality. The body-related dysphoria subscale (LSD) of the ARCI showed lower scores compared to previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting dissociative effects and a perceived inability to interact with one&#x02019;s body and surroundings. Further, the high dose of salvinorin-A increased depersonalization and derealization (OSE subscale of APZ) and decreased body and thought control (AIA subscale of APZ).</p><p content-type="indent">Paradoxically, the low and medium doses of salvinorin-A increased the MAIA trusting (TR) subscale, indicating an increased experience of one&#x02019;s body as safe and trustworthy. No other results in our study showed a similar inverted-U-shaped profile. It may be that at lower doses salvinorin-A increases bodily sensations, but that the dissociative effects of the high dose overwhelm the subtle trust-enhancing effects of the low and medium doses.</p></sec><sec id="s30"><title>Neural Substrates of Salvinorin-A Effects</title><p>In the encephalon, high levels of KOR are found in the neocortex, the thalamus and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Simonin et al., 1995</xref>). Despite lower amounts in the hippocampus, KOR activation effectively reduces the activity of excitatory afferents at this level (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chavkin, 2013</xref>). It also inhibits dopamine release from VTA afferents to the prefrontal cortex, and the activity of serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer, 2009</xref>). The dynorphin-KOR system has been involved in stress responses, reward and addiction and various psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Tejeda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chavkin, 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">KOR agonism in the temporal and parietal cortices could underlie the visual and auditory modifications (temporal cortex) and the altered experience of the body (parietal cortex). Posterior parietal areas in collaboration with subcortical structures and the premotor cortex play a role in the multi-sensorial experience of the body by codifying it into an axis of reference (e.g. hands, arms, or head). In one study in which the right angular was electrically stimulated, out-of-body experiences were elicited (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Blanke et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the medial posterior parietal cortex is a key structure within the default mode network, which has been proposed to be associated with the intimate sense of self (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Raichle, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The most likely structure mediating the loss of contact with external reality is the thalamus, which shows high KOR levels in humans (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Simonin et al., 1995</xref>). Studies in rodents have shown that the centromedian, paraventricular, and centrolateral nuclei of the thalamus are particularly rich in these receptors and cell bodies expressing them (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>). While the first two nuclei play an important role controlling arousal and the overall level of cortical activity, the paraventricular nucleus is associated with viscero-limbic functions (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Van der Werf et al., 2002</xref>). Lesions in the centrolateral nucleus lead to widespread reductions in activation of the reticular system, additional thalamic nuclei, and extensive limbic and cortical areas (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Raos et al., 1995</xref>). A KOR-mediated inhibitory effect of salvinorin-A at this level could block the relay of perceptual and somatic information to the cortex and explain the loss of contact with external reality and with one&#x02019;s own body as reported by participants.</p><p content-type="indent">Alternatively, the claustrum, a sheet of neurons neighboring the insula, also shows high KOR levels. Stiefel and coworkers have proposed that salvinorin-A could disrupt cerebral integration processes taking place at this level and lead to the effects of disconnection from reality induced by the drug (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Stiefel et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies should use neuroimaging techniques to provide direct evidence of the brain areas targeted by salvinorin-A.</p></sec><sec id="s31"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study included a relatively small number of subjects with extensive experience with psychedelics. Thus, our results may not be generalized to less experienced individuals. Additionally, as mentioned in the Methods section, the doses were administered in ascending order. Although the position of the placebo was varied randomly, this design may have influenced the results. In addition, the study had five female and three male participants. Due to the sex differences found in distribution and elimination of salvinorin-A, (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>), the effects may have been more intense in the female than the male participants. However, the small sample size precludes the statistical analysis comparison between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="s32"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The inhalation of vaporized salvinorin-A led to very strong psychotropic effects of rapid onset and short duration. Perceptual modifications included the visual domain, and in contrast with 5HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists, auditory hallucinations were very common. Also in contrast with the classical serotonergic psychedelics, loss of contact with external reality was prominent with the participants being unreactive to external visual and verbal cues, especially after the medium and high doses. While at the low and medium doses there was an increase in bodily sensations, at 1.0mg there was an almost complete loss of body ownership and an increase in out-of-body experiences. These results suggest that the dynorphins &#x02013; KOR system may play a previously underestimated role in the regulation of sensory perception, interoception, and the sense of body ownership in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s33"><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grant &#x0201c;PI12/02758&#x0201d; from the &#x0201c;Instituto de Salud Carlos III&#x0201d; of the Spanish Governement, which is co-funded by FEDER.
