In preclinical studies, we showed that the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39) suppresses insulin secretion and corrects fasting hypoglycemia in <italic>SUR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of exendin-(9-39) on fasting blood glucose in subjects with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI. This was a randomized, open-label, two-period crossover pilot clinical study. Nine subjects with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI received either exendin-(9-39) or vehicle on two different days. The primary outcome was blood glucose; secondary outcomes were insulin, glucagon, and GLP-1. In all subjects, mean nadir blood glucose and glucose area under the curve were significantly increased by exendin-(9-39). Insulin-to-glucose ratios were significantly lower during exendin-(9-39) infusion compared with vehicle. Fasting glucagon and intact GLP-1 were not affected by treatment. In addition, exendin-(9-39) significantly inhibited amino acid&#x02013;stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic islets isolated from neonates with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI. Our findings have two important implications: <italic>1</italic>) GLP-1 and its receptor play a role in the regulation of fasting glycemia in K<sub>ATP</sub>HI; and <italic>2</italic>) the GLP-1 receptor may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of children with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Inactivating mutations in the genes encoding the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel (K<sub>ATP</sub> channel) are responsible for the most common and most severe form of congenital hyperinsulinism (K<sub>ATP</sub>HI). In most cases, medical therapy is not effective and a pancreatectomy is required to control the hypoglycemia. For infants with a focal form of K<sub>ATP</sub>HI, total excision of the lesion can be curative. However, those with diffuse disease may require a near-total pancreatectomy. Unfortunately, this surgical approach carries a high risk of either persistent hypoglycemia or insulin-requiring diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone secreted from intestinal L cells in response to ingested nutrients. In addition to its insulinotropic actions, GLP-1 glucose-lowering effects include inhibition of glucagon secretion, hepatic glucose production, gastric emptying, and appetite (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Genetic and pharmacologic disruption of GLP-1 receptor signaling leads to fasting hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), suggesting that in addition to contributing to postprandial glucose regulation, GLP-1 plays a role in the control of fasting glucose. Exendin-(9-39), a truncated form of the GLP-1 agonist exendin-4, is a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In preclinical studies, we showed that exendin-(9-39) decreases cAMP levels and insulin secretion in <italic>SUR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In vivo, continuous subcutaneous infusion of exendin-(9-39) significantly raised fasting blood glucose levels in <italic>SUR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice without affecting glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These findings suggest that GLP-1 and its receptor play a key role in the control of insulin secretion in this mouse model.</p><p>We hypothesized that exendin-(9-39) can elevate fasting blood glucose levels in children and adults with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI and, thus, may have a potential therapeutic application for this disorder. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the effect of exendin-(9-39) on glucose homeostasis in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism. Given the dearth of available effective medical therapies for individuals with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI, these studies are important in understanding the pathophysiology of this disorder and evaluating the potential therapeutic applications of antagonists of the GLP-1 receptor in the treatment of this serious condition.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Nine subjects with confirmed genetic and clinical diagnosis of K<sub>ATP</sub> hyperinsulinism were recruited from the Hyperinsulinism Center at the Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Exclusion criteria included acute medical illnesses; a history of systemic chronic diseases such as cardiac failure, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anemia, or uncontrolled hypertension; pregnancy; diabetes; and use of medications that affect glucose metabolism, such as glucocorticoids, &#x003b2;-agonists, octreotide, and diazoxide.</p><p>This was a randomized, open-label, two-period complete crossover pilot study to evaluate the effect of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39), on glucose metabolism in subjects with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI. The study was approved by the human subjects committee of CHOP and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their parent/guardian. Assent was obtained from the children when appropriate.</p><p>Subjects were admitted to the CHOP Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) inpatient unit. All subjects were administered 5 ng exendin-(9-39) (0.05 &#x003bc;g/mL) intradermally as a test of immediate hypersensitivity. Baseline chemistry profiles were obtained to evaluate liver and kidney function in all subjects, and a pregnancy test was performed in all postmenarchal females. An antecubital vein was cannulated in each forearm for infusions and blood sampling. Each subject underwent two experiments in random order and on consecutive days. On one day, after a 12-h overnight fast, subjects received an intravenous infusion of vehicle (0.9% NaCl) for 1 h followed by an intravenous infusion of exendin-(9-39) at 100 pmol/kg/min (0.02 mg/kg/h) for 2 h and then 300 pmol/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) for 2 h, followed by 500 pmol/kg/min (0.1 mg/kg/h) for the last 2 h. The doses of exendin-(9-39) were selected based on previously published data demonstrating that at a dose of 300 pmol/kg/min, exendin-(9-39) abolishes the effects of physiologic postprandial plasma concentrations of GLP-1 and that a higher dose of 500 pmol/kg/min increases fasting plasma glucose concentration in normal subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). On the other day, after a 12-h overnight fast, subjects received an intravenous infusion of vehicle for 7 h. The infusion rates of vehicle were identical to the volume infused during the exendin-(9-39) study day. The primary outcome for this study was fasting blood glucose concentration. Secondary outcomes include fasting plasma insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, intact GLP-1, and insulin/glucose. Blood samples for blood glucose, insulin, glucagon, and intact GLP-1 were obtained at multiple time points during the infusions (&#x02212;60, 0, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 280, 300, 320, 340, and 360 min). During the infusion, blood glucose was monitored by a bedside glucose meter (Surestep) as needed to avoid hypoglycemia (defined as &#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]). An intravenous infusion of dextrose was started if blood glucose levels fell to &#x0003c;3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) during the study period.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Peptide.</title><p>Exendin-(9-39) was synthesized by the American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA) under cGMP guidelines. The peptide was purified to &#x02265;97% by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the sequence and mass were verified. The peptide was stored in a lyophilized form at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. For administration, the peptide was diluted in 0.9% NaCl and added to 0.25% human serum albumin (final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL). Aliquots were tested for sterility and pyrogenicity through the Investigational Drug Service at the University of Pennsylvania. The use of synthetic exendin-(9-39) is approved under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug no. 76612.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Islet studies.</title><p>Fresh pancreata from surgical specimens from three neonates (age 4&#x02013;6 weeks) with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI who were homozygous for mutations in either <italic>KCNJ11</italic> (R136L) or <italic>ABCC8</italic> (R248X and E824X) were procured through an institutional review board&#x02013;approved protocol. The pancreas was injected with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). Islets were handpicked under microscopy and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10 mmol/L glucose for 3 days prior to the studies. Batches of 50 islets were preincubated in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 60 min. Exendin-(9-39) was added 30 min into the preincubation period. Then, islets were exposed to stimulation with 10 mmol/L glucose or a mixture of amino acids at a concentration of 4 mmol/L as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Media were collected for determination of insulin concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Assays.</title><p>Whole blood glucose was measured using a Siemens Rapid Point 400 Blood Gas analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL).

These findings have two important implications: <italic>1</italic>) GLP-1 and its receptor play a role in the regulation of fasting glycemia not only in normal individuals but also in individuals with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI and <italic>2</italic>) the GLP-1 receptor may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of children with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI.</p><p>The importance of endogenous GLP-1 in the regulation of glucose metabolism is well established. Thus, GLP-1 receptor agonists have been introduced as a new therapeutic approach to treat diabetes. Less is known about the potential role of GLP-1 and its receptor in disorders of insulin regulation resulting in hypoglycemia. Evidence from studies involving pharmacologic doses of GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and excessive endogenous GLP-1 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) raises the possibility that despite the &#x0201c;glucose dependency&#x0201d; of its insulinotropic actions, GLP-1 actions can result in overt hypoglycemia. The clinical use of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide (Byetta) has not been associated with significant hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes, except when given concomitantly with sulfonylureas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This latter interesting observation suggests that K<sub>ATP</sub> channel integrity is important to maintain the glucose dependency of GLP-1 actions in the &#x003b2;-cell. This clinical observation is in agreement with the results from our preclinical studies in the mouse model of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the clinical studies presented here. Whether the mechanism of GLP-1 involvement in K<sub>ATP</sub>HI is through increased GLP-1 secretion or due to a constitutively active receptor remains to be determined. Clinically, we have observed that in neonates with severe K<sub>ATP</sub>HI, withdrawal of enteral feedings results in a decrease in glucose requirements to maintain euglycemia. These unpublished observations would suggest that GLP-1 secretion in response to ingested nutrients is increased in these children, perhaps resulting from dysfunctional K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in <sc>L</sc> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, in our present clinical study, the effects of exendin-(9-39) on glucose were seen during fasting. We have not yet examined its effect during feeding. Interestingly, Salehi, Prigeon, and D&#x02019;Alessio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) have reported that exendin-(9-39) inhibits insulin secretion in the absence of elevated circulating concentrations of GLP-1. This finding is in agreement with in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and our mouse islets studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), suggesting that exendin-(9-39) is an inverse agonist of the GLP-1 receptor. This implies that there is a tonic regulation via ligand-independent activity of the GLP-1 receptor that is inhibited by exendin-(9-39). The data supporting constitutive activity of the GLP-1 receptor include not only models in which exendin-(9-39) was used but also data from GLP-1 receptor&#x02013;null islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). It is therefore plausible that in depolarized pancreatic islets (due to inactivating mutations in K<sub>ATP</sub> channels or due to hyperglycemia or sulfonylureas) the constitutive activity of the GLP-1 receptor has an amplifying effect on insulin secretion that can be reversed by exendin-(9-39).</p><p>Our study was not designed to determine comprehensively the mechanism by which exendin-(9-39) exerts its effects on blood glucose in K<sub>ATP</sub>HI. In healthy individuals, previous studies have shown that the effects of exendin-(9-39) on fasting plasma glucose are associated with upregulated glucagon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), but others had failed to demonstrate an effect on glucagon during fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In all of these studies, there was no significant effect on fasting insulin. It has been suggested that the effect on fasting glucose is mediated by exendin-(9-39) blockade of the purported enhanced peripheral glucose disposal effects of GLP-1; however, there is no evidence supporting this hypothesis. Studies in healthy humans fasted overnight demonstrated that small transient increases in plasma insulin and decrease in glucagon in response to GLP-1 result in a decline in glucose appearance most likely owing to suppression of hepatic glucose release but without any significant change in glucose disappearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Similar findings have been reported in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We would speculate that the lack of fall in glucose observed in our study is most likely due to an increase in endogenous glucose production (<italic>R</italic><sub>a</sub>) rather than a decrease in glucose utilization. However, the mechanism by which exendin-(9-39) increases fasting plasma glucose in normal individuals remains unclear. In isolated <italic>SUR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse pancreatic islets, exendin-(9-39) very clearly inhibits insulin secretion at baseline and in response to amino acid stimulation. In the present clinical study, insulin concentrations in the subjects with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI were lower during exendin-(9-39), although not statistically significant, suggesting that inhibition of insulin secretion is, at least in part, responsible for the maintenance of glucose concentration. There was no evidence of an effect of exendin-(9-39) on hepatic extraction of insulin, as insulin&#x02013;to&#x02013;C-peptide ratio was not different between the experimental conditions or across time. In this population, however, the lack of significant change in insulin concentrations has to be interpreted taking into consideration the following: <italic>1</italic>) the study was not powered to detect a significant effect on insulin; <italic>2</italic>) in K<sub>ATP</sub>HI, very small changes in insulin concentration have a very large effect on fasting blood glucose, and therefore a very large number of subjects may be needed to detect small effects on insulin with statistical significance; and <italic>3</italic>) when interpreting plasma insulin concentration, one has to consider the glucose concentration at the same time, and thus while blood glucose concentration was decreasing during vehicle infusion, insulin concentration was either increasing or unchanged. Therefore, insulin-to-glucose ratios during vehicle and exendin-(9-39) infusion were shown to be significantly different at the highest doses of exendin-(9-39), indicating that, at least in part, the effects of exendin-(9-39) in K<sub>ATP</sub>HI are mediated by its effects on the &#x003b2;-cells. Further supporting this, amino acid&#x02013;stimulated insulin secretion in islets isolated from children with K<sub>ATP</sub> HI was inhibited by exendin-(9-39).</p><p>While it is plausible that the hyperglycemic effects of exendin-(9-39) are in part mediated by its effects on glucagon, we did not detect any treatment effects on glucagon concentration. Although the sample size is too small to make any definite conclusions, it is possible that GLP-1 receptor blockade does not overcome the glucagon secretory defect characteristic of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Similar to findings of previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), fasting intact GLP-1 plasma concentration was not affected by treatment with exendin-(9-39), contrary to the increased GLP-1 response to a meal observed by other investigators during exendin-(9-39) infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This suggests that GLP-1 actions directly or indirectly regulate GLP-1 secretion after meals but not in the fasting state. We did not evaluate the effects of exendin-(9-39) on extraislet GLP-1 actions, but given that these studies were in the fasting state and of very short duration, it is unlikely that they played any significant role.</p><p>Independent of the mechanism of action, the effect of exendin-(9-39) on fasting blood glucose is clinically significant for this population. As observed during this study, even older subjects and those subjects with a milder phenotype are at risk for symptomatic hypoglycemia during prolonged periods of fasting. Despite the impressive recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of congenital hyperinsulinism, there have not been any advances in medical therapies for &#x0003e;20 years. Diazoxide, the mainstay of medical therapy for hyperinsulinism, suppresses insulin by activating the opening of the &#x003b2;-cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channel and is therefore ineffective in the majority of K<sub>ATP</sub>HI cases. The second line of therapy for hyperinsulinism is octreotide, a somatostatin analog. The initial response to octreotide is good in most infants with hyperinsulinism, but tachyphylaxis develops after a few doses, rendering therapy inadequate for long-term use in most cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Moreover, while generally well tolerated, octreotide therapy has recently been associated with fatal necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with hyperinsulinism. This may be due to reduced splanchnic blood flow with increasing doses: a finding that may limit the use of octreotide in the treatment of hyperinsulinism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Thus, the finding that exendin-(9-39) raises fasting blood glucose levels in human subjects with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI shows great promise for the development of a potential therapeutic mechanism by antagonism of the GLP-1 receptor.</p><p>Our study has some limitations that should be discussed. Because the clinical research experience with exendin-(9-39) has been limited, we chose to study older individuals first. As expected, given the natural history of the disease and the fact that some of the subjects had undergone a pancreatectomy, blood glucose concentrations after an overnight fast were not low and three of the subjects had fasting hyperglycemia; however, during the vehicle infusion these levels declined, resulting in symptomatic hypoglycemia in most of the subjects. Exendin-(9-39) prevented this decline without causing overt hyperglycemia during the fasting period. Because of safety concerns, subjects with symptomatic hypoglycemia were rescued with dextrose to maintain blood glucose levels 3.3 mmol/L (&#x0003e;60 mg/dL), therefore limiting the treatment effect that we could detect. All the subjects included in this study have mutations in <italic>ABCC8</italic>, but some mutations were recessive and biallelic, while others were dominant and monoallelic. Nevertheless, the hyperglycemic effects of exendin-(9-39) were seen in all subjects, irrespective of their mutation.</p><p>Overall, similar to the findings of our preclinical studies, our data show that exendin-(9-39) elevates fasting glucose in human subjects with K<sub>ATP</sub>HI. These data do not necessarily indicate that there is a specific involvement of GLP-1 signaling in the pathogenesis of K<sub>ATP</sub>HI. Nevertheless, our findings offer some insight into the pathophysiology of K<sub>ATP</sub>HI and also point to the GLP-1 receptor as a therapeutic target for this condition. Our promising results suggest a significant role for GLP-1 receptor action as an integral mechanism in the control of fasting glycemia in K<sub>ATP</sub>HI. Given the lack of available therapies, antagonism of the GLP-1 receptor represents a novel therapeutic target to control hypoglycemia in congenital hyperinsulinism and could have a beneficial impact on morbidity and improve long-term outcomes for this devastating disorder.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
