Thorough
cleaning removes microorganisms, permits adaptation of filling materials and enhances
the action of intracanal medicaments. The choice of an irrigant is of great importance
because they act as lubricants during instrumentation, flush debris and bacteria out of
the canal, and react with pulp, necrotic tissues and microorganisms. Numerous irrigants
have been recommended for clinical use<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Irrigation with distilled water is effective at removing loose
debris, but has little effect on smear layer or microorganisms<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) has been extensively used as
an irrigating solution for several decades, and it is widely recommended<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Its excellent properties of tissue
dissolution and antimicrobial activity make it the irrigant of choice for the treatment
of teeth with pulp necrosis<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, even
though it has several undesirable characteristics such as tissue toxicity at high
concentrations, risk of emphysema when overfilling, and allergic potential<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, NaOCl does not totally clean
the surfaces of the root canals<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.
These problems suggest that NaOCl irrigation is not fully optimized and there is a need
to identify irrigants which are effective, but also biocompatible, to avoid the risk of
harming patients.</p><p>The smear layer is a 1-5 mm thick layer<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> of denatured cutting debris produced on instrumented cavity surfaces,
and is composed of dentin, odontoblastic processes, non-specific inorganic contaminants
and microorganisms<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The removal of
smear layer from the instrumented root canal walls is controversial<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Its removal provides better sealing
ability of the endodontic filling material to dentin, thereby avoiding leakage of
microorganisms into the oral tissues<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The infiltration of microorganisms into oral tissues must be prevented
because it is believed these often cause complications leading to treatment failure.</p><p>The disinfection of root canals through the elimination of microorganisms is an
essential step in endodontic treatment<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> to help avoid subsequent failure<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Surface adherence by bacteria to form biofilms is a good example
of bacterial adaptation and one that is pertinent to endodontic infections. Increasing
information is now available on the existence of biofilm communities on root canal
walls<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, complete
disinfection is difficult to accomplish; microorganisms can remain within the apical
dentin plug<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, within the smear
layer<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and within the dentinal
tubules<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. To maximize the
removal of microorganisms, the shaping and mechanical enlargement of a root canal must
be accompanied by copious irrigation<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The ideal irrigant should have an
antimicrobial action, low toxicity and good biocompatibility to oral tissues. In
addition, it should have the capacity to clean the walls of the root canal and remove
the smear layer.</p><p>In August 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Sterilox Dental&#x02019;s Aquatine
endodontic Cleanser (Aquatine eC, Sterilox Puricore, Malvern, PA, USA) for use as an
endodontic irrigating solution. Aquatine eC is intended to irrigate, cleanse and debride
the root canal system (510k number K061689). The active component in Aquatine eC is
hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is produced by the body&#x02019;s immune cells, via a chain of
aerobic reactions called the Oxidative Burst Pathway, to kill invading pathogens and to
fight infection<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Sterilox Puricore
(Malvern, PA, USA) has developed a range of medical products that contain different
concentrations of HOCl. The HOCl solution is produced by electrochemically charging a
low concentration salt solution using an element reactor. HOCl is commonly used for
hospital disinfection, sterilization, and in the treatment of chronic wounds<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In dentistry it is commonly used to disinfect water lines by
removing biofilms<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. HOCl is biocompatible and antimicrobial against a broad
range of microorganisms<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. A pilot
study of the cleaning effectiveness of an electrochemically activated solution (EAS)
that contained a mixture of HOCl, ClO<sup>-</sup>, ClO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at
pH 7.7 found its smear layer removal effectiveness was superior to 3% NaOCl27. However,
there have been no studies to date examining the effectiveness of Aquatine EC as an
endodontic irrigant.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate Aquatine eC as an endodontic irrigating
solution in a simulated clinical setting where bacterial invasion of the dental tubules
occurs prior to biomechanical instrumentation. The cleaning effectiveness of Aquatine EC
to remove bacterial biofilm, debris and smear layer from root canals was assessed by
visualization, using scanning electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>A pre-existing archive of extracted human teeth was used for this study following
institutional review board approval. The intact, randomly selected, permanent teeth had
not previously received any root canal medicaments nor were any stored in antibacterial
or fixative solutions. The teeth were X-rayed prior to inclusion in this project to
ensure that all the teeth had a single root canal, and the root lengths were
approximately 18 mm. The teeth were de-crowned at the cementoenamel junction using a
diamond rotary bone-cutting saw (Materials Science, NW Ltd, Settle, england, UK). each
tooth was placed in an eppendorf tube and filled with brain heart infusion broth (BHI,
Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA).</p><p>Pure culture <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (ATCC 29212, PML Microbiologicals,
Wilsonville, OR, USA) grown in BHI broth (Difco Laboratories) was used to contaminate
the eppendorf tubes containing the extracted teeth. each individual tooth was inoculated
with 10 mL of a 1.5x10<sup>8</sup> CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> suspension using a sterile 1 mL
using a tuberculin syringe. The teeth were incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere
at 37&#x000ba;C for 28 days<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. During the 28 day infection period, the
BHI media was refreshed every third day to ensure bacterial viability. After 28 days of
<italic>in vitro</italic> culture in the presence of e. faecalis, the absorbance of
the BHI culture media was measured at 600 nm to ensure that all (100%) of the teeth were
contaminated<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> prior to the
shaping and cleaning of root canals. At 28 days, the external and internal surfaces of
each tooth were sampled with sterile fine paper points and inoculated on BHI agar plates
to confirm infection of the specimens. <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in pure culture was
determined by visualization of individual white pinpoint colonies on the BHI agar
plates. Confirmation was determined by microscopic observation of Gram-positive cocci
arranged in a cross-chain pattern, following the protocol described by Shabahang and
Torabinejad<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (2003).</p><p>The teeth were instrumented with ProTaper (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Oklahoma City, OK,
USA) file series to F3, and the canals were further enlarged with Profiles (Dentsply,
Tulsa Dental) 35/.06 and 40/.06 similar to the methods described by Shabahang and
Torabinejad<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (2003), and
Crumpton, Goodell and McClanahan<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
(2005). The working length was determined by passively placing a #10 K-file (Dentsply
Tulsa Dental) in the canal until the tip of the instrument visibly penetrated and was
adjusted to the apical foramen. The actual canal length was measured, and the working
length was calculated by subtracting 1 mm from this measurement. During cleaning and
shaping, 5 mL of irrigating solution was used with each instrument size. In each canal
during instrumentation, a total volume of 25-30 mL of irrigation solution was delivered
using small plastic needles (Ultradent Products, South Jordan, UT, USA). The following
irrigation procedures were used: group i) Control group: The canals of 5 instrumented
teeth were irrigated with distilled water to serve as negative controls. The remaining
40 teeth were divided into 4 experimental groups of 10 teeth per group: group ii), the
root canals were irrigated during instrumentation with Aquatine eC solution. The
Aquatine eC hypochlorous acid (HOCl) solution (180-250 ppm of available free chlorine
(AFC), pH 5.35-6.75) was prepared fresh, by electrolysis, immediately prior to use. The
concentration of (AFC) was measured photometrically following the acidification of the
Hypochlorous acid [HOCl] to Chlorine [Cl<sup>-</sup>]
(Palintest Inc., KY, US). Group iii), the root canals were irrigated with Aquatine eC
solution as described in group ii), followed by the application of 2 mL of 17% eDTA for
15 s<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Group iv), the root canals
were irrigated with 6% NaOCl (Clorox, Oakland, CA, USA). In group v), the root canals
were irrigated with 6% NaOCl followed by the application of 2 mL of 17% EDTA (PulpDent,
Watertown, MA, US) for 15 s. These methods were congruent with those of Shabahang and
Torabinejad<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (2003).</p><p>The effectiveness of the irrigation treatments to clean the root canals were assessed
using micrograph images of the root canals collected using a scanning electron
microscope (SeM). The teeth were prepared for use in the SEM by fixing the tooth tissues
in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution at 18&#x000b0;C for 24 h. The teeth were then
post-fixed in osmium tetroxide (1% w/v) for 2 h before being dehydrated in a graded
series of ethanol solutions. The teeth were dried on filter paper for 24 h and then
fractured longitudinally along the length of the canal using a chisel. each tooth-half
was mounted onto aluminum stereoscan stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding,
CA, USA) with the entire length of the root canal visible and facing upwards. each of
the specimens was coated with a 20-30 nm thin metallic layer of gold/palladium in a
Polaron e5000 sputter coater (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The samples were viewed in a
Quinta 200 SeM (FeI, Hilsboro, OR, USA). SeM micrographs were obtained at x2,000
magnification using digital image analysis software. each of the root canals was scanned
in its entirety to obtain an overview of the general surface topography<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Micrographs were taken of
representative areas characteristic of the general surface topography of each specimen,
including the apical, middle and coronal aspects<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The dentin root canal surfaces were assessed for the presence of
smear layer by two double-blind reviewers using semi-quantitative visual criteria
described by Crumpton, Goodell and McClanahan<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (2005), Madison and Hokett<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (1997) and Tay, et al.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (2006) using a 4-step scale: (0) All tubules visible. (1) More
than 50% of tubules visible. (2) Less than 50% of tubules visible, and (3) No tubules
visible. The removal of smear layer from the root canals was analyzed using Chi-Square
(&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) statistics tests (Statview, SPSS, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After 28 days of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture in the presence of <italic>E.
faecalis</italic>, the absorbance counts from the BHI culture media of each tooth
gave high absorbance counts at 600 nm, indicating that all (100%) of the teeth were
contaminated<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> prior to the
shaping and cleaning of root canals.</p><p>The available free chlorine (AFC) concentration of the Aquatine eC was tested prior to
each use, by measuring the hypochlorous acid content; it was stably produced by
electrolysis (Sterilox Dental, Malvern, PA, USA) at a concentration of 180-200 ppm AFC,
pH 6.0.</p><p>Analysis of the smear layer removal data for differences between the coronal, middle and
apical aspect of teeth found no significant differences (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>,
p&#x0003e;0.05). Therefore, the data was not stratified according to the different aspects of
teeth prior to further statistical analysis.</p><p>The removal of smear layer covering dental tubules was influenced by the use of
different irrigation treatments (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>, p&#x0003c;0.05). The most complete
removal (100%) of smear layer covering root canal dentinal tubules was observed
following root canal irrigation with Aquatine eC and a rinse of eDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). The least removal of smear layer covering
root canal dentinal tubules was observed following irrigation with distilled water
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) which was a control group. Aquatine
eC and eDTA completely removed the smear layer in 30% of teeth, and removed more than
half the smear layer in a further 30% of teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure
3</xref>). NaOCl and eDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>) completely
removed 26.7% of the smear layer covering dentinal tubules, and more than half the smear
layer covering the dentinal tubules in a further 13.3% of teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>). Although there were more dentinal tubules covered with
smear layer following NaOCl irrigation with a rinse of eDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>), there was little difference in comparison with Aquatine
eC followed by a rinse of eDTA (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>, p&#x0003e;0.05). The greatest presence
of smear layer was observed covering dentinal tubules in the root canals irrigated with
Aquatine eC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>) and NaOCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figure 6</xref>) without eDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>), which were control groups.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrograph of a root canal irrigated with

of endodontic irrigants and the use of eDTA during root canal instrumentation. A
previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study has demonstrated the effectiveness of HOCl to
disinfectant mixed species biofilms<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>,
and that it has excellent biocompatibility to tissues. The biocompatibility and safety
of Aquatine eC have earned it FDA clearance as a medical device in late 2006 to be sold
and marketed as an endodontic irrigant. This product is new, and it has not been
previously tested as an endodontic irrigant. Only one previous pilot study of 20 teeth
by Solovyeva and Dummer<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (2000) has
been published about the cleaning effectiveness of a pH 7.7 eAS containing a mixture of
biological reagents including HOCl. That study, observed the eAS in comparison to NaOCl,
removed more smear layer and more debris, leaving cleaner canals. Because of these
beneficial results, Solovyeva and Dummer<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (2000) have advocated eAS to be used as an alternative to NaOCl, but
no further progress to advance the introduction of eAS into endodontic practice appears
to have been made, until now.</p><p>NaOCl is recommended for use as an endodontic irrigant by the American Association of
endodontists, but it is not approved by the FDA because of its high toxicity, caustic
hazard, risk of emphysema in case of overfilling, and the severe allergic reactions that
can result in patient suffering<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The
widespread use of NaOCl as an endodontic irrigating solution can be explained by its low
price, excellent necrotic pulp tissue dissolution properties, and its excellent root
canal disinfection properties. Since NaOCl is the endodontic "gold standard",
experimental irrigants must be compared with it, to be able to compare smear layer
removal. The comparison between NaOCl and Aquatine eC in this present study found that
when both are used with a rinse of eDTA; they are similarly effective at removing debris
and cleaning root canals, and removing smear layer covering dental tubules and also
inside the dental tubules.</p><p>In the present study, the root canals were contaminated with <italic>E.
faecalis</italic> to allow for ease of maintenance and identifying the growth of a
single species. A 28-day infection period allowed for biofilm growth and the penetration
of bacteria into the dentinal tubules<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. The microbial sampling demonstrated that bacteria remained viable
throughout the experiment. Most studies of bacterial growth from root canals have
visualized turbidity in the culture media as the end point. In order to avoid
subjectivity in determining turbidity, visual assessment we used, and the absorbance of
the BHI culture was measured in a spectrophotometer.</p><p>The presence of smear layer prevents penetration of antibacterial agents into the
dentinal tubules, indicating that its removal may benefit disinfection and also sealing
and adhesion of endodontic sealers to root canal walls<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The previous pilot study of eAS demonstrated its
ability to partially remove smear layer in the absence of a chelating agent<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The present results are somewhat in
agreement, but showed that smear layer removal was more optimal in the Aquatine eC teeth
with a rinse of 17% eDTA, compared to teeth instrumented without eDTA. In the absence of
a rinse of eDTA, the Aquatine eC was not very effective at cleaning root canals or
removing smear layer, indicating that for optimal performance, Aquatine eC must be used
with a rinse of eDTA. It is unlikely that the length of time, or quantity of eDTA used
for irrigation causes marked differences between different studies<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. This indicates that any differences
observed in smear layer removal are caused by the difference between the eAS in the
pilot study<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and this present study.
The potency of the Aquatine eC was tested prior to each use, by measuring the HOCl
content; it was stably produced by the electrolysis unit at a concentration of 180-200
ppm AFC, pH 6.0. In the pilot study the anolyte neutral cathodic solution - had an
active chlorine concentration of 300 mgL<sup>-1</sup>. Indicating that the eAS was
slightly different in composition to Aquatine eC and likely was more potent. This
difference serves to demonstrate that both eAS and Aquatine eC may be able to remove
smear layer without chelating agents if the concentration of hypochlorous acid is
increased.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>On the basis of these results, it appears that Aquatine eC has a similar effectiveness
as NaOCl when used with a rinse of eDTA to clean root canals of debris and to remove
smear layer following contamination with <italic>E. faecalis.</italic> The cleanliness
of the root canals and the degree of smear layer removal were comparable with that of 6%
NaOCl. Aquatine eC may be superior to NaOCl in terms of safeguarding patients from
accidents because it is a biocompatible root canal cleanser, whereas NaOCl is not.
Aquatine eC could therefore provide a safer alternative to NaOCl disinfection for the
removal of biofilm bacteria in endodontic canals. Further studies are needed to
