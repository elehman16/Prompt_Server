Poor implementation fidelity (i.e., program not implemented as intended) may explain this result. Despite repeated calls for the examination of implementation fidelity as an essential component of evaluating interventions designed to improve the delivery of care, it has been neglected in prior falls prevention studies. This study examined implementation fidelity of the 6-PACK program during a large multi-site RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Based on the 6-PACK implementation framework and intervention description, implementation fidelity was examined by quantifying adherence to program components and organizational support. Adherence indicators were: 1) falls-risk tool completion; and for patients classified as high-risk, provision of 2) a &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; sign; and 3) at least one additional 6-PACK intervention. Organizational support indicators were: 1) provision of resources (executive sponsorship, site clinical leaders and equipment); 2) implementation activities (modification of patient care plans; training; implementation tailoring; audits, reminders and feedback; and provision of data); and 3) program acceptability. Data were collected from daily bedside observation, medical records, resource utilization diaries and nurse surveys.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All seven intervention components were delivered on the 12 intervention wards. Program adherence data were collected from 103,398 observations and medical record audits. The falls-risk tool was completed each day for 75% of patients. Of the 38% of patients classified as high-risk, 79% had a &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; sign and 63% were provided with at least one additional 6-PACK intervention, as recommended. All hospitals provided the recommended resources and undertook the nine outlined program implementation activities. Most of the nurses surveyed considered program components important for falls prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>While implementation fidelity was variable across wards, overall it was found to be acceptable during the RCT. Implementation failure is unlikely to be a key factor for the observed lack of program effectiveness in the 6-PACK trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The 6-PACK cluster RCT is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=336434">ACTRN12611000332921</ext-link> (29 March 2011).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2315-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Falls prevention</kwd><kwd>Injury prevention</kwd><kwd>Hospitals</kwd><kwd>Program evaluation</kwd><kwd>Implementation fidelity</kwd><kwd>Quality improvement</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Complex health intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1067236</award-id><award-id>APP1055604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morello</surname><given-names>Renata T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barker</surname><given-names>Anna L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP632929</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>In-hospital falls continue to be a major clinical and economic problem for hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They are the most common adverse event in the acute hospital setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and are a source of personal harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], increased length of stay (LOS) and increased hospitalisation costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Consequently, falls prevention is a priority for patient safety activity internationally, with the development of falls prevention best practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the adoption of in-hospital falls as a quality indicator for hospital performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the implementation of a variety of in-hospital falls prevention programs. Despite these efforts, there remains limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Poor implementation fidelity (i.e., the program not implemented as intended) may explain the failure of programs to reduce falls in previous trials.</p><p>Falls are a complex problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], occurring as a result of complex interactions between physiological, behavioral and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This complexity is compounded in the inpatient setting due to the acutely ill nature of many patients, their short LOS and the dynamic nature of the acute hospital ward environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, prevention programs are commonly complex, dynamic and patient-orientated, to ensure adequate targeting to the needs of the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the challenge with testing the effectiveness of such programs is that they are often reliant on the extent to which they have been implemented in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], often referred to in the literature as implementation of intervention fidelity.</p><p>Despite repeated calls for the examination of implementation fidelity as an essential component of undertaking trials to evaluate interventions designed to improve the delivery of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], it has been infrequently examined in prior falls prevention research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Implementation strategies and levels of implementation fidelity are seldom reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Only a small number of studies have examined program adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The majority of these report less than ideal implementation; with low levels of program adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Other studies questioned whether limited practice change hindered the program&#x02019;s effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], however they did not report adherence. Therefore the persistent problem of falls in acute hospitals may be due to sub-optimal adoption of falls prevention practices.</p><p>Examining implementation fidelity is particularly relevant for complex interventions in multi-center trials, where the same intervention may be implemented and received in different ways across sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It enables researchers to make valid conclusions about an intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness or ineffectiveness, ensuring unsuccessful outcomes reflect failure of the intervention and not failure to implement it as intended. A number of frameworks have been developed to examine implementation fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The framework proposed by Carroll et al. conceptualizes implementation fidelity as being multifaceted, encompassing both the intervention and its delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This framework proposes two key elements: 1) program adherence; and 2) the degree to which adherence was influenced by factors that may have influenced the delivery process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Program adherence, <italic>&#x0201c;the bottom-line measurement of implementation fidelity&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] incorporates program content, dose and coverage. Factors that influence program delivery include intervention complexity, implementation strategies, participant responsiveness and quality of delivery.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case study: the 6-PACK program</title><p>This study concerns the implementation fidelity of the 6-PACK program, a targeted nurse-led multi-component falls prevention program designed specifically for acute hospital wards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It incorporates a nine-item falls-risk tool (the TNH-STRATIFY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and delivery of up to six interventions to patients classified as high-risk based on the tool. However, when tested in a multi-center cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31,411 patients), the 6-PACK program did not reduce falls (IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;04, 95% CI, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;78&#x02013;1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;37; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;796) or fall injuries (IRR, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;96; 95% CI, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;72&#x02013;1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;27; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;766) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The primary trial explored reasons for no effect and provided evidence that contamination and confounding were highly unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given the complexity of falls prevention in the acute ward setting, trial results may have been influenced by the degree to which the program was implemented into practice. The aim of this study was to examine the implementation fidelity&#x02014; program adherence and organizational support&#x02014;of the 6-PACK falls prevention program during a cluster RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] to assist with the interpretation of trial results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>The methodology and findings of the RCT, conducted between January 2012 and April 2013, are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Intervention wards that participated in the RCT were included in this study&#x02014;12 acute wards (medical or surgical) from six public hospitals (both metropolitan and regional teaching hospitals) in two states in Australia (Victoria and New South Wales). Participating wards comprised of general medical (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), general surgical (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), general medical short stay (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), specialist medical (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and specialist surgical (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). All patients admitted to participating wards were included in this study.</p><p>The RCT was a pragmatic trial with the 6-PACK program implemented by ward nursing staff as part of usual care practice. Data from a sample of intervention ward nurses and senior managers from each hospital were used in this evaluation. Sampling procedures are described in the data collection section below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The 6-PACK falls prevention program</title><p>The 6-PACK program (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was implemented onto the 12 participating intervention wards during the cluster RCT. Nurses were required to complete the falls-risk tool for each patient on their daily care plan. For patients classified as high falls risk, nurses were to select, document and apply a &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; sign above the patient&#x02019;s bed and one or more of the remaining 6-PACK interventions (supervision while in the bathroom; use of a low-low bed, lowered as close as possible to the floor; ensuring their walking aid is within reach; establishment of a toileting regime; and use of a bed/chair alarm when they are in the bed/chair). The selection of 6-PACK interventions were based on the nurse&#x02019;s clinical judgement of the patient&#x02019;s needs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The 6-PACK falls prevention program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2017_2315_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>The implementation of the 6-PACK program was managed at a central level (by the research team) and tailored locally by participating hospitals. It was informed by two mixed-methods studies: 1) perceived acceptability of the 6-PACK program (suitability, practicality and benefits) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and 2) perceived barriers to, and enablers of, implementation of the 6-PACK program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

</p><p>Nursing practice adherence indicators (program dose) were: 1) falls-risk tool completion each day of admission; and for patients classified as high-risk provision of 2) a &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; sign; and 3) a sign and at least one additional 6-PACK intervention. As this was a ward-based intervention and all patients admitted to participating wards were recruited as part of this study, program coverage was not specifically examined. Organizational support indicators were: 1) provision of hospital and ward resources (executive sponsorship, site clinical leaders and equipment); 2) implementation activities (modification of patient care plans; training; implementation tailoring; audits, reminders and feedback; and provision of data); and 3) program acceptability among nursing staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were prospectively collected. Data on program adherence were collected through daily audit of patient care plans and structured bedside observation. Data collection was undertaken by members of the research team (site data collectors) using a standardized tool. Budget constraints meant these data were only able to be collected from the commencement of the cluster RCT until December 2013. Weekly site clinical leader resource utilization diaries detailed time spent on program implementation activities. A member of the research team recorded attendance to site clinical leader training sessions and meetings and kept a log on the compliance of hospitals and wards to resource commitment, care-plan integration and data provision. Nurse perceptions were explored as part of a staff knowledge, attitudes and practices survey, developed by the research team. Nineteen items in the staff survey related to program acceptability scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly disagree; 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly agree). The survey was administered prior to program implementation. The researcher attended handover sessions or designated ward meetings to distribute the survey. Nurses that had worked on an intervention ward for at least 7.5&#x000a0;h per week in the 2&#x000a0;months prior were invited to complete the survey. Completed surveys were placed in sealed boxes collected by the researcher at the end of the 2-week dissemination period. To avoid hierarchical coercion, Nurse Unit Managers were not involved in the distribution of the surveys. The number of surveys distributed to, and returned from, each ward was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to profile the study sample, program adherence and staff perceptions. Adherence to program content was categorized into three levels: adherent, partially adherent and non-adherent. Program dose was defined as a proportion. Data on hospital and ward resources and implementation activities were measured against expectations and/or recommendations and categorized into three level of adherence: adherent, partially adherent and non-adherent. Items were only coded as adherent if the recommendation was completely met. Analyses were undertaken using Stata MP v13 statistical software. Data visualizations of staff survey item responses were created using Tableau Desktop v9.0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><p>During the RCT there were 22,670 admissions to the intervention wards representing 17,698 individual participants, as some patients were admitted more than once.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>6-PACK program adherence</title><p>Data on program use were collected from 103,398 daily observations and medical record audits (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All participating wards were adherent to program content. Overall, 75% of patients had their falls-risk tool completed each day of their admission (range: 52&#x02013;90%). Of patients classified as high-risk, 79% had a &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; sign placed above the bed (range: 61&#x02013;90%) and 63% were provided with a sign and at least one additional 6-PACK intervention (range: 48&#x02013;74%). Use of 6-PACK program components increased during the RCT period. By the 10th month of data collection 79% of high-risk patients had a &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; sign plus at least one other intervention (range: 61&#x02013;95%).

Some site clinical leaders spent substantial time undertaking activities not originally envisaged as part of the program implementation, such as administration, email communication and equipment review (range 18&#x02013;46% of allocated time over the 12-month study period).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Staff perceptions</title><p>A total of 208 intervention ward nurses (66% response rate) completed the survey. The majority of respondents were qualified registered nurses (85%) and had worked on the participating intervention wards for more than 12&#x000a0;months (68%) with at least five shifts per week (51%). Results have been summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Nurses considered the program components to be important for falls prevention. Falls risk assessment tools were considered useful (74%, aggregate of &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; and &#x02018;agree&#x02019;), as were &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; signs above the bed (87%, aggregate of &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; and &#x02018;agree&#x02019;) and low-low beds (83%, aggregate of &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; and &#x02018;agree&#x02019;).

</p><p>Nurse responses toward the prevention of falls were less positive. Almost one third agreed that falls cannot be avoided in older people (30%, aggregate of &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; and &#x02018;agree&#x02019;). A degree of uncertainty amongst nurses for some items were noted, for example, more than one third neither agreed nor disagreed that there was strong leadership for falls prevention on their ward (38%, &#x02018;neutral&#x02019;). Moderate variation in staff responsiveness on some survey items between hospitals were observed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall, an acceptable level of implementation fidelity was observed, though variation was noted between wards and over time. This affirms previously published conclusions, that implementation failure was unlikely to be a key factor for the finding of no-effect in the 6-PACK trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Program adherence by hospital ward varied across and within hospitals, with adherence levels ranging from 48 to 90%. Substantial fluctuations over time were also noted, with many wards experiencing an increase in adherence as the program continued beyond the initial months. It is likely that these variations are due to a myriad of factors including observed differences in site clinical leaders, their resources and the time allocated to individual implementation activities. The heterogeneity of included wards and patient risk profiles make it difficult to explore these in detail. Nurses have a key role in the implementation of falls prevention programs such as 6-PACK. They care for patients in hospital 24&#x000a0;h a day, 7&#x000a0;days a week, 52&#x000a0;weeks a year. Generally high levels of acceptability of program components was observed among nursing staff, although some concepts demonstrated a proportion of staff with knowledge or attitude limitations that may have limited implementation success.</p><p>The completion of the falls-risk tool and provision of falls prevention interventions observed in this study compares favorably with routine practice (e.g. 71% of patients had their risk score updated daily during the RCT, compared with only 13% of patients having their risk score updated at least once during their ward admission in an audit of usual falls prevention practices) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Nearly two-thirds of all high-risk patients received the 6-PACK program as defined in the protocol. While, there may be scope for improvement in program adherence on some participating wards, the characteristics of patients in acute wards (short LOS, complex medical conditions, acute medical instability), mean it may not be realistic to expect 100% adherence. Few previous studies have evaluated adherence to falls prevention interventions in acute hospitals. Therefore, the ability to benchmark the adherence levels observed in this study to prior literature is restricted, and it is difficult to determine what levels of program adherence are actually required to elicit meaningful changes in outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Methodological discussion</title><p>When interpreting these results, the following methodological limitations should be considered. The provision of 6-PACK interventions was reliant on the daily completion of the falls-risk tool and accurate classification of patients at high-risk. In addition, it does not necessarily reflect optimum practice (the provision of a &#x02018;Falls alert&#x02019; sign and all relevant 6-PACK strategies for those identified as high-risk) or allow for the examination of the appropriate use of strategies. The authors acknowledge that qualitative data would provide additional insights into the factors influencing implementation fidelity, yet it was beyond the scope of this study. Considerable but different barriers to implementation appeared to be present in some hospitals/wards during the 6-PACK trial. Further exploration of organizational characteristics, existing infrastructure and surrounding social structures, ward location, the availability, skills and leadership qualities of the local implementation team and other competing priorities experienced by staff should be considered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In-hospital falls represent a complex problem that occurs within the complex environment of a hospital ward, often to individuals with complex care needs. Therefore, it is inevitable that examining implementation fidelity is also challenging. Currently there is limited consensus on how best to define and measure implementation fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The framework used in this study provided systematic guidance to measurement, however, it does not provide any direction on how to explore the relationships between its key elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>In this study, while program adherence was not optimal at some participating hospitals, we considered overall implementation fidelity sufficient in the 6-PACK trial. Therefore, implementation failure is unlikely to be a key factor for the observed lack of program effectiveness on fall and fall injuries. This study provides valuable learnings for the development and implementation of future falls prevention programs or other nurse-led safety programs. Given the challenges and costs involved with the implementation of complex health interventions, such as falls prevention programs, examination of implementation fidelity should be an integral part of any evaluation of an intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
