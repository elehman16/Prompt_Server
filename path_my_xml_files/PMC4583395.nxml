We can acquire a wide variety of motor skills every day, and adapt to changes even in unfamiliar environments [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sensorimotor learning is based on sensory feedback pertaining to discrepancies between desired and actual movements [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Humans can estimate the error gradients of each motor command component, and improve performance through iterative corrections based on movement error [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Information concerning movement error plays a crucial role in motor learning [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Both concurrent and post-trial visual feedback (VF) improved motor performance during an isometric target acquisition task in two different ways: concurrent VF enhanced motor performance through automatic recalibration of visuomotor mapping, while post-trial VF induced improvements using a cognitive strategy [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture needle manipulation requires sophisticated hand movements and represents a fundamental skill for acupuncturists. Acupuncture experts consolidate motion patterns during needle manipulation by accumulating clinical experience [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Experts exhibit greater kinematic and kinetic movement consistency and temporal efficiency during needle manipulation compared with novices [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Various types of acupuncture needle manipulation techniques, including rotation and lifting/thrusting, have been passed down by practitioners over generations. However, due to the lack of objective, quantitative information concerning needle manipulation motion parameters, it is difficult for novices to acquire these sophisticated hand movements. Davis <italic>et al</italic>. developed a motion and force sensor to quantify different needling motion and force patterns for two different acupuncture techniques [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Using the <italic>Acupuncture Manipulation Information Analysis System</italic>, Liu et al. imitated the traditional reinforcing and reducing acupuncture manipulation described in classical Chinese medical books [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This system facilitates needle manipulation learning by classifying and characterizing the physical parameters of lifting-thrusting and twirling manipulations [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>When learning new motor skills, observing others enables novices to acquire sensorimotor representations of the observed action [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, when untrained medical students receive expert acupuncture needle manipulation instruction, imitating such complicated hand movements can prove difficult. A novel method of imitating rhythmic movements involves mimicking simulated motion pattern visual cues; VF pertaining to intended and actual movement discrepancies can be a useful tool for students [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Using a motion sensor device [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we developed the <italic>Acupuncture Manipulation Education System</italic> (AMES), which not only simulates traditional acupuncture needle movements (using an oscillogram) but also provides information on discrepancies between this motion template and the student&#x02019;s own hand movements, using concurrent or post-trial VF [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We herein assessed whether untrained students could improve their motor performance during acupuncture needle manipulations using AMES, with concurrent or post-trial VF (session 1: simple lifting/thrusting needle manipulations; session 2: complicated lifting/thrusting needle manipulations).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>The study participants were 21 right-handed students from the College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, recruited using poster advertisements placed on bulletin boards.

In session 1, a simple lifting/thrusting movement represented the motion template (ratio of time between motions; i.e., lifting time to thrusting time = 1:1). This movement involved the isometric (strength and velocity) lifting and thrusting of a needle (movement magnitude = 4 mm, frequency = 1 Hz), such that a sine wave of 4-mm amplitude and 1-Hz frequency was produced on a moving oscillograph. In session 2, the motion template involved a complicated lifting/thrusting movement (ratio of time between motions; i.e., lifting time to thrusting time = 2:1); i.e., non-isometric (strength and velocity) lifting and thrusting of a needle (movement magnitude: 4mm, frequency: 1Hz) such that a modified sine wave of 4-mm amplitude and 1-Hz frequency was produced on a moving oscillograph.

Prior to the pre-training test, we first presented a motion template such that participants could practice hand movements. In the pre- and post-training tests, participants were instructed to perform needle manipulations, without visual information, mimicking the motion template as closely as possible.

Following each training trial, participants were presented with error information (i.e., the difference between the intended and actual movements). After the experiment was complete, they were asked to evaluate the following using a 5-point Likert scale ranging between 1 (not at all) and 5 (extremely): 1) their degree of satisfaction with our education procedure and 2) its degree of necessity for formal education.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data processing and statistical analysis</title><p>For preprocessing, an infinite impulse response (IIR) Butterworth filter was applied to the raw signal as a band-pass filter, to filter out fluctuating low- (&#x0003c;0.2 Hz) and high-frequency noise signals (&#x0003e;5 Hz).

Following training, both the concurrent and post-trial VF groups were characterized by reduced subjective difficulty ratings across the whole session, with hand movement motion patterns more similar to the template motion pattern during the complicated lifting/thrusting session and significantly reduced error magnitudes during the simple lifting/thrusting session.</p><p>Motion pattern analysis revealed improved motion patterns during the complicated lifting/thrusting session for both groups. Because we intended to enhance hand movement performance without using simulated visual cues, we compared the needle manipulation motion patterns of the pre- and post-training tests of each group. Using GAMM, we estimated the motion pattern regression curves of each participant during the lifting/thrusting manipulation, and calculated shape error (i.e., the discrepancy between the intended and actual movements). Motion pattern analysis revealed that the estimated motion pattern regression curves were closer to the motion template in the post- vs. pre-training test of session 2 in both groups (<xref rid="pone.0139340.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Moreover, significant shape error reductions were observed in both groups, particularly in the complicated lifting/thrusting session, following training (<xref rid="pone.0139340.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). These results suggest that acupuncture needle manipulation can be improved without visual aids following AMES training. However, shape errors were not reduced in either the concurrent or post-trial VF group during the simple lifting/thrusting session following training. Because performance of needle lifting/thrusting proved straightforward even to untrained students, there may have been a ceiling effect with respect to reductions in shape errors during the simple lifting/thrusting session.</p><p>Both the concurrent and post-trial VF groups were characterized by reduced error magnitudes during the simple lifting/thrusting session (<xref rid="pone.0139340.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Although both groups exhibited significantly fewer errors following training, there were group differences in learning curve error magnitudes across the whole training period (<xref rid="pone.0139340.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Because concurrent VF can provide visual information for eye-hand synchrony during practice trials, fewer magnitude errors were detected across the whole training period in the concurrent VF group. In contrast, the post-trial VF group exhibited greater error magnitudes in the initial practice trials, which decreased gradually during the later practice trials. With no real-time VF, participants in the post-trial VF group might have acquired a cognitive strategy based on the post-trial error information provided during the during practice trials [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that both the concurrent and post-trial VF groups could have enhanced their motor performance using two different routes (i.e., implicit [automatic] and explicit [cognitive] processes).</p><p>Visuomotor adaptation suggests that humans largely depend on visual information to guide hand movements toward targets [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; our model takes the form of a visuomotor map transforming visual information into motor commands [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite the &#x0003e;15-min rest period between the two sessions, participants in the concurrent VF group could have habituated to the visual tasks of the previous simple lift/thrusting session (practice trials and post-training test) during the pre-training complicated lift/thrusting session. There was no significant difference in the shape errors of the concurrent and post-trial VF groups during the pre-training test of session 1 (i.e., the simple lifting/thrusting session), but a greater number of shape errors were committed by the concurrent vs. post-trial VF group during pre-training for session 2 (i.e., for the complicated lifting/thrusting session). These results are consistent with previous studies in which groups receiving concurrent VF during task execution exhibited classic aftereffects, whereas groups receiving only post-trial VF did not [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It may be that implicit adaptation to simple lifting/thrusting manipulations during session 1 represents automatic adaptations in the concurrent VF group, whereas cognitive processes could be involved in explicit strategies for more complicated tasks in the post-trial VF group. However, to further investigate the possible effects of visuomotor adaptation, more research is required.</p><p>Using AMES, we attempted to determine an efficient procedure for learning a very sophisticated hand movement involved in acupuncture manipulation. First, we measured acupuncture vertical movements as displayed on an oscillogram, which allows for a more precise assessment of subtle acupuncture movements than is possible with direct observation of the actual movement. Second, we tested two conditions: (1) concurrent visual feedback and (2) post-trial visual feedback. The target movements of sensorimotor learning under both conditions were provided in the form of an oscillogram. Following training, the results from both the concurrent and post-trial VF groups showed reduced subjective difficulty ratings across the whole session, with hand movement motion patterns more similar to the template motion pattern during the complicated lifting/thrusting session and significantly reduced magnitude of error during the simple lifting/thrusting session. However, only the concurrent VF group showed significantly reduced error magnitude during the complicated lifting/thrusting session (<xref rid="pone.0139340.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Under the concurrent visual feedback condition, superposing actual motion on the target movement provided a real-time reference for the discrepancy between the target motion and the actual motion. Such real-time referencing facilitates automatic recalibration of hand movements. Conversely, under the post-trial visual feedback condition, information regarding the discrepancy between the target motion and the actual motion was provided only after the actual movement. Post-trial visual feedback requires far more cognitive resources to recalibrate and to modify the actual motion to make it similar to the target motion compared with concurrent visual feedback [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0139340.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139340.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>The characteristics of both conditions (concurrent and post-trial VF) are summarized.</title><p>The modality, latent process, and results of each condition are included to facilitate understanding of each visual feedback condition.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0139340.g005"/></fig><p>This study had several limitations. First, we only assessed two lifting/thrusting needle manipulation skill levels. In the structural learning paradigm, the structure represents the relevant inputs and outputs of the system and the functional equations that relate to them, thereby explaining the learning-to-learn (meta-learning) phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Learning the structure of a task or game, such as tennis, can facilitate motor performance in games with closely related structures (e.g., other racquet sports). Similarly, students trained in certain types of lifting/thrusting manipulations should be able to easily acquire novel needle manipulation techniques. Second, it is not clear if motor performance during acupuncture needle manipulation can be improved purely through movement repetition, including when no visual information is available. Because we aimed to investigate motor learning using two types of VF following AMES training, we did not include a non-VF group; a non-VF group would be required to differentiate error-based learning with visual cues from use-dependent learning. Third, participants received VF on a phantom, not a human, acupoint; even though this phantom acupoint is well-validated with respect to biomechanical force and needle grasp [<xref rid="pone.0139340.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it is not certain that phantom acupoint needle manipulations are fully applicable to human acupoints. However, we suggest that visuomotor training with AMES using the phantom acupoint would prove beneficial for novices learning sophisticated acupuncture hand movements prior to clinical practice. Finally, participants were presented with a motion template, using sine-wave visual cues, for both simple and complicated lift/thrusting needle manipulations. Although such visual cues are applicable to different types of lift/thrusting movements, learning from them may not be intuitive. Our data further suggest that an advanced education system should be conceived. For example, additional devices could facilitate sensorimotor learning of more complex hand movements based on the recorded movements of acupuncture manipulation performed by experienced clinicians. A novel system that simulates actual hand movements using virtual reality-based VF would be one possible method for use in the future. Despite several limitations, participants of both groups reported great satisfaction with our education system (ratings of 4.00 &#x000b1; 0.22 in the concurrent VF group and 4.18 &#x000b1; 0.28 in the post-trial VF group on a 5-point Likert scale), and indicated that this system should be included in the formal education program (4.60 &#x000b1; 0.17 in the concurrent VF group and 4.27 &#x000b1; 0.31 in the post-trial VF group). Thus, we suggest that visuomotor training with AMES using the phantom acupoint would prove beneficial for novices learning sophisticated acupuncture hand movements prior to clinical practice.</p><p>In conclusion, sensorimotor learning with VF can improve the sophisticated hand movements required for acupuncture needle manipulation. Use of two types of VF can benefit untrained students, through either automatic or cognitive processes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (No. 2011&#x02013;0009913) and the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (no.
