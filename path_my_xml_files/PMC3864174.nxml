Increasing the starting dose of tacrolimus QD (0.3 mg/kg/day, Arm 3) did not increase efficacy. In particular, the incidence of BCAR was not improved. Noninferiority of Arm 2 versus Arm 1 was supported by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analyses and measurements of kidney function.</p><p>Previous randomized controlled studies have shown similar efficacy with tacrolimus QD and BD in kidney transplantation. A large, open-label study in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients showed that tacrolimus QD and BD were noninferior to cyclosporine (plus MMF, corticosteroids, and basiliximab induction) for the primary endpoint of efficacy failure (death, graft loss, BCAR, or lost to follow-up) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). A more recent study compared tacrolimus QD and BD (0.2 mg/kg/day) with low-dose MMF and steroids (without antibody induction) in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Although BCAR event rates at week 24 (the primary efficacy endpoint) with tacrolimus QD did not differ significantly from BD therapy (20.4% vs. 15.8%), the criteria for treatment noninferiority were not met. Tacrolimus QD and BD showed similar patient and graft survival at 1 year after transplantation, efficacy failure rates did not differ between treatments, and safety profiles were similar.</p><p>Acute rejection rates in OSAKA were low and comparable with 0.2 mg/kg per day tacrolimus QD versus BD. These data indicate that a higher starting dose of tacrolimus QD is unnecessary to achieve comparable efficacy to tacrolimus BD. The acute rejection rates observed with Arm 2 further support 0.2 mg/kg per day tacrolimus QD plus MMF and corticosteroids as the optimal QD treatment regimen in this study. Interestingly, the acute rejection rates with tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg per day without induction therapy were similar to those reported in the ELITE-Symphony Study after initiation with 0.1 mg/kg per day tacrolimus BD plus daclizumab (Symphony: 12.3%) (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>).</p><p>The scale of OSAKA allows meaningful analyses of the effect of organ quality on the primary composite outcome. In this study, graft dysfunction (eGFR &#x0003c;40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was the main driver for the primary composite outcome, which was strongly influenced by donor-related factors. Approximately 50% (620 of 1198) of patients received kidneys from ECDs, reflecting the worsening quality of donor organs available in Europe. Subsequently, there was an unexpectedly higher proportion of patients than anticipated who met the &#x0003c;40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> threshold, and this contributed to the seemingly high efficacy failure rate. However, the difference in renal function observed between the patients who received organs from ECDs and SCDs early after transplantation diminished over time, indicating that the immunosuppressive regimens used (including the initial dosing before transplantation) were appropriate for this patient population. In a previous study comparing tacrolimus QD and BD, efficacy failure (BCAR, graft loss, or death but excluding graft dysfunction) was 18.9% (55 of 291) in patients receiving tacrolimus BD and 22.5% (63 of 280) for QD (PPS) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). In hind sight, using the chronic kidney disease predefined eGFR categories may have resulted in a more balanced primary composite endpoint.</p><p>As donor demographics have such a strong influence on outcomes, it is essential that donor information is readily available for consideration in any indirect comparisons between studies. This study was designed to reflect real-world practice in Europe where there is a substantial proportion of deceased-donor and ECD kidney transplants performed (in OSAKA: 88% deceased donors, mean donor age, 51.5 years). In comparison, in BENEFIT, 42% of kidneys were from deceased donors, with mean ages of 42 years for living donors and 38 years for deceased donors (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). In ELITE-Symphony, 64% of kidneys were from deceased donors and mean donor age was approximately 45 years (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>).</p><p>In OSAKA, kidney function was lowest in the steroid-avoidance arm (Arm 4). Interestingly, in a subanalysis of patients who received organs from SCDs, the incidence of renal dysfunction was comparable between arms (24.5%, 22.4%, 21.9%, and 28.8% in Arms 1&#x02013;4, respectively; <italic>P</italic>=0.5011). This implies that the higher incidence of renal dysfunction in Arm 4 was predominantly associated with organs from ECDs. Steroid use has been shown to confer immediate posttransplantation kidney protection (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>); consequently, steroid avoidance may have a greater impact on kidneys from ECDs compared with SCDs. A steroid-avoidance regimen with tacrolimus QD at the lower starting dose of 0.2 mg/kg may therefore be feasible for the SCD subpopulation (with low immunologic risk) with the potential for a reduced incidence of ongoing diabetes and requirement for antidiabetic treatment.</p><p>OSAKA was conducted in a high number of kidney recipients who can be considered to be representative of the European transplant population. Graft dysfunction was the main driver for the primary efficacy endpoint, most likely as a result of there being approximately 50% of patients receiving kidneys from ECDs, thus making the true interpretation of treatment effect on recipients who received kidneys from SCDs more challenging. A marginally higher dropout rate and a higher number of protocol violations than originally assumed may also have influenced some of the study outcomes in this trial. To overcome this, and to confirm the robustness of the data, the endpoints were analyzed for both the PPS and FAS. Other limitations of this study include a low immunologic risk population, not assessing treatment adherence and short study duration (24 weeks). It would also be interesting to assess the calcineurin inhibitor-related long-term toxicities between regimens (such as renal impairment or the development of NODM after transplantation) over a longer treatment period.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that a modern tacrolimus QD-based immunosuppressive regimen using a starting dose of 0.2 mg/kg per day is of similar efficacy to the current standard tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg per day BD-based therapy in de novo kidney transplantation. Increasing the starting dose of tacrolimus QD to 0.3 mg/kg per day offered no efficacy or other clinical advantage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design (NCT00717470; ClinicalTrials.gov)</title><p>This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study was conducted at 110 centers in 22 countries (May 2008&#x02013;March 2010), in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, and the applicable laws and regulations. An independent ethics committee from each study center granted approval before initiation. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Eligible patients were 18 years or older with end-stage renal disease who received a primary kidney/retransplantation (unless the graft was lost due to rejection within 12 months after first transplantation). Kidneys were transplanted from deceased/living donors with compatible ABO blood types; there was no restriction on donor age or in cold ischemia time.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>The randomization sequence was prepared by Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd. (Surrey, UK). Randomization was coordinated centrally by Cenduit Interactive Response Technologies using an interactive voice response system to randomize eligible patients to one of four treatment arms (1:1:1:1) and allocate patient numbers. Treatment allocation was stratified according to study center and age group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title><p>A preoperative dose of tacrolimus BD (0.1 mg/kg, Arm 1) or QD (0.1 mg/kg, Arms 2 and 4; 0.15 mg/kg, Arm 3) was given within 12 hr before reperfusion and within 3 hr of anesthesia when possible. The second dose of tacrolimus BD or QD was administered postoperatively but not within 4 hr of the first dose or more than 12 hr after reperfusion. Patients who received a living-donor organ were allowed predosing with tacrolimus BD or QD within 72 hr of perfusion (Arms 1, 2, and 4: maximum 0.2 mg/kg and Arm 3: maximum 0.3 mg/kg). Subsequent oral doses of tacrolimus BD and QD were allowed after day 1 and adjusted based on clinical efficacy and safety, taking account of recommended whole-blood trough concentrations (see <bold>Figure S1, SDC,</bold>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/TP/A858">http://links.lww.com/TP/A858</ext-link>). Tacrolimus trough concentrations were determined by the local laboratories.</p><p>Treatment continued for 24 weeks. In Arm 1, tacrolimus BD commenced at a daily dose of 0.2 mg/kg; QD was initiated at a daily dose of 0.2 mg/kg in Arms 2 and 4 and 0.3 mg/kg in Arm 3. Corticosteroids were administered in Arms 1 to 3 in the following doses: day 0, &#x02264;500 mg (bolus); day 1, 125 mg (bolus); days 2 to 14, 20 mg per day; days 15 to 28, 15 mg per day; days 29 to 42, 10 mg per day; days 43 to 84, 5 mg per day; and days 85 to 168, &#x02264;5 mg per day. All patients received MMF (1 g preoperatively then 1 g BD for 14 days and 0.5 g BD thereafter; see <bold>Figure S1, SDC,</bold>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/TP/A858">http://links.lww.com/TP/A858</ext-link>). Basiliximab was administered to patients in Arm 4 only; these patients also received a steroid bolus (&#x0003c;500 mg) on day 0.</p><p>A kidney biopsy was performed before initiation of antirejection therapy if clinical and/or laboratory signs indicated rejection and was evaluated by a local histopathologist following Banff &#x02018;97 criteria (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Primary Efficacy Variable</title><p>Efficacy failure rate was defined as incidence and time to first occurrence of one of the following: (a) graft loss (retransplantation, nephrectomy, death, or dialysis ongoing at study end or at time of discontinuation, unless superseded by follow-up information that indicated graft survival); (b) BCAR, diagnosed locally; and (c) graft dysfunction (eGFR Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]-4, &#x0003c;40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, capped at 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) at week 24. Analysis was undertaken on the PPS as per the protocol. The threshold for graft dysfunction was based on estimates from previously reported studies (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18&#x02013;20</italic></xref>): it was expected that mean eGFR would be approximately 50 to 55 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. On this basis, it was anticipated that BCAR and graft dysfunction would have a similar impact on the composite endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Endpoints</title><p>Secondary endpoints included eGFR and creatinine clearance (Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault) at week 24, assessment of BCAR, and graft and patient survival. Adverse events were monitored throughout. NODM was defined as fasting blood glucose of 7 mmol/L or more from day 2 onwards.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis (SAS Version 9.1.3)</title><p>The planned sample size of 1200 patients (300 per group) provided 80% power to detect a difference of 12.5% or more between groups, assuming a failure rate of 30% and a 6% dropout rate for the composite primary efficacy endpoint. Failure rate was based on an expected early death/graft loss rate in de novo renal transplantation of 5% to 7.5%, an expected BCAR rate using a tacrolimus-based regimen of 10% to 17.5%, and an expected rate of renal dysfunction at week 24 in the range of 10% to 15% based on an eGFR threshold of less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Adjusting for overlap resulting from patients who experience more than one of the events (BCAR and graft loss ~2.5% or BCAR and renal dysfunction ~5%), the estimated frequency of the composite endpoint was approximately 30% (range, 25%&#x02013;35%).</p><p>Primary analyses of efficacy data were undertaken on the PPS: randomized patients who received one or more dose of study medication were transplanted, and did not have a major protocol violation. To determine the robustness of the data, these analyses were also assessed on the FAS (secondary endpoint): all randomized patients who had a transplant and received one or more dose of tacrolimus. All other efficacy data were assessed on the FAS. Safety analyses were based on all randomized patients who received one or more dose of tacrolimus. Analyses were stratified by treatment group.</p><p>To prove noninferiority, a 12.5% difference in the composite endpoint was considered to be within the range in which a meaningful clinical difference in efficacy between the treatment regimens becomes apparent (based on the 1200 patient sample size; 80% power to detect a difference). Noninferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in efficacy failure rate was above -12.5% for each tacrolimus QD arm versus the BD arm (PPS and FAS). The Bonferroni&#x02013;Holm method was applied for multiple comparisons. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analyses were used to determine efficacy failure rates; the reported percentages represent Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates, and the plain incidences are given in brackets. Kidney function and blood lipid parameters were evaluated using analysis of covariance. <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Ancillary Analysis</title><p>Although the study protocol did not define ECDs or SCDs, a post hoc analysis was performed. ECDs (modified Crystal City criteria) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>) included living or deceased donors aged 60 years or older or who were 50 to 60 years old with one or more other risk factor (cerebrovascular accident as reason for death, hypertension, or serum creatinine &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dL) and donation after circulatory death. All other donors were, by default, SCDs. Where values for any of these variables were missing, donors were assumed not to have met that criterion. For all comparisons, FAS data were analyzed using Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Stefan Schleibner and Roland Wolf (AMS-Advanced Medical Services, Munich, Germany) for their statistical support during the study and in the preparation of the manuscript, and Nina Heath and Anisha Mehra (iS Health) for their editorial support in the preparation of the article.
