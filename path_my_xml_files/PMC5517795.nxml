Main goal of the Healthy Employment (HE) project is to enhance intersectoral actions promoting mental health among unemployed, namely through the implementation and effectiveness-evaluation of short-term and sustainable group interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The project follows a RE-AIM-based (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework for assessing a cognitive-behavioural and psychoeducational intervention that has been developed for promoting mental health among unemployed people. It is a short-term group intervention (five sessions, four hours each, 20 unemployed persons per group) focused on mental health literacy, interpersonal communication and of emotional regulation. Implementation of the intervention will be carried out by clinical psychologists, following a standardized procedure manual. Effectiveness will be assessed through a randomized field study with two arms (intervention and control). Participants are unemployed people (18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years old, both genders, having at least nine years of formal education) registered at public employment centres from different geographical regions for less than 12&#x000a0;months (including first-job seekers). Allocation to arms of the study will follow a random match-to-case process, considering gender, age groups and educational level. Three moments of evaluation will occur: before intervention (baseline), immediately after its ending and three months later. Main outcomes are mental health literacy, mental health related personal and perceived stigma, psychological well-being, satisfaction with life and resilience. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be conducted. Cohen&#x02019;s d coefficient and odds ratio will be used for assessing the size of the intervention effect, when significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Scientific and clinical knowledge will be applied to promote/protect psychological well-being of unemployed people. While the first phases of the project are funded by the European Economic Area Grants, long-term assessments of the intervention require a larger timeframe. Further funding and institutional support will be sought for this purpose. Already established intersectoral collaborations are key-assets to reach long-term sustainability of this project.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">The study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; Prospectively registered number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12616001432404.aspx">ACTRN12616001432404</ext-link>; date of registration: 13 October 2016.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Psychological well-being</kwd><kwd>Mental health promotion</kwd><kwd>Unemployment</kwd><kwd>Economic crises</kwd><kwd>Randomized field study</kwd><kwd>Study protocol</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007048</institution-id><institution>EEA Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>222SM2</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">The recent European financial crisis has affected large proportions of the population in many countries, most particularly in Greece, Ireland and Portugal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Portugal, due to the assistance received from the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, several harsh austerity measures were adopted, leading to budget cuts across different areas including the health sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This led to a reduced health system capacity, jeopardizing the implementation of health promoting actions and prevention programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Economic crises present numerous potential challenges to mental health, such as reduced access to health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and deterioration of individuals&#x02019; psychological well-being as a result of job loss. Several studies have shown that in a context of recession or adverse economic climate, those affected by job loss have an increased risk of suffering from psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In Portugal, the unemployment rates have increased over the last 10&#x000a0;years. In late 2014, when the funding protocol for this project was first submitted (European Economic Area [EEA] Grants), the unemployment rate in Portugal was 13.5%. In February 2016, it was slightly lower (12.3%), but still higher than the European Community average (10.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Santana et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported that the decreasing tendency of suicide rates observed between 1989 and 1993 and 1999&#x02013;2003 (&#x02212;5.4%) was inverted in 2008&#x02013;2012 (with an increase of 22.6%).</p><p id="Par20">Extensive work has been done to identify the complex links between economic downturns and suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, higher levels of rurality and material deprivation have been identified as main determinants of suicide in Portugal, in the context of the recent financial crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Anyway, results remain conflicting. For example, it has been argued that difficult economic contexts do not necessarily imply increased adverse health (mortality rates can even fall), namely because economy slowdowns may favour healthier behaviours (e.g., as increased sleep time and physical activity, reduction of unhealthy foods and/or alcohol intake and less risky driving) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Also, the relationship between unemployment and suicide is possibly moderated by available welfare-system support and expectancies of regaining meaningful employment, which are conditions that vary over time and between countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Professionally active-aged individuals may change between a variety of dynamic employment-related forms, ranging from unemployment or underemployment to employment or even overemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

Under this last aspect, when attempting to make the transition back to paid employment, individuals can lack required or up-to-date skills, which can lead to precarious employment and increase risk of returning to unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The negative health effects of unemployment or underemployment can be attenuated or prevented through the implementation of wide restructuring health promotion actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Psychological well-being depends upon a complex and interrelated set of individual, socioeconomic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Efficacious mental health protection and promotion actions need to involve several community domains and societal sectors (both public and private) such as primary health care services, social welfare support and promotion of active labour market programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Several programs focused primarily on building capacity, resilience and enhancement of job search-related skills have been developed in different countries.

As a consequence, there is a clear deficit of evidence-based large-scale promotion mental health programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Indeed, in contrast to what has happened in other countries that implemented evidence-based programs to face unemployment rate increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], only incipient and rather delayed responses have been developed to protect psychological well-being of unemployed individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">For these reasons, this community intervention project, the Healthy Employment (HE), has been developed to contribute to the protection and promotion of psychological well-being for the unemployed.

In order to be feasible and sustainable at long-term, the intervention was defined as low-cost and standardized.

More specifically, the intervention focuses on the promotion of unemployed individuals&#x02019; social, emotional and interpersonal skills. It also targets the strengthening of resilience and of the ability to overcome the adversity of unemployment, by maximizing the personal use of owns&#x02019; resources for employability enhancement and future success in re-employment. It is a short-term group intervention (around 20&#x000a0;h, delivered in a two- to three-weeks period) and follows a cognitive-behavioural and psychoeducational paradigm (focusing on mental health literacy). Strategic skills to be promoted are: reduction of mental health related stigma, recognition of psychological suffering (depression and anxiety), coping with depression and anxiety, effective communication and emotional regulation.

For all tests, the level of statistical significance will be set as &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.05.</p><p id="Par45">For the effectiveness assessment, socio-demographic and outcome variables will be described for each moment of observation. Two strategies of data analysis will be done: (1) intention-to-treat (ITT), as a primary analysis, and; (2) per-protocol, as a supportive analysis. The ITT analysis (treatment as assigned approach), will consider all participants randomly allocated to each arm of the study at baseline with a last observation carried forward imputation for those who did not undergo the final evaluation. The per-protocol analysis (treatment as received approach), will include only the subset of the ITT sample who will completed the evaluations without any major protocol violations. When describing differences between intervention and control group, results from both types of analysis will be reported; for effect size assessment, only per-protocol approach results will be reported, in order to have an estimation of the impact of the treatment as received.</p><p id="Par46">Univariate description of variables will be summarized by central tendency measures (means and medians, according to the normality of their distributions) and respective dispersion measures (standard deviation and range). Normality of data will be assessed through the analysis of kurtosis and skewness.</p><p id="Par47">Association between nominal variables will be assessed through chi-square test (with Yates adjustment, when necessary). Continued variables will be compared (between arms, at the same momentum) by independent samples t-student test or by its non-parametric equivalent (Mann-Whitney test), when adequate.</p><p id="Par48">Effect of the intervention will be studied by linear or logistic regression analysis (according to the nature of the dependent variable), having as dependent variables test-retest variations and adjusting for conceptually (and statistically) relevant variables. Model assumptions will be tested by analysis of residuals and influence diagnostics through Cook&#x02019;s distance. Cohen&#x02019;s d coefficient and odds ratio will be used for assessing the size of the intervention effect, when significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par49">This intervention protocol follows the code of ethics of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. All participants will be asked to sign an informed consent, with detailed information concerning the goals and procedures of the project, as well as with regard to their full right to refuse or quit their participation at any time. The written informed consent will be signed before the first intervention session.</p><p id="Par50">If the intervention proves to be effective, participants enrolled in the control arm will be invited to benefit from it as well. This research protocol was approved by the Portuguese Protection Data Authority (CNPD). Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Academic Centre of Medicine of Lisbon (University of Lisbon).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par51">In a context of adverse economic climate, vulnerable groups experiencing unemployment have an increased risk of suffering from mood disorders and psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. This paper describes a community-based randomized field study protocol for assessing the effectiveness of a psychological well-being protection and promotion intervention, aiming to build capacity and reduce inequalities within the context of unemployment. This intervention is foreseen as strategic due to its applicability to different community settings and targeted populations. Moreover, the intervention has also a component of socio-cognitive skills development and training for an adequate recognition of psychological suffering and referral to primary healthcare and mental health services.</p><p id="Par52">A main challenge of the field experiment concerns some fundamental characteristics of the intervention, namely in terms of format and duration. The intervention is currently planned to follow a short-term group format, maximizing its potential to be adopted, replicated and sustained in different settings (in both public and private sectors). Another difficulty relates to the fact that the population that may benefit from the intervention is highly heterogeneous, namely regarding financial, sociocultural backgrounds and level of psychological suffering. Therefore, the added-value of the intervention for participants will vary substantially and the overall trial results will need to be stratified by individuals&#x02019; characteristics.</p><p id="Par53">Considering the timeframe of the EEA Grants 2009&#x02013;2014 that financially supported this project (see acknowledgements/funding section), the final evaluation of the intervention will be done three months after its ending. This is a limitation of this study protocol because three months might be a narrow time frame for detecting mental health promotion effects and, on the other hand, possible intervention-related changes can be temporary and not sustainable. Nevertheless, if the intervention shows positive results at the last observation moment, the project team will apply for new funding opportunities to follow the recruited cohort (within this trial) for a longer period.</p><p id="Par54">The external validity of the study will also require replication with larger numbers of participants. The expected results of the study, together with the fact that the involved partners include multilevel and intersectoral stakeholders, in the areas of unemployment, temporary employment, social security, local authorities, health services and entrepreneurial activities, will be instrumental to inform decision makers.</p><p id="Par55">This project is embedded in the strengthening of the bilateral relations between Portugal and EEA Grants&#x02019; Donor States (Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein), namely by sharing scientific knowledge about mental health promotion of vulnerable groups such as those unemployed. The tangible joint results that we hope to reach through this opportunity of cooperation will reinforce the political, professional and human ties between these countries.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>A-Lit</term><def><p id="Par5">Anxiety Literacy Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSI</term><def><p id="Par6">Brief Symptom Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CD-RISC</term><def><p id="Par7">Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNPD</term><def><p id="Par8">Portuguese Protection Data Authority</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D-Lit</term><def><p id="Par9">Depression Literacy Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSS</term><def><p id="Par10">Depression Stigma Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EEA Grants</term><def><p id="Par11">European Economic Area Grants</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GHQ</term><def><p id="Par12">General Health Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HE</term><def><p id="Par13">Healthy Employment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par14">Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RE-AIM</term><def><p id="Par16">Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SWLS</term><def><p id="Par17">The Satisfaction with Life Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We want to thank Filipe Le&#x000e3;o Miranda and Paulo Nicola for their heuristic insights throughout the building up of this protocol.
