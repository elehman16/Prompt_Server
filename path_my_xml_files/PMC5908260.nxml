Positive effects of cardiac rehabilitation on patients treated for AF with ablation have been found, but whether cardiac rehabilitation affects sleep quality is unknown. The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) differences in sleep quality between cardiac rehabilitation and usual care groups and (2) whether other factors could affect sleep quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From the randomized CopenHeart<sub>RFA</sub> trial, 210 patients treated for AF with ablation were included. A rehabilitation program consisting of physical exercise and psychoeducational consultations was tested. Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire before intervention and at the end of intervention. Anxiety, depression, and European Heart Rhythm Association scores were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>No difference between groups in sleep quality was found (PSQI global mean [SD] score, 6.60 [3.61] points for the cardiac rehabilitation group [n = 83] and 6.08 [3.60] points for the usual care group [n = 90]; <italic>P</italic> = .34), although improvements in sleep quality were noted in both groups. Sleep latency, duration, and efficiency were significant by type of AF at 1 month. Anxiety, depression, and higher European Heart Rhythm Association scores at 4 months were associated with a higher PSQI global mean score at the end of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The rehabilitation program showed no effect on sleep quality. A large proportion of patients reported poor sleep quality, and patients reporting anxiety, depression, or AF symptoms described worse sleep quality compared with patients who did not experience anxiety, depression, or AF symptoms. More research in the field is warranted.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS:</title><kwd>atrial fibrillation</kwd><kwd>cardiac rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular diseases</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Sleep is a fundamental behavior that has been shown to be associated with morbidity and recovery.

Patients 18 years or older, Danish speaking, and providing oral and written informed consent were eligible for participation. The following patients were excluded: (1) those unable to understand trial instructions; (2) pregnant or breastfeeding women; (3) those with a reduced ability to follow the planned program due to other physical illness; (4) those who, before ablation, had been engaged in intense physical exercise or sports at a competitive level several times a week; or (5) those who were enrolled in a clinical trial that prohibited participation in additional trials.</p><p>Patients were centrally randomized 1:1 to comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation plus usual care (cardiac rehabilitation group vs usual care group). Outcome assessment, data management, analyses, and conclusions were performed by a blinded statistician and research staff.</p><p>The intervention consisted of usual care, which included 1 consultation at 3 to 4 months with a cardiologist at the treating hospital and, in addition, a physical exercise program and psychoeducational consultations. The physical exercise program was designed to increase physical capacity measured by VO<sub>2</sub> peak. The training program consisted of graduated cardiovascular training based on intensity prescription using the Borg scale<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and strength exercises altered stepwise during training sessions. The program included 3 sessions per week for 12 weeks.</p><p>The aim of the psychoeducational consultations was to provide emotional support and improve coping skills and illness appraisal to enable the patients to respond appropriately to physical and psychological symptoms. The psychoeducational consultations were inspired by the 3 dimensions described in Parse&#x02019;s<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

The patients in the CopenHeart trial answered a questionnaire exploring their sleep quality at month 1 (before intervention) and month 6 (end of intervention). To explore the effect of other outcomes on sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and the severity of AF symptoms measured by the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) scores were examined at 4 months (end of the physical exercise program).</p></sec><sec><title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</title><p>Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Psychometric evaluation of the PSQI is limited, but studies indicate that it has overall high internal homogeneity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and its validity has been confirmed in various patient groups.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of .83 was demonstrated for internal consistency reliability, and validity was demonstrated as the PSQI distinguishes patients with a sleeping disorder from patients without one.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The self-rated questionnaire consists of 14 questions concerning factors that might influence sleep quality. Five additional questions are answered by the bed partner or roommate. From the 19 questions, 7 component scores are grouped, all weighted equally on a 0-to-3 scale. The components include subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness. From the 7 component scores, a global score can be calculated. The PSQI global score ranges from 0 to 21. High scores indicate poor sleep quality. Patients scoring higher than 5 on PSQI global are characterized as poor sleepers.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Patients were asked to fill out the questionnaire from usual sleep habits over the previous 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</title><p>Patients with symptoms of anxiety or depression were identified by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The HADS consist of 14 items on 2 subscales: an anxiety scale (HADS-A) and a depression scale (HADS-D), with each scale including 7 items. Each item is rated from 0 to 3 points. Seven is considered a cutoff score for each subscale, a score from 0 to 7 is considered normal, and scores of 8 or higher indicate the presence of a clinical mood disorder.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The HADS is extensively validated and recommended for use in cardiac patients.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> It is a generic instrument to identify patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Internal consistency is considered high, with a Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of .83 for HADS-A and .82 for HADS-D.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Differences between groups for baseline results for PSQI at 1 month were tested using independent samples <italic>t</italic> test for binary variables.

For example, in patients with heart failure, 63% report poor sleep quality that is associated with reduced cardiac event-free survival.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In AF specifically, sleep quality is poor in 50% to 55% of patients.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In this exploratory study, we examined sleep quality among AF patients being treated with ablation and who then participated in a randomized rehabilitation trial. There was no difference in sleep quality between the cardiac rehabilitation and usual care groups. However, 85% of all patients reported poor sleep quality at 1 month, and 55% reported poor sleep quality at 6 months. In comparison, the prevalence of poor sleep quality was found to be 38% in the general population in a large cross-sectional study in 2016.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The lack of difference in sleep quality found between the cardiac rehabilitation and usual care groups was also seen in a study including patients with an ICD.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We also found that more symptomatic patients experienced poorer sleep quality and patients with high scores for anxiety and depression experienced poorer sleep quality compared with patients with low scores regardless of type of AF.</p><p>It is notable that a high number of patients in this study reported low sleep quality even 6 months after ablation when most patients should be in sinus rhythm. Sleep quality has been reported to be low in other cardiac patient groups participating in cardiac rehabilitation for myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, or cardiac catheterization.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Depression is associated with poor sleep quality.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> According to the <italic>International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision</italic>, sleep disturbance is a symptom of depression<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and sleep disorder can be a predictor for depressive relapse, as well as sleep disturbances can lead to depression.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This is in line with the findings in this study where it was demonstrated that patients with high scores for depression had poor sleep quality.</p><p>We found that worse AF symptoms were associated with poor sleep quality. When comparing the EHRA and PSQI scores from this study with the results that Szymanski and colleagues<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reported, the same trend is observed in that patients with more AF symptoms experienced worse sleep quality. The relation between AF symptoms and sleep quality is multifactorial. Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increase in sympathetic activity that can produce symptoms and result in poor sleep quality.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Moreover, symptoms of AF, depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality are linked and mutually reinforcing.</p><p>These findings suggest that future interventions targeting sleep quality in patients with AF should include elements to decrease AF symptoms, depression, and anxiety. The intervention tested in the CopenHeart trial aimed at providing emotional support and improving coping skills and illness appraisal to enable patients to respond appropriately to physical and psychological symptoms. Therefore, we had hypothesized that the intervention could have an influence on sleep quality, as well as the primary and secondary outcomes. Our results suggest that, in addition to addressing negative emotions, it is important to directly address poor sleep quality as well.</p><p>In recent years, obstructive sleep apnea has been found to be a strong predictor of AF with up to 40% to 50% of AF patients experiencing obstructive sleep apnea.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Sleep apnea is associated with antidysrhythmic drug failures after cardioversion or catheter ablation, AF recurrence, and an increase of greater than 3-fold in ischemic stroke.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> A connection between obstructive sleep apnea and AF is associated with significant atrial remodeling that is characterized by atrial enlargement, reduction in voltage, site-specific and widespread conduction abnormalities, and longer sinus node recovery.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Rehabilitation programs that included diet and lifestyle management interventions for adults with obstructive sleep apnea have shown that lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing weight and therefore also improve obstructive sleep apnea parameters.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Screening for obstructive sleep apnea is not included in the PSQI; thus, it is not known how many of the patients in our study also experienced obstructive sleep apnea, but patients with a BMI of 25 and higher experienced more sleep disturbances in this study.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>These analyzes were explorative, meaning that the sample size calculation was done to examine an effect of the primary (physical capacity measured by VO<sub>2</sub> peak) and secondary (quality of life, measured on Short Form-36, Mental Component Scale) outcomes for the CopenHeart trial and not for the sleep analyses.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, the results should be considered as hypothesis generating for future trials. The PSQI has not been validated in an AF population, which is a limitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and Perspectives</title><p>The cardiac rehabilitation program in this study consisted of physical exercise and psychoeducational consultations. The program showed no effect on sleep quality. A large proportion of patients continued to report poor sleep quality regardless of group assignment. More symptomatic patients and patients experiencing higher levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms reported poor sleep quality. That is a concern because sleep quality is vital for a person&#x02019;s physical and mental health, and therefore it could be argued that screening for sleep quality should be prioritized by health professionals caring for patients with AF. Screening for depression or anxiety may benefit AF patients with poor sleep quality. Treatment for depression or anxiety can be offered with the aim of also improving the patients&#x02019; sleep quality. Patients with AF should be examined for sleep disorders and treated if needed. Intervention trials focusing on sleep quality in patients with AF or treated for AF are warranted to guide health professionals in supporting the patients to better sleep quality. Inspiration can be found in intervention trials that include patients with other heart conditions.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Trials of nonpharmacological interventions designed to improve sleep quality among patients with AF or treated for AF and interventions targeting both simple identification of sleep disorders and therapy directed against diseases such as sleep apnea are needed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>What&#x02019;s New and Important</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A cardiac rehabilitation program consisting of physical exercise and psychoeducational consultations showed no effect on sleep quality for patients treated with ablation for AF.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anxiety, depression, and symptoms of AF were associated with poor sleep quality for patients treated with ablation for AF and participating in cardiac rehabilitation.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>First of all, the authors thank the patients who were included in the CopenHeart RFA trial.
