Besides, in accordance with the relevant post instruction and assessment criteria, head nurses would carry out the assessment for these nurses per month to guarantee their homogeneity in nursing technique (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In the WeChat group, physician-in-charge, clinical pharmacist in Respiratory Department, and experts of pediatric asthma were also invited. At discharge, patients&#x02019; parents could join the WeChat group through scanning the quick response code (QR code) under the guidance of professional nurses. Following services would be provided by the WeChat group: a) Information push: Health education on asthma would be delivered in text, picture, audio or video to the parents twice a week, and changes in climate would also be delivered to the parents in a real-time manner; additionally, information on expert outpatient service was also promptly released weekly to circumvent the parents to waste time in visiting the experts; content that was pushed in the WeChat group was composed by professional nurses, and released only after the approval of head nurses of Respiratory Department or Pediatric Department. b) Online inquiry: Between 15:00 and 17:00, professional nurses would review the questions and proposals of patients&#x02019; parents, and professional answers would be given promptly; for questions that were difficult to answer, nurses would record and deliver them to the nurses, clinical pharmacists, head nurses and experts for discussion, and the parents who proposed these questions would receive the answer later. c) Interactions: Patients and their parents were encouraged to share the experience and feelings in nursing care of asthma. d) Questionnaire: In the WeChat group, Childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) would be released, and parents were asked to answer the questionnaire in accordance with the requirement online; thereafter, nurses would be aware of the practical control of asthma of patients through reviewing the answers using a terminal equipment, and reminded these patients under poor control to seek for medical treatment in time.</p></sec><sec><title>Telephone follow-up</title><p>For patients in the control group, telephone follow-up was performed only once within one week after discharge, aiming to comprehend the general condition of patients after discharge.

studied and defined by researchers ever since the 1980s. In 2001, Prossor et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) proposed 6 dimensions in the concept model of continuous care, and, in 2003, Haggerty et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) perfected the concept of continuous care on the basis of Freeman. In some countries, the pattern of continuous care has already been developed for a relatively long period, including the discharge-planning pattern (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and nursing care pattern in transitional period. With the development in medicine, patients proposed more and more stringent requirement on nursing care (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Ever since the continuous care has been applied in clinical practice, it has been providing more first-rate service for patients suffering from the chronic diseases, which has exhibited its increasingly important role (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Individual management of pediatric patient with asthma could reduce the acute onset of asthma and the number of hospitalization (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Bronchial asthma is a kind of chronic disease frequently seen in childhood with the characteristics of chronic airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsivenes, and mainly characterized by the clinical features such as recurrent wheeze, cough, short of breath and chest distress. Additionally, complicated pathogenesis, susceptibility to recurrence and a variety of complications are also its features. For pediatric asthma patients, failure in long-term control and recurrent inhospital treatment will severely affect the prognosis of patients (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), e.g. the incidence of some diseases such as emphysema and pulmonary atelectasis has a significant casual relationship with the asthma. Thus, long-term self-management is required after discharge, in which there are differences on education level and awareness of the disease, inhalation drugs, use of expiratory peak-velocimeter and compliance. Literatures also have reported that ideal efficacy can hardly be attained in control through single medication, and that the long-term inhalation treatment at home and proper nursing intervention can remarkably improve the compliance of asthma patients to the medication (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we carried out a series of activities in forms of WeChat group, telephone follow-up, health lecture of asthma and summer camp of pediatric asthma patients for 86 pediatric asthma patients to help the patients and their parents form a proper understanding on asthma, resolve the puzzles of patients in familial nursing care, and render specific support, which could compensate the insufficiency in knowledge of drug administration, diet and exercise of patients and their parents, and improve the compliance and normality in medication. Through guiding and urging the patients to record the condition of asthma, we enhanced the self-management abilities of patients and their parents. Additionally, the confidence to conquer the disease was also strengthened via negotiation and communication between the patients, parents, and parents and medical staff, which is conducive to integrating the patients into group life and alleviating the negative feelings. Through comparisons, we found that at the 12th month after discharge, the FEV1% and PEF% in the intervention group were significant improved in comparison with the control group (<italic>P&#x0003c;</italic>0.05), and the PAQLQ scores and C-ACT scores in the intervention group were also remarkably higher than those in the control group (<italic>P&#x0003c;</italic>0.05), indicating that continuous care can improve the patient&#x02019;s pulmonary functions and life quality, and effectively control the symptoms of asthma.</p><p>In this study, based on the individual management, five Three-A hospitals jointly carried out group management for pediatric asthma patients. During the management, how to improve the compliance of patient&#x02019; parents was the difficult point in this study. Thus, researchers, with the management form in other domains as model, adopted the merit points management in this study, in which they formulated the items and corresponding points. For example, in WeChat group, they put forward the <italic>check-in</italic> management system to remind the parents of the push information, and the points were given to the parents in following patterns: 1 point for 1 check-in; 3 points for participating in questionnaire; 5 points for sharing the nursing experience in WeChat group; 5 points for attending the health lecture; 5 points for attending the summer camp. Parents with 50 points or more would have free access to appointment with expert for once, and with 200 points or more would have free access to the examination of pulmonary function. Through the above measures, we aimed to promote the parents to participate actively in the activities, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In addition to the achievement that has been gained in major medical organizations, especially the Three-A hospitals, continuous care can correct the imbalance in current development of medical system in China, which will render major pediatric patients, particularly those with chronic diseases, the access to the high-quality nursing care at home, and reduce the pains of patients and burdens on the family. Thu, continuous care has a promising future in development.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues (Including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc.) have been completely observed by the authors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We received no funding support in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of Interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Paganelli</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Spinicci</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Giuli</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2008</year>). <article-title>ERMHAN: A Context-Aware Service Platform to Support Continuous Care Networks for Home-Based Assistance</article-title>. <source>Int J Telemed Appl</source>, <volume>2008</volume>: <fpage>867639</fpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>YL</given-names></name><name><surname>Xi</surname><given-names>XY</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>KX</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2015</year>). <article-title>Effect analysis of early bedside hemofiltration in treatment of severe pneumonia with acute renal failure of children</article-title>. <source>Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci</source>, <volume>19</volume>(<issue>24</issue>): <fpage>4795</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>4800</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26744871</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rehm</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2013</year>). <article-title>Nursing&#x02019;s contribution to research about parenting children with complex chronic conditions: an integrative review, 2002 to 2012</article-title>. <source>Nurs Outlook</source>, <volume>61</volume>(<issue>5</issue>): <fpage>266</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>290</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23809600</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Au</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><name><surname>Macaulay</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Jarvis</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>US</given-names></name><name><surname>Birnbaum</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2015</year>). <article-title>Impact of a telehealth and care management program for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</article-title>. <source>Ann Am Thorac Soc</source>, <volume>12</volume>(<issue>3</issue>): <fpage>323</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>331</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25642649</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nishima</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Furusho</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2003</year>). <article-title>New pediatric guideline for the treatment and management of bronchial asthma in Japan</article-title>. <source>Pediatr Int</source>, <volume>45</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>759</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>766</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14651560</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kvangarsnes</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Torheim</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Hole</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Ohlund</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2013</year>). <article-title>Intensive care unit nurses&#x02019;
