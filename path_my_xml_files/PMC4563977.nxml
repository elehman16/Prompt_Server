Patients with unwillingness for the procedure, coagulation or neurological disorders, septicemia, deformity or previous surgery of spine, morbid obesity, pregnancy and allergy to the study drug were excluded from the study. Informed written consent was taken from all the patients and were randomly divided into two groups of 50 each using a computer generated table of random numbers.</p><p>Group L (<italic>n</italic> = 50) received 2 ml of 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine (10 mg) plus 0.5 ml normal saline and group LF (<italic>n</italic> = 50) received 2 ml of 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine (10 mg) plus 0.5 ml fentanyl (25 &#x003bc;g) intrathecally. Total volume of the drug was kept constant as 2.5 ml in both groups to avoid bias during drug administration.</p><p>A day before surgery detailed preanaesthetic check-up was done. General physical examination along with proper systemic examination, assessment of airway and local examination of lumbar spine was done. Relevant investigations were reviewed. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was explained to the patients to determine the level of analgesia in the postoperative period. It was carried out with a 0&#x02013;10 cm line. The first end mark &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; means &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and the end marked &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; means &#x0201c;severe pain.&#x0201d; Patients were asked to restrict solids and fluids by mouth at least 6 h before surgery.</p><p>On the day of surgery, patients were shifted to operation theatre after giving injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly 45 min before surgery. Multipara monitor was attached and baseline respiratory rate, heart rate (HR), noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), peripheral oxygen saturation and electrocardiography (ECG) were recorded and continuous monitoring was started. Intravenous (IV) line was secured with 18 gauge intracath and injection midazolam 0.04 mg/kg body weight was given IV. Patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg body weight of Ringer lactate solution over 15&#x02013;20 min. Under all aseptic precautions, spinal anaesthesia was given in L3 and L4 space with 25 gauge or 26 gauge Quincke spinal needle via midline approach in lateral decubitus position. On free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, study drug was injected intrathecally. In group L, 2 ml of 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine plus 0.5 ml of normal saline and in group LF 2 ml of 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine plus 0.5 ml fentanyl (25 &#x003bc;g) was given. Study drug was prepared in similar syringes keeping the drug volume constant by an anesthesiologist, who then handed over the syringe to another anaesthesiologist who performed the spinal block and also monitored all the patient variables. Patients were immediately turned to supine position and oxygen was started at the rate of 6 L/min. Continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, HR, noninvasive SBP and DBP, SpO<sub>2</sub> and ECG was done at 0 min, 3 min and 5 min, then at an interval of every 5 min up to 30 min and then every 15 min till the end of surgery. Bradycardia (defined as HR &#x0003c;60 bpm) was treated with injection atropine sulphate 0.6 mg IV. Hypotension (defined as fall in SBP &#x0003e;20% from baseline) was treated with additional Ringer's lactate solution and injection ephedrine 5 mg IV titrated according to blood pressure.</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by loss of sensation to pin prick in the midline every 2 min for first 10 min and then at an interval of 5 min till no change in level occurred. Onset of sensory block (when patient does not feel pin prick at T10 level), highest level of sensory block achieved, time to maximum sensory block, regression of sensory block to T10 and total duration of sensory block (regression to S1 dermatome) was noted.</p><p>Motor block was assessed by using the modified Bromage scale,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] every 2 min up to 20 min and then at an interval of 10 min till the completion of surgery. Modified Bromage scale was taken as: 0 &#x02013; No paralysis: Able to flex hips/knees/ankles, 1 &#x02013; able to move knees, unable to raise extended legs, 2 &#x02013; able to flex ankles, unable to flex knees, 3 &#x02013; unable to move any part of limb &#x02013; complete block. Maximum motor block achieved, time to maximum motor block and total duration of motor block (motor recovery to Bromage [0] was noted. All parameters were noted by taking the time of giving the study drug intrathecally as time 0. Surgery was allowed to start when sensory block to T10 dermatome was achieved. During intraoperative period, if any patient felt pain then injection ketamine was given IV as supplementary analgesia. It was repeated twice and if adequate analgesia was not achieved then patients were given general anaesthesia and were excluded from the study. The quality of surgical analgesia was assessed and graded as: Excellent &#x02013; No supplementary drugs required, good &#x02013; Analgesic required, fair &#x02013; More than one analgesic required, poor &#x02013; General anesthesia required.</p><p>In the postoperative period, patients were monitored for haemodynamic parameters and postoperative using VAS score, every 15 min for 120 min, then half hourly for 180 min, hourly for 12 h and thereafter every 3 hourly till 24 h of surgery in both groups. Rescue analgesia in the form of injection diclofenac 75 mg or if needed injection tramadol hydrochloride intramuscularly was given when VAS &#x0003e;3 in both groups. Time at which patient demanded first dose of rescue analgesia was taken as total duration of analgesia. Number of doses of rescue analgesia required in the postoperative period was also noted. Patients were monitored for any side effects or complications like hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, sedation, urinary retention, pruritis, headache, backache and neurological changes for 24 h.</p><p>At the end of the study, patient satisfaction score was generated by general questioning of the patients regarding their experience of anesthesia during intra- and post-operative period. It was analyzed as: 5 &#x02013; Very satisfied, 4 &#x02013; satisfied, 3 &#x02013; neutral, 2 &#x02013; dissatisfied, 1 &#x02013; very dissatisfied.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Power analysis was done.

It produces localized anesthesia by blocking the transmission of action potential in sensory, motor and sympathetic nerve fibers, by inhibiting the passage of sodium through voltage sensitive ion channels in the neuronal membrane.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The duration of action of levobupivacaine is dose dependent and it was found that 10 mg is the minimum dose for effective sensory and motor block in spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Intrathecal opioids as an adjuvant to low dose local anesthetics, produces a synergistic effect by acting directly on the opioid receptors in the spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Fentanyl, stimulates both &#x003bc;1 and &#x003bc;2 receptors and potentiates the afferent sensory blockade.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Studies reported that addition of 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl to LA improves anesthesia quality and prolongs postoperative analgesia without prolonging the time to void.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Inspired by the above findings, we selected 10 mg dose of levobupivacaine and compared it with 10 mg levobupivacaine plus 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl given intrathecally for spinal block characteristics.</p><p>The results of the present study demonstrated that addition of fentanyl to levobupivacaine improves the sensory and motor block characteristics, prolongs postoperative analgesia with decreased requirement of rescue analgesics in the postoperative period, without increasing the incidence of side effect and complications.</p><p>In the present study, time to onset of sensory block and the time to achieve maximum sensory and motor block was more rapid, the duration of sensory and motor block and postoperative analgesia was more prolonged in levobupivacaine and fentanyl group as compared to plain levobupivacaine group. Maximum sensory level in group L was T8 and in group LF was T6 dermatome but the maximum motor block was Bromage 2 in both groups. Requirement of postoperative rescue analgesics was also less in group LF.</p><p>Ozyilkan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] compared 2.2 ml of levobupivacaine plain with 10 &#x003bc;g fentanyl or 2.5 &#x003bc;g sufentanil as adjuvant in spinal anesthesia for caesarean section. Onset of sensory and motor block was achieved more rapidly in fentanyl and sufentanil group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Duration of sensory and motor block and time for first analgesic requirement was longer in adjuvant groups as compared to plain group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Akan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] while using 10 mg plain levobupivacaine and comparing it with 7.5 mg levobupivacaine plus 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl and 7.5 mg levobupivacaine plus 2.5 &#x003bc;g sufentanil in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate under spinal anaesthesia concluded that combining lower doses of levobupivacaine with fentanyl and sufentanil provides faster onset of sensory block, lower frequency and shorter duration of motor block and prolonged analgesia time. However in the present study, motor block duration was prolonged in group LF as compared to group L. This difference might be due to the use of equal doses of levobupivacaine in both groups. Cuvas <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also added 15 &#x003bc;g fentanyl to lower dose of levobupivacaine 2.3 ml and compared it with 2.5 ml of plain levobupivacaine. The time to onset of sensory and motor block, regression of sensory block to S1 was similar in both groups. Duration of motor block was shorter in fentanyl group. Again the dose of levobupivacaine used was less in this group. Addition of fentanyl to levobupivacaine resulted in higher sensory level (T6) as compared to plain levobupivacaine (T9) which was almost similar to the findings of the present study (T6 in group LF and T8 in group L). The difference in the level of sensory block in both the groups can be explained by the difference in the baricity of the injected solutions. Opioids are hypobaric and when added to hypobaric LA will make the mixture more hypobaric thus altering the density of resulting solution which effects the direction and extent of spread in spinal block. Girgin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] while using 5 mg levobupivacaine plus 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl and 7.5 mg levobupivacaine plain demonstrated that maximum sensory level was T7 and T6 respectively; however the maximum motor block achieved was Bromage 2 in both groups. In this study maximum sensory level achieved was lower in combination group which might be due to the low dose of levobupivacaine used in this group.</p><p>Heart rate and blood pressure remained stable and comparable in both the groups intraoperatively as well as postoperatively. Bradycardia was observed in 5 (10%) patients in group LF and 2 (4%) patients in group L and hypotension was seen in 4 (8%) patients in group L and 6 (12%) patients in group LF. Similar findings were reported by a previous study, where incidence of bradycardia was 15% when 10 mg of levobupivacaine was given intrathecally.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Chattopadhyay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] concluded that addition of fentanyl to levobupivacaine does not increase the incidence of bradycardia. Akan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] also concluded that there was no significant difference in the mean heart and blood pressure in plain levobupivacaine group and levobupivacaine plus fentanyl group. Similar results were reported by Cuvas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The most common side effect observed with intrathecal fentanyl was pruritus which was observed in 4 (8%) patients in group LF and none in group L (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). Pruritus as a side effect of intrathecal fentanyl was reported by previous studies also.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Second most commonly occurring side effect of spinal anaesthesia is delayed micturition. With addition of 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl to 5 mg levobupivacaine, Girgin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] did not reported urinary retention in any patient. In the present study, only 3 (6%) patients in group LF and none of the patient in group L had delayed micturition but the difference was statistically nonsignificant. No other side effect and complications were observed in both the groups. Patients were satisfied with the surgical analgesia and postoperative analgesia in both the groups. Similar patient satisfaction scores were reported by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Cuvas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Limitation of our study was that we did not compare the two groups for achieving home discharge criteria. Hence, we were not able to evaluate the effect of fentanyl added to levobupivacaine on the recovery profile of patients from spinal block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both regimes were effective in providing surgical anaesthesia and haemodynamic stability, but group LF offered an advantage of rapid onset of sensory and motor block and prolonged duration of sensory block and postoperative analgesia, thus decreasing the doses of rescue analgesia in the postoperative period. However, prolonged motor block was unwanted as it delays early ambulation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
