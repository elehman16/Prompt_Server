However, there is no proven effective and safe treatment. Although Chinese herbal medicine is widely used in the treatment of acute pharyngitis, there is a lack of evidence-based data. Despite several clinical trials conducted in this setting, no randomized placebo-controlled trial has been performed to date. This trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of Qi-Wei-Qing-Yan aerosol (QWQYA), a Chinese herbal prescription, compared with a placebo aerosol in the treatment of acute pharyngitis with lung-stomach excess-heat syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 420 adult patients, of either sex, with acute pharyngitis will be enrolled from seven study sites across China. All patients will be randomly allocated to one of three parallel treatment groups: (1) QWQYA with the current propellant, (2) QWQYA with a previous propellant, and (3) the placebo aerosol with the current propellant. The study medication will be administered into the pharyngeal region in three sprays thrice daily for 5 consecutive days. The primary outcome measures are time to complete resolution of sore throat and relief rate of sore throat. Secondary outcome measures include resolution rate of sore throat, time to relief of sore throat, intensity of sore throat, and change of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score and clinical signs score from baseline to post-treatment, as well as the occurrence of any adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This will be the first clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of QWQYA in the treatment of acute pharyngitis in an adult population in a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled manner. Not only might it establish the basis for the efficacy and safety of QWQYA in treating acute pharyngitis, but it might also provide evidence to support the use of Chinese herbal medicine in treating acute pharyngitis and thus support an alternative treatment option for management of acute pharyngitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=10454">ChiCTR-IPR-15005991</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>acute pharyngitis</kwd><kwd>Qi-Wei-Qing-Yan aerosol</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>sore throat</kwd><kwd>traditional Chinese medicine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Acute pharyngitis is characterized by an inflammation of mucous membranes of the pharynx and the surrounding lymphoid tissue and accounts for an estimated 15 million patient visits in 2006 in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is commonly caused by various viral or bacterial infections. Viruses are the most common cause, accounting for up to 40&#x000a0;% to 60&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most common type of bacterial infection is group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection, which is responsible for around one-third of pediatric pharyngitis but only 5&#x000a0;% to 10&#x000a0;% of adult pharyngitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An acute onset of sore throat is the predominant symptom, accounting for more than 10&#x000a0;% of all primary care visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Antibiotics are indicated to prevent suppurative complications and rheumatic fever, and decrease infectivity, but may only provide limited benefit in the resolution of symptoms, shortening sore throat duration by less than 1&#x000a0;day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, excessive or inappropriate use of antibiotics may be associated with the potential side effects, increased antibacterial drug resistance, and high medical costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given that the majority of cases are caused by viral pathogens, the current treatment strategy in adults focuses on the relief of symptoms, particularly sore throat. Corticosteroids may reduce the severity and duration of pain, but corticosteroids alone should not be administered as routine treatment, owing to potential side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce sore throat pain in 24&#x000a0;hours but are associated with gastrointestinal, renal, or hepatic adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although gargles or lozenges with local anaesthetic also provide sore throat pain relief, the effect is short-lived or temporary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Owing to a lack of proven effective and safe therapies in Western medicine, an increasing number of patients turn to complementary and alternative medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], including traditional Chinese medicine, for relief of symptoms of acute pharyngitis. In traditional Chinese medicinal theory, acute pharyngitis falls into the disease category of pharyngitis (houbi in Chinese Pinyin), and is mainly caused by external causes, including wind and heat. Based on traditional Chinese medicinal clinical practice, wind-heat syndrome and lung-stomach excess-heat syndrome are the most common syndromes. Of these, lung-stomach excess-heat syndrome is more common in patients, with underlying heat in the lungs and stomach, and is primarily characterized by sore throat, cough, dryness of throat, thirst, and fever. The general traditional Chinese medicinal therapeutic principle is to clear away heat and toxins, and to relieve the sore throat.</p><p>Although traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used in China for the treatment of acute pharyngitis for thousands of years, Chinese herbal medicine is not recommended for use as an effective therapy, owing to the lack of high-quality clinical trials in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Qi-Wei-Qing-Yan aerosol (QWQYA) is a registered herbal prescription in China and manufactured by Shandong Bencao Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Shandong, China). Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists the detailed formula. Despite the use of QWQYA in acute pharyngitis for several years, its efficacy has never been investigated through a placebo-controlled trial. Moreover, dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), the previous propellant of QWQYA, has gradually been banned by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China, owing to its ozone-depleting properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Alternatively, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) is used as the current aerosol propellant, owing to its negligible ozone depletion potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Accordingly, the safety of QWQYA with the current aerosol propellant remains unknown.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Formula of Qi-Wei-Qing-Yan aerosol</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Pinyin name</th><th>Botanical or zoological authority</th><th>Family name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shandougen</td><td>

Original case report forms and any other records will be kept on file at each study site for 5&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Interim analyses will not be performed, as the investigational product is a registered and clinically used aerosol and the study is scheduled to last for approximately 6&#x000a0;months. An independent data monitoring committee will be set up to monitor patient safety and treatment efficacy data. Moreover, a monthly progress report on enrollment, recruitment, study participations, safety, and completion will be issued to the principal investigator. The regulatory authority at each study site and auditors independent of the investigators and sponsor will conduct a monthly audit, including, but not limited to, trial procedure and compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, code of Good Clinical Practice, and the applicable regulatory requirements. Any observation or finding should be documented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Adverse event reporting</title><p>An adverse event will be defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study medication. All adverse events will be recorded in detail, including event, date of occurrence, grade, whether expected or unexpected, date resolved, and treatment patients receive specifically related to the event, and will be categorized as clearly not, doubtfully, may be, likely, or clearly related to the study medication. A serious adverse event will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other important medical event. Other events that are not likely to result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization, might be considered as serious adverse event if the event might jeopardize the patient and might require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</p><p>Medically qualified investigators will record, assess, and report adverse events. Non-serious adverse events will be recorded in case report forms, and listed in a monthly progress report to the principal investigator and sponsor. Serious adverse events must be reported to the institutional review board, principal investigator, sponsor, and the Drug Registration Division of China&#x02019;s State Food and Drug Administration and Research within 24&#x000a0;hours. The blinding procedures will be broken in case of a medical emergency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated on the basis of the two primary outcomes, using &#x02018;Non-inferiority tests for two proportions [differences]&#x02019; in PASS 11.0. Based on a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the mean time to complete resolution of sore throat in both active treatments was similar, both with a standard deviation of 2.2&#x000a0;days. A difference of 1&#x000a0;day or more between groups was regarded a clinically important effect. Setting a one-sided <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of 0.05 and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> of 0.1, the sample size was estimated to be 84 cases for each group. Based on consultation with clinical experts and a preliminary unpublished study provided by the sponsor, the relief rate of sore throat in QWQYA with previous propellant was estimated at 91&#x000a0;%, with a difference of 10&#x000a0;% or more considered clinically significant. The sample size was estimated at 118 participants for each group, assuming a one-sided <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of 0.05 and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> of 0.15.

Participants with impaired decision-making capacity who might have difficulty weighing the risks and benefits of the study will be excluded from this study.

Moreover, each patient will be identified with a unique identity without any other personal identifier for purposes of maintaining confidentiality. This study protocol has been prepared according to the SPIRIT checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, chest X-rays will be obtained in selecting eligible participants, to exclude patients with lower respiratory tract infection, and a urine pregnancy test (strip) will be used to detect early suspected or unknown pregnancy in women with child-bearing potential.</p><p>A preliminary study (an unpublished observation by Professor Jia Miao) suggests that QWQYA might be associated with a risk of mild reduction of heart rate within normal range. However, another two trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] did not find any such association. In this study, myocardial markers will be tested and electrocardiography will be performed in potential participants, and a detailed history will be taken, to exclude those with an underlying heart disease. In addition, the test of myocardial markers and electrocardiography will be performed again after treatment to monitor participants for potential adverse effects.</p><p>The results of this study will be presented at national or international conferences and submitted to peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of 12 randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine for sore throat found that trials in this area were methodologically of poor quality, with controversial and questionable evidence of efficacy. Moreover, the randomized controlled trials included in this review and trials conducted thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] all used a &#x02018;positive effect drug&#x02019; as a control, comparing the Chinese herbal medicine under investigation with another Chinese herbal medicine or a Western medicine. However, the efficacy of these &#x02018;positive effect drugs&#x02019; has not yet been well established. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Chinese herbal medicine designed to treat acute pharyngitis in an adult population. Not only might it establish the basis for the efficacy and safety of QWQYA in the treatment of acute pharyngitis, but it might also provide evidence regarding Chinese herbal medicine for treating acute pharyngitis and an alternative treatment option for the management of acute pharyngitis.</p><p>This trial is placebo-controlled and focuses on viral pharyngitis in adults. Although it is not always easy to distinguish viral from bacterial causes, laboratory confirmation of bacteria, including a rapid antigen detection test and throat culture is not indicated and recommended in adults with a lower likelihood of GABHS infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this trial, Centor criteria (a history of fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, and lack of cough) will be applied to exclude patients with potential GABHS pharyngitis, with the absence of three or four of the criteria indicating a negative predictive value of more than 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>It is well-known that the gold standard for assessing the efficacy of specific intervention is a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Ideally, a placebo should be an inactive substance that is pharmacodynamically inert. However, it is significantly difficult to develop appropriate placebos, in terms of smell, taste, and color, in clinical trials of herbal medicine especially those of compound formula in a liquid form. To our knowledge, no validated placebo of Chinese herbal medicine has been developed in the setting of acute pharyngitis. Moreover, several clinical trials outside the setting of acute pharyngitis have applied 10&#x02013;20 times dilutions of active herbs as placebos in China and Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this trial, one-twentieth of the total dose of active solution is used as the placebo, since it is assumed to be unlikely that a tiny amount of 14.4&#x000a0;mg per day could be an effective treatment. Both the active aerosols and the placebo aerosol are issued in bottles identical in size, shape, and color, to ensure appropriate blinding. In addition, participants are required not to communicate with each other, to minimize the possibility of revealing differences between the placebo and active medication.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is preparing for patient recruitment at the time of manuscript submission.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GABHS</term><def><p>Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QWQYA</term><def><p>Qi-Wei-Qing-Yan aerosol</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HLJ participated in the design and development of the study protocol, and drafted the initial manuscript.
