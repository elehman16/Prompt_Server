Considering the proven immunomodulatory effects of oral simvastatin in psoriasis, this trial study was enrolled to determine whether the topical form has also antipsoriatic effects. Vitamin D analogs known to be effective and are considered the first line of therapy in mild to moderate cases. In this study, the efficacy of topical calcipotriol 0.005% ointment (as a standard method of treatment for psoriasis) versus combination of calcipotriol plus topical simvastatin is compared in the treatment of psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 80 subjects with symmetric psoriasis who had body surface involvement up to 20% were divided randomly into 2 groups. Group A were treated with calcipotriol 0.005% ointment twice daily and Group B with calcipotriol 0.005% ointment twice daily and simvastatin 3% ointment twice daily for 12 weeks. The results were evaluated by a Blind Dermatologist using psoriasis area severity index (PASI) score at baseline, 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> week of treatment.

The world-wide estimated prevalence of this common skin disease is around 2%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Regarding the effectiveness and safety of topical calcipotriol, this drug has been become the first line therapy for mild to moderate cases of psoriasis since 1990.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the efficacy of calcipotriol remains modest.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The advent of biological medications in the area of psoriasis treatment, have led to the development of investigations on the drugs that play role in modulating of cytokines.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] With clarification of the immunomodulatory aspect of statins besides antihyperlipidemic effects,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] several studies on the potential aspect of oral simvastatin in the treatment of psoriasis have been carried out.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Due to the fact that psoriasis is a dermatologic disease, there is a common predilection to conduct surveys on topical therapies that are effective, safe and inexpensive. In spite of the confirmed effectiveness of oral simvastatin in the treatment of psoriasis, data in favor of the anti-inflammatory and wound healing potentials of the topical application of simvastatin has been confirmed.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Taken together, by incorporation of simvastatin in ointment formulation, a topical form of the drug is formed.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The goal of the current study was thus to determine if the combination of topical simvastatin with calcipotriene is more effective than calcipotriene alone in patients with psoriasis. Both have no significant adverse effects. Furthermore, the sample size was large to reach the conclusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized, controlled trial was conducted on patients with psoriasis referring to the outpatient Department of Dermatology of Azahra Teaching Hospital in Isfahan (Iran), during March 2012 to December 2012. Patients included to in this study were subjects of 20-60 years old, with mild to moderate psoriasis. Patients should have had less than 20% of the involved body surface, with plaque size greater than 2 cm &#x000d7; 2 cm, but lesser than 15 cm &#x000d7; 15 cm. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Research project number was 9028.</p><p>Patients with a current diagnosis of unstable or pustular psoriasis, only involvement of scalp, nail, flexural or palmoplantar areas, pregnancy and breast feeding, impaired kidney function and allergy to the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> analogs were excluded from the study.</p><p>Apart from the predictable association of psoriasis with obesity and metabolic syndrome, a detailed history was taken from each patient regarding involved or deteriorating factors (Bacterial infections, human immunodeficiency virus infection, pregnancy, hypocalcemia and causative drug consumption including terbinafine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-malarias, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lithium, interferon [IFN] and beta blockers).</p><p>With regard to type I error (alpha) = 0.05, study power = 80% and expected difference of 30% in response rate, sample size was calculated as 40 subjects in each group. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Research project number was 9028.</p><p>After initial screening visit, this double-blind clinical trial was initiated with 80 eligible subjects (aged 20-58 years). Patients were divided into two different treatment groups, using a table of random numbers. Finally, 71 patients with plaques of psoriasis sized greater than 2 cm &#x000d7; 2 cm, lesser than 15 cm &#x000d7; 15 cm on their bodies completed treatment modality. 4 subjects excluded from the study due to aggravation of lesions and 5 subjects were not willing to complete the study.</p><p>In each group, 40 patients for 12 weeks of treatment were enrolled in the study. All patients of 2 groups have been received calcipotriol 0.005% ointment (Psoriament 50 MCG/G 30G Oint; Aburaihan Co, Iran) twice daily in the morning and before sleeping. In addition, patients in Group B received have been received simvastatin 3% ointment twice daily.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Patients were advised to report the occurrence of any unwilling adverse effects (redness, burning, itching and erosion) during the 12 weeks of the study.</p><p>Evaluation of improvement and side-effects were conducted at baseline and 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> week of treatment. In each visit, digital photographs were taken by a facial photo fixture using a Canon Power shot G12 stand-off camera.</p><p>The improvement scoring system based on changes in erythema, induration and scaling was conducted through psoriasis area and severity index (PASI).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] PASI as an accepted benchmark for clinical research study of psoriasis is considered for evaluation of results of any treatment modality in psoriasis. However, it is not commonly used in the daily management of patients in the clinical setting.</p><p>In order to evaluate patient satisfaction surveys, assessment of the treatment areas using comparative photographs were conducted by patient based satisfaction and 12 weeks after starting of treatment (Patient Global Assessment). The improvement was scored from 0 to 10 by a visual analog scale (0 as no improvement and 10 as the best possible improvement).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>A consort diagram was provided [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] and the statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS for Windows software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, version 18.0) by using Chi-square, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, ANCOVA and repeated measures ANOVA analyses.

Among 6 subjects complained of mild irritation in Group A, 4 subjects reported involvement in the facial region. By comparison, 5 subjects reported mild burning in Group B with 4 of them were related to the facial region. However, overall tolerability was good and nobody gave up the study in both groups due to side-effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Psoriasis, a common papulosquamous disorder responds to therapy with fluctuating results.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although, topical vitamin D analogs including calcipotriol and topical corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the overall outcome still remains modest.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Indeed, a request for finding a cheap, safe and common treatment is without cease.</p><p>For decades psoriasis has been considered an epidermal disease. With the advent of vitamin D analogs in the early 1990s, a revolution occurred in the treatment of psoriasis with drugs those have limited toxicity rather than corticosteroids. However, the former drugs including calcipotriol mainly regulate proliferation and differentiation of the keratinocytes.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Following the success in the cognition of the role of immune factors in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, psoriasis is now considered a polygenic disease with both impairment of immune function and keratinocyte biology.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In the immunopathogenesis model, psoriasis is considered a Th1-mediated disease.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Moreover, NK T cells, neutrophils and nitric oxide are more expressed in psoriatic plaques.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] IFN-&#x003b3;, which is released by both T cells and NK cells, by activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription factor family, induce the more accumulation of T cells and nitric oxide expression.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Other than inhibiting of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A, other interesting mechanisms by which statins are therapeutic are anti-inflammatory properties. By means of flow cytometry, it was shown that simvastatin are direct inhibitors of IFN-&#x003b3;.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Furthermore, statins down-regulates the expression of adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, on leucocytes and endothelial cells.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] By binding to LFA-1, the LFA/ICAM interaction inhibited.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Moreover, considering psoriasis as a Th1 disease with overproduction of IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3;, statins shift Th1/Th2 balance.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In the present study to our knowledge, we provide the first clinical evidence that measures quantitatively the effectiveness of topical simvastatin in the treatment of psoriasis. Since, the effectiveness of topical calcipotriol as the first line of therapy in mild to moderate psoriasis has been confirmed, both groups received calcipotriol. By adding topical simvastatin to the subjects of Group B, the efficacy of combination therapy (including calcipotriol and topical simvastatin) in comparison of mono-therapy (including calcipotriol) has become measurable.</p><p>Calcipotriol included among the most noticeable approaches for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. The reduced PASI value for topical calcipotriol in literature was near 60%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Juxtaposition of the results of the Group A (reflecting only the effect of calcipotriol) and the findings of the literature, figures an incredible compatibility.</p><p>Previous studies focused on the effectiveness of combination of calcipotriol and corticosteroid in the treatment of psoriasis. Fenton and Plosker showed that up to 4 weeks of therapy with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate provides an effective and well tolerated treatment. This paper emphasized on the long term safety of this combination.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Recently, in another study by Feldman <italic>et al</italic>. foam formulation of calcipotriol was safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis for up to 8 weeks.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In our study, despite the more rapid reduction in PASI score in patients of Group B at the end of 4<sup>th</sup> week of treatment, the rate of improvement at the end of the study was not significant.</p><p>Wolkenstein <italic>et al</italic>. has noticed the diminished risk of psoriasis associated with statin intake.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In another study Naseri <italic>et al</italic>., evaluated the efficacy of oral simvastatin on improvement of psoriasis.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This paper has shown significantly more reduction of PASI score in the group received oral simvastatin compared to group who did not (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In comparison to aforementioned studies on the beneficial impact of oral simvastatin in psoriasis, the number of patients with remarkable response in our study was not significant. This difference in response could reflect the fact that psoriasis is a systemic disorder with dermatologic manifestation. In overview of immunorelated mechanisms that play the role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, investigators noticed that even associated findings such as obesity mirrored underlying inflammatory base.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In other words; topical treatment in such condition is not as effective as systemic form.</p><p>Considering the studies that confirmed the effectiveness of topical statins in the treatment of dermatologic disorders are limited to local conditions such as contact dermatitis and wound healing.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>However, many patients still consider psoriasis only a dermatologic disorder. With the advent of nanoparticle preparation of topical drugs in solid lipid nanoparticles, a topical form of the drug with more bioavailability is formed.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Despite the fact that the bioavailability, even more than oral form is predictable by the nanoparticle loaded preparations according to past pharmaceutical surveys,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] no clinical trial study in the treatment of psoriasis has not recruited to date. With regard to insignificant results of the common topical form of simvastatin in the treatment of psoriasis, in future studies the effectiveness of topical form of statins, should be followed in the nanoparticle loaded preparations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold>
