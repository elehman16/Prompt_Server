Based on an epidemiology survey of cerebrovascular disease conducted in 7 cities and 21 rural provinces in China, morbidity, mortality, and point prevalence was 219, 116, and 719 per 10 million in cities, and 185, 142, and 394 per 10 million in rural areas, respectively. Prevalence of patients with new-onset of stroke was estimated to be approximately 2 million, while nearly 1.5 million die of cerebrovascular disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Compared to developed countries, in China and many developing countries, stroke is the predominant form of cardiovascular disease and the incidence of both ischemic and of hemorrhagic stroke exceeds the incidence of ischemic heart disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Blood pressure (BP) is the most consistent and powerful predictor of stroke. This is further supported by the fact that population mortality trends for stroke parallel those for hypertension.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In China, hypertension is the most important risk factor. A meta-analysis of 12 epidemiological studies with 2379 stroke cases confirmed that the overall relative risk of stroke associated with hypertension was 5.43.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> In the INTERSTROKE study, self-reported history of hypertension was a significant risk factor for stroke, accounting for close to 50% of population at risk.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Guidelines recommend that for patients with hypertension and stroke, BP should be &#x0003c;140/90&#x0200a;mm Hg.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can effectively control BP and reduce the incidence of stroke and hypertension associated with diabetes and atrial fibrillation; therefore, an ARB is recommended as a first-line treatment for stroke prevention in patients with hypertension.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Long-term use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) was effective in reducing BP steadily, thereby helping to prevent atherosclerosis.

Patients were categorized into 3 subgroups based on stroke subtype, namely, hemorrhagic, ischemic, or mixed stroke. All patients were administered Val/Aml (80/5&#x0200a;mg) SPC. Patients on antihypertensive therapy [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), CCBs, diuretics, or &#x003b2;-blockers] and those with diabetes or renal insufficiency were included. Patients were prescribed Val/Aml SPC based on the clinical judgment of the investigators according to the patient's condition and taking into consideration the package insert. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients before study enrollment. Patients were excluded if they had any conditions that precluded administration of the drug based on the investigator's discretion.

In addition, ESC/ESH 2013 guidelines recommend initiation of combination therapy containing agents with complementary mechanisms of action (e.g., renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers such as ACEIs or ARBs with CCBs and/or diuretics) in patients with markedly high baseline BP or at high cardiovascular risk. Further, SPCs are recommended as they improve compliance in patients with hypertension, usually with low adherence, thereby increasing rates of BP control and ultimately, leading to cardiovascular benefits of BP lowering.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>In a meta-analysis of 9 randomized clinical trials comparing antihypertensive therapies in 62,605 patients, CCBs provided more reduction in the risk of stroke compared to other classes.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Similar results suggesting that CCBs may have a slightly greater effectiveness on stroke prevention have also been reported by other meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> From experimental studies, the protective effects of CCBs on stroke might be explained by a specific role of intracellular calcium in triggering ischemic cell death. CCBs block the central neuronal calcium influx, thus reducing ischemic injury and necrosis of neurons in the ischemic brain area.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> ARBs have also been reported to have greater cerebrovascular protective effects versus other drugs in randomized controlled trials and this was further confirmed by a meta-analysis of &#x0223c;50,000 patients, where treatment with ARBs was associated with a significant reduction of stroke risk (&#x0223c;8%) compared with ACEIs.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> ARBs exert their beneficial effects on BP lowering, cardiovascular remodeling, and stroke prevention by selectively blocking the angiotensin I receptors and allowing angiotensin II to stimulate the unoccupied angiotensin 2 receptors. This dual effect of ARBs may explain their superiority over ACEIs in stroke protection.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup></p><p>Previous randomized clinical trials have reported significant BP-lowering effects of the Val/Aml combination therapy in patients with hypertension,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> including Chinese patients with hypertension inadequately controlled by Val or Aml monotherapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> Further, patients using valsartan-based SPCs are significantly more likely to achieve their BP goal than those treated with ARB-based free combinations in real-world clinical practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> In a recent real-world study in Chinese patients with uncontrolled hypertension and a history of stroke, initial dual combination therapy during the first 6 months reduced stroke incidence to a greater extent than monotherapy. Also, initial therapy and maintenance therapy were mainly CCB-based (alone or in combination), and ARB/CCB combination was the dominant therapy after medication switching in patients taking combination therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> CCBs and ARBs were the most common antihypertensive drugs in our study population. In a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs in 20,451 hypertensive patients, ACEI/ARB plus CCB combination therapy was superior to other combinations in lowering the incidence of cardiovascular events, including stroke.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> Based on the above evidence, ARB/CCB combination has the potential to reduce the risk of stroke.</p><p>The neuroprotective effect of ARBs and CCBs has been shown in a few studies. In the LIFE study conducted in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, losartan significantly reduced the rate of fatal and nonfatal stroke by 25%.<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> In the SCOPE study in elderly patients, candesartan-based treatment reduced nonfatal stroke by 30% and all stroke by 24% versus placebo.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> In the ASCOT study, Aml reduced fatal and nonfatal stroke better than atenolol.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Nitrendipine-based treatment reduced the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke in elderly Chinese patients with isolated systolic hypertension.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> An analysis of 6 actively controlled studies with Aml-based treatment showed that Aml provided more protection against stroke than other antihypertensive agent.<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup> Our results show that Val/Aml SPC resulted in significant BP reductions from baseline and high BP control rates at week 8 across all stroke subtypes in patients with hypertension. The above evidence demonstrating the protective effects of Val- or Aml-based therapies against stroke, coupled with the greater BP-lowering efficacy of Val/Aml combination than either monotherapy in several studies, suggest that this combination might be an effective approach for stroke protection and prevention.</p><p>To name a few study limitations, there was no washout period in this study. The addition of treatments at week 4 might have influenced effectiveness of Val/Aml at week 8, and this impact has not been determined. Moreover, lack of a comparable group in the study introduces the potential for selection bias, which precludes generalization of the results to the entire population.</p><p>The major study limitation is the nonrandomized, open-label, single-arm design, which does not allow the comparison between treatment arm and control arm. However this study represents actual clinical practice. And it is still possible to evaluate the BP change in real world setting. A patient was prescribed the Val/Aml SPC based on the clinical judgment of the investigators. And then after 4 weeks the additional treatment was adopted when BP was not controlled at 4 weeks. Changes in MSSBP and MSDBP from baseline to week 4 and week 8 were observed. Val/Aml SPC resulted in significant overall MSSBP/MSDBP reductions from baseline to week 4 and week 8, respectively.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present findings of the China Status II study post hoc analysis confirmed the effectiveness of Val/Aml (80/5&#x0200a;mg) SPC in achieving BP control and its tolerability in Chinese hypertensive patients with hemorrhagic, ischemic, or mixed stroke, in whom BP was inadequately controlled by antihypertensive monotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Writing support was provided by Parvathy Ramakrishnan from Novartis Healthcare Private Limited, India.
