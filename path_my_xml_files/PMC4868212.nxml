program on the walking and balance abilities of stroke patients using an up-to-date
walking analysis device. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of this study were 12 adults
who were diagnosed with stroke. Evaluation was conducted using the Smart Step test for
walking ability; (BBS) for balance ability; and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) for
functional mobility and movement ability. The 12 stroke patients were randomly recruited
and divided into two groups; an experimental group which performed circuit training with
obstacles, and a control group which performed flat gait training). [Results]
Between-group comparison of the change in the 10-m walking speed found a statistically
significant difference between the two groups. Between-group comparison of the changes in
BBS and TUG found statistically significant differences between the two groups.
[Conclusion] The circuit training program using obstacles had a positive effect on the
gait and balance abilities of the stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Task circuit program</kwd><kwd>Obstacles</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a major reason for disability in adults. It results in weakening of the muscles,
reducing victims&#x02019; balance and mobility<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stroke not only has a negative impact on left and right symmetry due to asymmetric posture,
but also decreases the stride length of the non-paretic side, as the patients cannot use the
ground reaction force effectively. Moreover, this decrease in stride length results in a
slower walking cycle and walking speed. Because of this abnormal walking, patients with
stroke tend to show an inefficient walking pattern that requires large energy consumption
during walking<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In patients with stroke, approximately 61&#x02013;80% of total weight is borne on the unaffected
lower limb in standing position due to the weakened muscle strength of the paretic upper and
lower limbs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The center of the body
shifts to the unaffected side, and the ability to maintain balance decreases because a
symmetric weight shift does not take place under conditions of external perturbation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of postural disturbance,
abnormal muscle mobilization is caused, and the endurance necessary for weight-bearing
decreases, which makes it hard for the patient to maintain his or her posture<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Asymmetric body alignment of the affected
and unaffected sides results in diminishing balance ability; as a secondary effect, it also
increases the risk of falling<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diverse therapeutic methods have been used to enhance the walking and balance abilities of
patients with stroke. Bayouk et al. argued that exercise using tasks is effective at
enhancing balance and mobility<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover,
Taube et al. reported that weighy-shift training on an unstable surface had significant
effects on the balance and postural control of patients with stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Said et al. reported that obstacle training had a
significant impact on walking and balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, stroke patients&#x02019; and it has also been reported that diverse afferent
stimuli and functional activities help to improve the ability to perform daily life
activities<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In walking and balance training, a circuit training program using obstacles should have
positive effects not only on level walking within the treatment room, but also on patients&#x02019;
ability to respond to environmental demands related to daily life, before they return to
community living. Moreover, repetitive performance of tasks on diverse and unstable surfaces
should help patients to maintain psychological stability. Previous studies mainly focused on
the motor functions of patients with stroke, and to date, little research has been conducted
on their responses to environmental changes such as when negotiating obstacles.</p><p>Hence, this preliminary study conducted a circuit program with a diverse environment
created by obstacles for patients with stroke, and investigated the impact of the program on
their walking and balance abilities using an up-to-date gait analysis device.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 12 adults who were diagnosed with stroke by specialists
in rehabilitation medicine at Hospital C located in Cheongju City, Chungcheongbuk-do,
Korea. The 12 stroke patients were randomly recruited and divided into two groups, an
experimental group which performed a circuit training program using obstacles, and control
group which performed flat gait training, after the subjects had answered a questionnaire
survey. The inclusion criteria for the subjects were patients at least six months after
the occurrence of stroke who understood the purpose of the research and were capable of
independent walking over 40 meters and crossing over obstacles. Those with orthopedic
diseases, those who were not capable of voluntary movement, as determined by a stiffness
level of less than Level 2 on the Modified Ashworth Scale,and those who could not perform
the Smart Step test were excluded from the study. All subjects provided their written
informed consent before participating in the study in accordance with the ethical criteria
defined by the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Measurement tools for this study consisted of a tool for measuring walking ability and a
tool for assessing balance. Evaluation of walking was conducted using the Smart Step test.
Inflatable insoles of the Smart Step tool that fited the foot sizes of the patients were
inserted inside the subjects&#x02019; shoes. The patients walked while wearing the shoes, and
plantar prints (forefoot, hindfoot), walking speed, walking cycle, and cadence were
analyzed. Smart Step measures the air pressure of the insole and transmits the data by a
wireless device. In this study, the Smart Step was used to analyze the foot on the paretic
side twice, before and after the intervention, to measure the change in plantar prints,
10-&#x02005;m walking speed, and stride during walking.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is one of the most widely used clinical tools for evaluating
postural control and walking function. It is mainly used to evaluate the balance of
elderly people and patients with nervous system diseases who have a high risk of falling.
The BBS assesses three elements; postural maintenance, postural control by voluntary
movement, and responses to external disturbance. A total of 14 items are evaluated on a
5-point scale scored from 0 to 4, with a maximum possible score of 56.</p><p>Timed Up and Go testis a method that measures functional mobility and movement ability.
The test measures the time it takes for a patient to stand up from a sitting posture on a
chair after a starting signal and walk to the halfway point at 3&#x02005;m distance, then return
to sit down on the chair again. In this study, the patients were told to turn at the
halfway point using the unaffected side as a pivot.</p><p>The circuit program using obstacles applied to the experimental group was circuit
training making use of circulation obstacles used in the rehabilitation room at Hospital
C. For safety reasons, the intervention program was implemented one-on-one with a
therapist. The 30&#x02005;min daily intervention was implemented for 3 weeks, for a total of 12
sessions. The obstacles were as follows.</p><p>1) In tandem gait, the patient walks in a straight line, stepping on a 10&#x02005;m dotted
line;</p><p>2) In slalom, the patients passes five cones with a 2&#x02005;m distance in zigzags;</p><p>3) In climbing up and down stairs, the patients climbed up and down five 10&#x02005;cm stairs
with safety handles on both sides;</p><p>4) In climbing up and down the clivus, the patients climbed up and down a 150&#x02005;cm tilted
platform with a downward slope of 10 degrees and safety handle on both sides; and</p><p>5) In step box passing, the patients walk over one 5&#x02005;cm box, one 10&#x02005;cm box, and two 20&#x02005;cm
boxes in order that are located at a 2&#x02005;m distance.</p><p>The control group performed 30&#x02005;min level walking rehabilitation training on a firm indoor
surface without obstacles 4 times a week for 3 weeks, a total of 12 sessions. The
intervention was conducted one-on-one with a therapist.</p><p>For the research intervention, the 30-min circuit training program using obstacles was
performed by the six patients in the experimental group, and the daily 30-min level
walking training was performed by the six patients in the control group.</p><p>The SPSS Win. 20.0 package was used for data analysis. The results are described as means
and standard deviations (Mean &#x000b1; SD). The paired-sample t-test was conducted to examine the
significance of within-group effects of the intervention on the experimental and control
groups. The independent sample t-test was conducted to examine the significance of
intervention, effects between the experimental and control groups. Significance was
accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The change in plantar prints was statistically significant in neither the experimental

remediation to enhance patients&#x02019; mobility and daily life<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. An obstacle training program has a positive impact on balance and
walking enhancement<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study examined the effects of a circuit training
program using obstacles on walking ability and balance.</p><p>The results of this study indicate circuit training program using obstacles resulted in
significant improvements in the 10-m walking time, an index of walking ability, and the Berg
Balance Scale and the Timed Up and Go test, indices of balance ability. However, no
statistically significant results were observed in the plantar prints, forefoot, hindfoot,
or cadence in terms of walking ability. Meanwhile, the control group, which received level
walking therapy, showed no statistically significant improvements in walking ability or
balance ability.</p><p>Chun performed an analysis of the obstacle negotiating ability and kinematic
characteristics of 12 patients with hemiparesis due to stroke, and reported that performing
obstacle course training resulted in a significant difference in the 10-m walking speed,
compared to level walking, due to increases in hip joint, shoulder joint, and ankle joint
control<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim conducted a study on the
effect of task-oriented training including obstacles on trunk control ability, and balance
and walking ability using a sample of 20 patients with stroke. He reported a decrease of
5.53&#x000b1;4.26 sec in 10-m walking time after the intervention<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and conjectured that walking speed increased due to increased of
walking efficiency of the lower limbs after performing obstacle tasks, such as climbing up
and down the stairs, climbing up and down a ramp, and stepping over boxes.</p><p>Jeong conducted research on task-oriented circuit exercise including obstacles using a
sample of 30 patients with stroke<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
that study, the experimental group showed a statistically significantly increase in the Berg
Balance Scale, from 43.7&#x000b1;6.0 before the training to 45.2&#x000b1;5.3 after the training. In the
Timed Up and Go test, the experimental group showed a statistically significantly decrease
from 20.3&#x000b1;7.7 before the training to 18.6&#x000b1;5.2 after the training. Moreover, in a study by
Yoo et al., both the experimental and control groups showed a significant decrease in
performance time in the Timed Up and Go test, which was greater in the combined exercise
group<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings are consistent with our study results. It is our
conjecture that balance ability was improved by exposure of the vestibular organs to diverse
visual information and afferent information, and that somesthesia developed from performing
the circuit training program using obstacles.</p><p>This study had several limitations. The participants included only patients who were
capable of walking and performing obstacle training. Moreover, as the sample consisted of
only patients who satisfied the research criteria, it is difficult to generalize the study
results to all patients with stroke. The study did not include an evaluation of the
persistence of the effect over time after the end of the 3-week intervention. It will be
necessary to supplement the training period and continuously examine the persistency of the
effect in a follow-up. Moreover, the effects of training using obstacles on the confidence
and psychological efficacy of the patients also deserves attention.</p><p>This study showed that a circuit training program using obstacles at effective in improving
the walking speed and balance of the patients with stroke. The results suggest that a
circuit training program using obstacles is an intervention method that improves walking
ability and enhances the balance of patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of a task-oriented training on trunk control
