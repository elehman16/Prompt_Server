RHIVA2 was the first randomised controlled trial of HIV screening in primary care. The intervention quadrupled the HIV diagnosis rate. Calls have been made by public health and primary care physicians, as well as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, for its cost-effectiveness to be evaluated, to ensure limited resources are appropriately employed. We searched PubMed for studies published from inception up to May 31, 2017, estimating the cost-effectiveness of primary care-based HIV screening interventions, and including effects on onward transmission. We combined search terms for HIV screening (&#x0201c;HIV&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;screening&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;testing&#x0201d;) with health economic terms (&#x0201c;cost-effectiveness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cost effectiveness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;ICER&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cost&#x02013;benefit&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cost benefit&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cost&#x02013;utility&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cost utility&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;health economics&#x0201d;) and &#x0201c;transmission&#x0201d;.

For rapid testing, the INSTI HIV1/HIV2 Rapid Antibody Test (bioLytical Laboratories, Richmond, BC, Canada) finger prick system was used (sensitivity 99&#x000b7;6%, specificity 99&#x000b7;3%). Most (40 [89%]) of the 45 general practices in Hackney took part.</p><p>HIV diagnosis rates in intervention (20 practices with 44&#x02008;971 new registrants) and control (20 practices with 38&#x02008;464 new registrants) practices over the 28 month trial duration informed the cost-effectiveness model. Intervention practices newly diagnosed 32 people living with HIV compared with 14 in control practices. The overall rate of HIV diagnosis was four times higher in the intervention group than in the control group: 0&#x000b7;30 (95% CI 0&#x000b7;11-0&#x000b7;85) per 10&#x02008;000 patients per year in intervention practices versus 0&#x000b7;07 (0&#x000b7;02&#x02013;0&#x000b7;20) in control practices. Mean CD4 count at diagnosis was 356 cells per &#x003bc;L (SD 254) in intervention versus 270 (SD 257) in control practices. Full details of the intervention, study design, and analysis are available.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Costs for the RHIVA2 intervention were estimated with standard methods, in which the mean use of a resource was multiplied by the unit cost of that resource to produce the estimated direct mean cost incurred by the intervention.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The analysis was done from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and thus only considered costs directly incurred by the NHS; overhead costs were not included.</p><p>Direct start-up and recurrent costs for the RHIVA2 intervention were collected by the RHIVA2 team. Each participating surgery was offered a &#x000a3;300 (US$484) enrolment incentive. Additionally, an incentive of &#x000a3;10 ($16&#x000b7;14) was offered for each rapid HIV test done (intervention only).</p><p>We annualised start-up costs over the lifetime of the programme to reflect utility beyond the period of the trial (duration 28 months). Using our best judgment as managers of the RHIVA2 intervention and our experience of working within the NHS, we estimated programme lifetime to be 5 years.</p><p>When necessary, we adjusted the price of commodities (eg, HIV rapid test, confirmatory tests) by inflation to reflect the year of the costing analysis, 2012. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at a rate of 3&#x000b7;5% per year. We used an average annual exchange rate of $1&#x000b7;6143 per &#x000a3;1 for 2012 as calculated by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.oanda.com" id="interrefs10">OANDA</ext-link> but this rate has changed substantially in recent years ($1&#x000b7;29448 per &#x000a3;1 as of July 7, 2017). Further details of costing are in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 1)</xref>.</p><p>We took quality of life estimates by CD4 cell count band and diagnosis and treatment status from the scientific literature (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 16&#x02013;18</xref>). We calculated QALYs gained by the intervention by comparing total QALYs of the model population (ie, the population of Hackney) under the control scenario with total QALYs under the intervention scenario. We estimated QALYs as the product of the utility estimate assigned to each model compartment and the average duration that an infected individual remains in that compartment.</p><p>HIV-related health-care cost data used in the model included costs of antiretroviral treatment (ART) and CD4, viral load, and resistance testing, as well as use of health-care services (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 3, 19</xref>). Little information is available on how long-term HIV health-care costs are related to CD4 cell count at diagnosis. Therefore, we explored three plausible scenarios in which patients diagnosed with late infection have increased health-care costs. Scenario 1 is based on UK data<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and models 25% higher costs for long-term diagnosed (ie, patients in long-term HIV care after the first year of diagnosis) patients on ART who were diagnosed at CD4 counts of 200 cells per &#x003bc;L or less. Scenarios 2 and 3 are based on data from Canada<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> where those diagnosed at CD4 counts of 350 cells per &#x003bc;L or less had direct medical costs 1&#x000b7;6 times higher than did other patients, up to 15 years after diagnosis. Scenario 2 assumes 1&#x000b7;6-times higher costs for long-term diagnosed who were diagnosed at 350 cells per &#x003bc;L or less. Scenario 3 assumes 1&#x000b7;6-times higher costs for all long-term diagnosed who were diagnosed at CD4 counts of 350 cells per &#x003bc;L or less, but costs for those diagnosed at counts of 200 cells per &#x003bc;L or less are twice those of patients diagnosed at counts of 200&#x02013;349 cells per &#x003bc;L. In each case, we calculated weights so that total costs of all long-term diagnosed are the same as in scenario 1. We report scenario 1 results as our base case because it is based on UK data. We also explored scenarios in which ART costs reduce with future drug price reductions after patent expiry.

Quality of life estimates are lower during the first year after diagnosis compared with subsequent years, and so time diagnosed is divided into a first phase averaging 1 year and a long-term phase thereafter.</p><p>After diagnosis, individuals are assumed to have a long life expectancy because of effective treatment and care, and reductions in HIV infectiousness are assumed to result from ART-induced reductions in viral load.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> For each behavioural risk group, we assigned an average number of partners per year for those undiagnosed.

We fitted the equilibrium state of the model to incidence in the control arm of the trial to calculate number of HIV-positive individuals in the model. Diagnosis rates for control and intervention scenarios were fitted to the number of infections diagnosed and the proportions diagnosed at each CD4 cell count band to trial data for intervention and control practices. We fitted the model using Bayesian inference done with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, with 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs) sampled from the posterior distribution.</p><p>We explored the sensitivity of model predictions to uncertainty in model parameters in univariate analysis by constructing a tornado diagram of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimates at 40 years after the start of the trial, using ranges of values for key parameters (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 21</xref>) and plotting sensitivity of ICER estimates over time to plausible ranges for those parameters identified as influential through the tornado analysis. Parameter values were not varied by a fixed percentage above and below the base case value as used in a typical tornado plot; reasonable parameter ranges were selected as informed by data sources. Uncertainty in model outcomes was expressed as 95% CrIs that were generated by use of probabilistic, multivariate sensitivity analysis, selecting model inputs from the model parameter ranges and with the 2&#x000b7;5&#x02013;97&#x000b7;5th percentile range of all results generated. The model was double-programmed in R version 3.0.3 and Berkeley Madonna Version 8.3.18 to ensure robustness of the results. All other analyses were done with R.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness of the intervention was assessed with the ICER at different time horizons (durations since start of the intervention). We assessed cost-effectiveness for the duration of the trial only rather than as an ongoing intervention (ie, the model simulated a higher diagnosis rate for the first 28 months of the simulation, before reducing to the control rate for the remainder of the model run). This result was compared with a simulation by use of the control arm diagnosis rate for the entire simulation. The ICER is defined as the difference in cumulative costs in the intervention minus the control model scenarios, divided by the difference in their cumulative effect on QALYs.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The ICER for the intervention was evaluated as cost-effective if it lay within or below the &#x000a3;20&#x02008;000&#x02013;30&#x02008;000 threshold of cost-effectiveness of interventions used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

ICER estimates for scenarios 2 and 3, based on evidence from Canada, show that the higher the HIV-related health-care costs are for long-term patients who were diagnosed late compared with those diagnosed earlier, the more rapidly RHIVA2 becomes cost-effective, reaching the upper NICE threshold in as little as 13 years (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>The results presented in the cost-effectiveness plane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>) show the initial QALY loss resulting from early diagnosis over the first 8&#x000b7;5 years. However, the intervention continues to derive benefits in terms of QALYs gained as well as costs saved for decades, because earlier testing reduces HIV transmission (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p><p>Predictions of the ICER of the RHIVA2 trial are most sensitive to incidence of new HIV infections in Hackney, closely followed by uncertainty in the estimate of quality of life of patients when in the acute stage of HIV infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 21</xref>). A higher incidence produced a lower model-predicted ICER (cost per QALY gained). A higher incidence leads to more cases in the community, so the intervention averts more secondary infections, thus increasing QALYs gained and reducing costs. The model is sensitive to acute-stage HIV quality of life because of its large range of uncertainty. Ribbon plots show how uncertainty in ICER estimates to these two key parameters change over time since the start of the intervention (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 11&#x02013;12</xref>). Notably, model uncertainty resulting from the acute-stage infection quality of life multiplier decreases substantially over time since the start of intervention. This result is because at the start of screening, QALYs are gained through prevention of new infections that start in the acute stage, but over time, QALYs gained are from prevention of QALY loss as a result of chronic HIV infection. Importantly, the ribbon plots (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 11&#x02013;12</xref>) show that uncertainty in ICER predictions decreases hugely over time and by 40 years after RHIVA2 start, ICER values become centred on the NICE cost-effectiveness threshold.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Tornado plot of model parameters varied in univariate sensitivity analysis of scenario 1</p><p>Parameters are arranged from widest range of model outcome, with range of model input values shown in parentheses.

Our model-based predictions are sensitive to assumptions regarding the increased cost of managing late-diagnosed HIV infection, for which UK-based data are scarce. If HIV health-care costs remain permanently elevated by at least 60% for patients diagnosed late (CD4 count &#x02264;350 cells per &#x003bc;L), RHIVA2 becomes cost-effective more rapidly (between 13 years and 18 years in our modelled scenarios) and even becomes cost-saving. Therefore, general practice-based HIV screening is an important public health intervention deserving of scaling up.</p><p>Our study has a number of strengths. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to use data from a randomised controlled trial of HIV screening in primary care. That RHIVA2 was a pragmatic trial including almost all general practices in a large inner city borough strengthens the generalisability of our findings. We have done a full uncertainty analysis involving tornado plots for univariable analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to provide 95% CrIs that provide a range for each model output to reflect the uncertainty in our model inputs. For some of the more potentially influential model inputs, we did scenario analyses to explore how different assumptions changed the model outputs.</p><p>Our study also has limitations, reflecting uncertainties regarding the values of inputs for modelling the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease. The paucity of reliable data to inform sexual behaviour and HIV transmission parameters means we designed our model to track secondary infections, as opposed to a full transmission model that accounts for all HIV transmissions. This approach has been used by others,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and slightly underestimates benefits of the intervention because tertiary HIV infections onwards are not included. Given the small influence that onward HIV transmission has on intervention cost (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>) and the insufficient sensitivity of the model to sexual risk behaviour assumptions, we would not anticipate tertiary transmissions and beyond to affect our findings substantially. Further detail of limitations is given in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 5)</xref>.</p><p>Our analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of the RHIVA2 trial, lasting 28 months, rather than that of an ongoing intervention. If RHIVA2 were to continue or have the residual effect of prolonged, increased HIV diagnosis rates, the intervention would take slightly longer to reach cost-effectiveness, but would be even more cost-effective overall. This result would be because the reduced quality of life of patients immediately following diagnosis initially counteracts QALYs saved through limiting transmission, but ultimately prevention of new infections has the greatest effect.</p><p>Our findings show the importance of the collection of accurate data on actual costs of HIV treatment to the NHS to produce more reliable cost-effectiveness estimates. Uncertainty about how long-term HIV health-care costs vary by HIV stage at diagnosis substantially affects our cost-effectiveness predictions. However, NHS England still does not have consistent information on costs for many specialised services.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p><p>Previous HIV testing cost-effectiveness studies from high-income countries have produced contrasting results, depending on the nature of the testing intervention investigated and the assumptions made in the analysis. Sanders and colleagues<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> estimated that screening for symptomatic HIV patients was highly cost-effective. However, they assumed ART initiation at CD4 counts of 350 cells per &#x003bc;L or less and focused on identification of late-stage patients, whereas treatment in the UK generally occurs earlier than this (83% of all people living with HIV in 2015 were on treatment<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>). Our model assumes increased diagnosis rates across all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 cell count. Therefore, earlier diagnosis of asymptomatic patients will not produce great QALY gains but substantially increases treatment costs, making our cost-effectiveness predictions more modest.</p><p>Long and colleagues<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> assessed annual HIV testing of UK adults, concluding it to be very cost-effective when targeted to key populations (such as MSM). Phillips and colleagues<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> evaluated increased HIV testing in MSM in the UK and presented scenarios in which substantial increases in HIV testing (ie, in which more than 90% of MSM are diagnosed within a year of infection) were cost-effective. Such scenarios represent a highly intensive and targeted intervention which would probably have a major effect on the MSM HIV epidemic. Restriction of RHIVA2 to screening self-identifying MSM only would probably increase its cost-effectiveness but at the expense of missing large numbers of diagnoses (for example, in northeast London, 34% of new HIV diagnoses in 2015 were in women,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> which calls into question the equity of targeted interventions).</p><p>The START<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and ANRS TEMPRANO<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> trials have shown reduced morbidity and mortality with earlier treatment, even in patients with high CD4 cell counts (&#x0003e;500 cells per &#x003bc;L); such benefits of earlier HIV treatment initiation would make RHIVA2 cost-effective at an even earlier time horizon.</p><p>The estimated cost-effectiveness of RHIVA2 is comparable to that of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among MSM, implementation of which in high-income countries has been the subject of several health economic analyses.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> PrEP cost-effectiveness estimates have ranged from cost-saving (Canada<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>) to US$160&#x02008;000 per QALY gained (USA<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>). Preliminary cost-effectiveness results of MSM PrEP in the UK have also varied, from &#x000a3;26&#x02008;300<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> to cost-saving per QALY gained<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> in base case scenarios. The latter ICER used an 80 year time horizon,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> whereas we report cost-effectiveness at 40 years after the start of the intervention. Cost-effectiveness of these HIV prevention interventions increase with time and so RHIVA2 is of comparable cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Our cost-effectiveness analysis is relatively unusual because we are considering a public health intervention involving therapeutic drug use, thus providing both individual-level and population-level benefits. Early diagnosis of people who are HIV-positive has benefits for the individual in terms of improved prognosis, reduces inequalities, and improves access to effective ART, while also benefiting the wider community by reducing onward HIV transmission. The community benefit is because people living with HIV who are diagnosed earlier are treated earlier, thus reducing their infectiousness, and might also reduce their risk-taking behaviour, thus reducing population exposure to HIV. Our results suggest that most of the HIV prevention benefit of RHIVA2 is due to earlier ART initiation rather than changes in behaviour. They highlight the need for further UK health-care cost data, by CD4 cell count band at diagnosis, for HIV economic evaluations.</p><p>Translation of the findings of the RHIVA2 trial and this accompanying cost-effectiveness analysis into action is crucial. We have evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RHIVA2 in a high HIV-prevalence local authority. RHIVA2 is probably less cost-effective in low-prevalence authorities (defined as &#x0003c;0&#x000b7;2%, which is the NICE and British HIV Association threshold for routine HIV testing in primary care) and we would currently recommend primary care-based HIV screening in high-prevalence regions only. 11 authorities have HIV prevalence similar to Hackney (0&#x000b7;80&#x02013;1&#x000b7;46%) and 74 of 325 authorities in England are defined as high prevalence and could benefit from screening.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We are currently comparing the implementation of RHIVA2 with different HIV testing interventions in neighbouring London boroughs with slightly lower prevalences. Further analyses with these data might identify a cutoff HIV prevalence below which screening is not cost-effective, but it is more likely for recommendations for screening to tally with low-prevalence cutoff defined by Public Health England of less than 0&#x000b7;2%. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness is affected by other factors varying by region, such as proportion of infections undiagnosed. Daily PrEP for 10&#x02008;000 MSM has been estimated to cost &#x000a3;54 million per year.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> The RHIVA2 trial intervention, covering half of Hackney general practices, cost &#x000a3;127&#x02008;724 over 28 months. Thus, estimated annual screening programme costs for roll-out to all 11 Hackney-level HIV-prevalence authorities is about &#x000a3;600&#x02008;000, and &#x000a3;4 million for roll-out to all high-prevalence authorities. RHIVA2 therefore represents an affordable prevention measure across all high-prevalence authorities in England. These figures are screening programme costs and do not include the increased HIV health-care costs resulting from earlier HIV diagnosis and treatment, which would fall under other NHS budgets (our analysis is of the 28 month trial rather than an ongoing, continuous intervention, so we cannot estimate an average health-care cost of the intervention per year).</p><p>Although ART as a prevention intervention is very effective, and treatment coverage in the UK is high, the estimated number of people living with undiagnosed HIV remains substantial and the number of people living with HIV continues to increase.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Patients should be diagnosed and treated earlier to effect meaningful reductions in transmission, along with ensuring that for those with a negative HIV test other prevention interventions, such as condom use and PrEP, are accessible and promoted.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hamers</surname><given-names>FF</given-names></name><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV-infected populations in Europe</article-title><source>HIV Med</source><volume>9</volume><issue>suppl 2</issue><year>2008</year><fpage>6</fpage><lpage>12</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>CDC</collab></person-group><source>HIV surveillance report.
