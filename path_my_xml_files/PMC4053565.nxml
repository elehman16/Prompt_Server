Despite its high prevalence, no accepted clinical criteria to diagnose its presence or pharmaceutical interventions to treat its symptoms presently exist. While rigorous attempts to define sarcopenia are ongoing, the unfolding intricacies of skeletal muscle changes that occur with aging have convoluted our understanding of the condition and complicated progress toward treatment options. Research has shown that measures of muscle mass give an incomplete picture of the functional scope of sarcopenia and may not be sensitive to changes. Functional and performance assessments may lack consistency and not be feasible for clinical practices. Alternative strategies like muscle biopsies are invasive. Hence, as reported by the International Working Group on Sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], circulating objective biomarkers may provide an alternative and informative clinically feasible measure of skeletal muscle quality.</p><p>During muscle remodeling, the structural framework of the muscle, comprised largely of collagen, provides the support for the alignment and growth of the myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Type III collagen, a sub-type of collagen located in skeletal muscles, is synthesized from the larger procollagen III molecule through the cleavage of N- and C-terminal peptide ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During its synthesis, the N-terminal propeptide (P3NP) is cleaved and released into circulation in direct proportion to type III collagen synthesis. The cleaved P3NP resulting from the proteolytic cleavage in the synthesis of skeletal muscle that can be measured in the blood. Since it is a product of synthetic pathways, P3NP is reflective of actual tissue remodeling. Contrarily, other anabolic measures (e.g., testosterone, GH, IGF-1) present in circulation reflect only the hormonal milieu which may or may not translate to actual anabolic responses.</p><p>Previous research has indicated that older adults have reduced levels of circulating P3NP (4.51&#x000a0;ng/mL in community-dwelling men) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and sarcopenic muscle is lower in contractile proteins, higher in connective tissue, and lower in satellite cells, presenting a hampered capacity to remodel. Additionally, changes in serum P3NP levels have been previously been shown to be predictive of changes in lean body mass and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Exercise promotes muscle remodeling and lean body mass and strength accrual through mechanical strain on the intramuscular connective tissue. Strain on the intramuscular connective tissue increases satellite cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], proteolytically driven degradation of collagen (and other proteins), and collagen synthesis 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The rate of collagen synthesis in skeletal muscle has been shown to increase with exercise, in a time-dependent manner that follows the increase in myofibrillar protein synthesis with exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In healthy muscle, neuromuscular junctions are maintained by the nerve-derived protein agrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. During neuromuscular remodeling, agrin is cleaved by the enzyme neurotrypsin into a 22&#x000a0;kDa C-terminal agrin fragment (CAF). By cleaving and inactivating agrin, neurotrypsin regulates the strength of communication between nerve and muscle cells. Recent discoveries have shown that excessive cleavage of agrin by neurotrypsin into a CAF leads to functional disintegration at the neuromuscular junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and may consecutively cause sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. During the cleavage of agrin, CAF is released into the blood in levels proportionate to increased neurotrypsin activity and reduced neuromuscular junction strength. In fact, animal models have shown that overexpression of neurotrypsin in motor neurons results in sarcopenic muscle characterized by fewer muscle fibers, more variable fiber thickness, centralized nuclei, fiber-type grouping, and proportion of type I fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. CAF is detectable in human serum and can be quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In humans, serum CAF concentrations have recently been reported to be inversely related (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02212;0.524) to appendicular lean mass in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] where lower appendicular lean mass was associated with higher CAF. Interestingly, no significant relationships were observed in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, serum CAF concentrations have been shown to be elevated in older adults with sarcopenia compared with aged-matched controls (4.7&#x000a0;ng/mL versus 2.64&#x000a0;ng/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Even higher concentrations have been reported in pre-frail men (5.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9&#x000a0;ng/mL in older pre-frail men aged 79.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.6&#x000a0;years) and women (4.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.2&#x000a0;ng/mL in older pre-frail women aged 76.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.1&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Previous research has implicated N-terminal peptide of procollagen type III (P3NP) and CAF as two potential biomarkers that may inform muscle quality status. Thus, careful examination of their circulating changes in response to a stable and known intervention may provide the fundamental evidence toward novel approaches to sarcopenia diagnosis and treatments. Accordingly, the purpose of this pilot study was to examine P3NP and CAF changes in response to a short-term resistance exercise program to determine if changes reflect muscle qualitative adaptations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study overview</title><p>A 6-week, randomized, wait-list controlled pilot study was conducted to evaluate changes in hypothesized biomarkers of sarcopenia in older adults. Participants randomized to the intervention group completed 6&#x000a0;weeks of supervised resistance exercise training. Participants randomized to the control group were instructed to maintain their normal daily activities during the 6-week &#x0201c;wait-list control&#x0201d; and began the exercise program following post-testing. Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (post-intervention). Testing occurred over two non-consecutive days within 1&#x000a0;week. On the first testing day, participants reported to the laboratory in the morning following an overnight fast and donated a blood sample and underwent skeletal muscle imaging. Performance tests were performed on the second day of testing where participants were not required to fast but instructed to duplicate their prior breakfast for follow-up testing. Follow-up testing occurred in the same order at the same time of day to reduce the influence of prior tests or diurnal variations on testing measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-three (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) healthy older men and women (aged 61 to 85&#x000a0;years) volunteered to participate in the study.

All participants were considered low to moderate risk according to the American College of Sports Medicines risk stratification criteria. Participants over the age of 69&#x000a0;years or who were considered moderate risk based on screening criteria were required to receive written physician&#x02019;s clearance for exercise participation. All participants were not currently participating in a resistance exercise program and were encouraged to maintain their normal daily activities throughout the study. All participants were free from current active malignant disease, immunodeficiency disorders, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease or symptoms.

Prior to beginning the program and following pre-testing, all participants completed two days of familiarization to become acquainted with the exercises and to establish resistance for each of the exercises. The program consisted of two workouts per week with sessions lasting 1 to 1 1/2&#x000a0;h. Each workout was separated by at least 48&#x000a0;h to allow for adequate recovery. The training program consisted of an individualized, periodized, full-body program including exercises of varying progressions of all of the major muscle groups. Exercises included progressions of the squat, split squat, leg curl, leg extension, push-up, triceps extension, calf raise, lat pull down, seated low row, biceps curl, shoulder press, abdominal plank, and reverse crunch. Acute program variables varied progressively throughout the 6&#x000a0;weeks but generally consisted of three sets of 8 to 15 repetitions of seven to eight exercises at submaximal intensity (perceived exertion not to exceed 5&#x02013;6 on the ten-point Omni scale) (&#x0223c;70 to 85&#x000a0;% of RM) with 60&#x000a0;s of rest allotted between sets and exercises. Resistance was adjusted to allow for the completion of the designated repetition range and to ensure participants were challenged to the specified perceived exertion rating. Each workout session began with a standardized dynamic warm-up consisting of body weight squats, high knee walking, and limb rotations and terminated with an appropriate cool down.

Measures were taken using B-mode ultrasound with gain set to 50 and dynamic range set to 72. Image depth was fixed to 5&#x000a0;cm. Images of the rectus femoris were taken on the sagittal plane at a distance marked as half way from the anterior, inferior iliac to the proximal border of the patella. Images of the vastus lateralis were taken at a distance marked as half of the distance from the most prominent point of the greater trochanter to the lateral condyle.

Echo intensity was measured in arbitrary units on a 0&#x02013;255 scale (0: black; 256: white).

Additionally, magnitude-based inference statistics avoids the problem of interdependence of observations by using within-subject modeling, where repeated measures are combined into a single measure (unit of change) for analysis. The precision of the magnitude inference was set at 90&#x000a0;% confidence limits, using a <italic>p</italic> value derived from an independent <italic>t</italic> test. Threshold values for positive and negative effects were calculated by multiplying standard deviations of baseline values by 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Inferences on true differences between the exercise and control group were determined as positive, trivial, or negative according to methods previously described by Batterham and Hopkins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Inferences were based on the confidence interval range relative to the smallest clinically meaningful effect to be positive, trivial, or negative. Unclear results are reported if the observed confidence interval overlaps both positive and negative values. The probability of the effect was evaluated according to the following scale&#x02014;&#x0003c;0.5&#x000a0;%, most unlikely; 0.5&#x02013;5&#x000a0;%, very unlikely; 5&#x02013;25&#x000a0;%, unlikely; 25&#x02013;75&#x000a0;%, possibly; 75&#x02013;95&#x000a0;%, likely; 95&#x02013;99.5&#x000a0;%, very likely; &#x0003e;99.5&#x000a0;%, most likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The short-term resistance exercise training intervention was effective in increasing muscle strength and quality in the total training group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and in men and women (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

As a pilot study designed to provide guidance on future research, we observed for the first time that circulating CAF may increase in response to short-term resistance exercise training in older adults to a clinically meaningful magnitude. Changes in circulating P3NP in response to the intervention were less clear but may still reflect of hypertrophic muscular adaptations. Our results reveal preliminary insights into circulating biomarker responses to an intervention and support further elaborative research efforts to better elucidate biomarker responses and potential clinical applications.</p><p>The 6-week resistance exercise training intervention was effective at improving muscle strength and quality by 29&#x000a0;% and 28&#x000a0;%, respectively. The observed strength gains are in agreement with strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and muscle quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] improvements achieved by older adults in prior short-term resistance training studies. While our muscle quality improvements were somewhat higher than those observed in the 9-week study by Tracy and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], differences can likely be attributable to different training programs. Our exercise program included multiple exercises to strengthen the leg extensor muscles including progressions of modified squats, split squats, and seated leg extensions while the 9-week study by Tracy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] trained strictly with the seated leg press exercise. Thus, the greater overload created by multiple exercises likely explained the relatively greater muscle quality gains achieved in the present study. Nevertheless, the resistance exercise intervention was effective in eliciting muscle quality improvements, as intended.</p><p>Interestingly, the significant muscle strength and quality increases observed in response to resistance exercise training over 6&#x000a0;weeks occurred despite no significant changes in total lean body mass. The lack of detectable muscle hypertrophy observed in the present study was expected for several reasons. First, this study was intentionally designed as a short term 6-week intervention in an attempt to detect muscle quality changes prior to significant hypertrophy. Prior studies show that longer duration training of at least 4 to 5&#x000a0;weeks is required before muscle hypertrophy is apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as strength gains achieved during the first several weeks of resistance exercise training are due primarily to neural adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, in older adults, increases in strength are predominantly attributed to neural factors even up to 8&#x000a0;weeks into training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, prior work by Wells et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reported that aging can attenuate the hypertrophic response of skeletal muscle to resistance training, while not impairing training-induced increases in muscle quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Muscle quality and strength increases observed in the present study are likely due to neural adaptations such as increases in voluntary activation of the agonists and reductions in the antagonist coactivation as previously described by Hakkinen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Although neural adaptations are commonly attributed to muscle strength and quality gains achieved early in a resistance training program, recent evidence by our lab suggests that some muscle structural adaptations can occur early on in a training program that cannot be detected by DEXA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The process of muscle fiber remodeling begins as soon as myofibers are damaged during the acute mechanical strain of the exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Hence, even in the absence of whole muscle hypertrophy, muscle is remodeled acutely during a resistance training intervention which may also contribute somewhat to muscle quality and strength improvement. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis muscle as measured via ultrasonography significantly increased in the exercise training group, despite no changes in total lean body mass or cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris. Hence, although some muscle structural adaptations can be detected early on in response to resistance training, non-invasive methodologies indicative of myofiber remodeling may yield a better understanding of muscular adaptations underlying strength and quality improvements.</p><p>The effects of the resistance exercise intervention on changes in circulating P3NP were clinically &#x0201c;unclear.&#x0201d; Based on the work by Bhasin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], who reported significant increases in circulating P3NP after 4&#x000a0;weeks of anabolic treatments of testosterone and recombinant GH in older men, we had hypothesized that muscle qualitative adaptations to a resistance exercise intervention could be reflected in circulating concentrations of P3NP. Although our exercise group increased circulating P3NP by 7.9&#x000a0;%, compared with a 1.9&#x000a0;% increase in the control group, our results were not statistically significant or clinically meaningful. The null findings may be attributed to several factors. First, the relatively small sample size in this exploratory study may have been insufficient to detect statistical or meaningful changes. As the first study to evaluate changes in circulating P3NP in response to a resistance exercise intervention, power analysis could not be accurately performed a priori until expected variance could be determined from the results of the present study. Post hoc power analyses based on the variance observed in the present study yielded a sample size of approximately 80 to achieve statistical significance in this measure. Nevertheless, the direction of our findings would support the investment in a larger study to investigate changes in circulating P3NP in response to an anabolic intervention.</p><p>Another possible explanation for our null findings may be attributed to the lack of change in lean body mass during the resistance exercise intervention. The significant increase in circulating P3NP with anabolic treatments of testosterone and recombinant GH in the prior study by Bhasin and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] were significantly correlated to changes in lean body mass. Our resistance exercise intervention did not result in significant group mean changes in lean body mass during the 6&#x000a0;weeks. However, individual lean body mass changes ranged from &#x02212;2.2&#x000a0;kg to 1.4&#x000a0;kg over the 6&#x000a0;weeks and were positively correlated to baseline P3NP, where those who increased circulating P3NP also increased lean body mass. Thus, it may be that significant muscle hypertrophy is required to alter circulating P3NP concentrations.</p><p>Circulating CAF increased by 11.4&#x000a0;% in older adults following 6&#x000a0;weeks of resistance exercise training which translated to a &#x0201c;likely beneficial&#x0201d; clinical interpretation of the effect of the intervention. Based on the work by Bolliger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], B&#x000fc;tikofer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and Hettwer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we had hypothesized that muscle qualitative neuromuscular adaptations to an intervention could be reflected in circulating concentrations of CAF. As Hettwer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found elevated circulating levels of CAF in older adults with sarcopenia and Drey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that physical exercise was significantly associated with a reduction in CAF concentration in pre-frail older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we had hypothesized that the resistance exercise intervention would reduce circulating CAF. Contrary to our hypothesis, circulating CAF increased rather than decreased in response to the resistance exercise intervention. However, it is important to emphasize that this result is based on magnitude-based inference statistics, a complementary statistical tool for null hypothesis testing to reduce errors in interpretation and to provide more clinically meaningful results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While repeated-measures ANOVA was also used to evaluate the changes, statistical significance was not achieved with this test due to the insufficient power of the small exploratory sample size. As our first study to evaluate changes in circulating CAF in response to a resistance exercise intervention, power analysis could not be accurately performed a priori until expected variance could be determined from the results of the present study. Nevertheless, this clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] finding is potentially indicative of positive neuromuscular remodeling occurring as a result of the intervention.</p><p>It is well known that considerable neuromuscular adaptations occur during the early stages of resistance exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As CAF is a biomarker of degradation at the neuromuscular junction where agrin is cleaved by the enzyme neurotrypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it may be that the elevated circulating concentrations of CAF are reflective of neuromuscular remodeling. Earlier research has shown that agrin is involved in the signaling that induces the clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the muscle membrane of the neuromuscular junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the transport of neurotrypsin to synapses and release from presynaptic terminals are dependent on muscle activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While it is plausible that the increase in circulating CAF is reflective of neuromuscular remodeling, the reason for why the direction of our results conflicted with those previously reported by Drey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] is less clear. It may be that participants in the present study were healthy older adults, compared with those in the study by Drey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which recruited pre-frail older adults who were older and had higher baseline CAF. Interestingly, this prior study noted that the association of a decline in circulating CAF corresponded to the sub-group with elevated CAF. Hence, it may be that CAF like other biomarkers is indicative of disease or acute response to exercise or stress. Nevertheless, we observed an interesting clinically meaningful change in circulating CAF in response to the resistance exercise intervention, which warrants future mechanistic studies to examine whether circulating CAF is evidence of positive or negative neuromuscular remodeling.</p><p>Changes in circulating CAF were significantly related to changes in CSA of the vastus lateralis. Individuals who increased circulating CAF tended to increase cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis over the 6&#x000a0;weeks, while those with lower baseline levels, tended to lose muscle size. The relationship between circulating CAF and muscle size has been previously reported by Drey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] who reported a relationship between appendicular lean mass and circulating CAF concentration in pre-frail men but not women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While CAF is a biomarker of neuromuscular remodeling, the reason for the association with changes in cross-sectional area is less clear. It may be that those who experienced greater adaptations were overall better &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; due to differing genetic potential. Some recent evidence has attributed differing micro-RNA abundance to greater phenotypic changes in those who experience more pronounced adaptations to resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Whether or not genetic potential influences the observed results requires further study.</p><p>While the present study included both older men and women and was not statistically powered to detect gender differences, the potential of gender to influence results should be considered. At baseline, circulating P3NP was somewhat lower in older women compared with older men while, to the contrary, baseline circulating CAF was somewhat higher in older women than older men. However, as depicted in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, there were no apparent trends in directionality of changes between men and women. Nevertheless, it is feasible that inclusion of both men and women in the present study convoluted our results. It is well known that skeletal muscle adaptations differ between men and women, where women have an attenuated myofiber hypertrophic capacity even at older ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The attenuated hypertrophy in older women has attributed strength gains in women to neurological adaptations predominantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, we recently observed gender differences in contributions of muscle quality to physical performance in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. As gender may influence skeletal muscle adaptations in older adults, further studies should examine potential gender differences in biomarker responses to muscle improving interventions.</p><p>Contrary to our hypothesis, changes in circulating biomarkers did not appear to relate to changes in muscle strength or quality. While the relatively small sample size in this pilot study may somewhat account for the null finding, it is also possible that circulating P3NP and CAF are not indicative of muscle strength or quality and are instead more indicative of muscle hypertrophy and strength via muscle hypertrophy. This possibility is somewhat supported by Bhasin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] who reported only a modest relationship between circulating P3NP and strength, despite the somewhat stronger relationship between circulating P3NP and lean body mass. Similarly, Drey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] did not observe a relationship between hand grip strength and circulating CAF concentration in frail older adults. Nevertheless, further study is needed to determine the relationship between circulating P3NP and muscle strength and quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Short-term resistance exercise training significantly improves muscle strength and quality in older adults and may result in clinically meaningful changes in circulating biomarker concentrations. Circulating CAF appears to increase in response to short-term resistance exercise training in older adults to a clinically meaningful magnitude. Changes in circulating P3NP in response to the intervention were less clear but appear to reflect muscle hypertrophy. Results support the potential of biomarkers reflective of skeletal muscle status to enhance clinical practice by informing muscular conditions without the need for more invasive or time consuming tests. Our results reveal preliminary insights into circulating biomarker responses to an intervention and support further elaborative research efforts to better elucidate responses and potential clinical applications. The present study provides preliminary evidence to justify further research to further understand how P3NP and CAF as potentially novel biomarkers of skeletal muscle status and sarcopenia are affected by interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors certify that they comply with the ethical guidelines for authorship and publishing of the <italic>Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle</italic> (von Haehling S, Morley JE, Coats AJS, Anker SD.
