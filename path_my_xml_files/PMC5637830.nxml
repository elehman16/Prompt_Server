Introduction</title><p>Schistosomiasis transmitted by fresh water snails is one of the highly prevalent parasitic infections in the world, and it is estimated that more than 200 million individuals are infected at any given time, of whom over a half suffer from related morbidity and about 93% are inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disease is responsible for causing considerable morbidity and mortality in endemic rural communities, inflicting up to 4.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Three endemic species, namely,<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic>,<italic> S. haematobium</italic>, and<italic> S. intercalatum</italic>, are responsible for causing schistosomiasis in Africa, of which the most important ones are<italic> S. mansoni</italic> and<italic> S. haematobium</italic> that cause intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis, respectively [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both intestinal and urinary schistosomiases are major public health problems in Tanzania, where levels of endemicity vary from place to place [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 2012, it was reported that, of the estimated population of 43.5 million people, nearly 23.2 million were infected with schistosomiasis, forming country prevalence of about 51.5%, making the country rank second to Nigeria in terms of disease burden in Africa [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular,<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic> in the country is extensively distributed in the southeastern and southwestern sides of Lake Victoria and its islands [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In these areas, it has been reported to significantly affect people, mostly schoolchildren, contributing significantly to their morbidities and mortalities [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Praziquantel chemotherapy has been the mainstay for schistosomiasis control in many endemic countries [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The target of schistosomiasis Praziquantel mass chemotherapy in endemic countries has been to control morbidity associated with the disease and, in certain epidemiological settings, contribute to sustained reduction in transmission of the disease [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In these areas, treatment is implemented at periodic intervals, as part of either school-based or community-based campaigns, referred to as mass drug administration (MDA) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, in 2012, through World Health Assembly Resolution 65.19, WHO recommended that countries, if possible, aim beyond control of morbidity toward elimination of schistosomiasis as also stated in the sustainable development goals for all neglected tropical diseases [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Praziquantel has been shown to have good efficacy in killing both mature worms [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the use of a single dose 40&#x02009;mg/kg has limitations as PZQ does not kill immature worms present in the body at the time of treatment [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. When Praziquantel is used in the first dose, it will kill the adult stages only, and in endemic areas chances of having developing immature stages are quite high and these ones are not going to be killed by the first dose; instead, as they mature, they are likely to be exposed to sublethal doses of Praziquantel, therefore increasing chances of developing resistance. In that case, application of a second Praziquantel dose at weeks 3&#x02013;6 will kill those parasites that were immature during the first dose as they will have matured by then; therefore, in doing so, there will be an improvement in the cure rates and egg reduction rate which in turn will slow down the likelihood of the parasite developing resistance to the drug as well as significantly reducing environmental contamination by eggs discharged by infected people and therefore contributing to the efforts of achieving transmission control [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>This restricted activity to adult worms and eggs may contribute to reduced efficacy of Praziquantel and also contribute to raising population of adult parasites that have once been exposed to the drug and possibly contribute to emergency of Praziquantel resistance [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This speculation is supported by studies elsewhere which have reported reduced sensitivity of<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic> to Praziquantel and a failure of complete cure in a<italic> S. mansoni</italic> infection with a standard dose [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In Tanzania, a study done in Mara region showed that even a single Praziquantel treatment could produce a genetic bottleneck with reductions in a range of measures of genetic diversity of Schistosoma<italic> mansoni</italic>; reduction in genetic diversity may be an initial sign of emerging resistance or reduced sensitivity to the drug [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because of this, investigating alternative treatment strategies that may help prolong the usefulness of the drug such as administering multiple doses is highly important [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, administering more than one treatment may increase cure rate, thereby significantly hastening efforts to achieve transmission control by 2030 as stated in the sustainable development goals [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore this study intended to investigate the efficacy of single and repeated dose Praziquantel treatments on<italic> S. mansoni</italic> infection and its implication on the burden of undernutrition and anaemia among primary schoolchildren living in an endemic area in Rorya District, northwestern Tanzania.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methodology</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Design and Population</title><p>This study was done in Rorya District, northwestern Tanzania, from 2015 to 2016. The district forms one of the seven districts that constitute the Mara region. It borders Tarime District to the east, Lake Victoria to the west, Butiama District to the south, and the Republic of Kenya to the north [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The Luo tribe constitutes the majority of inhabitants of Rorya District. Other ethnic groups are Kurya, Kine, Simbiti, Sweta, and Suba. The district is situated in the north of Tanzania and lies within latitudes 1&#x000b0;00&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02013;1&#x000b0;45&#x02032;&#x02032; south of the Equator and longitudes 33&#x000b0;30&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02013;35&#x000b0;0&#x02032;&#x02032; east of Greenwich Meridian. A more detailed description of the study area is found in our previous publication [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The current study was a longitudinal randomized intervention trial with a registration number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/appmanager/atm/atmregistry?dar=true&#x00026;tNo=PACTR201601001416338">PACTR201601001416338</ext-link> registered on the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry. The longitudinal randomized intervention trial aimed at comparing the efficacy of single 40&#x02009;mg/kg dose against repeated 40&#x02009;mg/kg dose of Praziquantel treatment regimens on parasitological (egg reduction rate and cure rates) and morbidity (haemoglobin and nutritional status) indicators with cure rate being the primary outcome of interest.</p><p>The study population consisted of primary schoolchildren aged 6&#x02212;16 years attending primary schools in two villages, Busanga and Kibuyi, in Rorya District. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were as described in Munisi et al.'s work [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Sample Size Determination</title><p>This study was a longitudinal intervention trial that aimed at comparing parasitological cure rates of single versus repeated doses of Praziquantel treatments for the treatment of intestinal schistosomiasis. We used a formula for calculating sample size aimed at comparing two rates to calculate the sample size for this study [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Parasitological cure rates of Praziquantel against intestinal schistosomiasis reported from a study of communities living along the shores of Lake Albert in Uganda, which reported cure rates of 41.9% and 69.1% for the single-dose and two-dose treatment regimens, respectively, were used [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The level of significance was set at 95% and the study power was set at 90%. We added 30% to counter annual loss to follow-up; a total sample size of 257 schoolchildren was required per treatment group. The sampling procedure was as described in our previous publication [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Data Collection</title><sec id="sec2.3.1"><title>2.3.1. Assessment for Demographic Characteristics</title><p>A pretested Swahili translated semistructured interview questionnaire was used to gather demographic information about the study participants. Variables such as age, sex, and sociodemographic characteristics were assessed. Initially, the questionnaire was developed in English; it was then translated to Swahili and back-translated to English by a different person who was blinded to the original questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.2"><title>2.3.2. Stool Sample Collection and Examination</title><p>Stool containers and wooden applicator sticks were provided to children with signed informed consent forms from their parents or legal guardians; the children were then requested to bring sizable stool samples of their own. We collected a single stool sample from each study participant. To increase sensitivity, a standard protocol with four Kato-Katz thick smears was prepared from different parts of the single stool sample using a template of 41.7&#x02009;mg (Vestergaard Frandsen, Lausanne, Switzerland) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Examinations of Kato smears for hookworm eggs were performed within 1 hour of slide preparation. Then the Kato smears were arranged in wooden slide boxes, packed together in large container boxes, and transported to the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) laboratory, Mwanza Research Centre, where they were examined for<italic> S. mansoni</italic> eggs by two experienced laboratory technicians. The intensity (eggs per gram (epg) of faeces of<italic> S. mansoni</italic> infection for each child) was calculated as an average egg per gram of faeces for all the four Kato smears prepared for each child. We used a template delivering 41.7&#x02009;mg of stool to prepare Kato slides, the eggs of each parasite in the slide were counted, and the number of eggs was multiplied by 24 to calculate epg for<italic> S. mansoni </italic>infection.<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic> intensities were categorized as per WHO intensity classes as light (1&#x02013;99&#x02009;epg), moderate (100&#x02013;399&#x02009;epg), and heavy (&#x02265;400&#x02009;epg) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A random sample of 10% of the negative and positive Kato-Katz thick smears was reexamined by a third technician as a quality assurance procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.3"><title>2.3.3. Anthropometric Measurements</title><p>The children's heights and weights were measured using a portable stadiometer and digital weighing scale, respectively. The children's barefoot stature and weight with minimum clothing and without shoes were recorded to the nearest 0.1&#x02009;cm and 0.1&#x02009;kg, respectively. The resulting height and weight measurements were used to calculate <italic>z</italic>-scores using the new World Health Organization's Child Growth Standards [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Children with height-for-age <italic>z</italic>-scores (HAZ) and BMI-for-age <italic>z</italic>-scores (BMIAZ) below or equal to &#x02212;2 standard deviation (&#x02264;&#x02212;2 SD) were classified as stunted and wasted, respectively. Those children whose HAZ and BMIAZ were less or equal to &#x02212;3 standard deviation (&#x02264;&#x02212;3 SD) were classified as severely stunted and severely wasted, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) was used as the index of choice for the assessment of recent undernutrition as recommended [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We took all anthropometric measurements with instruments that were calibrated and validated before use.</p><p>The age of each participant was recorded from school records as reported by parents/guardians during school registration of the children. We used the midpoint of the year of birth and the 15th day of the month of birth.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.4"><title>2.3.4. Determination of Haemoglobin Levels</title><p>About 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of blood was collected by finger prick using disposable lancet; this was used to determine venous haemoglobin (Hb) by using a HemoCue photometer (HemoCue, Angelholm, Sweden) [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Children with Hb levels more than or equal to 11&#x02009;g/dL were considered to be normal. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin levels of less than 11&#x02009;g/dL, while haemoglobin levels of less than 7&#x02009;g/dL, 7.0&#x02013;9.9&#x02009;g/dL, and 10.0&#x02013;10.9&#x02009;g/dL were classified as severe anaemia, moderate anaemia, and mild anaemia, respectively [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.5"><title>2.3.5. Randomization and Treatment</title><p>For assignment to the type of treatment regimen, children with positive stool test for<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic> were randomly divided into two groups using SPSS-generated random numbers after entering all collected data from the baseline survey. One group did not receive a second dose of 40&#x02009;mg/kg PZQ; therefore this was the single treatment arm, that is, only treated at baseline. The second group was assigned to receive a second dose of 40&#x02009;mg/kg of body weight PZQ with a 3-week interval. Treatment was given using tablets of PZQ USP 600&#x02009;mg manufactured by Micro Labs Ltd., Verna, Goa, India.

In the descriptive analysis, we used simple frequency and percentages.</p><p>The cure rate was defined as the proportion of treated persons who were egg-positive at baseline but became egg-negative 8 weeks after baseline treatment. We used two-sample proportion comparison test to compare cure rates between the two treatment regimens among different demographic characteristics. The egg reduction rate for those who remained positive was calculated as follows: (1 &#x02212; [AMI after treatment/AMI before treatment]) &#x000d7; 100. The chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare proportions of anaemia, stunting, and wasting between the two treatment regimens for different demographic characteristics. Parasite counts were normalized by log transformation, averaged, and then back-transformed to the original scale.<italic> S. mansoni</italic> infection intensities were calculated as geometric mean of eggs per gram of faeces. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Ethical Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Medical Research Coordination Committee (MRCC) of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), Tanzania (reference number: NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol. IX/1990). The study received further clearance from the District Executive Director, District Education Officer, and District Medical Officer of the Rorya District Council. Before commencement of the study, the research team conducted meetings with the village executive officers, teachers, and pupils of selected villages and schools, respectively. During these meetings, the objectives of the study, the study procedures to be followed, samples to be taken, study benefits, and potential risks and discomforts were explained. Informed consent for all children who participated in the study was sought from parents and legal guardians by signing an informed consent form. Assent was sought from children who were also informed of their right to refuse to participate in the study and to withdraw from the study at any time during the study. At baseline, all children were given a standard dose of Praziquantel (40&#x02009;mg/kg) and albendazole (400&#x02009;mg) as a single dose on separate days. Treatment with Praziquantel was given after a meal which was prepared and offered at school to minimize potential side effects. Treatment was performed immediately after baseline data collection and was done under direct observation (DOT) by a qualified nurse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3.

It was further observed that geometric mean egg intensity of<italic> S. mansoni</italic> started to rise after a sharp decline at 8 weeks following baseline treatment. The geometric mean egg count at 5 months after baseline was slightly higher on the single-dose arm (13.03&#x02009;epg) compared to double-dose arm (10.18&#x02009;epg) but the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

Discussion</title><p>Praziquantel's restricted activity to adult worms and eggs may contribute to reduced efficacy of the drug and to raising population of adult parasites that have once been exposed to the drug and may possibly contribute to emergency of Praziquantel resistance [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Assessing alternative treatment regimen that would improve the drug's efficacy, thereby significantly hastening efforts to achieve transmission control, is of paramount significance. Therefore, this study intended to investigate the efficacy of single-dose and double-dose Praziquantel treatments on<italic> S. mansoni</italic> infection and its implication on the burden of undernutrition and anaemia among primary schoolchildren living in an endemic area in Rorya District, northwestern Tanzania.</p><p>In this study, we examined the impact of two repeated doses of 40&#x02009;mg/kg Praziquantel administered 3 weeks apart compared to a standard single dose of 40&#x02009;mg/kg with particular attention to cure rate and egg reduction rate (intensity of infection after treatment) and its effect on the burden of anaemia and undernutrition among study participants.</p><p>At 8 weeks after baseline treatment, we found significantly higher cure and egg reduction rates among individuals who were treated with double Praziquantel doses as compared to those treated with a single standard dose. 8 months after baseline treatment, we found that about 85% and 83% of those who were cured at 8 weeks after receiving a single treatment and two treatments, respectively, were reinfected. No significant difference was observed in the rates of reinfection at 5 months and 8 months after baseline treatment between the two treatment groups. It was further observed that, at 8 months after baseline treatment, there was no difference in the prevalence of stunting between the two treatment regimens. However, we noticed a significant increase in the prevalence of wasting among those on repeated dose compared to those on a single dose of Praziquantel. We further observed an increase in the mean haemoglobin levels at 8 months with no difference between the two arms.</p><p>The cure rate resulting from repeated Praziquantel treatments which is reported in this study is slightly higher compared to the upper margin of the possible cure rate resulting from single treatment (90%), while the cure rate resulting from single-dose standard treatment lies close to the lower margin of the recorded cure rate of single-dose Praziquantel treatment which is 60%&#x02013;90% [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the cure rates reported in this study in both treatment arms are relatively higher than what was reported by Kabatereine (41.9% for single dose and 69.1% for double dose) and Tukahebwa (47.9% in single-dose and 69.7% in double-dose treatments) [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This difference in the observed cure rates for the two treatment regimens in comparison with those reported in the previous studies could be due to differences in the timing of the second treatment, whereby in Kabatereine et al.'s study the two treatments were given 6 weeks apart and in Tukahebwa et al.'s work the two treatments were given 2 weeks apart and assessment was done at 6 weeks and/or 12 weeks and 9 weeks after treatment, respectively [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], contrary to this study in which the two treatments were given at three weeks' interval and assessment was done at 8 weeks following baseline treatment. Also, it could possibly be due to the fact that the drug has not been intensively used in the study area for schistosomiasis mass chemotherapy. The relatively lower cure rate observed in the single-dose treatment arm as compared to repeated treatment suggests that since this is a<italic> S. mansoni</italic> endemic area [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it is likely that during the baseline treatment some infected children had both mature worms and immature worms that are normally less sensitive to Praziquantel [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This population of immature schistosomes that survived the first treatment, if left untreated, could result in adult parasites that are less sensitive to the drug. Administering a second treatment might result in killing those parasites that were immature at the time of the first treatment, resulting in improvement of the cure rate as seen in this study and delaying development of resistance to the drug. It was further observed that the superiority of the cure rates resulting from repeated Praziquantel treatment was observed across sex and village of residence, but this was not the case across age groups; we noted that there was no difference in cure rates among children aged 13&#x02013;16 years who received single-dose and double-dose Praziquantel treatment. This observation could be attributed to the fact that this is the age at which highest prevalence is usually observed and their behaviour predisposes them to rapid reinfections following the first dose in such a way that when the second treatment was offered, infections acquired following the first dose were still at the age at which they were less sensitive to the second Praziquantel dose and therefore the lack of significant difference in cure rates in this age group was observed. This has also been reported as being a reason for low cure rate among children in this age group [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective for the currently used mass treatment programs in schistosomiasis endemic areas is morbidity reduction through reduction of the intensity of infection following treatment [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Double praziquantel doses resulted in a significantly higher egg reduction rate. Similar findings have also been reported in a different study [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The egg reduction rates reported in this study are within the recorded standard egg reduction rates of Praziquantel of over 80% or 90% [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The relatively higher egg reduction resulting from double doses could, as stated earlier, be linked to the fact that, in areas where transmission intensity is very high, like an area in which this study was done [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a single dose is not enough to kill all worms, particularly the immature worms; therefore administering a second dose resulted in killing more worms and eggs, resulting in the observed significantly higher cure and egg reduction rates [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition to this, the repeated-dose treatment in our study leads to a significantly lower mean egg intensity among those who were not cured at 8 weeks after baseline treatment. This could have been of value as far as morbidity reduction is concerned had it been sustained; however, in this study, no difference in geometric mean egg intensity between the two arms was observed at 5 months and 8 months after baseline treatment. This suggests that repeated treatments would not offer any added advantage on reducing<italic> Schistosoma</italic>-related morbidity in highly endemic areas, where infections with parasites at different developmental stages and rapid reinfections following treatment are a norm. To sustain the benefit of repeated treatments, treatment should be coupled with other control measures that will reduce the rate of reinfections following treatments such as behaviour change communication and sanitation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This has also been reported in another longitudinal study, where treatments were done in different years and cure rates reported; it was observed that the year in which cure failures were the greatest was also the year in which prevalence of<italic> S. mansoni</italic> in snails was highest [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that the rate of reinfection with schistosome parasites following Praziquantel treatment is faster with<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic> than with<italic> Schistosoma haematobium</italic> [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Factors that determine the rate of reinfection with schistosome parasites have been said to include baseline infection intensity, schistosome species, and local ecology [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This study found overall prevalence of reinfection at 5 months and 8 months not to be statistically significantly different between the two treatment regimens, similar to what was also observed elsewhere [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This is likely a result of the high transmission intensity in the area where this study was conducted [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, a significant difference in reinfection rate was observed when the analysis was based on village of residence. In Kibuyi village, a significant difference in reinfection rate was observed between the two treatments, with those receiving two treatments having significantly lower prevalence of reinfection at 8 months after baseline treatment. This observation could be a result of the difference in transmission intensity between the two villages, whereby Kibuyi has relatively lower transmission intensity as reported in our earlier report [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Intestinal schistosomiasis has been shown to contribute to the high prevalence of malnutrition and anaemia among children in developing world and improvement in nutritional status and haemoglobin levels has been reported following treatment with Praziquantel [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Although our previous study among study participants could not establish the relationship between nutritional status and anaemia with<italic> S. mansoni</italic> infection [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we assessed the comparative implication of treating infected children with single-dose and repeated-dose Praziquantel treatment on the overall burden of anaemia and undernutrition among study participants. As an indicator of chronic nutritional insult, stunting rates at 8 months after baseline treatment did not differ significantly between the two treatment arms; however, there was a general decline in the prevalence of stunting when compared to baseline prevalence in both arms, a decline which of course this study fails to empirically link to treatment intervention due to lack of dietary information with regard to the study participants and the lack of a placebo control group. Surprisingly and contrary to stunting, the study observed that there was an increase in the overall rates of wasting following treatment, with the prevalence of wasting being significantly higher among children who were given repeated Praziquantel treatments. This observation relates to what was reported elsewhere demonstrating that<italic> S. mansoni</italic>-infected children were less likely to be wasted than their uninfected counterparts [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In this case, therefore, the slight improvement in linear growth as a result of treatment might have negatively affected weight- and height-based indices (BMIAZ) as reported in [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or the observed increase in the prevalence of wasting might have been confounded by acute dietary deficiency during or close to the time of the follow-up survey.</p><p>It has further been shown that<italic> S. mansoni</italic> infections contribute to the burden of anaemia among schoolchildren in endemic areas [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Although our earlier study in the study area could not associate<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic> infections with anaemia [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we assessed the comparative implication of single-dose and repeated-dose Praziquantel treatments on the burden of anaemia among study participants. We found that there was a general increase in the mean haemoglobin levels among study participants in both treatment arms with ultimate significant decrease in the prevalence of anaemia following treatment among subjects in both treatment arms. Improvement in haemoglobin levels following Praziquantel treatment among<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic>-infected individuals has also been reported in other studies [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, at 8 months after treatment, second dose of Praziquantel did not offer any added benefit in improvement of haemoglobin levels. This observation is likely to be due to the observed lack of difference in the prevalence of reinfection at 8 months, since morbidity to schistosomiasis correlates with the intensity and duration of infection [<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>We acknowledge that the relatively higher baseline arithmetic mean/geometric mean egg intensity among individuals who received two treatment doses might have resulted in underestimating the efficacy of the repeated treatments on<italic> S. mansoni</italic> and its possible implication on nutritional status and anaemia.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion and Recommendation</title><p>The present study found a significantly higher cure rate and egg reduction rates resulting from repeated-dose Praziquantel treatment three weeks apart as compared to a single standard dose at eight weeks after baseline treatment. However, besides the two treatment regimens resulting in significantly higher cure and egg reduction rates, the rates of reinfections among study subjects were almost equal between the two treatment arms, leading to the mean egg intensities becoming almost equal at 5 and 8 months after baseline treatment. To achieve reduction of transmission intensity and ultimately disease control in highly endemic areas, repeated treatments need to be coupled with other control measures such as behaviour change communication and improvement in water supplies and sanitation. The present study further noticed no difference in the prevalence of stunting between the two treatment regimens 8 months after baseline treatment. This could be a result of the short follow-up period; we therefore recommend studies that will have a longer follow-up period to assess the potential benefit of repeated treatments on nutritional status.</p><p>Significant increase in the mean haemoglobin levels following Praziquantel treatment among<italic> Schistosoma mansoni</italic>-infected individuals has also been reported in several studies [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Overall, there was a general significant increase in the mean haemoglobin levels among study subjects in our study with no difference between the two treatment arms. This highlights the usefulness of the currently used treatment regimen with the aim of controlling morbidity including anaemia. However, when the goal is to reduce transmission and ultimately achieve disease control, repeated-treatment regimen could offer a better benefit as compared to single-treatment regimen, particularly in areas where rapid reinfection occurs following treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the Government of Tanzania for funding this study through the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology.
