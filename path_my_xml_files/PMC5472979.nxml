In Australia, the gap in life expectancy for people with a mental illness is estimated to be 16&#x000a0;years for males and 12&#x000a0;years for females, with approximately 78% of this excess death being attributable to physical health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviours, including smoking, poor nutrition, harmful alcohol consumption and inadequate physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], contribute to this chronic disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For example, smoking rates among people with a mental illness are up to three times higher than that of the general population in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, risk for two or more chronic disease risk behaviours was present in 78% of clients of Australian community mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], compared to 31% of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Clinical practice guidelines recommend that chronic disease risk behaviours be routinely assessed and managed by health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], including specialist mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As a minimum, it has been suggested that this care may follow a &#x02018;2As and an R&#x02019; approach: <italic>assessment</italic> of clients&#x02019; risk for chronic disease behaviours, provision of brief <italic>advice</italic> to modify behaviours and <italic>referral</italic> of clients to support services for ongoing specialist care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Despite such guidelines, the provision of care by mental health clinicians to modify chronic disease risk behaviours is consistently reported to be sub-optimal in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For example, a survey of Australian community mental health services found that few clinicians reported the provision of care for four key chronic disease risk behaviours (smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol consumption and physical inactivity), with only 9% reporting assessing most (at least 80% of) clients for all such risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, where risks were identified, only 25% of respondents stated that they were offering most at-risk clients brief advice, and 10% were referring most at-risk clients to specialist behaviour change services to assist clients in modifying their chronic disease risk behaviours. In the USA, a survey of community mental health staff in one service (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;154) found that only 27% reported that they provided advice to more than half of their clients regarding smoking, inadequate physical activity and insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Such a failure to provide preventive care has been suggested to be a further contributor to the chronic disease burden experienced by people with a mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Reasons for clinicians not addressing chronic disease risk behaviours in mental health settings have been suggested to include inadequate time and resources, lack of clinician training and low clinician confidence regarding the provision of such care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>One approach to overcoming barriers to the provision of preventive care which has some support with mental health professionals and clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] is to allocate a clinician to the specialist role of providing such care in the context of mental health care delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Two randomised controlled trials within mental health settings have assessed the efficacy of specialist roles in increasing the provision of care to address chronic disease risks, including at least one behavioural risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Osborn and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial of six mental health services in the UK to examine the efficacy of allocating a nurse to deliver a 6&#x000a0;month intervention to increase assessment of cardiovascular risks (tobacco smoking and biomedical risks such as high blood pressure and cholesterol). The nurse&#x02019;s role was to (1) promote cardiovascular screening in routine mental health consultations by mental health clinicians by establishing monitoring systems for risk assessment and the use of reminders, and (2) provide cardiovascular screening to those clients who did not receive screening during their routine mental health consultations. Following the 6&#x000a0;month intervention, rates of cardiovascular risk screening increased by at least 30% for each risk, compared to mental health services that were provided with an educational package regarding the provision of such care only. No significant difference was found between groups in the proportion of clients receiving a referral to smoking cessation support services in the nurse-led intervention (49%) compared with the control condition (49%).</p><p>In the USA, Druss and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] undertook a randomised controlled trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;407) to assess the potential efficacy of a care management model to increase access to primary and preventive care services. The intervention involved a &#x02018;medical care nurse&#x02019; located in a single community mental health service whose primary role was to assist clients in overcoming barriers to accessing primary medical care. The nurse provided chronic disease health education, advice to support health risk behaviour change, liaison with primary care providers on behalf of clients and support for clients in contacting primary care providers. The impact of the intervention was measured in terms of an aggregate score of services the client received regarding their physical health, including education regarding chronic disease risk behaviours, physical examination, screening tests and vaccinations. At a 12&#x000a0;months follow-up, the intervention group received a significantly higher proportion of such services than those who received usual care (58.7% vs 21.8% respectively). No results were reported regarding care addressing chronic disease risk behaviours specifically.</p><p>Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of embedding a specialist care provider in a community mental health setting with the role of providing assessment, advice and referral for multiple behavioural chronic disease risks. To address this limited evidence, a randomised controlled trial will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of a &#x02018;healthy lifestyle clinician&#x02019; located in a community mental health service in increasing the provision of assessment, advice and referral for four key chronic disease risk behaviours: smoking, poor nutrition, physical inactivity and harmful alcohol consumption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>A parallel-group randomised controlled trial with blinded follow-up will be undertaken (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the study flow diagram, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) diagram and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the SPIRIT checklist). The study will be conducted in one community-based mental health service in a regional area in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The service is typical of regional community-based mental health services, seeing clients with a range of mental health issues (such as depression, psychoses, anxiety and bipolar disorder) and severities. In 2010, the health district within which the service is located implemented a policy requiring clinician assessment, advice and referral to ongoing behaviour change support services for clients with chronic disease risk behaviours, including smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, physical inactivity and harmful alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Rates of adherence to this policy in community mental health services have been reported to be sub-optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design flow diagram. <italic>CATI</italic> computer-assisted telephone interview</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2017_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>The community mental health service is implementing a new approach to meeting the policy requirements, whereby a healthy lifestyle clinician will be embedded within the service for a period of 6&#x000a0;months, with the specific role of providing assessment, advice and referral to evidence-based behaviour change services to modify the chronic disease risk behaviours of clients. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate this approach to care provision. Clients will be randomly allocated to receive usual care (including any care for chronic disease risk behaviours that might be provided in the context of routine mental health treatment) or usual care plus an additional face-to-face consultation and follow-up call with the healthy lifestyle clinician. The primary purpose of the additional care component will be to identify at-risk clients and provide motivation for modification of the behaviour and uptake of free government-provided telephone coaching services (NSW Quitline (smoking) and NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service (nutrition, physical activity, alcohol consumption and weight management)). Primary outcome data will be obtained from the respective services at baseline and at 6&#x000a0;months post baseline and will include (1) referrals made by the community mental health service to the telephone services, (2) client contact with the telephone services and (3) client engagement in a behaviour change program offered by the telephone services. Secondary outcomes will be client-reported receipt of any assessment, advice and referral for chronic disease&#x000a0;risk behaviours from the mental health service; satisfaction with the receipt of such care; satisfaction with the receipt of any care provided by the telephone services; interest and confidence in and importance of changing chronic disease risk behaviours; and risk behaviour status. Secondary outcome data will be collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) undertaken with clients at baseline and at 1 and 6&#x000a0;months post baseline follow-ups. The effectiveness of the healthy lifestyle clinician role will be assessed by comparing primary and secondary outcomes between the intervention and control conditions at follow-up.</p><p>The trial has been approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref no. 16/02/17/4.09) and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref no. H-2016-0123).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants will be all clients of one community mental health service in Australia. Community mental health staff will identify on a weekly basis all new and existing clients of the service during a 6&#x000a0;month period. Clients who are under the age of 18 or identified by mental health staff to be too unwell or clinically inappropriate to contact will be ineligible for inclusion. Eligible clients will be mailed a study information statement explaining the telephone interviews and data collection procedures. Clients will be provided a toll-free number to call should they not wish to participate in data collection. This procedure is based on those previously used successfully in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Eligible clients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive usual care (control condition) or usual care plus a consultation and follow-up call with the healthy lifestyle clinician (intervention condition). Clients will not be blinded to the study allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention condition</title><p>Clients allocated to the intervention condition will be notified by a mailed letter which will briefly describe the additional care they will receive.

The knowledge gained from this study will inform the development of future policies and service delivery initiatives to increase care provision for chronic disease risk behaviours. If shown to be effective, the uptake of the healthy lifestyle clinician role by community mental health services has the potential to have a positive impact on the chronic disease-related care that clients receive. Ultimately, this could reduce the disproportionately high prevalence of risk behaviours in this population and positively affect life expectancy and quality of life.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission, participant recruitment had not yet commenced.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional file</title><p>
