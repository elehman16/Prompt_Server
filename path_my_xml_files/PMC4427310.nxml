Annually, over 1.2 million people develop CRC globally, with more than 600,000 patients die from the disease in 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Incidence and mortality rates for CRC have declined as a result of improved tests that allow early detection of the cancer, when it can be more easily treated by surgery and chemotherapy along with radiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite those advances in clinical treatment, the overall prognosis of CRC patients is still unsatisfactory due to cancer metastasis. Therefore, it is important to develop additional biomarkers in order to enhance the prognosis of CRC patients by prediction or early detection of occult metastasis.</p><p>Blood-based, minimally invasive markers would be increasing important in CRC screening and monitoring of CRC patients. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 have been commonly assessed in CRC patients, but with varying results depending on the study design and the study population [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and their clinical association with cancer metastasis have not been demonstrated thus far. Although numerous biomarkers are under evaluation for the detection of CRC from serum, none of them has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered in the current guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted glycoprotein with a multi-domain structure and functions characteristic of an extracellular protein [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is a small integrin-binding ligand <italic>N</italic>-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) that binds to cell surface receptors including integrins and CD44 [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. OPN is expressed in many tissues and secreted into body fluids, including blood, milk and urine [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which has important physiological roles in bone remodeling, immune response and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is also a tumor-associated protein and elevated OPN levels are associated with cellular proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis via altered activity of matrix metalloproteinases, the epidermal growth factor receptor and PI3K-AKT signaling [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126219.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These preclinical studies suggest that plasma OPN could be an important non-invasive biomarker of occult systemic metastases. In accordance, in a recent meta-analysis of over 228 publications, high tumor or plasma OPN levels correlated with decreased disease-free survival and overall survival in multiple tumor types, including lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Increased levels of OPN mRNA and protein have been demonstrated in CRC comparing to the non-tumor tissue [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the high expression correlated with metastatic features such as lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, Nitsche <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s study which investigated more than 200 patients with stage II colon cancer demonstrated that tumor tissue level of osteopontin was useful for detecting the presence of colon cancer, but not for predicting the prognosis of the patients [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These studies suggested that OPN tissue level was not yet confirmative to detect or predict CRC metastasis. Blood OPN level has been suggested as a potential detective biomarker of CRC, yet its clinical correlation with CRC metastasis has not been demonstrated thus far. In addition, most of the cancer studies focused on the clinical significance of pre-operative plasma OPN level, while the post-operative level in cancer patients has seldom been investigated. Therefore, in this study, we will examine the clinicopathogical significance as well as the prognostic potential of pre-operative and post-operative plasma OPN levels of CRC patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Patients and specimens</title><p>The human sample collection protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Hong Kong, and all clinical investigation has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Pre-operative blood samples were obtained from 96 patients who underwent surgical resection of primary CRC at the Department of Surgery, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, between 1998 and 2007. Tissue samples were obtained from 32 out of the 96 patients, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80&#x000b0;C until analysis. The post-operative blood was obtained from patients during their post-operative follow-up visit to our clinic (usually within 6 months after surgical operation). Blood was anticoagulated by EDTA and then centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. The plasma was collected, aliquoted, and snap frozen at -80&#x000b0;C till use.

Significantly higher plasma OPN level was detected in patients with tumor size over 5 cm (180.4 vs 140.7 ng/ml, p = 0.003; 1C), higher stage (187.9 vs 137.0 ng/ml, p&#x0003c;0.001; <xref rid="pone.0126219.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>) and metastatic CRC (197.0 vs 148.7 ng/ml, p = 0.003; <xref rid="pone.0126219.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).

These results revealed that pre-operative plasma OPN was a potential non-invasive biomarker for tumor progression and metastasis. We also examined whether pre-operative plasma OPN level correlated with future metastasis of CRC patients who showed no distant metastasis at operation.

OPN expression is regulated by a wide variety of stimuli which are associated with CRC progression and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], involving complex regulatory pathways. Various growth and differentiation factors also increase OPN expression, including platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;, bone morphogenic proteins and inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, transcription of OPN is also directly activated by a number of transcriptional regulators including Wnt signaling and Tcf-4 [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which is a well-known deregulated pathway promoting CRC. In the presence of &#x003b2;-catenin, Tcf-4 cooperates to stimulate OPN promoter activation and protein production [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We believed that the activation of these factors and signaling pathway during CRC tumor progression induces OPN expression and the subsequent cancer cell metastasis.</p><p>Plasma OPN is a potential non-invasive prognostic marker for tumor progression, invasion and metastasis in gastrointestinal cancers [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While high plasma OPN level has been associated with metastatic features in a variety of cancers such as gastric cancer [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], renal cell carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and breast cancer patients [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], its correlation with CRC metastasis has not been demonstrated thus far. The present study aims to examine the potential of plasma OPN levels as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of CRC.</p><p>This study showed that the post-operative plasma OPN level could predict the development of future metastasis in CRC patients. While most of the studies on OPN focused on the clinical significance of pre-operative plasma OPN level in cancer patients, the post-operative level has seldom been investigated. A recent HCC study which demonstrated post-operative serum OPN level could serve as surrogate serologic biomarker for monitoring treatment response and tumor recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], indicating the potential of post-operative plasma OPN as biomarker in HCC and other cancers. Our results demonstrated a significantly higher post-operative plasma OPN level in CRC patients with post-operative distant metastasis and shorter DFS, when compared with those bearing low post-operative plasma OPN level. We further showed that neither pre-operative nor post-operative CEA level was prognostic for development of post-operative metastasis, suggesting that in addition to CEA, other blood parameters (such as plasma OPN) are necessary to monitor the disease progression status of CRC patients.</p><p>Our results revealed that pre-operative plasma OPN level correlated with tumor size and distant metastasis. One possible explanation to such correlation is that plasma OPN level associates with treatment response of chemotherapy. In a non-small cell lung cancer clinical study, high pre-operative plasma OPN level was significantly associated with patient response, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In another colorectal cancer study which employed plasma OPN in their six-marker signature, they demonstrated the predictive importance of their six-marker signature for CRC patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine/oxaliplatin [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Since oxaliplatin/cisplatin-based chemotherapy is widely applied to CRC patients, their findings suggest that patients bearing higher plasma OPN are more resistant to those treatments and thus more susceptible to tumor progression and distant metastasis.</p><p>Moreover, our study demonstrated that high pre-operative plasma OPN level was associated with metastasis at the time of surgical operation while high post-operative level correlated with development of distant metastasis after primary resection. The functional effects of endogenous and exogenous OPN in induction of CRC cell growth, angiogenesis, invasion and migration have been demonstrated both in <italic>vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126219.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments also showed that overexpression of OPN induced cell migration in CRC cell-lines DLD1 through induction of EMT. However, no significant change was observed in the cell invasion assay, suggesting that OPN is not the unique factor necessary to stimulate invasion. Similar observation that certain factors regulate cell migration but not invasion has been reported by other cancer studies [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126219.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. DLD1 cells migrated faster when cultured in medium with higher secretory OPN level, indicating that OPN was not only a biomarker but also involved in the metastatic process. Secretory OPN is more likely to play a crucial role in liver metastasis of CRC cancer cells, since the two known receptors of OPN (integrin &#x003b1;v and CD44v6 proteins) are strongly expressed in hepatocytes from normal liver [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We believed that inhibitor targeting OPN is a potential therapeutic approach to treat CRC patients. A recent study demonstrated the efficacy of a humanized anti-OPN antibody in inhibiting breast cancer growth and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the efficacy of targeting OPN in CRC treatment by this anti-OPN antibody or other inhibitors warrants further investigations.</p><p>Plasma OPN has also been extensively investigated and shown to be a valuable biomarker in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Its level increased in early NSCLC, reduced after resection and increased with recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In chemotherapy-treated patients with advanced NSCLC, low plasma levels of OPN were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes. Patients with lower levels had better response rates and higher overall and progression-free survival rates, suggesting that OPN plasma level have utility as a prognostic biomarker in chemotherapy-treated patients with unresectable NSCLC [<xref rid="pone.0126219.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A more recent NSCLC study demonstrated that OPN level changes over time, particularly post-treatment, may yield additional prognostic information in curative-intent radiotherapy of NSCLC, which might be potentially useful in the identification of patients with high risk of death and relapse after radiotherapy. This could be beneficial in patient stratification and the decision-making process for post-radiotherapy treatment concepts. We believed that plasma OPN is a valuable biomarker in CRC. The pre-operative plasma OPN level could be applied to predict the treatment response to chemotherapy for patients with unresectable CRC, whereas the post-operative plasma OPN level could predict and monitor the response to adjuvant chemotherapy, and early detection of recurrence and metastasis. Extensive care and alternative treatment approach should be taken for CRC patients who show high or increasing plasma OPN level.</p><p>To conclude, this study demonstrated high post-operative OPN after surgery were correlated with post-operative distant metastasis, suggesting that post-operative plasma OPN level is a potential non-invasive biomarker for monitoring of CRC patients after curative resection of their primary tumor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126219.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Correlation of blood OPN and CEA levels with disease-free survival of CRC patients.</title><p>(A) Correlation of pre-operative plasma OPN with disease-free survival of CRC patients (p = 0.720; Log-rank test).
