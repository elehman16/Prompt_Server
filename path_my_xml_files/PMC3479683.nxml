Following
stroke this self-care task can be problematic, with 54% of stroke survivors unable to dress
independently at six months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511431089">1</xref></sup> and 36% at two years after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511431089">2</xref></sup> The prevalence of this problem is
unsurprising, however, as dressing is a complex skill that requires many physical and
cognitive abilities to ensure independence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511431089">3</xref></sup> Previous longitudinal studies have
documented that those patients with persistent cognitive difficulties have higher levels of
dressing dependence than those without<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511431089">2</xref></sup> and that the nature of cognitive
difficulties determines the pattern of persistent dressing problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511431089">4</xref></sup></p><p>As part of routine stroke rehabilitation, occupational therapists assess the self-care
abilities of each patient and strive to resolve any dressing difficulties observed. A
narrative literature review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511431089">5</xref></sup> and survey of occupational therapy dressing practices in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511431089">6</xref></sup> documented that therapists
did not use standardized dressing assessments to evaluate dressing performance nor did they
use research evidence to inform their clinical practice, frequently providing a
time-limited, repetitive, problem-solving approach to dressing practice. This method is
referred to as the &#x02018;functional approach&#x02019; to dressing. Although cognitive deficits were
acknowledged as a key prohibitive factor in the acquisition of dressing independence, there
was little evidence in the survey of therapists tailoring the approach to dressing treatment
in light of impairments experienced by the patient. Therapists who did treat cognitive
impairments did so using mental stimulation on unrelated cognitive exercises, such as pen
and paper exercises to improve visual neglect, in the hope that improvements on these tasks
might generalize to dressing ability. There was little evidence of therapists treating the
cognitive difficulties directly during dressing practice.</p><p>There is some evidence that dressing practice provided by occupational therapists can be
beneficial. A previous single-blind, randomized cross-over trial has described the
successful treatment of dressing difficulties after stroke in a group of community-dwelling
patients (<italic>n =</italic> 30) at six months after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511431089">7</xref></sup> Dressing practice was administered by an
experienced occupational therapist over a three-month period and employed a pragmatic
functional approach to treatment. The interventions provided included advice on appropriate
clothing, the teaching of strategies such as dressing the affected side first, the use of
markers on garments to overcome perceptual problems and energy conservation techniques.
Although there was an average increase in dressing ability (measured by the Nottingham
Stroke Dressing Assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511431089">3</xref></sup>) of 11% in the treatment group, it is possible that an optimal improvement
in dressing ability was not achieved as there was no systematic approach to the assessment,
analysis of the underlying problems or targeted treatment of cognitive difficulties.
Similarly, although two other studies have reported improvements in dressing performance
following task-specific interventions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511431089">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511431089">9</xref></sup> the underlying cognitive impairments associated with dressing remain
unexplored.</p><p>A subsequent single-blind randomized multiple-baseline experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431089">10</xref></sup> combined naturalistic observation of
dressing abilities, systematic neuropsychological assessment and administration of targeted
dressing interventions. Results demonstrated that there was a significant treatment effect,
measured by the Nottingham Stroke Dressing Assessment and observation-based t-shirt test,
for those inpatients with right hemisphere stroke. There was, however, no therapy-related
improvement for those with left or bilateral damage and apraxia. Because of the small number
of case studies in this experiment (<italic>n =</italic> 8), a further study was required to
establish the potential benefits of this approach over conventional approaches employed by
occupational therapists. In following the MRC framework for the development and evaluation
of complex interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511431089">11</xref></sup> a pilot phase II randomized controlled trial was designed. Our aim was to
conduct an evaluation of two approaches used to treat stroke patients with persistent
dressing problems and accompanying cognitive difficulties after stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section10-0269215511431089"><title>Methods</title><p>Consecutive inpatients on the stroke rehabilitation wards at Nottingham University
Hospitals Trust were monitored by the ward occupational therapists to identify those
patients with persistent dressing difficulties. Patients were deemed suitable for the study
if they had received two weeks of conventional rehabilitation and still required help to
dress. Patients were invited to take part in the study if they were impaired (scored less
than 100% maximum score) on the Nottingham Stroke Dressing Assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511431089">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511431089">12</xref></sup> and on one or more items in a brief
cognitive screening test: line cancellation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511431089">13</xref></sup> to detect visual neglect (maximum score
36, impaired &#x0003c;33); 10-hole peg transfer test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511431089">14</xref></sup> with the non-paretic hand to detect
dexterity problems not due to paresis (impaired &#x0003e;22 seconds); the Object Decision subtest
from the Visual Object and Space Perception assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511431089">15</xref></sup> (maximum score 20, impaired &#x0003c;12);
Gesture Imitation to detect apraxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511431089">16</xref></sup> (maximum score 20, impaired &#x0003c;15). To ensure selection of patients
able to participate in dressing practice, the exclusion criteria included the inability to
tolerate sitting in a chair for 15 minutes, premorbid disability (Rankin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511431089">17</xref></sup> &#x0003e;3) and known diagnosis
of depression or dementia.</p><p>In terms of comprehension, patients had to be able to understand English if it wasn&#x02019;t their
first language. The Sheffield Aphasia Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511431089">18</xref></sup> was used to assess aphasia and adapted
information and consent forms were used where appropriate. Demographic data were also
collected on the Barthel Index,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511431089">19</xref></sup> Motricity Index,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511431089">20</xref></sup> age, gender and side of stroke.</p><p>Following baseline assessments and using concealed allocation via the University of
Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit internet randomization service, patients were randomized to
one of two treatment groups; conventional occupational therapy (the &#x02018;Functional approach&#x02019;)
or the &#x02018;Neuropsychological approach.&#x02019; Patients were stratified by side of stroke and
severity of their dressing problem as measured by the Nottingham Stroke Dressing Assessment
score. The two groups continued with their usual rehabilitation therapy and nursing care and
only differed in the type of dressing practice provided by the trial occupational
therapists. Both interventions were delivered by two research occupational therapists
experienced in the treatment of stroke patients.</p><p>As side of stroke was initially recorded from the medical notes, brain scans were later
reviewed by an experienced stroke radiologist. This identified a subgroup of patients with
definite or probable bilateral hemisphere damage and these were treated as a separate
category in analysis of results.</p><p>Interventions were prescribed according to group allocation. Treatment manuals had
previously been developed for both dressing approaches using comprehensive literature
searches, survey results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511431089">6</xref></sup> and occupational therapy text books.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511431089">21</xref></sup> Patients allocated to the functional
approach were given repeated dressing practice using a problem-solving approach, with
assistance when required. This approach is commonly used by occupational therapists in the
UK and has been shown to have a beneficial effect on dressing performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511431089">7</xref></sup> Dressing interventions would
include components such as putting the affected arm into the sleeve first, crossing affected
leg over other leg to reach feet, energy conservation techniques, etc. There was no attempt
to formally assess the patient&#x02019;s cognitive difficulties or relate them to evidence on which
approach to training might be the most successful.</p><p>Patients assigned to the neuropsychological approach received further detailed cognitive
testing and an assessment of the impact of cognitive deficits on dressing by observation of
a standard task of putting on a t-shirt,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431089">10</xref></sup> with performance scored using an error
analysis rating form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511431089">12</xref></sup> This error analysis identified the presence of cognitive problems such as
impaired attention, spatial confusion and action sequence errors. On the basis of the test
results and the types of error observed, treatment interventions were selected from a menu
of evidence-based techniques described in the pre-prepared neuropsychological treatment
manual. The most commonly used specific techniques were cueing and alerting procedures to
combat neglect or attentional difficulties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511431089">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511431089"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511431089">24</xref></sup> systematic laying out of clothing to reduce spatial
confusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431089">10</xref></sup> and
graded errorless learning strategies to enhance acquisition of dressing skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511431089">25</xref></sup> Fidelity of treatment in
both patient groups was monitored by an independent researcher who observed random dressing
sessions to ensure the manuals were adhered to.</p><p>The optimal intensity of dressing practice as indicated in our previous single case
experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431089">10</xref></sup>
dictated that patients in both groups received dressing treatment three times a week for a
period of six weeks. Patients continued to receive dressing treatment in their own home if
they were discharged from hospital before the end of the treatment period.</p><p>Patients were assessed at six weeks after randomization by an independent assessor who was
masked to the patient&#x02019;s treatment group allocation. Masking of the independent assessor was
monitored by completion of a best guess form. All patients were assessed on the Nottingham
Stroke Dressing Assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511431089">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511431089">12</xref></sup> and the
cognitive tests which had been used in initial screening were repeated (line
cancellation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511431089">13</xref></sup> to
detect visual neglect; 10-hole peg transfer test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511431089">14</xref></sup> with the non-paretic hand to detect
dexterity problems not due to paresis; the Object Decision subtest from the Visual Object
and Space Perception assessment;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511431089">15</xref></sup> Gesture Imitation to detect apraxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511431089">16</xref></sup>). Performance on the Nottingham Stroke
Dressing Assessment was selected as the primary outcome measure for the study.</p><p>As this was a feasibility study, no formal power calculation was performed. However based
on a similar dressing study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511431089">7</xref></sup> using the same primary outcome measure, it was estimated that the study
would require 35 patients per group (80% power to detect an effect at the 0.05 level).
Although the previous trial had investigated a slightly different approach to dressing
difficulties, the authors felt that a pragmatic study of this magnitude would be informative
for the proposed trial. Statistical analyses included Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests of
within group means and standard deviations over time, between group differences at six weeks
and planned subgroup analyses for patients with right hemisphere and those with left or
bilateral damage were also carried out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section11-0269215511431089"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 965 patients screened during the trial (1 March 2008&#x02013;28 February 2010), we sought
consent from 110. Of these, 40 passed the screening tests. The remaining 70 patients (64%)
were randomized to either the neuropsychological group (<italic>n =</italic> 36) or to the
functional group (<italic>n =</italic> 34). A sample of treatment sessions were monitored to
ensure that they included the actual treatment prescribed in the manual. We found a high

dressing performance over the trial intervention period. We found no statistically
significant differences between the groups on performance on our main outcome measure: the
Nottingham Stroke Dressing Assessment. However we did find a trend for improvement in those
patients with right hemisphere stroke who were receiving the systematic neuropsychological
approach to dressing. This outcome supports our previous findings in this patient
group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431089">10</xref></sup> and adds
weight to the hypothesis that patients with right hemisphere stroke with accompanying
dressing problems and cognitive deficits can be treated successfully using a systematic
neuropsychological approach. The fact that these patients also demonstrated a significantly
greater reduction in visual neglect suggest that it was the use of techniques to reduce
neglect which had the greatest impact on dressing ability in this group.</p><p>It is likely that a stronger treatment effect would be observed in a purpose designed trial
aimed specifically at patients with right hemisphere damage. The current study included all
patients with cognitive impairment and dressing difficulties, with no preselection for site
of brain lesion. This meant that the subgroup of right hemisphere patients allocated to the
neuropsychological was small. Furthermore, the techniques described in our treatment manual
were culled from the wider neuropsychological literature and seldom specifically described
the application of these treatments to patients with dressing difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511431089">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511431089"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511431089"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511431089">25</xref></sup> Our experience of
the trial will allow us to write a more targeted treatment manual, which together with a
larger sample size may demonstrate a more substantial treatment effect. In addition, we
included two intervention groups in our dressing trial and did not include a conventional
control group. Our reasoning behind the inclusion of a manualized functional approach was
based on the positive benefits found in a similar interventional dressing study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511431089">7</xref></sup> Although the approach we
applied was based on routine care provided by occupational therapists in the UK, the content
of the functional manual was very prescriptive and the frequency with which the intervention
was delivered was much greater than that routinely provided on the stroke rehabilitation
wards. We therefore believe that a clinically significant difference may have been observed
on the main outcome measure had we included a conventional control group.</p><p>The left and bilateral damage subgroup showed no sign of any benefit of the
neuropsychological approach. One reason for this may be that their dressing difficulties
were simply less severe and therefore that there was less room for improvement. For right
hemisphere-damaged patients, the presence of unilateral neglect, spatial confusion or poor
sustained attention have a devastating effect on dressing skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511431089">3</xref></sup> In contrast, left hemisphere damage is
associated with apraxia and related problems in control of action, but the impact of these
on everyday functioning is more subtle and seems to depend on the exact cognitive demands of
any given task situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511431089">26</xref></sup> This said, there were left hemisphere damaged apraxic patients in this
study who were unable to regain independence in dressing, and reasons for this lack of
benefit of the neuropsychological approach need to be considered. A likely explanation is
that the techniques to assist them are not well developed: there are only few, small-scale
experimental studies on intervention for apraxia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511431089">27</xref></sup> This contrasts with the well-developed
literature on intervention for visual neglect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511431089">28</xref></sup> Our results suggest that evidence-based
systematic interventions tailored to the deficits found in right hemisphere-damaged stroke
patients are likely to be beneficial.</p><p>The main weakness of our study was its relatively small sample size which limited the power
to detect a statistically significant effect on dressing performance. Similarly, although
the subgroup analysis was planned, it was nonetheless carried out on a small number of
patients. However, we believe that the sample size achieved has allowed us to demonstrate
that this approach to dressing is a feasible method to employ with stroke patients
experiencing persistent dressing difficulties and such an intervention can be carried out on
