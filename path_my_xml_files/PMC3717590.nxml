In order to improve the ease and safety of this emergency procedure new instruments have been developed. Such a new device is the Percutaneous Cricothyroidotomy Kit (Portex Crico Kit, Smiths Medical International Ltd., Hythe, Kent, UK) which allows a single step insertion into the trachea. As a safety mechanism the unit has a spring-loaded locator needle with a red flag indicator. This feature is intended to prevent damage to the posterior tracheal wall. The aim of this study was to evaluate this new emergency cricothyroidotomy set regarding success rate, performance time and complications in comparison with the standard surgical approach performed by inexperienced clinicians.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Within the first 2&#x02005;years of postgraduate clinical education, physicians of the German Armed Forces Medical Corps have to pass a structured training programme in the field of emergency medicine. This training programme includes a 6-month rotation at the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care at one of the four German Armed Forces Military Hospitals. For this study 30 physicians of this emergency medicine training programme at the German Armed Forces Medical Centre Ulm were recruited to participate during their rotation at the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care. All of them have had &#x0003c;1&#x02005;year of postgraduate training and none of them have had previous cricothyroidotomy experience. The study was performed according to the guidelines of the regional ethics committee. During a period of 23&#x02005;months, we compared two methods of cricothyroidotomy (standard surgical technique vs indicator-guided puncture technique) in 30 adult non-formalin-fixated adult human cadavers within 24&#x02005;h after death. The study was conducted at the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Ulm, Germany. All study participants were introduced into the techniques and the equipment used for cricothyroidotomy by an experienced trauma anaesthesiologist, who already has performed emergency cricothyroidotomy in the prehospital as well as in the inhospital setting. The two cricothyroidotomy techniques assessed in our study were the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Standard surgical technique (ST) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Portex Cricothyroidotomy Kit (PCK) technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The standard surgical technique set.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="emermed-2012-201493fig1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The Portex Cricothyroidotomy Kit set.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="emermed-2012-201493fig2"/></fig><p>Each study participant was randomly assigned to one of the cricothyroidotomy technique groups. Furthermore, each study participant performed only one cricothyroidotomy in one cadaver. The standard surgical technique (ST) was performed as follows: (1) Immobilisation of the larynx. (2) Identification of the cricothyroid space followed by a vertical and midline skin incision of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;cm of length using a No. 11 scalpel blade. (3) Blunt preparation of subcutaneous tissue down to the cricothyroid membrane (CTM) with a preparation scissors (eg, Metzenbaum scissors) followed by a transverse incision of the CTM using the same scalpel blade. Withdrawal of the scalpel and use of a Kilian speculum to demonstrate the incision of the CTM. (4) Insertion of a 6.0&#x02005;mm ID armed cuffed endotracheal tube (Mallincrodt Safety-Flex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> low pressure cuff tube; Covidien plc, Dublin, Ireland) with the assistance of a Kilian speculum.</p><p>The Portex Cricothyroidotomy Kit (PCK) technique was performed as follows: (1) Immobilisation of the larynx. (2) Identification of the cricothyroid space followed by a vertical and midline skin incision of 2&#x02005;cm of length only over the CTM. (3) Insertion of the device perpendicularly into the trachea with constant observation of the red indicator in the needle hub. Correct placement into the tracheal lumen is confirmed by disappearance of the red indicator in the needle hub. The device is carefully advanced further until the red indicator reappears again, indicating contact to the posterior tracheal wall. (4) The device is then angled in caudal direction and advanced 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;cm into the trachea. The needle is removed and while the dilator is held stationary, the cricothyroidotomy tube is then advanced over the dilator fully into the trachea and the dilator is removed.</p><p>In each technique, once the operator had indicated completion of the procedure, correct cricothyroidotomy tube placement was confirmed by anatomical dissection. In accordance with the literature for each technique successful insertion was defined as insertion of the device into the correct anatomic location.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7">5&#x02013;7</xref> There was no &#x02018;functional check&#x02019; by trying to ventilate the patient. During the dissection structures also were inspected for any complications, such as lacerations or penetrations of the tracheal wall, fractures to the trachea, cricoid, or thyroid cartilages. In addition, injury to thyroid vessels were recorded.</p><p>After completion of the procedure the following parameters were evaluated: 1. Time to complete procedure (from immobilisation of the larynx to tube insertion). 2. Time to achieve patent airway (from immobilisation of the larynx to tube insertion). 3. Damage to the cricoid or thyroid cartilages, perforation or laceration of the posterior tracheal wall, damage to the oesophagus as well as injury to thyroid vessels.</p><p>Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the Fishers exact test to compare success rate and complications. Time to achieve successful airway access was compared using unpaired t-test and reported as mean values (SD).

It is a pre-assembled, compact kit which contains all components for the procedure. In this study we compared this PCK technique with the standard surgical procedure technique in non-formalin-fixated human cadavers, performed by inexperienced clinicians. We studied the three outcome variables success rate, tube insertion time and complication rate, which are crucial for survival of the hypoxic patient. There are several factors influencing these three variables in an emergency situation as well as in a study situation. Out of these factors, familiarity with the device and technique as well as the individual clinicians' experience are of utmost importance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Furthermore the type of model (manikin model, porcine cadaver, human cadaver) used for investigation may influence these outcome variables significantly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> we conclude that these factors might have contributed to the high incidence of major complications. We did not experience any of these major complications in the ST-group but two minor complications (injuries to small thyroid vessels). Previous studies have mainly reported similar results. In a large cadaveric study, Schaumann <italic>et al</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> did not find any injury to the posterior tracheal wall with the ST-technique. Schober <italic>et al</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> in their study did not experience any complication (major and minor) with the ST-technique compared to a complication rate of 36% with a new Scissors-technique and a complication rate of 71% and 64% with a catheter-over-needle and wire-guided-technique. Chan <italic>et al</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> also did not experience an injury to the posterior tracheal wall but fractures to the thyroid/cricoid cartilage in 15% of the successful attempts with the ST-technique.</p><p>In contrast to manikin as well as animal models, non-fixated, non-frozen fresh human cadavers seem to be the ideal model, allowing standardised research; however, study conditions differ from in vivo conditions. A major difference is that cadavers bleed to a lesser extent so that bleeding complications are likely underestimated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> This may especially be true for anatomical-surgical techniques and to a lesser extend also to percutaneous puncture techniques because they dilate rather than dissect the tissue. Additionally, laboratory models cannot convey the sense of urgency and difficulty encountered in the clinical situation, where difficult patient anatomy, patient movement, and bleeding are present.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our observational bench-test found that the PCK technique was not superior to the ST technique regarding the three outcome variables success rate, insertion time and complications in a human cadaver model performed by inexperienced operators. In contrast, we experienced a significantly lower success rate and a significantly higher rate of major complications with the PCK device compared to the standard surgical technique. In the hand of the inexperienced operator, the standard surgical cricothyroidotomy technique seems to be a safe procedure, which can successfully be performed within an adequate time. The PCK technique cannot be recommended for inexperienced operators.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> This manuscript was written by the corresponding author and the co-authors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> Ethics approval was provided by Local ethics committee.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>American Society of Anaesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway</collab>
