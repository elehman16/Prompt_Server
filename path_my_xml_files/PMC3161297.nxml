It results from loss of normal endothelial function and is associated with increased oxidative stress, production of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and a decrease in antioxidative defense systems (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia also contribute to overall morbidity and mortality. In a recent study of patients with hypercholesterolemia, a soy germ&#x02013;enriched pasta containing isoflavones, in mainly the biologically active aglycon form, significantly improved serum lipids and other markers of cardiovascular risk, including arterial reactivity, beyond that of an American Heart Association Step II diet alone (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Our objective was to determine whether similar effects from this novel food could be attained in patients with T2D.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This 20-week study enrolled 26 adults with T2D (13 men/13 women, aged 62 &#x000b1; 7 years) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. None had major complications of diabetes and all were on an American Diabetes Association diet. Prior use of estrogen therapy, oral corticosteroids, antioxidant supplements, soy foods or isoflavone supplements, a BMI &#x0003e;35, and smoking were exclusion criteria. The study was conducted with informed consent according to ethical guidelines for research on humans and was approved by the human ethics committee of the University of Perugia School of Medicine.</p><p>Two types of dried pasta were used: a soy germ&#x02013;enriched pasta (Aliveris s.r.l., Perugia, Italy) containing 31&#x02013;33 mg of total isoflavones per serving predominantly in aglycon form (Pasta+) and conventional pasta (Pasta&#x02212;), with both packaged identically (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Patients were randomized to two groups. One group consumed one serving/day of soy germ&#x02013;enriched pasta (80 g dry pasta) for 8 weeks followed by conventional pasta for 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout between. The other group consumed these pasta types in reverse sequence. Overnight fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, after washout, and at the end of the diet periods for serum/plasma biochemistries measured by standard methods. Blood pressure was measured and endothelial function assessed from changes in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation using ultrasound imaging of artery diameter during reactive hyperemia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Methods for data analysis are detailed in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0495/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s6"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 26 patients enrolled, 6 were withdrawn (4 whose drug therapies were altered, 1 who took antioxidants, and 1 who was noncompliant to the diets). The mean BMI of the remaining subjects (10 women, 10 men) was 28.3 &#x000b1; 3.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, fasting glucose was 122 &#x000b1; 33 mg/dL, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 6.8 &#x000b1; 0.65%. After randomization, there were no significant differences between the groups (Pasta+/Pasta&#x02212; vs. Pasta&#x02212;/Pasta+) in these measures.</p><p>Plasma isoflavones were undetectable at baseline and when consuming Pasta&#x02212;. When consuming Pasta+, serum daidzein, glycitein, and genistein concentrations ranged 12&#x02013;255 nmol/L, 11&#x02013;128 nmol/L, and 15&#x02013;167 nmol/L, respectively, consistent with previously reported data (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation increased &#x0223c;5% after consuming Pasta+ and decreased with Pasta&#x02212; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0495/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>); this difference was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0005). Consistent with improved endothelial function was a significant reduction in systolic (<italic>P</italic> = 0.026) and diastolic (<italic>P</italic> = 0.017) blood pressures. Pasta+ lowered systolic blood pressure from 133 &#x000b1; 1 at baseline to 126 &#x000b1; 12 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure from 79 &#x000b1; 9 at baseline to 73 &#x000b1; 10 mmHg.

Effects are also shown separately during each sequence of administration of the two pasta types (Pasta&#x02212;/Pasta+, <italic>n</italic> = 11, and Pasta+/Pasta&#x02212;, <italic>n</italic> = 9). The line in the middle of the box represents the median or 50th percentile of the data, and the box extends from the 25th to the 75th percentile, an interval referred to as the interquartile range. The lines emerging from the box extend to the upper and lower adjacent values (i.e., the largest data point less than or equal to the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the smallest data point greater than or equal to the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range, respectively). If the examined data come from a normal distribution, one would expect the interval between the adjacent values to include 99.3% of the data.

Consistent with these changes was a reduction in lipid peroxidation, as observed by a decrease in plasma oxidized LDL cholesterol (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009). Serum homocysteine concentration was lower (<italic>P</italic> = 0.017) after Pasta+ compared with Pasta&#x02212;, but there was no effect of either pasta on serum cysteine or interleukin-6 levels. At baseline, all patients were in good glycemic control and, consequently, neither pasta influenced plasma insulin, glucose, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This novel soy germ pasta was developed with the objective of delivering biologically active isoflavone aglycons (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) at levels typically found in soy foods in the Asian diet (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and not to satisfy the 1999-approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration cardiovascular health claim for soy protein (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A high dietary intake of isoflavone aglycons may explain why soy foods appear beneficial to Asians (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and why pure aglycon supplements, such as genistein (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) or <italic>S</italic>-(-)equol (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), are proving efficacious. Because Italians consume pasta almost daily, this facilitated dietary compliance, which was confirmed by the expected increase in plasma isoflavone concentrations (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) or from returned package counts.</p><p>Although no significant changes were observed with either pasta on serum total and LDL cholesterol, which were relatively normal at baseline, serum triglycerides showed a decreasing trend that was greater with Pasta+ than Pasta&#x02212;. Despite a lack of effect on serum lipids, impressive effects on other important surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk were observed. Endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of cardiovascular disease, has prognostic value in assessing cardiovascular risk (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and was significantly improved by Pasta+. This finding corroborates previous data in hypercholesterolemic patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and is consistent with the vasodilatory effects of isoflavone aglycons (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). With Pasta+, highly significant 8 and 7% reductions, respectively, in systolic and diastolic blood pressures occurred, and considering the small sample-size, the magnitude of the effect on endothelial function and blood pressure is impressive and clinically relevant.</p><p>Because isoflavones have antioxidant activity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the finding of highly significant beneficial effects of Pasta+ on several markers of oxidative stress, and on serum GSH, a key constituent of the antioxidant defense system, was not unexpected but important given that increased oxidative stress is seen in T2D (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and Pasta+ lowered serum levels of this atherogenic and prothrombotic amino acid.</p><p>In summary, this isoflavone-enriched soy germ pasta, unlike conventional pasta, significantly improved multiple markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D. Dietary inclusion of this novel pasta may provide benefits to diabetic patients beyond those achieved by an American Diabetes Association diet alone.</p></sec>
