Conventional treatment routinely involves surgical evacuation of significant hematomas, efforts to restore and maintain adequate brain perfusion and prompt management of cerebral edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Other treatment modality, in particular systemic hypothermia, had shown promising beneficial effect, though results appeared inconsistent in numerous trials.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Notwithstanding, induced hypothermia had also been reported in the management of stroke, hypoxic encephalopathy and seizures.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The therapeutic basis of inducing hypothermia is supported by a neuroprotective effect on the brain following trauma or ischemic insults. Several mechanisms thought to underlie this effect which include the reduction in the metabolic rate and energy expenditure, attenuation in excitatory amino acids release and free radicals synthesis, suppression of excessive ischemia-induced and post-traumatic inflammatory reactions, and prevention of blood-brain barrier disruption and brain edema.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Despite our greater understanding in the scientific basis of brain hypothermia, an optimal method of brain cooling remains an issue that needs to be vigorously studied. It is apparent that method of inducing hypothermia does influence the effectiveness of delivering the cooling effect onto the injured brain. Methodically, brain cooling can be divided into peripheral and core cooling.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our opinion, the direct cooling effect on the injured brain via both methods could still remain suboptimal, and frequently limited by complications. Such complications include pneumonia, systemic infections and cardiac arrhythmias in a systemic body cooling, and focal soft tissue injuries over the head in a helmet cooling.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Given so much controversy in inducing hypothermia for the injured brain, we sought to design a prospective, randomized pilot study to assess efficacy of new method in brain cooling called &#x0201c;direct regional brain hypothermia.&#x0201d; In this article, we present our preliminary experience with direct focal or regional brain cooling, obtained via direct irrigation of cold fluid onto the surface of severely injured brain for trauma patients who require decompressive craniectomy with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6-7.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized controlled trial, designed to assess the effect of direct regional brain cooling treatment in severely head injured patients. The study has been approved by our local research and ethics committee (USMKK/PPP/JEPem [225.3 (13)]). Patients referred to the Department of Neurosciences from January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2012 and fulfilled the criteria were recruited into the trial. The sample size was calculated using two proportions formula with alpha of 0.05 and power of 80% with expected total sample size of 36 patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Subject criteria</title><p>All patients with traumatic brain injury were screened prior to recruitment. The inclusion criteria were: (a) Age 12 and above; (b) severe head injury with GCS 6-7; (c) require decompressive craniectomy; (d) able to be followed-up after 6 months being discharged from the hospital and (e) consented by next of kins or guardians. Patients with the following criteria were excluded: (a) Penetrating brain injury; (b) significant drop in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure of &#x0003c;90 or diastolic blood pressure of &#x0003c;60 mmHg) and/or significant hypoxia prior to admission; (c) bilateral fixed and dilated pupils; (d) severe injury to other organ systems which may lead to marked morbidity or even mortality; (e) concomitant traumatic spinal cord injury; (f) known pre-morbid immune or neurological diseases; (g) severe head injury with only extradural hematoma, and (h) known pre-morbid condition prior to the accident, including history of seizures. All recruited patients were then randomized to either group A (cooling group) or B (no cooling or standard treatment group).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Randomization and therapy</title><p>Potential patients were identified and screened by the principal investigators who are also the treating surgeons (Z.I and M.S.Z). They explained the randomization process, surgical procedures and cooling method, required neuromonitorings, imaging and follow-up to all potential candidates&#x02019; legal representative in details. Once they agreed to participate, informed consent was obtained, and the patient was randomized to one of the two-treatment arms: Cooling versus no cooling. Sealed envelopes, initially blinded to both consenting individuals (on patients&#x02019; behalf) and clinicians containing either paper A (for cooling group) and B (for no cooling or standard treatment group) were randomly chosen. Group A consisted of patients who had therapy with direct regional brain cooling and group B consisted of patients who did not have direct regional brain cooling therapy. There was no blinding done after assignment to interventions. All recruited patients received monitoring for ICP, brain oxygen and brain temperature using ICP and Licox probes (GMS, Kiel-Mielkendorf, Germany). ICP probe was inserted into the ventricle or brain parenchyma whilst Licox probe for brain oxygen and temperature was placed into the damaged brain areas. In addition, the cooling group (group A) had bloods taken for immunological parameters pre- and post-cooling therapy. The studied immunological parameters were CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16, and 56, interleukins (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and total white blood cells count. The duration for monitoring and period of cooling therapy was for at least 24 h, although in case-by-case basis, longer therapy and monitoring was considered for persistently raised ICP without obvious surgical lesion on repeated computed tomography (CT) images. The body temperature was also monitored during the treatment period.</p><p>The recruited patients had CT brain prior to surgery and were categorized into different grade of severity of brain or whole body injury based on: (a) GCS; (b) Marshall score and (c) injury severity score (ISS). The unilateral decompressive craniectomy was the standard operation indicated for pathology causing midline shift, while bifrontal decompression was done for diffused pathology that causing cerebral swelling. The monitoring [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>] and therapies given after the surgery were the standard therapy for severely injured brain patients which include the following: (a) On ventilator support; (b) sedated with or without muscle paralysis agents; (c) draining of cerebrospinal fluid and/or hypertonic saline or mannitol therapy for persistently raised ICP of &#x0003e;20 mmHg; and (d) thiopentone coma therapy as a final step to treat postoperative refractory intracranial hypertension. For the cooling group (group A), direct regional brain cooling therapy was given after decompressive craniectomy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>] by persistent irrigation of the swollen brain with a cold Hartmann's solution. The temperature range of initial infused fluid was used as the basis to analyze and to further divide Group A into two groups: (1) Deep cooling at a temperature of 20-29&#x000b0;C and (2) mild cooling at a temperature of 30-36&#x000b0;C. The cold infusion was achieved via neurojaf external ventricular drainage (EVD) with multiple side-holes catheter, which was inserted superior to the dura flap and at the inner surface of the dura, sprinkled onto the surface of the swollen brain. The catheter was in contact with the surface of the brain. The 500 ml of Hartmann's solution infusion rate was scheduled within 7 h (70 ml/h). Owing to patients&#x02019; head position setting in the Intensive Care Unit, a second larger draining tube was inserted at the lower part of the craniectomy flap outside the dura, which was loosely closed to drain the excess fluid with a low suction pressure. The temperature of the infused Hartmann's solution was regularly monitored through the three way connector draining the fluid out to the collection port for temperature assessment. If the drained solution's temperature was under or above the intended value (s), the preceding infusion was replaced by a new solution with the correct intended temperature. An immediate CT scan of the brain was indicated if patients&#x02019; ICP showed persistently raised values despite standard therapies being given. This was to exclude any new surgical lesions and/or the retention of infused solution as a cause of raised ICP. However, if the ICP hold within normal values, the CT scan was repeated after 48 h of therapy.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Neurointensive care monitoring and therapy for patients in this study.

The proposed neuroprotective mechanisms include: (a) Hypothermia can inhibit the activation of caspase enzymes, (b) prevents or mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction, (c) decreases the metabolism as well as decrease the overload of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and free oxygen radicals, (d) modifies the cellular disorders of intracellular ion concentrations, (e) suppresses the inflammatory and immunological responses and epileptic activity, (f) reduces the disruption in blood brain barrier, vascular permeability and edema, (g) improves the microcirculatory circuits and intra- and extra-cellular acidosis, (h) corrects the hyperthermia after brain injury and influence the local secretion of various vasoactive mediators secreted by the endothelium, and (i) enhances expression of immediate early genes and cold shock proteins. Building on the vast benefits of cerebral hypothermia, we did a prospective study to test the null hypothesis, &#x0201c;cerebral hypothermia has no benefit on severely injured traumatic brain with initial GCS of 6 and 7&#x0201d;. In the design of our study, several important issues related to induced hypothermia were put into context. First, the area of injury should be cooled. Therefore, brain cooling is the target, not body or scalp cooling. This was thought possible in patients who had decompressive craniectomy and irrigating the brain surface with cold Hartmann's solution and with second drainage tube situated outside the dura which was loosely closed. Furthermore, our experience from endoscopic intraventricular neurosurgery, by routinely irrigating the brain with a large amount of fluid seems safe, without inducing high rate of infectious complications. Second, brain temperature can be different from measured temperature of cooling method or therapy given to the patients. Statement saying &#x0201c;the brain was cooled to certain temperature degree needs to be stated cautiously.&#x0201d; Measured brain temperature depends on many factors, including the location or site of the measuring tip as the inflamed area of the brain would manifest higher brain temperature than non- or less-inflamed brain area.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Third, by applying the concept of increase brain pulsation during compensatory phase of raise ICP, the irrigated regional fluid hopefully will be distributed to other brain regions via principles of vascular and brain pulsations.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Finally, induced hypothermia for the brain can be made below 32&#x000b0;C. An animal study by Oku <italic>et al</italic>. in 2009, disclosed focal brain cooling above 0&#x000b0;C did not induce irreversible histological change or cortical damage.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] This study was carried out based on these four aspects of brain hypothermia and found the complication rate was indeed no difference between the cooling and control groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Group comparison</title><p>It is essential to ensure the studied groups were comparable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> reveals only age has a significant difference between the studied groups. Mean age for no cooling or standard treatment group was higher than cooling groups. Nonetheless, the 95% CIs for those groups were still within non-elderly category. In terms of other parameters: Gender, GCS, ISS, Marshall score and clotting parameters, these were comparable. We purposely limited patient's inclusion to those with severely head injured patients with GCS 6 and 7 only. Since one of our main objectives is to study the true effect of cerebral hypothermia on outcomes, we thought by restricting patients to GCS 6 and 7, we can eliminate other prognostic indicators that may greatly influence the outcomes such as poor motor responses (decerebrate or decorticate posturing). By doing so, we can ascertain the &#x0201c;true benefit of brain cooling&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Proven benefits and reasons</title><p>Patients in cooling group had a higher percentage of good GOS and statistically had a significant difference at 6 months post-trauma when compared to non-cooling group. This finding may conclude that cooling the injured brain has indeed the potential benefits. The benefits of brain hypothermia for the severely injured brain can be explained based upon the pathophysiology of secondary brain injury as discussed above and also because of our method of cooling-our study applied direct regional brain cooling which means the cooling effect was directed toward the region of interests and perhaps via CSF pulsation, the residual cooling effect might have been distributed to the whole brain surfaces. This direct method of brain cooling is currently thought feasible for patients who had decompressive craniectomy. Further analysis on cooling-treated patients after stratifying them into two groups disclosed interesting findings: (a) Mild cooling group, treated at temperature of 30-36&#x000b0;C had fared better 6 months outcomes when compared to no cooling group and b) there was no significant difference for the 6 months post-trauma outcomes when the deep cooling group (temperature ranges from 20&#x000b0;C to 29&#x000b0;C) was compared to the non-cooling group. This signifies mild cooling-treated patients has the most significant benefits; and despite no apparent difference in the incidence of treatment complications, the deep cooling group surprisingly failed to be equally better as mild cooling group. The beneficial effects of mild brain cooling at temperature 30-36&#x000b0;C can partly be explained by our monitored parameters as discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Monitored and studied parameters; and brain cooling</title><p>Various study on hypothermia did notice reduction in ICPs, improvement in CPPs or PtiO<sub>2</sub> after cerebral hypothermia, which translated to better outcomes.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Since our study recruited only trauma patients with severe head injury and required decompressive craniectomy, reduction in ICP was not expected to be a major determinant correlated with outcomes, obviously because decompressive craniectomy itself has been shown to cause significant reduction in ICPs.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] This could also be a reason why, majority of our treated patients with direct regional brain cooling had induced cerebral hypothermia for period up to 48 h only (short period). Besides ICP, cerebral blood flow (CBF) is another important parameter that must be optimized during monitoring the severely injured brain patients in neurointensive care. Interesting to note, the cooling-treated patients did have ascending or improved trends in CPP and brain oxygenation [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>]. These two parameters could indirectly reflect the status of CBF. The mild cooling group did have mean CPP within accepted range of 60-75 mmHg [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>] and mean PtiO<sub>2</sub> ranged from 35 to 48 mmHg [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>] which is within normal range for a normal individual and proven to correlate well with outcome score [<italic>r</italic> = 0.4; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. As noted in other studies, reduction in ICP and optimal CBF parameters could have been contributed to the best long term outcomes for our mild-cooling-treated patients compared to deep- and no-cooling-treated patients.</p><p>Since the neuroinflammatory and metabolic responses happened inside and on the surface of the brain parenchyma, the irrigated cold fluid acts as an exogenous factor to exert mitigating effects on those responses. Therefore, the temperature of the brain should be higher and not be the same as the temperature of the irrigated fluid. This study disclosed that the intended temperature of induced cerebral hypothermia with direct regional brain cooling obviously did not correlate with brain temperature. One new observation noted from this study is brain-body temperature gradient; in mild cooling group, great gradient exists between brain-body temperature at 2-4 h after the therapy, whereas in deep cooling group, the gradient seems to become greater only after 24 h of cooling when both were compared with no cooling group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. The importance of this observation is not yet known and, therefore, need to be reconfirmed by other studies. Finally, findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> proved the previous reported study on brain temperature, which was always higher than the body temperature [0.5-1.5&#x000b0;C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>].[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Severe brain injury will induce significant and protracted inflammatory responses, beginning approximately 1 h after the injury and continuing for several days. Pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF are released in large quantities by astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells. These inflammatory responses can cause significant additional brain injury via synthesis of various toxic products, activation of complements and further stimulating immune reactions in what may become a vicious circle.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In our study, direct regional brain hypothermia seems to suppress all these excessive inflammatory responses. The obvious benefit noted in this study was marked suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Therefore, our findings are in agreement with previous animal and clinical studies, which showed hypothermia decreases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following brain injury.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Nonetheless, to know the true effect of regional brain cooling on immunological biomarkers, one needs also to consider levels in non-cooling group, which was not done in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Limitation and recommendation</title><p>The limitation of this pilot study lies with its small sample size, and irrespective of patient randomization, recruitment of younger patients in the cooling group. Despite of the above mentioned drawbacks, this study could provide a nice foundation for future work on direct hypothermia, which can explore benefits in terms of GOS or other scoring outcomes. Future study to prove the clinical benefits of the present technique clearly need multicenter trials before inferring recommendation for the therapy as a standard of care. In addition, it is also important to consider a longer cooling period of &#x0003e;48 h even in the presence of normalized intracranial pressure and to do future study for patients even with GCS of &#x0003c;6.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This preliminary or pilot study found that direct regional brain hypothermia may have potential benefits in treating the severely head injured patients with initial GCS of 6 or 7. Other than a safe and practicable approach, this direct regional brain cooling therapy may serve as an added therapy for patients who require urgent decompressive craniectomy, irrespective of the underlying etiologies in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was funded by the Short Term Grant of Universiti Sains
