In the United States, 4.0 million adults are living with TKR, and as more adults in the United States undergo TKR, the population at risk for complications increases and the cost of reoperation or continuous management continues to rise (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Weinstein et al., 2013</xref>). Knee joint disorder significantly affects activity competence and restricts daily living, markedly impairing quality of life (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Takemasa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Self-care is required for the first full year after TKR. Self-care refers to individual responsibility for improving health and supporting recovery. (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Omisakin &#x00026; Ncama, 2011</xref>). Self-care behavior at home after TKR includes medication, wound care, monitoring for complications exercise, coping with stress, etc. (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">National Association of Orthopedic Nurses, 2014</xref>). Adequate postdischarge self-care is important for maintaining knee function (KF), activities of daily living (ADL), and life satisfaction (LS) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Oatis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Patients undergoing TKR can tire of the self-care regimen in the months after discharge; as a result, they often become inattentive to self-care over time, which may result in adverse effects such as the loosening of prosthesis, breakdown and abrasion of the polyethylene insert, and joint stiffness (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">National Association of Orthopedic Nurses, 2014</xref>). Self-care is life-long, but monitored and supported at the 1, 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up visits.</p><p>Previous studies reported that telephone counseling for discharged patients was an effective method for management of postdischarge chronic health problems, reducing recurrence and resultant rehospitalization (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Harrison, Hara, Pope, Yong, &#x00026; Rula, 2011</xref>), and that short message service (SMS) texts supported high-quality health self-management at a low cost (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Mukund Bahadur &#x00026; Murray, 2010</xref>). Because TKR patients have temporal restriction on their movements after surgery, telephone counseling or SMS is particularly helpful because the patient does not have to visit the hospital; in addition, the timing is more flexible for both the provider and the recipient. In many hospitals, ward nurses carry out &#x0201c;postdischarge telephone follow-up&#x0201d; to check the patient's medication, wound and drainage management, range of motion, discomfort, satisfaction with nursing and education, etc., but this work can be burdensome to busy nurses. Although telephone counseling provides information needed by the patient; it can be time-consuming for the nurse. SMS texts have the advantage of being convenient and are not time-sensitive; however, they are not responsive to patient need.</p><p>Currently, most hospitals provide postdischarge telephone counseling services, but in response to recent reports that SMS alone produces good results (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Hughes, Done, &#x00026; Young, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Mukund Bahadur &#x00026; Murray, 2010</xref>), there is an increasing interest in the use of SMS. However, no study comparing SMS and telephone counseling, as it applies to TKR patients, has been reported.</p><p>Thus, this study compares KF, ADL and LS of patients who received telephone counseling with that of patients who received SMS texts after TKR.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The purpose of this study was to provide postdischarge telephone counseling or SMS to TKR patients and to analyze the effects of these services on their KF, ADL, and LS.

The minimum required sample size was estimated using the G*Power program (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &#x00026; Lang, 2009</xref>). On the basis of repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a significance level of .05, power of test of 0.90, effect size (<italic>f</italic>) of 0.25, the number of measurements three, and the number of groups two, a total of 36 subjects were required. Considering the expected dropout rate, 43 participants were recruited, numbered at random, and assigned to either the telephone counseling group or the SMS group. As one dropped out of the counseling group and two dropped out of the SMS group, 21 patients in the telephone counseling group and 19 patients in the SMS group participated, and the power of test with 40 participants was 93.5% (0.935).

Changes over time for both groups were not significantly different, indicating that the pattern of change was the same between the telephone counseling group and the SMS group (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In both the telephone counseling group and the SMS group, KF and ADL increased 1 month after surgery compared with presurgery measurements, but LS was not different. In both groups, LS showed a significant difference at 3 months after surgery, suggesting that LS changes slowly. <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Papakostidou et al. (2012)</xref> reported that the change in quality of life was significant 6 weeks after TKR. These findings suggest that quality of life increases during the period between 6 weeks and 3 months from TKR. The outcome of TKR is influenced by personality trait such as life satisfaction (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Giurea et al., 2016</xref>) and postoperative support systems (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 2004</xref>); it is also influenced by cultural characteristics (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Zacharia, Paul, &#x00026; Sherule, 2016</xref>). Long-term intervention and ongoing self-care are required to support TKR patients to achieve LS. The results of this study showed that the effects of telephone counseling and SMS on KF, ADL, and LS of TKR participants were not different. This is contrary to the expectation that direct contact interventions, such as telephone counseling, would be more effective in supporting participants' self-care. In the research with diabetic patients by <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Zolfaghari, Mousavifar, and Haghani (2012)</xref>, the effects of telephone counseling and SMS were the same. In this study, the time for telephone counseling was limited to 5 minutes per session, making it difficult to give detailed answers to participants' questions, but simple questions and answers could be exchanged (telephone counseling was mainly for encouraging, reminding, providing information, and answering basic questions). As SMS is not as inviting to discussion as is telephone counseling, it was more for encouraging exercise, emphasizing self-care, and providing appointment reminders. The results of this study show that SMS was more effective for encouraging and reminding than for the provision of information. This could be because of patients' access to information through the Internet.</p><p>Because SMS is not limited by time and place, it is accessible and convenient. With these merits, information can be provided to recipients regardless of their circumstance and the provider can send the same contents to multiple recipients at the same time, improving economic efficiency (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Ferrer-Roca, Cardenas, Diaz-Cardama, &#x00026; Pulido, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In the past, before patients had access to the Internet, it was reported that counseling played a significant educational role (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Roussi et al., 2010</xref>). Given the accessibly of health-related information today, patients need support implementing this information (not in accessing it). For this reason, giving encouragement and issuing reminders are believed to play an important role in supporting self-care. However, as excessive SMS texts can annoy patients, further research is necessary to identify the optimal frequency and duration of SMS texts.</p><p>In both groups, ADL worsened 1 month after surgery, probably because postoperative physical recovery was not yet complete. In this study, ADL regained the preoperative level 3 months after surgery. Therefore, postoperative change in ADL should be monitored through a longer follow-up period.</p><p>No difference in pattern of change in KF, ADL, and LS was observed between telephone counseling and SMS transmission, implying that SMS is as effective as telephone counseling in supporting postoperative self-care for TKR patients. As such, SMS can substitute for telephone counseling. If SMS is included in the postoperative management protocol, it is important to decide timing and duration. Further studies are needed to determine the most effective content, interval and duration of SMS for promoting self-care.</p><p>Many participants said that telephone counseling and SMS messages helped them trust the hospital and the medical staff, suggesting that these services enhanced participant satisfaction with hospital services. Further study is needed to explore patient satisfaction with medical services, medical expenses, and nursing efficiency when SMS is provided after TKR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Clinical Suggestions</title><p>This study provided postdischarge telephone counseling or SMS to patients with artificial TKR and analyzed the effects of services on their KF, ADL, and LS. A randomized clinical trial design was used for this study, and the participants assigned to either of two groups. The number of participants evaluated was 21 in the telephone counseling group and 19 in the SMS group, with a total of 40. For each group, postdischarge SMS transmission or telephone counseling was conducted six times, and assessment of the participants' KF, ADL, and LS was performed three times: before artificial TKR and 1 month and 3 months after.</p><p>Within each group, KF, ADL, and LS showed a statistically significant difference before artificial TKR in comparison to 1 month and 3 months after, but they were not different between the telephone counseling group and the SMS group. The pattern of change in KF, ADL, and LS was similar between the two groups. These results show that telephone counseling and SMS texts have the same effects on KF, ADL, and LS in TKR participants.</p><p>This research was conducted solely in one university hospital and sample size was small; despite these limitations, this study suggests that SMS is a highly effective intervention to promote patient self-care after TKR. Future research is needed to determine optimal frequency and duration for post-TKR SMS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by the Gachon University research fund of 2015 (GCU-2015-0050).</p><p>The authors have disclosed no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</collab>.
