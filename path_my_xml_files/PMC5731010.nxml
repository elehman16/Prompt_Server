Attention has often been focused on antibiotic therapy administered at different time schedules (before or after surgery or both). This investigation reveals how the use of different molecules and dosages is critical in the postoperative period and has always provided positive result.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methodology:</title><p>A prospective randomized study was carried out in 100 healthy controls of age group 20&#x02013;50 years undergoing transalveolar extraction in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Vivekanandha Dental College for Women. A 5-day regimen of amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin group of antibiotics along with regular analgesics was administered to the patients following transalveolar extraction. The patients were evaluated for postoperative infection, inflammation and wound care on postoperative days: day zero, day 2, day 5, day 7, day 15, day 30, and analyzed.

Antibiotics are the greatest contribution of the 20<sup>th</sup> century to the field of therapeutics.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Clinical and bacteriological and epidemiological factors determine the indication of antibiotic usage in dentistry.

To prevent local infection, as the target microbiota is usually polymicrobial in nature and these infections originate from the possible surgical contamination/infection from the normal microbiota of the mouth and saliva, and from dental pathogens in the periodontal disease, thus, postoperative antibiotic usage is inexorable.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Judicious use of antibiotics following surgical therapy is the most appropriate method to treatment. Narrow spectrum antibiotics should be considered the first choice as it produces less alterations in the gastrointestinal tract.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There is often a dilemma among the dental practitioners concerning the use of antibiotics in conjunction with dental procedures. In this article, we have compared the efficacy of ciprofloxacin over amoxicillin as a primary antibiotic following transalveolar extraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODOLOGY</sc></title><p>A prospective randomized clinical study was carried out in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at our institution on 100 patients who underwent surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar teeth.

The other common reason for tooth extraction, performed by oral surgeons, is to remove wisdom teeth that are poorly aligned/partially impacted third molars or those causing pain or inflammation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] To prevent infection, the following two factors should be achieved: first, decreasing bacterial load in the surgical wound, and second, improving host defenses to prevent the bacteria that inevitably enter the wound from causing clinically evident infection.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] As transalveolar extraction is often graded as Class II surgery (clean-contaminated surgery), the expected infection rate in clean-contaminated surgery is 10%&#x02013;15%.</p><p>The most important principle in antibiotic prophylaxis is to administer the antibiotic at a time that provides high blood and tissue levels at the time of anticipated bacterial contamination of the wound. This was established by experimental studies of dermal lesions in guinea pigs in which it was found that there is a decisive period of up to 3 h after bacterial contamination during which antibiotics will prevent an infective lesion from developing.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In our survey, amoxicillin was the antibiotic of first choice among dentists with a prescription rate of 45.7%.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Second came a combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid at 33.7%.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Ciprofloxacin was used by 14.5% of dentists. Interestingly, none of the respondents used metronidazole or a combination.</p><p>In our study, we found infection rates of 8% and 12% in Groups A (ciprofloxacin) and B (amoxicillin), respectively, suggestive of type of postoperative antibiotics has mild significance in the management of postoperative infection in transalveolar extraction. When the patient is presenting with substance abuse and habits such as smoking, it potentially alter homeostasis and the immune system, causing psychological, and physical alterations. Another contributing factor for postsurgical complications are malnutrition and behavioral issues.</p><p>ACOFS, it has been proven that prolonging antibiotic administration postsurgically does not decrease the incidence of wound infection. For short procedures, a single dose of amoxicillin preoperatively is sufficient to prevent wound infection. For longer procedures, intraoperative doses are given as necessary, followed by final dose in the POD1 and 2 is sufficient for maximum infection control.</p><p>We came across patients with inflammatory complications such as dry socket, erythema, pain and purulent discharge from the surgical site. Postoperative inflammatory complications after transalveolar extractions are reported to occur with frequencies up to 10%. In the study, we observed a postoperative infection rate of 12%, and this is consistent with other studies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Another important contributory factor for developing infection is time or duration of the procedure and manipulation of soft tissue. The mean duration time of procedure was 32.7 min and wound healing was 5.7 days. Although the main reason for delayed wound healing was social status, habits, and malnutrition during postoperative period, we observed that among all those patients whose duration of surgery was less than or equal to 20 min had less chance of developing infection. Only 6.9% of patients who were operated within 25 min had infection whereas 7.6% of the patients who were operated more than 30 min had infection, implying that increased duration of procedure also attributed to develop infection or postoperative complication.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>There are certain limitations in our study that should be addressed. As our sample was limited to the patients in and around our locality, the review was biased toward early discovery, so minor or insignificant infections were included in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Our results are consistent with the previous study. The use of post opeative ciprofloxacin dose has statistically mild significant effect on management of postoperative infection rates in transalveolar extraction. Perioperative prophylactic amoxicillin have been proven to lower infection rates postoperatively and are in wide use. Larger studies with improved control of confounding variables may still need to be conducted to further prove this hypothesis.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ramu</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Padmanabhan</surname><given-names>TV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Indications of antibiotic prophylaxis in dental practice- review</article-title><source>Asian Pac J Trop Biomed</source><year>2012</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>749</fpage><lpage>54</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23570007</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Satterthwaite</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Absi</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antibiotic prescription for acute dental conditions in the primary care setting</article-title><source>Br Dent J</source><year>1996</year><volume>181</volume><fpage>401</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8990560</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whitten</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardiner</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeansonne</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></name><name><surname>Lemon</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current trends in endodontic treatment: Report of a national survey</article-title><source>J Am Dent Assoc</source><year>1996</year><volume>127</volume><fpage>1333</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8854609</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pallasch</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antibiotics in endodontics</article-title><source>Dent Clin North Am</source><year>1979</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>737</fpage><lpage>46</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">294397</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abbott</surname><given-names>PV</given-names></name><name><surname>Hume</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearman</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antibiotics and endodontics</article-title><source>Aust Dent J</source><year>1990</year><volume>35</volume><fpage>50</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2108659</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ragot</surname><given-names>Jean Pierre</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prescription of antibiotics in odontology and stomatology.
