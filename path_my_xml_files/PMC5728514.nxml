However, informed choice is only achieved in a small proportion of decisions made about participation in the MSP [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This uninformed compliance [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is a major public health problem, mainly because it is unclear whether mammography screening is beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many women expect unrealistic benefits of this screening [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A decision is classified as informed, if the decision maker has good knowledge about the options, her/his attitude is congruent with the decision, and she/he then implements this decision [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To enable women invited to the MSP to such an informed choice, they need to be informed about the existing benefits and harms including their probability and to be supported in clarifying the meanings of those benefits and harms for themselves [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Importantly, no correct course of action can be determined [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]&#x02014;only a personally preferred course of action.</p><p>Decision aids (DAs) are an effective way to support informed choices: they improve knowledge about options, increase active engagement in decision making, lead to a higher proportion of choices being in congruence with the decision maker&#x02018;s values, and lower decisional conflict due to feeling uninformed or unclear about ones values [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A typical DA presents risk information both numerically and graphically and includes a type of values clarification exercise. The International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration (IPDAS) [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] developed very comprehensive and widely used standards for DAs. In the context of mammography screening, DAs have the potential to increase the proportion of women making informed choices [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, the magnitude of information materials for all kinds of health decisions is contrasted by a paucity of high-quality decision aids [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lenz et al., taking an inventory of German language DAs, found 12 DAs that had been evaluated in a RCT [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but none of these was on mammography screening. Overall, two types of information materials on the MSP are available: (1) materials published by the Kooperationsgemeinschaft Mammographie which also offers the screening itself; and (2) materials published by health insurances. None of the materials available for the German MSP at the time our study were sufficiently in line with IPDAS criteria [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or systematically evaluated in a RCT. We therefore developed an evidence-based online interactive decision aid for the German MSP. Recently and after the end of our data collection, a printed DA has been developed by the IQWiQ [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but it has not been systematically evaluated in a RCT yet.</p><p>Internationally, DAs on mammography screening have been systematically evaluated. The Cochrane Review [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reports two DAs on mammography screening [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (see DAs 1 and 2 described below). Completively, the Inventory of Decision Aids of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] yields 5 DAs (other than our DA) on mammography screening: (1) a DA for 40-year old women [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], (2) a DA for 70-year old women [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], (3) a DA for women ages 40-49 for deciding screening start age and interval [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], (4) a DA for women with dense breasts [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and (5) a DA with the options of screening start at 40 or 50 [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. None of these DAs is targeted at an average risk population ages 50-69 and three did not present not having a mammography as an option but instead compared different starting ages, screening intervals or additional screening tests.</p><p>The DA for women aged 40 improved knowledge and increased the proportion of women who had made a choice but did not affect the proportion of informed choices [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The DA for women aged 70 increased knowledge and proportion of informed choices [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a RCT comparing a DA for women aged 50 with information on overdetection to a DA without such information [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], more women in the intervention group had adequate knowledge, fewer had a positive attitude, and fewer intended to be screened. In a pre-post study with 75 women ages 40 to 49 [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the DA reduced decisional conflict and had no effect on intention. Therefore, we expect positive effects of our DA on informed choice, knowledge and decisional conflict.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The present study aimed to assess for the first time in Germany the effect of an interactive online DA on informed choice in a RCT with 3 months follow-up. This RCT compared women receiving a DA additional to usual care (i.e., the brochure of the MSP [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) to women only receiving usual care. The DA included both additional information (all cause mortality) as well as a different presentation (crowd figure pictograms and values clarification exercise). The primary objective was to assess whether the DA increases the proportion of women making an informed choice. The secondary objectives were to evaluate whether the DA (1) increases knowledge about the MSP, (2) changes attitudes on the MSP, (3) changes participation intentions, (4) reduces decisional conflict, and (5) reduces decision regret.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in Wesphalia-Lippe, Germany. In our non-blinded two-armed RCT (German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00005176), the participating women were randomised to receive either the DA (intervention group) or usual care (control group). The usual care for women aged 50 in Germany involved, at the time of the study, an invitation to the MSP accompanied by an information brochure (see [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). This brochure contained written and numerical information about the MSP. Both study groups received these standard materials; the intervention group additionally received the DA. The online assessments were conducted at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2, two weeks after T1), and 3 months follow-up (T3).</p><p>The Ethics Commission of the Medical Association Westphalia-Lippe and the Medical Faculty of the University of M&#x000fc;nster approved our study protocol. It was originally planned that women would receive the baseline questionnaire and the DA as well as the post questionnaire in one session. The baseline assessment was moved to two weeks before the intervention and post questionnaire to keep the time needed to work through the DA and respond to the questionnaire to an acceptable level.</p><p>Our study invitation contained information about the content, purpose, and procedure of the study including the information that our trial was conducted independent of the MSP. Once written informed consent was obtained, the participating women were randomised to the intervention or control group by the researchers through an allocation sequence generated by a random number generator (Random.org). Women were only informed about their study group at the second assessment, when they either received the DA or only the questionnaire.</p><p>The invitation to the study was sent by post 3 weeks before the estimated arrival of the MSP invitation (for more details, see the study protocol [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Three weeks after the postal invitation, women consenting to study participation and providing their e-mail address received the link to the baseline questionnaire (T1). Women were e-mailed the link to the second assessment (T2) 2 weeks after the baseline assessment. At T2, women in the intervention group received a link to the DA and the second assessment whereas women in the control group received a link only to the second assessment. The link to the third assessment (T3) was e-mailed to the women 3 months after T2. The screening appointment was assumed to have passed at this time. A reminder was e-mailed 10 days after each survey. Participating women received all 3 e-mails irrespective of their response to the previous questionnaire. Data were collected between April and November 2014. All questionnaires were based on the questionnaire of the study &#x02018;Informed Choice of German and Turkish Women for Participation in the MSP (InEMa)&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Modifications were made to make it suitable for evaluating an intervention and to be used Online (for the original questionnaire see [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). All assessments were linked to each other through a self-generated code.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>The sample of 7,400 women was randomly drawn from registration offices in Westphalia-Lippe, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Women were eligible for the trial if they were aged 50 (birth months of March to May 1964). Women with a potential Turkish migration background (according to a name algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) were assigned to the InEMa study and accordingly, our sample comprised only women without Turkish migration background.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Decision aid</title><p>The intervention group received an online DA which was designed to comply with IPDAS criteria (see the BARMER website where our DA (the DA is in German) was made available after the end of our study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.barmer.de/gesundheit/praevention/krebspraevention/krebsfrueherkennung/mammographie-13876">https://www.barmer.de/gesundheit/praevention/krebspraevention/krebsfrueherkennung/mammographie-13876</ext-link>) and the Decision Aid Library Inventory where it was registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/AZsumm.php?ID=1673">https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/AZsumm.php?ID=1673</ext-link>)).</p><p>Our Online DA consisted of a static information part and an interactive part (see study protocol for a more detailed description [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Mathieu et al.&#x02019;s DA [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] provided the basis for developing the structure of our DA.

The findings of pre-testing the DA resulted in additionally including the likelihood of all cause mortality. Information on all cause mortality was not part of the brochure and the first draft of our DA. Since both experts and women in the qualitative pre-test, thought information on this desirable, we included this information in our DA. As a result, the information content of the DA differed from that of the brochure.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>According to the three-dimensional classification framework of Marteau et al. [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the following dimensions were assessed and the continuous scales were then dichotomously coded: (1) knowledge about the screening, (2) attitude towards the screening, and (3) intention/uptake (depending on measurement point). A choice to take part in the MSP was considered to be informed, if a woman had adequate knowledge, positive attitude and positive intention/uptake [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A choice not to participate in the MSP was considered to be informed, if a woman had adequate knowledge, negative attitude and no intention/uptake [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, a dichotomous primary outcome resulted (informed/uninformed). Informed choice is thus dependent on both the dimensions used as well as the cut-points employed to dichotomise the continuous dimensions knowledge and attitude.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>We used a similar approach to assess knowledge as in a previous study on screening decisions [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] using seven multiple choice items: (1) target group of the MSP, (2) number of women receiving a positive result, (3) whether a positive screening result equals a diagnosis, (4) existence of false negatives, (5) number of diagnoses in screened vs unscreened populations, (6) number of breast cancer deaths in screened vs unscreened populations, and (7) existence of overtreatment. Questions 1 and 3 to 7 assessed conceptual knowledge. Only Question 2 assessed numerical knowledge with four value ranges as response options. This numerical information was considered to be especially important as the number of women receiving a positive mammography screening result (as opposed to a negative screening result) is the most proximal screening outcome. Each correct answer was scored 1 point; items were then summed to calculate the knowledge index (range 0 to 7). To calculate informed choice, the knowledge index was dichotomised. We used a marking scheme for the knowledge index that is similar to previous research [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and decided a priori that a mark of 50% or above (score &#x0003e; 3) would be considered as adequate knowledge (see study protocol for a more detailed description of all outcome measures [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]).</p><p>Attitude was measured according to the reasoned action approach of Fishbein and Ajzen [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The four items were adapted from Marteau et al. [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] for use with mammography screening and rated on a five-point scale. To calculate informed choice, the scale ranging from -8 to +8 was dichotomised: a scale score of &#x02265; 0 represented a positive attitude.</p><p>Intention to participate in the MSP and self-reported uptake were each measured using one item: intention to participate in the MSP in the next 3 months (yes/no/undecided) and uptake of the MSP in the last 3 months (MSP/opportunistic screening/none). To calculate informed choice, intention was dichotomised as &#x02018;participation in the MSP in the next 3 months&#x02019; and &#x02018;no participation in the MSP in the next 3 months&#x02019; and undecided women were excluded. In addition, women who reported at T2 to want to participate in opportunistic screening were excluded. Consequently, only those were categorised as women with a positive intention, who intended to participate in the MSP in the next 3 months (this category did not include women intending to participate in opportunistic screening or intending to participate in the MSP at some time beyond the three months), and only those were categorised as women with a negative intention, who neither intended to participate in the MSP nor in opportunistic screening in the next 3 months (this category also did not include undecided women). At T3, behaviour was dichotomised as &#x02018;participation in the MSP&#x02019; and &#x02018;no participation in the MSP&#x02019;. Women who had taken part in opportunistic screening were excluded.</p><p>Decisional conflict was measured using the 4-item SURE (Sure of myself; Understand information; Risk-benefit ratio; Encouragement) test [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To calculate the total score &#x02018;uncertainty&#x02019; all items were summed (score range 0 to 4) with a high value indicating high decisional conflict. Decision regret was measured at T3 using the Decision Regret Scale [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Decision stage was measured with one item with the response options &#x02018;not thought about&#x02019;, &#x02018;contemplating it&#x02019;, &#x02018;close to deciding&#x02019;, and &#x02018;choice already made&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analysed with SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Corp., Armonk, NY) and MPlus version 7.0 (Muthen &#x00026; Muthen, Los Angeles, CA).

[<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>All secondary outcomes with several indicators (i.e., knowledge, attitude, decisional conflict, decision regret) were modelled as latent variables which allowed to account for measurement error and to test measurement invariance. Since measurement invariance is necessary to conduct and interpret analyses on longitudinal multigroup data [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], measurement invariance levels were tested across time and group before analyses of intervention effects were performed. Partial invariance (i.e., invariance of the majority of indicators, with some parameters being freely estimated) was tested if full measurement invariance was not tenable. Partial measurement invariance is unproblematic when only few loadings or intercepts are variant [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, modelling outcomes as latent variables allowed us to apply full information maximum likelihood estimation enabling us to include individuals with missing values in the analysis. To test the intervention effect, autoregressive latent models [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] were applied with group (0 = control, 1 = DA) predicting T2 and T3 latent outcomes. A first order autoregressive effect of T1 on T2 and a second order autoregressive effect of T1 on T3 were specified. The autoregressive path between T2 and T3 was fixed to 0 to allow a comparison to the baseline measurement. For scale setting, all models were calculated using the Fixed-Factor-Method [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Two types of latent analyses were conducted: (1) Numeric secondary outcome items forming a continuous latent factor (i.e., attitude and decision regret) were analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). For these models, model fit was evaluated using the following goodness-of-fit indices: Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). A model with acceptable fit should yield a CFI &#x02265; 0.90, TLI &#x02265; 0.90 and a RMSEA &#x02264; 0.08 [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For the CFA models, the assumption of the respective invariance level held, if the CFI difference to the model of the previous invariance level was &#x02264; .01 [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For our analyses, data had to be strong-factorially invariant (loadings and intercepts of the indicators equal over time and group) [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>(2) Categorical secondary outcomes forming a continuous latent factor (i.e., decisional conflict and knowledge) were analysed using 2-parameter-logistic item factor analysis (IFA).

Women who ever had breast cancer (n = 29), and women, who did not respond to this question (n = 26), were excluded from the analyses.

As hypothesised, the DA resulted in a greater proportion of informed choices, a higher knowledge level, and less decisional conflict. Contrary to our hypothesis, decision regret was not reduced by the DA. For attitude and intention/uptake, we did not formulate specific hypotheses. Our results for these outcomes were mixed: depending on the measurement point, we either found a decrease or no effect of the DA on these measures.</p><p>In the control group the proportion of uninformed choices was constant at about 70%. This confirms the results of a previous German study, according to which very few decisions about the MSP are made informed [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our results at both post intervention and follow-up show that our DA led to more informed decisions than the existing information materials, that were provided with the invitation, were able to achieve alone. Previous research on levels of informed choice after exposure to a DA on mammography screening shows mixed results. Mathieu et al. (2007) evaluating a DA for women aged 70 reported a greater proportion of women making an informed choice [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] while Mathieu et al. (2010) in their cross-sectional study on women aged 40 found no difference in the proportion of women making an informed choice [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Regarding our secondary outcomes, the DA showed different effects. The proportion of adequate knowledge at baseline with less than one-third must be seen as low. Contrastingly, Hersch et al. reported correct responses to knowledge items of over 70% at baseline in an Australian study [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a cross-sectional survey in the Netherlands, Agt et al. assessed only conceptual knowledge and reported 95% of women to have sufficient knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These differences may in part be explained by differences between mammography screening information materials and programmes in the different countries. Another possible explanation is that the different knowledge measures account for these wide discrepancies. Existing knowledge measures differ in content, difficulty, number of items and response formats. Our DA group had a higher knowledge level than the control group at post-intervention and follow-up. This is in line with the Cochrane review according to which DAs in general lead to higher knowledge than usual care [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Regarding a DA for mammography screening, Mathieu et al. (2007) found a significant increase in knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similarly, Mathieu et al. (2010) also reported a significant effect of their DA on knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>It remains unclear which component of our DA or which combination of components is responsible for the knowledge increase. Crowd figures using circles or pictograms to indicate the number of affected and unaffected people have been shown to increase accuracy of risk perception [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189148.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. DAs always interact with other factors. Petrova et al. conducted an experiment on 3 presentation formats for statistical information about breast cancer (text, fact box, visual aid) and found no main effect of information format on number of correct comprehension questions [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Presenting numerical information accompanied by a visual aid improved knowledge compared to alternative formats only when perceived severity of the disease was not extremely high [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Previous beliefs about mammography screening as well as a high level of fear of breast cancer interfere with comprehension of evidence based information and thus hinder knowledge increase and informed choices [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Both groups had, at all measurement points, a very positive attitude towards participation in the MSP. Hersch et al. and Agt et al. similarly reported that most women had a positive attitude [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Post-intervention, we found no differences between groups. In contrast, at follow-up, the DA group had a more negative attitude than the control group. Our DA may have made the women feel less positive about screening through increasing their knowledge about the low personal benefit of screening, but it remains questionable why this effect did not occur at post-intervention. Similarly, Mathieu et al. reported no difference in attitude in their DA group [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>At baseline and post-intervention, the majority of participating women responded that they would participate in the MSP within the next 3 months. At T3, in both groups, the majority had participated in the MSP. Intention to participate was lower in the DA group post-intervention. The uptake rate was unaffected by our DA regardless of a lower post-intervention intention to participate. Regarding intention and uptake, the effect of DAs is not clear. One study reported no effect on intention following a DA [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] whereas others did find a lower intention following a DA [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or in the DA group [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The situation is similar for uptake with research showing no effect on uptake [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as well as lower uptake in the DA group [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to the Cochrane review, DAs with an explicit values clarification exercise were more likely to lead to a value congruent choice [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but there is no clear effect on intention per se. Depending on the type of screening or treatment offered, more information will have a positive, no, or a negative effect. This argument similarly applies to attitude.</p><p>The proportion of women at follow-up not having participated in the MSP was significantly higher than the intention to not participate in the MSP at post-intervention. Apart from a true change of mind, other explanations have to be taken into account. We assessed intention to participate within the next 3 months. Accordingly, some women will have had the intention to take part in the next three months but either received the invitation to the MSP so late that the appointment at our third measurement point had not yet passed orsome barrier hindered an intended attendanceand the appointment was postponed. Potentially, social desirability may have been a factor influencing intention responses, since in a context where early detection is seen as something good by society, an intention to not participate may be perceived as deviant and thus not reported. Retrospective uptake responses may not be biased as strongly as screening attendance either has or has not occurred.</p><p>The DA group had lower decisional conflict than the control at both post-intervention and follow-up. This is in congruence withthe Cochrane review reporting overall, a reduction in decisional conflict following a DA [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Contrastingly, two randomised controlled studies on mammography screening reported no effect of a DA on decisional conflict [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189148.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] whereas one study found lower decisional conflict [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, this may be different for various subgroups of women resulting in opposing effects. Many women have decided before contact with a DA [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This then may cause more decisional conflict if personal preference and scientific evidence do not match; i.e., a DA can increase decisional conflict [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. DAs are also seen most positive by women who merely verify their previous decision with the DA [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. At present it is uncertain whether high decisional conflict is a good or a bad thing [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], since high decisional conflict could be an indicator for an active deliberation process [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] as well as for insufficient decision support.</p><p>Most women experienced no decision regret and this was not affected by the DA. This is in line with other research. According to the Cochrane review, only 7 studies assessed decision regret and none reported statistically significant differences [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>At baseline, the majority of women indicated they had already made a decision which is similar to a RCT by Hersch et al. [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our study groups were similar in decision stage at post-intervention and follow-up. This may be explained by our DA only being relevant for women who have not yet formed a decision. Thus, decision stage in our study would not have been expected to alter since the majority had already made the decision leaving little room for decision process progression.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Major strengths of this study were its design as a RCT and as one of the first the follow-up at 3 months. This allowed the evaluation of long-term effects of the DA (e.g., the persistence of increased knowledge) and also of screening uptake. Importantly, another strength of this research is that we developed and evaluated the DA in accordance with IPDAS criteria which are designed to ensure a minimum level of quality for DAs. Our DA was systematically developed and evidence based. The brochure that was in use during our study and was thus the usual care, had been in use since September 2010 and openly discussed benefits and harms of the MSP [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Only some but not all statistics were presented in absolute numbers [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Gummersbach and Abholz indicate that a graphical presentation of the numbers may have been useful and that the probable lack of effect on overall mortality should be mentioned [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. All 3 points were all fulfilled by our DA but not by the brochure.</p><p>Most respondents received the questionnaire at about the time of receipt of the official invitation materials. This ensured a high relevance of the decision. Some women had not yet received the invitation to the MSP and the associated brochure. Thus, the timing of the decision and the availability of usual care information materials was heterogeneous. Since the information brochure is also available online, it remains speculative how whether the women not yet having received their invitation had access to it.</p><p>To avoid the potential disruptive influence of previous screening experiences or habits, only women aged 50 who are invited for the first time to the MSP were included in the study. Our study achieved acceptable response and attrition rates but it has to be noted that women participating in our study will likely have been different from those not participating: in particular, it can be assumed that they may have been more interested in mammography screening as a topic and thus may probably have informed themselves about this topic more than the general population.</p><p>Since the sample we drew from the population registries was representative except for women with Turkish migration background, our results cannot be applied to this group. We had almost no women in our sample whose main language did not include German. Women whose mother tongue was not German may have been less likely to participate in our study.</p><p>In calculating informed choice, intention to participate in the MSP within the next three months was used as one of 3 dimensions. Consequently, women whose appointment was at a later date were classified as non-intenders and an artificial mismatch (or match) between attitude and intention would be created due to the time frame of the intention question. This time limitation may explain some of the inconsistencies between attitude and intention that have been categorised as uninformed decision [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, a limitation of the period was important for the validity of the question [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Assessed uptake at T3, since it was self-reported, will have deviated to some degree from actual uptake.</p><p>Using latent structural equation models for our analyses had several advantages. (1) We could explicitly account for measurement error. (2) Testing measurement invariance across time and groups enabled us to establish a crucial prerequisite for testing our intervention effect. Measurement invariance entails that the same construct is measured regardless of time or group. Thus, the item specific information is unaffected by these contextual factors [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. (3) In order to deal with missing values, we could apply full information maximum likelihood estimation allowing us to include individuals with missing values in the analysis.</p><p>The knowledge index contained only some facts about the MSP. These have been carefully selected, however, by no means cover the entire spectrum of possibly decision relevant facts. Additionally, we had to exclude one item, which did not differentiate women with a high or low knowledge level. It remains speculative, what caused this problem in this item.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Practice implications and future research</title><p>An important aspect for future research is the influence of affect on information processing, especially since decisions about cancer screening involve counterintuitive evidence [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] like overdiagnoses. When cancer is perceived as a severe condition, understanding of screening statistics can be reduced [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, when the consequences of a decision are affect-rich (e.g., when women experience fear of breast cancer) heuristic processes are engaged, which neglect this probabilistic information [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Hence, for women in our study with strong previous beliefs, the effect of our DA may have been limited. Previous research showed that visual aids have no benefits for women regarding breast cancer as highly severe condition [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These women might have rather relied on established beliefs being less motivated to engage with the visual aids than women experiencing less severe affect regarding breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These moderating and mediating factors will be interesting to assess in future research.</p><p>Since almost all trials on DAs fail to assess potential long-term effects on health or quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]&#x02014;and our study is no exception to this&#x02014;it would be interesting not only to include these measures but also to see how the different outcome groups of screening (false-positives, negatives, true positives) affect these measures. We assessed screening outcomes, but in this time span, to few events for any calculations occurred.</p><p>It can be hypothesised that the effect of the DA will be larger in women with higher health literacy. It remains questionable in how far a one size fits all approach will ever be feasible for a DA on the MSP. Not only should a DA be available in different languages and for different levels of health literacy but also for women with differing existing knowledge levels and finally with differing motivations to engage with this decision. A tailored approach therefore, may be indicated in future DA developments. Alternatively, at least regarding health literacy levels, a universal precautions approach may be beneficial although it may be difficult to keep the DA to an acceptable length. A possibility may be to further develop the DA to include more explanatory information sections that can be accessed if desired (e.g., as mouse hover boxes).</p><p>After the end of our study, the information brochure of the MSP has been updated [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and, additionally, was further developed into a DA and a concept for a future online version [<xref rid="pone.0189148.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The new materials have not yet been evaluated in an RCT and a comparison with our DA would be interesting.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to assess the impact of an online DA for the German MSP in a RCT. The DA developed in this project is a valuable tool to support decision making and has been implemented through making it publicly available on the website of the BARMER since December 2015. Since the DA has proven to be effective in supporting women to make an informed choice, the results are relevant to practice and the DA can be widely used to support women in decision making. The DA also significantly increased women&#x02019;s knowledge about the screening and decreased decisional conflict.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189148.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Original application to the ethics committee in German.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189148.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189148.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>English translation of the application to the ethics committee.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189148.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189148.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189148.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Emily Finne and Dr. Johanna Ute Frisch for their valuable comments to the manuscript.
