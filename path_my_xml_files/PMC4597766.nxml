Its management often requires a costly hospital stay and multidisciplinary care due to high morbidity and mortality induced by sepsis, hemorrhage, malnutrition and electrolyte disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Staged fistula treatment involves recognition and stabilization, anatomic definitioxn and decision, and definitive operation. With sufficient time, conservative treatment can result in spontaneous fistula closure, with rates varying from 15&#x000a0;% to 71&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this also results in long-term discomfort.</p><p>Use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract has been shown to promote closure of low-output ECFs. As a noninvasive option, it could avoid the risk of developing further dehiscence compared to surgical operations. The application of glue has been reported in recent years for intestinal fistula in case reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and small series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Commercial fibrin sealants are usually made from porcine/bovine blood products, whereas autologous adhesives have potential advantages, such as a low risk of infection transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and provision of a matrix for tissue regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Both are used in clinical practice, but they have not yet been compared to fistula sealing.</p><p>Our previous study demonstrated that autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue (PRFG) treatment significantly decreased time the time to fistula closure and promoted closure rates. During the follow-up, no treatment-related adverse events or severe adverse events were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The previous study was a prospective, nonrandomized single-center study. There were several limitations in the nonrandomized study, which may have led to bias in our conclusion. Thus, a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial is designed to evaluate the glue application in the treatment of patients with low-output volume ECFs.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of glue sealing (using PRFG or the commercially available fibrin sealant Yueling&#x02122;) in the management of patients with low-output ECFs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The trial is designed as a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial with three parallel groups (two treatment groups and one control group) and a primary endpoint of fistula closure time during the 14-day treatment period. The randomization will be performed by Internet-based software with a 1:1:1 allocation.

The SOC comprises supportive measures to stabilize the fistula patient, including fluid/electrolyte balance, bowel rest, nutritional replacement, wound care, and antibacterial therapy in patients with signs of systemic sepsis or inflammation with pain. Nasogastric or nasointestinal feeding will be provided whenever possible; otherwise, parenteral nutrition along with 0.9&#x000a0;g/24&#x000a0;h somatostatin (Stilamin, Serono, Switzerland) will be infused intravenously. To assist in remission of infection, normal saline will be dripped continuously to rinse the fistula tracts; at the same time, percutaneous suction drainage of these tracts is conducted. Nursing staff monitor the daily external output by collecting output volumes. Once the daily fistula volumes decrease to 200&#x000a0;ml, the patients will be evaluated by the coordinating center.</p><p>For patients in Group A, autologous PRFG is prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The platelet-rich cryoprecipitate and thrombin are obtained from the whole blood of patients in Group A at least 24&#x000a0;h prior to the start point. Blood collecting packs, prepared with anticoagulant (citrate phosphate dextrose), are used for the collection of whole blood (300 to 400&#x000a0;ml). The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is separated from the blood by centrifugation at 6&#x000a0;min at 1,000 x<italic>g</italic> twice at ambient temperature. The PRP is transferred to a new pack, and the amount will be determined by weight. From 40&#x000a0;g PRP, equally transferred to two new 300&#x000a0;ml empty packs, the euglobulin fraction is precipitated by dilution with 180&#x000a0;ml citric acid (2.84&#x000a0;mM) in each pack. After thorough mixing, the pack is centrifuged at 3,000 x<italic>g</italic> for 5&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The supernatant is removed and the precipitate dissolves in 1.625&#x000a0;ml CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.1&#x000a0;M). The pH is adjusted by the addition of 1.0&#x000a0;ml NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (75&#x000a0;mM) in order to initiate the activation of the prothrombin to thrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The clot formation is terminated after 30&#x000a0;minutes, and the liquid thrombin solution is removed into microcentrifuge tubes. At the same time, the cryoprecipitate is produced from the rest of the plasma, which is frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for at least 6&#x000a0;h first and then thawed at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After centrifugation at 4,000&#x000a0;rpm/min for 8&#x000a0;min, the cryoprecipitate is harvested by removal of the cryoprecipitate-poor plasma. When applied, fibrinogen and thrombin are thawed at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C from &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until recovery of the liquid state.</p><p>Patients in Group B receive glue sealing with commercial sealants. The Porcine Fibrin Sealant Kit (Yueling&#x000ae;, Hangzhou Puji Medical Technology Co. Ltd, Hangzhou, China) is composed of freeze-dried powder of fibrinogen and thrombin and of relevant solutions. Stored at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the kit needs to reach room temperature. Then fibrinogen (Component I, &#x0003e; 30&#x000a0;mg/ml) is dissolved by sodium chloride solution (Activator I, 6.0 to 7.0&#x000a0;mg/ml), and thrombin (Component II, 450 to 850&#x000a0;IU/ml) is dissolved by calcium chloride solution (Activator II, 35.0 to 45.0&#x000a0;mg/ml).</p><p>When receiving glue sealing, the patients in the two treatment groups will have drainage cessation. Two main components of FG are placed separately in a double-syringe system with distal mixing catheter. When applied, equal amounts of fibrinogen and thrombin are mixed and the fibrin sealants are to form within 10&#x000a0;seconds. In order to assure total occlusion of the internal hole, the full length of the fistula tract must be determined by image examination prior to the procedure or with assistance of endoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The glue-sealing procedure could be repeated up to three times within the 14-day glue treatment period. A repeat sealing could be conducted if the fistula persists for 5&#x000a0;days after the first procedure. After the 14-day period, patients who fail to achieve medical closure are evaluated to further exclude possible factors disturbing healing, such as infection, foreign body, <italic>etcetera.</italic> These unhealed fistulas will either be treated by definitive surgery or continue to be treated conservatively based on the patient&#x02019;s best interest and the physicians&#x02019; discretion.</p><p>Once glue sealing is applied, parenteral nutrition that provides calories of 20 to 25&#x000a0;kcal/kg is initiated through the peripheral vein or central venous catheter. Fistula drainage will be evaluated every day until the drainage decreases to zero, which is defined as fistula closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It also needs confirmation by contrast enhanced computed tomography at each follow-up visit to verify the complete closure of internal and external openings of the fistula tract. When the closure is achieved, a nasointestinal tube is to be placed and the enteral feeding (2,000&#x000a0;ml/d) is restarted gradually. Other SOC measures can be conducted when needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the trial is fistula closure time (defined as the interval between the day of enrollment and day of fistula closure) during the 14-day treatment period. Fistula closure is defined as complete closure of the fistula tract and internal and external openings later, which will be confirmed by contrast enhanced computed tomography at each follow-up visit where there is no drainage or any sign of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the primary outcome measure of fistula closure, secondary outcomes include closure rates up to 14&#x000a0;days, closure rates up to 180&#x000a0;days, fistula recurrence rates and the incidence of adverse events and severe adverse events up to 180&#x000a0;days (defined as an event that was fatal or life-threatening, led to additional hospitalization or disability or required an intervention to prevent one of these outcomes).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participant timeline</title><p>All patients with ECFs in each study site receive SOC, and the fistula output will be evaluated every day. In case of daily output less than 200&#x000a0;ml, the inclusion criteria will be assessed, and imaging examination will be performed to exclude abscesses, obstruction, <italic>etcetera.</italic> Then participants are randomly allocated to Group A (autologous fibrin glue), Group B (commercial fibrin glue) or Group C (drainage cessation). Once enrolled and allocated to Group A, autologous PRFG needs to be prepared. The study period is set as 14&#x000a0;days after the day of enrollment, and fistula drainage will be evaluated every day. All patients are followed up for at least 180&#x000a0;days. The outpatient visits will be scheduled for 1&#x000a0;month, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months after enrollment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design. Patients are randomly allocated to group A (autologous fibrin glue), group B (commercial fibrin glue) or group C (drainage cessation). After glue application or drainage cessation, fistula drainage will be evaluated for 14 days, during which a maximum of three times of glue sealing will be conducted for patients in groups A and B. Both efficacy and safety outcomes will be assessed during the whole study period.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_966_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size is to be calculated based on detecting the minimal, clinically relevant difference in the success rates of the three arms. Our preliminary study, which enrolled 145 patients, compared the efficacy of PRFG application (PRFG group) with drainage cessation (control group) when low output volume was achieved (&#x0003c;200&#x000a0;ml/d). During the 28-day treatment period, 77&#x000a0;% (58/75) of the patients in the PRFG group experienced fistula closure in comparison to 57&#x000a0;% (40/70) in the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0127) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The unpublished data of the pilot study demonstrated that closure rates were 80&#x000a0;% (60/75) in the PRFG group and 50&#x000a0;% (35/70) in the control group during the 14-day observation period. Due to the above raw data, the closure rates in the two treatment groups and one control group are assumed to be 80&#x000a0;% and 50&#x000a0;%, respectively. In this way, 51 patients per group are needed for this trial based on an alpha of 0.05, with a power of 90&#x000a0;%. Taking into account a drop-out rate of 10&#x000a0;%, a total sample size of 171 patients would be included, with 57 participants in each group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Coordination</title><p>A clinical coordinating center in each participating site is established to identify subject eligibility for the study and to provide support to investigators and study personnel throughout the study period. The coordinating center consists of a principle investigator and a well-trained study coordinator. Research coordinators are required to screen all fistula patients in each study center for eligibility once a day, either the morning or afternoon. The patient cannot be enrolled until their eligibility is confirmed by the treating physician. Then, the study coordinator will obtain written informed consent from the patient. Patients will be consecutively enrolled at each of the participating centers whenever a study coordinator is available for enrollment.

Currently, fibrin glue is indicated only in treating simple ECFs of low-output volume as a first line therapeutic option. Therefore, complex or high-output ECFs are excluded from this study. In addition, this study is designed as an open-label, three-arm study, with autologous and commercial fibrin glue in two treatment groups and drainage cessation for use as a placebo. Because the autologous fibrin sealants require blood donation from patients themselves, patient blinding cannot be conducted. Further, there is a possibility that spontaneous closure can be achieved for fistula patients. Therefore, the control group is being established for comparison of the efficacy and safety of the glue application. In this way, this study is designed as an open-label and three-arm study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study was conceived and designed in 2014.
