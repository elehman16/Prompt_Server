There are a number of small studies which have examined possible methods of case finding through primary care, but no large RCTs that have adequately assessed the most cost-effective approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this study, using a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) in 56 general practices in the West Midlands, we plan to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a Targeted approach to case finding for COPD compared with routine practice. Using an individual patient RCT nested in the Targeted arm, we plan also to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Active case finding using a postal questionnaire (with supplementary opportunistic questionnaires), and Opportunistic-only case finding during routine surgery consultations.</p><p>All ever-smoking patients aged 40-79 years, without a current diagnosis of COPD and registered with participating practices will be eligible. Patients in the Targeted arm who report positive respiratory symptoms (chronic cough or phlegm, wheeze or dyspnoea) using a brief questionnaire will be invited for further spirometric assessment to ascertain whether they have COPD or not. Post-bronchodilator spirometry will be conducted to ATS standards using an Easy One spirometer by trained research assistants.</p><p>The primary outcomes will be new cases of COPD and cost per new case identified, comparing targeted case finding with routine care, and two types of targeted case finding (active <italic>versus</italic> opportunistic). A multilevel logistic regression model will be used to model the probability of detecting a new case of COPD for each treatment arm, with clustering of patients (by practice and household) accounted for using a multi-level structure.</p><p>A trial-based analysis will be undertaken using costs and outcomes collected during the trial. Secondary outcomes include the feasibility, efficiency, long-term cost-effectiveness, patient and primary care staff views of each approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This will be the largest RCT of its kind, and should inform how best to identify undiagnosed patients with COPD in the UK and other similar healthcare systems.

In the UK it accounts for 1.4 million GP consultations, 1 million in-patient days per year and costs the NHS over &#x000a3;800 million per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, around 45-85% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], depending on diagnostic criteria, remain undiagnosed, representing many with potentially unmet need. There is much uncertainty about how to approach early identification of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], although it has been recently demonstrated that there are many missed opportunities to diagnose patients in primary care where signs and symptoms have been overlooked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The CMO's report, 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the Healthcare Commission report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] highlighted the burden of COPD, the extent of under-diagnosis and variation in access to relevant services. As a result a National Clinical Outcomes Strategy has been published recommending case finding in high risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], resulting in a British Lung Foundation campaign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and drive to identify missing cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Several NHS Trusts have started initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Despite the move towards early case-finding for COPD, the most effective and cost-effective approach is not known. There are no relevant published systematic reviews, though many small pre-post studies have reported on approaches to case finding. These report either active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or opportunistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] approaches (with yield 18-47%), but are limited because of a lack of comparison groups, restricted number and range of participants, incomplete follow up or different target populations. More recently a few trials have been published. A small trial from a single practice reported a higher prevalence of airflow obstruction with an opportunistic compared to invitation based approach to case finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The population however was highly deprived, with many non-English speakers, and no economic analysis was undertaken. A cluster RCT in 16 general practices in the Netherlands which used an initial screening questionnaire to identify patients at risk found that a practice-managed approach to calculating the score and inviting patients for spirometry assessment was more effective than a patient-led approach of applying for spirometry assessment having calculated their own scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, we have also reported a pilot study in two general practices which suggested that it may be more cost-effective to undertake opportunistic screening; however the study was underpowered and the results require proper testing in a full RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The limitation of the current evidence base and lack of adequate data from RCTs contributed to the recent recommendation by the UK National Screening Committee against screening for COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and justifies a new adequately-powered trial.</p><p>Many studies have used spirometry alone to screen for COPD. However this is not recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as it would identify many without clinically important disease for whom there is little evidence of effective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend opportunistic case finding in those presenting with relevant symptoms and exposures (mainly smoking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our analysis of the Health Survey for England (HSE), a large dataset representative of the English population, shows that targeted case-finding among smokers aged &#x02265;40 with relevant symptoms would have greater yield than targeting the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Of the undiagnosed cases likely to be detected, more than three quarters could benefit from evidence based treatment (e.g. pulmonary rehab, inhaled therapies, vaccination &#x00026; smoking cessation interventions), and there is new evidence that others may also benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Modelling of data from the Health Survey for England indicated that active case-finding (with postal questionnaire plus opportunistic case-finding in primary care consultations) would be more effective than opportunistic case-finding alone, but this needs empirical testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Cases identified are expected to benefit from treatment resulting in improved quality of life, increased survival, reduction in hospital admissions and less work-related absence. Published economic evaluations in COPD have primarily considered interventions for the disease rather than diagnosis, and others have concentrated on the costs of COPD in burden of illness studies. No trial-based economic evaluation has considered case-finding. NICE guidelines included simple decision-tree based modelling to determine the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic case finding among ever smokers over 35&#x000a0;years old with chronic cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The model is simplistic, contains many assumptions and requires better data on the natural history of the disease. The proposed cost-effectiveness component of this study will resolve this issue.</p><p>In this study, using a cluster RCT in general practices across the West Midlands, we plan to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a Targeted approach to case finding for COPD compared with routine practice. Using an individual patient RCT nested in the targeted arm, we plan also to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Active case finding using a postal questionnaire (with supplementary opportunistic questionnaires), and Opportunistic case finding at routine surgery consultations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To determine whether Targeted case finding is more effective and cost-effective than routine practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two alternative methods of targeted case finding: Active (postal questionnaire plus flagging of patient records) versus Opportunistic (flagging only).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>TargetCOPD is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of a case-finding intervention, delivered at organisational level, with two elements (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>):<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Any linked practices (those practices that have the same GPs across two sites, each with a different patient list) will be stratified so that the allocation to trial arm will be the same in order to avoid contamination.

The current NICE guidance is that patients with appropriate chronic respiratory symptoms must also meet spirometric criteria (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

However this definition is controversial, and therefore, we propose also to use the &#x0201c;Lower Limit of Normal&#x0201d; (LLN) definition using the recently established GLI 2012 equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This requires that the post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio falls below the 5th percentile of the predicted values for patients&#x02019; age, height, sex and ethnicity. All patients must also report chronic respiratory symptoms. In sensitivity analyses we will explore other definitions such as use of different cut-offs for the LLN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional data collection</title><p>Data on the practices and patients will be collected at several stages during the trial:</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Practice level information</title><p>Information on the characteristics of each of the participating practices will be collected, to include list size, number of eligible patients, number of existing COPD patients, deprivation score, rural/urban status, ethnicity profile, number of GPs, designated practice contacts and age profile of the practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Information on all eligible patients</title><p>At baseline, practices will provide an anonymised dataset on each of the eligible patients (in both routine practices and targeted arms) to allow comparison between the arms of the trial.

Assuming therefore a conservative 1000 eligible patients per practice of average list size 6000, and adjusting for clustering of patients within practices, assuming a conservative ICC of 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] the sample size required was 27,768 per arm, equivalent to 28 practices per arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>(b) Targeted arm: Active versus opportunistic case finding</title><p>The following estimates are based on assumptions drawn from the authors&#x02019; previous modelling work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We assume 50% allocated to the Active arm will respond; of the remaining patients 91% will visit their GP at least once in 12&#x000a0;months, 50% are offered the questionnaire and 90% of these will fill it out. In the Opportunistic arm we assume 50% are offered the questionnaire and of these 90% complete questionnaires (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of all responders to the questionnaire in both arms, we assume 48% are likely to report symptoms and be invited to spirometry, of which 70% will attend and 17% of these will have COPD. This leads to yield of 2.3% in the Opportunistic and 4.0% in the Active arms. At a 0.25% significance level, 3904 patients/arm are required to detect this difference with 90% power.</p><p>For the targeted case finding comparison, there will be 19,152 eligible in each arm, giving ample power for the primary comparison (based on above assumptions 448 new cases from Opportunistic arm and 771 from Active arm). This sample size provides additional power for secondary analyses and also allows more flexibility should the assumptions be more optimistic than anticipated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Statistics and data analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses will be undertaken in STATA version 13.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Primary analyses</title><p>There are two primary comparisons:</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Targeted case finding vs Routine care (cluster design)</title><p>Baseline characteristics of patients and uptake rate at each stage will be described for each cluster, and compared across clusters to check for balance across groups.

An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from a health care perspective will determine the cost per additional case detected, with a sensitivity analysis taking into account patient out of pocket costs in addition to health care costs. True cases of COPD detected by each method will be determined within the trial. The cost of case finding and spirometry will be established within the trial, and resource use data will be collected for each method and will include staff time, equipment, diagnostic testing and any consumables required. Data will be collected from a representative sample of practices to ensure generalisability. Unit costs (e.g. staff costs, equipment) will be collected from published sources. In addition a patient cost questionnaire will be administered to all who attend for spirometry to determine their out of pocket (travel and time) costs.</p><p>By using data from the trial which uses West Midlands&#x02019; practices only, there may be limits to the generalisability of the results of the trial. This will be explored within the economic evaluation using extensive sensitivity analysis. Key parameters will be varied to determine the impact of changes on results. Case finding in different patient sub-groups will also be considered. Non-parametric bootstrapping and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to explore uncertainty in the confidence to be placed on the results of the economic analysis and cost effectiveness acceptability curves presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Additional analyses</title><p>We also plan further related analyses not detailed here including:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis to consider longer-term effects of case-detection and subsequent treatment (cost per quality-adjusted life year gained)</p></list-item><list-item><p>A qualitative study exploring patients views of case-finding</p></list-item><list-item><p>A qualitative study exploring the views of healthcare professionals</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Patient advisory group</title><p>A patient advisory group (PAG) has been set up, chaired by Mr Michael Darby.

Previously undiagnosed patients aged 40 years and over with a positive smoking history will either receive a respiratory questionnaire when they routinely visit their surgery, or will also receive a questionnaire through the post. Those with indicative respiratory symptoms will be offered spirometry to diagnose COPD. There are many strengths of this study including: it is the first of this design based in a large sample of GP practices with a comparator group; it is set in a range of GP practices representative of urban UK; it has a pragmatic design which should reflect real life; the spirometry will be the best quality possible with highly trained staff and quality control; there will be a full cost-effectiveness analysis and also sensitivity analyses to reflect a range of scenarios; the effects will be explored across the range of GPs involved, allowing the cost-effectiveness in different types of GPs to be assessed. This trial should inform practice across the UK and elsewhere with similar healthcare systems, and help to direct current effort towards case-finding more efficiently.</p><p>However, a study of this size and complexity has many challenges. We will be coordinating a large number of practices, and as a screening trial, thousands of patients and patient data. Accurately identifying appropriate patients from GP databases with their complex coding is a known problem. It is not known how patients will respond to questionnaires, and whether (or how often) it is practical for GP staff to give out screening questionnaires during routine visits. These are some of the feasibility outcomes we will be measuring. Coordinating and arranging patient assessments with the dual issues of patient and GP capacity will also be a challenge, especially in the short time-frame. And finally, it will be important to discuss how this approach can be rolled out from a trial setting into routine practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Authors&#x02019; information</title><p>Principal Investigators: Dr Rachel Jordan, Professor Peymane Adab, Professor David Fitzmaurice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec48"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12890_2014_626_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Additional file 1: Appendix 1: READ codes used for identifying eligible patients. <bold>Appendix 2.</bold> Screening questionnaire. <bold>Appendix 3.</bold> Patient costs questionnaire. <bold>Appendix 4.</bold> Patient Information Sheet. <bold>Appendix 5.</bold> Patient consent form.
