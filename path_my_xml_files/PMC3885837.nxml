electromyographic activities of upper extremity and lower extremity muscles. [Subjects and
Methods] The subjects were randomly divided into two groups as follows: without Nordic
pole walking group (n=13) and with Nordic pole walking group (n=13). The EMG data were
collected by measurement while the subjects walking on a treadmill for 30 minutes by
measuring from one heel strike to the next. [Results] Both the average values and maximum
values of the muscle activity of the upper extremity increased in both the group that used
Nordic poles and the group that did not use Nordic poles, and the values showed
statistically significant differences. There was an increase in the average value for
muscle activity of the latissimus dorsi, but the difference was not statistically
significant, although there was a statistically significant increase in its maximum value.
The average and maximum values for muscle activity of the lower extremity did not show
large differences in either group, and the values did not show any statistically
significant differences. [Conclusion] The use of Nordic poles by increased muscle activity
of the upper extremity compared with regular walking but did not affect the lower
extremity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Nordic pole walking</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity muscle</kwd><kwd>Lower extremity muscle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Walking is the most basic movement of humans and is said to be one of the good methods to
maintain and promote health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
good walking methods that promote health, Nordic pole walking has been recently used. It is
an exercise frequently performed in Northern Europe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup> that remarkably increases calorie and oxygen consumption compared
with regular walking exercise due to the use of poles carried in both hands, which results
in many muscles in the upper body, such as the arms, shoulders, and chest, being used
simulatenously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Church et
al. (2002)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, oxygen and calorie
consumption remarkably increase when walking forward using Nordic poles. This indicates that
use of Nordic poles greatly affects human bodies.</p><p>Exercises using Nordic poles increase stability compared with regular walking because the
upper extremities are used together with the lower extremities during exercises using Nordic
poles, and they have been said to be particularly useful for persons with disorders in body
balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was reported that the
use of Nordic poles reduced loads imposed on the lower extremities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and that reducing loads imposed on the lower extremities
could prevent damage to the knee joints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In studies of walking using Nordic poles, it was reported that oxygen consumption and heart
rates remarkably increased during walking using Nordic poles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and that these effects were very effective not only in arthritis
patients but also in subjects with cardiovascular or nervous diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This exercise method enables exercises of the whole body because use of Nordic poles
increases the use of the upper extremities and reduces loads on the lower extremities.
According to a paper written by Kim &#x00026; Shim (2012)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, when movements before and after using Nordic poles were observed,
normal movements appeared when Nordic poles were used that made foot pressure pass through
the feet. Given this result, it can be assumed that symmetric movements of the upper
extremities positively affected normal movements of the feet. According to Shim (2012)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, the use of Nordic poles increases step
lengths and reduces the ratio of time from foot flat, at which the feet come into contact
with the ground, to heel off because the use of the poles increased stability. Therefore, it
can be assumed that use of the upper extremities&#x02019; force using Nordic poles affected the
lower extremities.</p><p>On reviewing previous studies, it can be seen that the use of muscles in the upper
extremities affects the lower extremities. However, studies on differences in muscle
activity between the upper extremity and lower extremity are quite insufficient.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, subjects were divided into a group that used Nordic poles
and a group that did not use Nordic poles to examine differences shown by the biceps
brachii, triceps, deltoid, and latissimus dorsi in the upper extremity and the rectus
femoris, lateral hamstring, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius in the lower extremity
between the two groups. The aim of the present study was to provide accurate information on
the effects of use of Nordic poles on the muscles in the upper and lower extremities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were twenty-six subjects who voluntarily consented to participate in the
study. They were randomly divided into two groups as follows: walking with Nordic poles
group (with NPW group&#x002bc;s, n=13) and walking without Nordic poles group (without NPW group,
n=13). The with NPW group`s average age was 21.38&#x000b1;0.87&#x02005;years, average height was
168.85&#x000b1;8.05&#x02005;cm, and average weight was 65.23&#x000b1;14.14&#x02005;kg. The without NPW group&#x002bc;s average age
was 21.46&#x000b1;0.77&#x02005;years, average height was 169.15&#x000b1;7.66&#x02005;cm, and average weight was
63.00&#x000b1;11.88&#x02005;kg. The exclusion criteria were past or present musculoskeletal, neurological
and cardiopulmonary disease that could hamper with or without NPW. Prior to the start of
this study, all subjects signed an informed consent form. This study was approved by
university institutional review board.</p><p>The subjects were asked to walk in an upright posture, with the head upright and looking
forward. In Nordic pole walking, the Nordic poles are held close to the body. When a foot is
moved forward, the arm on the other side lifts the Nordic pole and moves it forward. The
pole comes into contact with the ground first, followed by the foot. Then, the pole and the
foot move by turns to push the body forward while pushing backward against the ground. When
pushing backward, the arm is completely extended at the farthest point that can be reached.
At this point, the hand holding the pole is spread to push the body forward<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. When walking forward using Nordic poles,
the body utilizes more calories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
the upper extremities become to act so that the walking becomes exercises of the whole body
and thus more physical activities appear unavoidably<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Before examinations using EMG, the dominant arms and legs of the study subjects were first
examined. In the case of the arms, the subjects were examined to determine the arm used for
writing; in the case of the feet, they were examined to determine the foot used to kick a
ball<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The activities of the lower
extremity muscles were measured using surface EMG (TeleMyo 2400T G2, Noraxon U.S.A., Inc.,
Scottsdale, AZ, USA). Collected surface EMG signals were converted into digital signals in a
TeleMyo 2400T G2, and the converted signals were processed using the Myoresearch XP 1.07
software. The EMG signal sampling rate was set to 1000&#x02005;Hz. The sampled EMG signals were
filtered at 20&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz using 60&#x02005;Hz notch filters as band-pass filters.</p><p>Electrodes were placed on each muscle (biceps brachii, triceps long head, deltoid medius,
latissimus dorsi, rectus femoris, lateral hamstring, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius) in
the standard places<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. After attaching
EMG electrodes to each muscle, the values of maximal voluntary contraction were obtained
three times in total from the manual muscle-testing position, and the average of the values
was obtained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on these values,
muscle activity was measured in each member of the with NPW and withoutNPW groups, and %MVIC
values were obtained by substituting the muscle activity values.</p><p>First, all the subjects were present at the laboratory and educated on the NPW technique
for approximately 30 minutes. Then, they were educated on the use of Nordic poles so that
they could sufficiently use the poles by practicing walking with them<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. They did not wear any shoes during walking, and the speed
of the treadmill was set to the average of the speeds at which the subjects could
comfortably walk in both groups. The average treadmill speed was 4.56&#x02005;km/h. EMG data were
collected by measurement while the subjects walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes by
measuring the time from the right leg&#x02019;s heel strike to the next heel strike of the same leg.
The values were measured at 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes during walking and the averages of
the values were calculated. The ratio of contraction during waking of each muscle to the
maximal voluntary contraction of the muscle was calculated to obtain the percentage of
maximal voluntary contraction.</p><p>All the statistics were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and the
significance level &#x003b1; for all the statistics was 0.05. To examine the general characteristics
of the subjects, means, standard deviations, and frequencies were calculated. To compare the
without NPW and with NPW groups, the data were analyzed with the independent sample
t-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A comparison of the muscle activities of the upper extremity during walking between the

Nordic poles can prevent damage to the lower extremity joints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and relatively reduce loads on the knee joints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unlike regular walking exercises, Nordic pole walking
exercises induces the mobilization of all upper and lower extremity muscles because poles
are used, and so they show higher oxygen consumption by the body compared with regular
walking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bumgardner (2010)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup> said that Nordic pole walking could easily
increase cardiac outputs and heart rates without increasing exercise fatigue thereby
increasing the effects of exercises. Church (2002)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when adult males and females were instructed to walk 1
mile and oxygen consumption during the exercises was measured, Nordic walking exercises
showed higher oxygen consumption. He also reported that, when compared with regular walking,
Nordic pole walking enabled faster walking. Nordic pole walking exercises are aerobic
exercises that can increase muscle mass even when only they are performed, so muscle
strength can be improved and the poles can play a role as supports to improve stability.
According to Kim and Shim (2012)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, the use
of Nordic poles can enable exercises closer to normal walking and provide positive effects
of foot pressure distribution during walking. According to Shim (2012)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, when compared with walking without using Nordic poles,
walking using Nordic poles increased step length and the time from heel contact to foot flat
while reducing the time from foot flat to heel off. The reason for the increase in the time
from heel contact to foot flat can be assumed to be the fact that the Nordic pole comes down
to the ground together with the heel at heel contact, and the reason for the reduction in
the time from foot flat to heel off can be assumed to be the fact that the Nordic pole
pushes against the ground to make heel off happen faster in the gait cycle. Therefore, the
use of Nordic poles can relieve pain in the lower extremity, increase the amount of
exercise, improve cardiovascular system functions, help patients with arthritis or diabetes
during walking, and help improve the gait and normal walking in relation to foot
pressure.</p><p>This means that the use of Nordic poles greatly affects the human body. Therefore, this
researcher conducted the present study to examine the effects of use of Nordic poles during
walking on muscles of the upper and lower extremities.</p><p>In the present study, EMG was used to observe the activities of muscles of the upper and
lower extremities. On reviewing the movements made during walking with Nordic poles in the
hands and walking without Nordic poles, it can be seen that when the arms move back and
forth, the feet also move back and forth. The muscles mainly used for these movements are
the biceps brachii, triceps, deltoid, and latissimus dorsi in the upper extremity and the
rectus femoris, lateral hamstring, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius in the lower
extremity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in the present
study, those muscles were measured. A treadmill was used in order to maximally reduce
changes in muscle activity due to changes in speed, since subjects can find speeds suitable
to them and continuously walk at those speeds when they walk on a treadmill<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On reviewing the results of the present study with regard to the upper extremity, it can be
seen that the activities of the biceps brachii, triceps, deltoid medius, and latissimus
dorsi increased remarkably when Nordic poles were used compared with when Nordic poles were
not used. In particular, it can be seen that the biceps brachii and the triceps were
exercised in turns as the elbow joints were moved when Nordic poles were used. The deltoid
and lattissimus dorsi were frequently used when the body moved forward while pushing against
the ground using a Nordic pole and when the poles were moved. The results of the present
study were similar to the results of a study conducted by Evans et al. (1994)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup> indicating that when Nordic poles are used,
many muscles in the arms, shoulders, chest, and back are used and energy consumption is
increased. The results of the present study were also similar to the results of a study
conducted by Anja et al. (1999)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
indicating that when many office workers performed Nordic pole walking exercises for 12
weeks, their upper body muscles were improved.</p><p>However, the results of the present study with regard to the lower extremity indicated that
the muscle activities of the rectus femoris, lateral hamstring, tibialis anterior, and
gastrocnemius did not show big differences between when Nordic poles were used and when
Nordic poles were not used. These results indicate that the use of Nordic poles by the upper
extremities did not greatly affect the muscle activity of the lower extremity muscles. On
reviewing these results, it can be seen that walking with Nordic poles has the added benefit
of exercise of the arms compared with walking without Nordic poles, resulting in larger
exercise effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the results
of the present study indicated that although walking using Nordic poles increased use of the
upper extremity, the activities of the muscles in the lower extremity were not greatly
affected.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The comparison of nordic pole walking general walking on
