The study enrolled male and female patients with a clinical diagnosis of moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening who required around-the-clock opioid therapy. To be eligible for enrollment, patients were required to have an average 24-h pain intensity score of &#x02265;5 and &#x02264;9 on an 11-point (0&#x02013;10) Pain Intensity&#x02014;Numerical Rating Scale at the screening visit. The study enrolled both opioid-experienced and opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients. The study consisted of an open-label titration phase followed by a 12-week double-blind maintenance phase. The dose range was 40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg oxycodone hydrochloride equivalent per day. This post hoc analysis evaluated the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of oxycodone DETERx among patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age. The effectiveness of oxycodone DETERx was evaluated based on average pain intensity scores, Patient Global Impression of Change, responder analysis, and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis. The safety and tolerability of oxycodone DETERx were also evaluated. Patients were randomized to either oxycodone DETERx or placebo using a blocked randomization scheme in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified by previous opioid use (na&#x000ef;ve or experienced). The study drug was coded in a manner that maintained the blinding. Study personnel and patients remained blinded to the assigned treatments throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">For this post-hoc analysis, the intent-to-treat and randomized safety populations included 52 patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years old, 26 each in the oxycodone DETERx and placebo groups, who participated in the study during the titration phase and were randomized to the double-blind maintenance phase. Clinically important pain reduction from screening was achieved with oxycodone DETERx, with the median pain intensity score decreasing from 7.50 at screening to 2.69 at Week 12. A clinically meaningful treatment difference of &#x02212;0.9 in pain score between oxycodone DETERx and placebo was observed. All 18 elderly patients who completed the study reported improvement in pain, with 62% showing &#x02265;30% improvement and 54% showing &#x02265;50% improvement in pain intensity compared with patients on placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0128 and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0501, respectively). Patients on oxycodone DETERx remained in the study longer than those on placebo. Of the 26 patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years old randomized to continue oxycodone DETERx during the double-blind maintenance phase, 18 (69%) completed the study; only two patients (8%) in the oxycodone DETERx group discontinued due to adverse events. The safety and tolerability profiles showed no new or unexpected safety concerns. The adverse event profiles were similar between the titration and double-blind maintenance phases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Oxycodone DETERx was efficacious and generally well tolerated in patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years old.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p id="Par5">The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01685684).</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing AG 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Key Points</title><p id="Par6">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Chronic pain is a global health problem estimated to affect approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It increasingly affects the elderly as the incidence of chronic pain increases with age. The elderly population in the US is increasing faster than the total population, according to the 2010 US census [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Managing chronic pain in this growing patient population is a public health concern.</p><p id="Par8">Chronic pain is often treated with opioid medications, which can provide short- or long-acting analgesia, depending on the specific properties of the analgesic and its formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Long-acting/extended-release (ER) opioids are typically used for around-the-clock maintenance treatment.</p><p id="Par9">Escalating medical use of opioids has been correlated with an increase in the incidence of non-medical opioid-related drug abuse and manipulation of conventional ER dosage forms for abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In an effort to mitigate this type of product manipulation, abuse-deterrent formulations have been developed, including harder tablet formulations that are more difficult to crush. An unintended consequence of hard, monolithic-tablet opioid formulations is that the tablets can be difficult to swallow for some patients, especially the elderly. It is estimated that over 11 million patients in the US with chronic pain either have difficulty swallowing tablets (dysphagia) or dislike swallowing tablets; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimated that as many as 40% of Americans may suffer from dysphagia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Despite warnings in the prescribing information and Patient Medication Guides, patients with dysphagia and their caregivers often manipulate currently marketed ER opioid analgesics by chewing, cutting, or crushing tablets, or opening ER capsules to make swallowing easier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This unintentional or possibly intentional misuse of opioids can cause a change in the release profile of the analgesic, leading to adverse effects, including death. Specifically, altering an ER formulation can change the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics (increased maximum plasma concentration [<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>] and possibly area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve [AUC]) and can lead to overdose, potentially resulting in death.</p><p id="Par11">Currently available treatment options for patients with chronic pain who cannot swallow solid oral dosage forms include transdermal patches, immediate-release opioids, methadone, and certain other ER opioids, each of which have limitations that can potentially result in inadequate pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, transdermal patches may have unreliable absorption, particularly in the elderly, and are associated with dermal side effects such as skin rash and erythema. Release kinetics can be altered by changes in temperature or use of occlusive dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Most of the currently available ER opioids do not offer multiple modes of administration (e.g., the same opioid that can be taken via a method other than swallowing intact) or have restrictions for dosing (e.g., take with sufficient water to avoid getting stuck in the throat or do not chew to avoid a potentially fatal overdose).</p><p id="Par12">Oxycodone DETERx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Xtampza&#x02122; ER, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Canton, MA, USA) addresses the needs of patients with chronic pain with dysphagia. This novel, abuse-deterrent formulation is a microsphere-in-capsule formulation that enables patients with dysphagia to open the capsule and administer the contents onto soft food, directly into the mouth from a cup, or directly into an enteral tube, while maintaining the ER properties of the product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The formulation is designed to protect against bolus release and subsequent exacerbation of potentially serious adverse effects if a patient chews or crushes the formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The formulation also allows for administration through enteral tubes (e.g., nasogastric and gastrostomy) without the concern for tube blockage or interaction with common administration media such as tube feeding formulas, water, or milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In a phase III study conducted by Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., oxycodone DETERx was found to be safe and efficacious in the management of moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain (CLBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Because limited data exist on the effects of oxycodone treatment regimens among elderly patients with chronic pain, a post hoc analysis was performed using data for patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age who participated in the phase III study; the current manuscript reports the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of oxycodone DETERx in this patient population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par15">Post hoc analyses were performed using data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal study with a titration phase followed by a 12-week double-blind maintenance phase, which has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Eligible patients required around-the-clock opioid therapy and had an average 24-h pain intensity score of &#x02265;5 and &#x02264;9 (i.e., moderate-to-severe pain) on an 11-point (0&#x02013;10) Pain Intensity&#x02014;Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) at screening while on their current opioid or non-opioid analgesic medication. Pain was classified as non-malignant and non-neuropathic (Class 1 and 2), neuropathic (Class 3), or symptomatic for more than 6&#x000a0;months after low back pain surgery (Class 9) based on Quebec Task Force Scale score. Patients must have been in otherwise general good health, which was defined as the absence of any clinically relevant abnormalities, based on screening physical examination, medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, serology, and urinalysis). For opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients, each patient must have failed prior acetaminophen (APAP) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and/or was unable to tolerate NSAIDs. All patients had to have stopped use of all analgesics other than study drug from the day of the first titration phase visit through to end of study or early discontinuation. Adjunct therapy for back pain such as physical therapy, biofeedback therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, acupuncture, nutraceuticals, herbal remedies, and water aerobics must have been kept unchanged for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to screening and through to the end of study/early discontinuation.</p><p id="Par17">To be eligible for the double-blind maintenance phase, patients must have attained a stable dose of oxycodone DETERx of at least 18&#x000a0;mg (20&#x000a0;mg oxycodone hydrochloride [HCl] equivalent), but no more than 72&#x000a0;mg (80&#x000a0;mg oxycodone HCl equivalent) every 12&#x000a0;h prior to randomization.

The purpose of the titration phase was to titrate oxycodone DETERx to a stable, effective dose that reduced the patient&#x02019;s pain to &#x02264;4 on the PI-NRS. The double-blind maintenance phase lasted 12&#x000a0;weeks, during which patients took either oxycodone DETERx or placebo twice daily. Oxycodone was taken twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, orally, intact, and with food. Only APAP was allowed as rescue medication (&#x02264;2000&#x000a0;mg/day; 500&#x000a0;mg unit doses) in both active treatment phases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Efficacy and Safety/Tolerability Outcome Measures</title><p id="Par20">The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the PI-NRS score from randomization baseline to Week 12.</p><p id="Par21">Secondary endpoints included improvement in pain intensity responder analysis, time to exit the study, and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) assessment.</p><p id="Par22">The safety and tolerability of oxycodone DETERx were evaluated by examining common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); vital sign measurements; hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis variables; and opioid withdrawal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p id="Par23">This post hoc analysis evaluated the study data for patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age.

However, this model failed to converge in the subset of patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age, likely due to the small sample size; therefore, a mixed-model repeated measures analysis was used. This model included categorical fixed effects for treatment, week, and their iteration; a baseline covariate; and random subject intercepts.</p><p id="Par25">A responder analysis calculated the proportions of patients demonstrating at least 30% and at least 50% improvement in pain intensity from screening baseline to Week 12 of the double-blind maintenance phase for each treatment group; patients who discontinued or had missing data were considered non-responders. Differences in the proportions between treatment groups were assessed by the Chi-square test.</p><p id="Par26">The time-to-exit survival analysis was defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of early discontinuation plus 1 day.

Studies conducted to assess the abuse deterrence characteristics demonstrated that administration of oxycodone DETERx either crushed or chewed did not increase the maximum drug concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) or total exposure (AUC) relative to dosing the drug intact as a capsule, indicating that crushing or chewing does not compromise its ER properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The treatment difference of the analgesic effect of oxycodone DETERx in patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age was similar numerically to that of patients &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years of age, indicating that oxycodone DETERx is effective in the management of pain attributable to CLBP in the elderly, although the result was not statistically significant. The lack of statistical significance of the primary endpoint comparison in the &#x02265;65-year-old cohort is a result of the small sample size; given the resultant effect size for this age cohort, there would be only 36% power to detect a difference in effectiveness with the number of subjects &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Improved pain control was also supported in that throughout the 12-week double-blind maintenance phase, the majority of patients did not require a dose adjustment once they achieved a stable dose of oxycodone DETERx, despite only being allowed to mitigate breakthrough pain with APAP. In addition, the dropout rate attributable to lack of effectiveness was low.</p><p id="Par55">Results for secondary endpoints, including for the responder analysis, PGIC, and time-to-exit analyses, were consistent for patients &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years of age and patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age.</p><p id="Par56">In both the titration and double-blind maintenance phases, the incidence of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-related AEs, and treatment-related SAEs were similar between patients &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years and patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age, indicating that oxycodone DETERx may offer geriatricians treating chronic pain another abuse-deterrent opioid option for older patients who have dysphagia or odynophagia (painful swallowing). The AE profile for oxycodone DETERx was consistent with other ER opioid formulations and was similar between patients &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years of age and patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age.</p><p id="Par57">As with any clinical study, there are limitations. The sample size for the cohort of patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age was small, with only 26 patients each in the active and placebo groups, which limited the ability to detect statistically significant differences between the two groups. However, the sample size for the age cohort was not atypical and was similar to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The clinical study design was an EERW design of a phase III study adherent to the requirements of the FDA for a chronic pain indication, which may limit the generalizability of the results to an elderly, dysphagic patient population. The treatment in this study was oxycodone DETERx unimodal therapy; use of a more real-world treatment paradigm of multi-modal therapy was not possible in order to avoid confounding of the study results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">Oxycodone DETERx is an easy-to-administer, abuse-deterrent alternative to hard, monolithic tablet formulations of ER opioids that may be difficult to swallow, particularly in the elderly. This analysis showed that oxycodone DETERx was generally efficacious (i.e., clinically relevant), although not statistically significant due to the relatively small sample size, and well tolerated in the &#x02265;65-year-old subgroup of the study population, with no newly identified (i.e., AEs currently not already known based on the pharmacology of opioids) safety concerns.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Editorial support for writing this manuscript was provided by Teresa Faulkner, MA, of Rho, Inc.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par59">Authors Melinda O&#x02019;Connor and Scott Lagasse are salaried (including stock) employees of Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., the company that funded the study and the writing of this manuscript.
