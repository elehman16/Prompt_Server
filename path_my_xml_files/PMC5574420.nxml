We demonstrated that the association of worse outcome with obesity was independent of female sex, current smoking and worse functional impairment at baseline. Obesity was the strongest independent predictor of non-remission, with more than a fivefold increased odds 2&#x02009;years after diagnosis despite a&#x000a0;treat-to-target approach&#x000a0;initiatives in accordance with current guidelines. A persistent and dose-dependent association was observed for every clinical outcome measure captured at every follow-up visit; that is to say, a higher BMI category (obese&#x0003e;overweight&#x0003e;normal weight) was associated with a worse disease activity score, more functional impairment and more pain&#x02014;thus validating, but extending previous clinical observations to the randomised setting.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Whether obesity influences the outcome measures used&#x02014;being to a large extent patient-reported in their nature&#x02014;remains to be clarified, but the associations observed could not be explained by specific components of the DAS28 measure, with a similar pattern for all components except for the swollen joint count, where no significant associations were observed. However, very few patients had swollen joints at follow-up, so this observation should be interpreted with caution. An inverse, but not independent association between obesity and radiographic progression was observed in our study. Although not being independent from other predictors, our results indicate that obesity is associated with a clinically manifest yet non-erosive phenotype of RA. Stronger associations have been described in previous studies,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 9</xref> and reasons for no significant association in our study can be the early RA setting with a low proportion of patients with progression.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that obese patients with early RA respond differently to biological versus conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs&#x000a0;(DMARDs), where no significant differences were found for patients randomised to infliximab+MTX, in contrast to consistently worse outcomes for obese patients randomised to TT or a risk for worse long-term outcomes on monotherapy despite initial response to MTX. It is perhaps not surprising since infliximab doses are weight&#x000a0;adjusted. However, previous reports with up to 1&#x02009;year data on disease activity have yielded opposite results.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> In a report from the Italian GISEA network on RA, obesity was associated with non-remission to three different anti-TNF treatments.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Here, obese patients who received infliximab had even worse outcomes than the other two anti-TNF agents, etanercept and adalimumab, which are not adjusted for weight. GISEA, however, was in an observational setting on established RA. Finally, an earlier non-randomised study with a small amount of patients found a worse 4-month response on infliximab if obese.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, our randomised results indicated&#x02014;despite a 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;month MTX monotherapy non-response &#x02014;statistically superior rates of remission directly after randomisation with 3 months of infliximab versus TT among obese patients. There are also findings from the BeSt four-armed randomised trial.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Compared with SWEFOT,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> the glucocorticoid doses were higher, and steered treatment adjustments were applied every 3 months if remission was not achieved in the first three synthetic DMARD arms. The fourth arm, immediate infliximab+MTX, had dose elevations every 2 months on non-remission, up to a maximum of 10&#x02009;mg/kg every 8 weeks (threefold higher dose than SWEFOT). In the post hoc study of BeSt, overweight/obesity was significantly associated with higher disease activity only in patients receiving infliximab after failure on several DMARDs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Among the other arms, overweight/obesity was significantly associated with worse outcomes on synthetic combination DMARDs. Thus, the findings in this intensive treatment approach are to an extent in accordance with our findings in a trial that may be closer to today's&#x000a0;real-life care in several countries.</p><p>Although obese patients altogether had worse clinical outcomes, we demonstrated the value of analysing these outcomes individually by therapy in showing that infliximab with MTX led to non-significantly different outcomes in obese compared with non-obese patients, and that standardised-dose synthetic DMARDs are associated with inadequate treatment efficacy among obese individuals.</p><p>Although the current study was not designed to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the associations observed, there is substantial evidence available from basic studies about the connection between inflammation and adiposity. Macrophages are activated by free fatty acids, which are elevated in obesity due to the excessive amounts of adipose tissue.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This also leads to more dead adipose tissue, creating a loop of chronic inflammation through consistent macrophage activation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Two biomarkers that could play a role in RA disease progression are adiponectin (inverse association with BMI) and leptin (positive association with BMI due to leptin insensitivity), which, in addition to TNF and interleukin 6, are both produced by white adipose tissue. Although additional studies are needed, both have been found to be potential stakeholders in RA&#x02014;leptin in inflammation<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 22 23</xref> and adiponectin in bone erosions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 24&#x02013;26</xref></p><p>It has recently been shown that MTX polyglutamates&#x02014;the active metabolites which are associated with MTX efficacy&#x02014; have an inverse association to BMI, and so was the frequency of hepatotoxicity, being observed in none of the obese patients, but in one-third of the patients in the lowest BMI category.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It is possible that the lack of response to synthetic DMARDs is simply a question of dosage, since the associations with obesity were not observed for the anti-TNF arm but only for the TT and MTX responder arms. Infliximab is the only weight-adjusted TNF inhibitor, and future randomised trials therefore need to address whether or not similar responses can be achieved among obese patients with other TNF inhibitors. Notably, we are not aware of any studies investigating weight-adjusted MTX dosage in RA or other rheumatic diseases in adults, despite being done in juvenile forms as well as other indications for this treatment. Patients assigned to TT had a standardised dose and the only allowed increase was with sulfasalazine: from 1000 to 1500&#x02009;mg twice daily. Thus, it is possible that obese patients on TT, including those with an initial MTX response who continued on monotherapy, required even higher doses to achieve effective responses.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>The main limitation in this study is its post hoc design, since the SWEFOT trial was not specifically designed to address the current questions pertaining to analysing clinically relevant predictors of specific treatment responses, such as lifestyle factors, for example, BMI or smoking status, where data were consequently not complete. However, there was no indication of selection bias in this subset. Furthermore, the size of the individual treatment groups does not allow us to draw firm conclusions pertaining to therapy response, especially for our findings concerning the infliximab arm due to a limited sample size. Additional studies investigating obesity as a predictor for response to specific therapies in early RA are thus required.</p><p>Obese patients were shown to have consistently worse disease activity, functional impairment and pain in all observations beyond diagnosis of early RA, and a clear dose&#x02013;response relationship was observed with BMI categories in all core set outcomes. The strengths in this study are that we still observed this after taking into account other known clinical and lifestyle predictors; after performing sensitivity analyses (including LOCF, per protocol); and also finding similar patterns in both the seropositive and seronegative subsets of RA. At the same time, we analysed this within the treatment subgroups observing that this pattern was not significant for infliximab-treated obese patients.</p><p>To conclude, we found that obesity&#x02014;a modifiable lifestyle factor&#x02014;was associated with worse clinical outcomes over time, measured in disease activity (or its components), functional impairment and pain; but only a marginal inverse association was found for radiographic progression. Obesity at diagnosis was a strong and independent predictor of non-remission after 2 years of treatment according to current guidelines; the other significant predictors being female sex, current smoking and HAQ. When stratified into treatment groups, obesity was the only significant independent predictor of non-remission for MTX non-responders randomised to TT, but not if the weight-adjusted infliximab was added on to MTX. Thus, our findings confirm and yet extend previous findings, as it has now been performed in a well-defined trial-based clinical setting. Further studies are needed to explore whether this may be explained by the underlying biology, since TNF, which is secreted by adipose tissue and surrounding macrophages, could potentially pose as a&#x000a0;more effective target than conventional DMARDs in the case of excessive adiposity; or it may be a question of dosage, since trials on weight-adjusted MTX treatment are, to our knowledge, lacking. Finally, these findings show that manifold differences in the likelihood of remission can be predicted using easily-available variables in the clinic at baseline and highlight the importance of taking both lifestyle and sex into account when conducting and reporting RA trials, as well as the importance of considering modification of lifestyle habits as one of the cornerstones of patient care in RA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors meet the ICMJE guidelines for authorship and contributed equally to the design of the project, the discussion of the results and to the preparation of the manuscript.
