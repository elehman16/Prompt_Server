However, only &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of patients experience adequate response after a single AD trial, and this variability remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers of AD response using small RNA-sequencing in paired samples from MDD patients enrolled in a large, randomized placebo-controlled trial of duloxetine collected before and 8 weeks after treatment. Our results revealed differential expression of miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-425-3p and miR-24-3p according to treatment response. These results were replicated in two independent clinical trials of MDD, a well-characterized animal model of depression, and post-mortem human brains. Furthermore, using a combination of bioinformatics, mRNA studies and functional <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we showed significant dysregulation of genes involved in <italic>MAPK/Wnt</italic> signalling pathways. Together, our results indicate that these miRNAs are consistent markers of treatment response and regulators of the <italic>MAPK/Wnt</italic> systems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>Antidepressant drugs are the most common treatment for depressive episodes but only a fraction of patients experience adequate response.

Treatment of MDD includes a variety of biopsychosocial approaches, but in medical practice, antidepressant (AD) drugs are the most common treatment for depressive episodes and, not surprisingly, they are among the most prescribed medications in the world<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. While they are clearly effective, particularly for moderate-to-severe depressive episodes, there is substantial variability in how individuals respond to AD treatment. In spite of the many ADs available, almost 70&#x00025; of patients do not respond to a single trial and 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of patients do not present with a full response following several trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The failure to respond has important individual, economic and social consequences for both patients and their families. Thus, there is a great need to better understand factors associated with response to AD treatment.</p><p>Genes can be regulated through the activity of several noncoding RNA transcripts that act as fine-tuners and on&#x02013;off switches of gene expression patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Among the noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been the most extensively studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Since their discovery in the early 1990s, miRNAs have revolutionized our understanding of gene regulation and show great potential for assisting in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying disease pathology and treatment response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. MiRNAs are small noncoding, single-stranded RNA transcripts that regulate the expression of mRNAs through RNA degradation or translational repression. There is increasing evidence suggesting a key role for miRNAs in the regulation of essential processes of brain functioning, as well as in the development of psychiatric disorders and their treatments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. For instance, Baudry <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> found that miR-16 mediates AD action of fluoxetine in the raphe and locus coeruleus of mice, and follow-up work suggested that this same miRNA displays antidepressant-like effects and mediates adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Another recent and promising finding uncovered a key role for miR-135a in the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of ADs in both depressed humans and animal models of depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Dias <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> showed that the miRNA processing protein, Dicer, acts in brain reward regions to promote antidepressant-like responses in animal models. Finally, we have recently reported that miR-1202, a primate-specific and brain-enriched miRNA, is downregulated in the prefrontal cortex of depressed individuals and regulates the expression of the <italic>metabotropic glutamate receptor</italic> (<italic>GRM4</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. These encouraging new findings underline the potential of studying miRNAs to better understand molecular processes associated with MDD. Here, we investigate miRNAs in relation to AD response. Using complementary strategies, we demonstrate that levels of miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-24-3p and miR-425-3p are modified as a function of AD response and regulate genes involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Wnt signalling pathways.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>MicroRNA dysregulation after antidepressant treatment</title><p>We performed small RNA-sequencing in blood samples from a randomized placebo-controlled trial of duloxetine, a serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Blood samples were collected before and 8 weeks after treatment (discovery cohort (DRCT); <italic>n</italic>=516 samples from 258 patients) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We compared the expression of miRNAs before and after treatment (that is, 8-week response to baseline). Statistical analysis, using Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg correction for multiple testing (5&#x00025; false discovery rate (FDR)) and corrected <italic>P</italic> values of &#x0003c;0.05, revealed differential expression of 22 miRNAs after 8 weeks of duloxetine treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and 6 miRNAs after 8 weeks of placebo treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Except for one miRNA, these findings were specific to patients who responded to treatment with no differences found in the nonresponder groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). We defined response as &#x0003e;50&#x00025; decrease in Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores from baseline to trial end point<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Remarkably, the six miRNAs that were significantly changed according to placebo response were among the 22 whose expression changed according to duloxetine response, and were altered in the same direction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, 16 miRNAs changed specifically according to duloxetine treatment. One miRNA (miR-503-5p) was significantly changed in responders and nonresponders in both placebo- and duloxetine-treated patients, suggesting that the alterations in the expression of this miRNA may associate with metabolic processes that are independent of clinical outcome.</p><p>We validated our significant findings using a high-sensitivity multiplex cellular miRNA assay on a standard flow cytometer (Firefly BioWorks). Using a custom panel, we measured miRNA expression before and after treatment in the same 516 samples used for small RNA-sequencing. We validated 87&#x00025; of the miRNAs tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) and found a significant correlation of fold changes across the two technologies (<italic>r</italic>=0.83, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Since we were interested in the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in response to treatment, and based on recent evidence suggesting that some of the mechanisms involved in placebo response are also engaged during AD treatment and could reinforce response to common AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, we next focused on the miRNAs that were differentially expressed according to response in both the duloxetine and placebo groups. These were miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-425-3p and miR-3074-5p that were all downregulated after treatment, and their individual expressions were strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) suggesting a shared mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Independent replication with cohort 1</title><p>To test the external validity of our findings, we measured the expression of these five miRNAs before and after 8 weeks of AD treatment in a fully independent sample composed of 61 depressed patients (122 samples) who were recruited as part of the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (replication cohort 1). Patients were treated with escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In line with our findings in the DRCT, we again found a significant downregulation in the expression of miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-24-3p and miR-425-3p in the blood of depressed patients after treatment. Importantly, these changes were consistent with those observed in the discovery cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Although we also saw a decrease in the expression of miR-3074-5p, this effect was not statistically significant, and thus we did not include this miRNA in further analyses. Consistent with our initial findings, the downregulation of the validated miRNAs was only observed among responders to treatment, as we found no changes in the expression of these miRNAs in the nonresponder group.

There was a downregulation of miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p and miR-24-3p after antidepressant treatment. More importantly, these effects were only observed among responders to escitalopram treatment, as we found no changes in the expression of these miRNAs in the nonresponder group.

More importantly, we measured the levels of the validated and replicated miRNAs in cell-free plasma samples obtained from these subjects, and observed results that were similar to those observed with the whole blood samples, both in significance and direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dysregulation of miRNAs after antidepressant treatment in mice</title><p>We next investigated the relevance of our results in a well-established animal model of depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.

Susceptible mice were then treated with the antidepressant imipramine (tricyclic antidepressant) or saline control for 14 days followed by a repeat of the social interaction and sucrose preference tests. Mice that showed improvement in depression-like symptoms in these behavioural assays were classified as responders, while those that showed no improvements were deemed as nonresponders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We measured the expression of miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-24-3p and miR-425-3p in peripheral blood samples of mice before and after treatment with imipramine or saline control, using a NanoString, a probe-based miRNA expression assay. We found a significant downregulation of miR-146b-5p, miR-24-3p and miR-425. In addition, we found a decrease in the expression of miR-146a-5p, but these findings did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>=0.09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with the data in humans, these changes were selective for the responder group, as no differences were detected in the nonresponders or saline control groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).

As the changes of these 4 miRNAs were positively correlated, we hypothesized that they had common pathways of regulation, and thus narrowed our list of targets by considering only genes that were commonly predicted targets for at least 3 of the miRNAs, producing a list of 895 genes. We then used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) to identify biological pathways that were potentially regulated by these miRNAs.

A one-way analysis of variance showed that all of the <italic>MAPK/Wnt</italic> genes tested were downregulated by at least one of the miRNA mimics transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Seven of the tested genes were downregulated by each of the four miRNA mimics. Thirteen genes were downregulated by three of the four miRNA mimics.

Based on our results, we propose a potential mechanism of action for these miRNAs through regulation of the <italic>MAPK</italic> and <italic>Wnt</italic> signalling pathways. Interestingly, inhibition of these pathways has been shown to lead to a depressive phenotype, while activation has been strongly associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms and improved antidepressant response in both central and peripheral systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

Other genes involved in calcium signalling, endocytosis and adherens junctions are also potentially regulated by these miRNAs.</p><p>In summary, we report a consistent dysregulation of miRNAs in peripheral blood samples from depressed patients after antidepressant treatment. Our findings indicate that miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-24-3p and miR-425-3p are consistent blood markers of antidepressant response and regulators of psychiatrically relevant signalling pathways. More importantly, we showed consistent changes in the expression of these miRNAs in patients who respond to treatment with different classes of ADs, as well as in stressed mice that respond to AD, suggesting their involvement in a common mechanism of action. These results have important implications for the elucidation of biological mechanisms involved in clinically relevant antidepressant effects and suggest that these miRNAs could potentially be used as correlates or state biomarkers of treatment response. Ultimately, our results underline the potential of studying miRNAs to better understand molecular processes associated with MDD and provide valuable information for the development of diagnostic tools, precautionary approaches and successful pharmacological interventions for MDD.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human samples</title><p>A total of 1,006 human samples were included in the present study, and include (1) discovery cohort (DRCT; <italic>n</italic>=516 samples from 258 patients) obtained in collaboration with the CAN-BIND and Lundbeck A/S sponsored clinical trials; (2) replication cohort 1 (RPCT1, <italic>n</italic>=122 samples from 61 patients) obtained in collaboration with the GENDEP consortium; (3) replication cohort 2 (RPCT2, <italic>n</italic>=316 samples from 158 patients) obtained in collaboration with CAN-BIND; and (4) post-mortem, prefrontal cortex brain tissue (<italic>n</italic>=52) that was obtained in collaboration with the Quebec Coroner's Office and the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank (Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Montreal, Canada).

All individuals were of French&#x02013;Canadian origin, a homogeneous population with a well-documented founder effect, and were matched for refrigeration delay, age and pH. Refrigeration delay refers to the difference between the estimated time of death (determined by the pathologist through external body examination details) and the time at which the brain was refrigerated.

Resilient and susceptible mice were identified by their respective preference for, or avoidance of, interaction with a novel mouse after 10 days of defeat in a social interaction test. Only control and susceptible mice were used for further study with imipramine.</p><p>Social-avoidance behaviour was assessed with a novel CD1 mouse in a two-stage social-interaction test. In the first 2.5&#x02009;min test (no target), the experimental mouse was allowed to freely explore an arena (44 &#x000d7; 44&#x02009;cm) containing a plexiglass and wire mesh enclosure (10 &#x000d7; 6&#x02009;cm) against one wall of the arena. In the second 2.5&#x02009;min test (target), the experimental mouse was returned to the arena with a novel CD1 mouse enclosed in the plexiglass wire mesh cage. Time spent in the &#x02018;interaction zone' (14 &#x000d7; 26&#x02009;cm) surrounding the plexiglass wire mesh cage, &#x02018;corner zones' (10 &#x000d7; 10&#x02009;cm) and &#x02018;distance travelled' within the arena was measured by video tracking software (Ethovision 5.0, Noldus).</p><p>Sucrose preference was assessed using a 2&#x00025; sucrose solution or tap water in 50&#x02009;ml tubes with stoppers fitted with ball-point sipper tubes. All animals were acclimatized to two-bottle choice conditions before testing conditions. Daily, at &#x0223c;1600, h, fluid levels were noted, and tube positions were interchanged. Sucrose preference was calculated as a percentage (100 &#x000d7; volume of sucrose consumed/total volume consumed (sucrose and water)) and was averaged over 2 days of testing.</p><p>Susceptible mice were randomly assigned to treatment with either imipramine (20&#x02009;mg&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;kg, daily) or a saline control (daily) treatment for 14 days. Blood was collected from all animals via the saphenous vein before treatment. Rapid sampling from the saphenous vein was used because it causes minimal discomfort or stress to the animal. The blood was stored in RNAlater at &#x02212;70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until use. After treatment and the second round of behaviour testing, animals were killed and blood was collected via truncation into RNAlater and frozen at &#x02212;70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>Then, 100&#x02009;ng of total RNA was used to quantify expression levels of miRNAs from animal blood samples using a probe-based miRNA expression assay (NanoString Technologies, USA). Briefly, hybridization of specific tags to target miRNAs was annealed to create multiplex probe libraries from all samples. Each miRNA of interest is identified by a &#x02018;colour code' generated by six ordered fluorescent spots present on a reporter probe and read by the nCounter Prep Station Digital Analyzer. Control RNA was included to monitor ligation efficiency and specificity throughout each step of the reactions. In addition, this protocol does not include any amplification steps that might introduce bias to the results. Raw data were imported into NSolver Analysis Software v2.0 (NanoString technologies) and normalized to the average counts to all endogenous genes. Data were further normalized using internal positive spike-in controls to account for variability in the hybridization process. Normalized data were imported into MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) software v.4.9 for further analysis. All numerical data are expressed as the mean&#x000b1;s.e.m.
