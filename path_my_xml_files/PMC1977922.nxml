One hundred and eighty two patients received a loading dose of 8 mg of ondansetron followed by a 24 h infusion of 1 mg h-1 (group 1); 180 and 173 patients received single doses of 32 mg (group II) and 8 mg (group III) respectively, followed by a 24 h placebo infusion. Complete and major control (less than or equal to 2 emetic episodes) of acute emesis was achieved in 74% of patients in group I, 78% in group II and 74% in group III. Seventy seven per cent of the patients in group I, and 75% of patients in groups II and III respectively experienced no or mild nausea during the 24 h observation period. A retrospective stratification of the efficacy data on the basis of patient gender showed the response rate in females to be significant lower (43% vs 67%; less than 0.001). Ondanestron was well tolerated; mild headache was the most commonly reported adverse event (11% of patients) with a similar incidence in the three groups of patients. In conclusion, a single intravenous dose of 8 mg of ondansetron given prior to chemotherapy is as effective as a 32 mg daily dose given as either a single dose of a continuous infusion in the prophylaxis of acute cisplatin-induced emesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00059-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="192" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00059-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="193" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00059-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="194" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00059-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="195" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00059-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="196" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00059-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="197" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
