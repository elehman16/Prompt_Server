The FOxTROT trial aims to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy for colon cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the pilot stage of this randomised controlled trial, 150 patients with radiologically staged locally advanced (T3 with &#x02265;5 mm invasion beyond the muscularis propria or T4) tumours from 35 UK centres were randomly assigned (2:1) to preoperative (three cycles of OxMdG [oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, l-folinic acid 175 mg, fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus, then 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> by 46 h infusion] repeated at 2-weekly intervals followed by surgery and a further nine cycles of OxMdG) or standard postoperative chemotherapy (12 cycles of OxMdG). Patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type tumours were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive panitumumab (6 mg/kg; every 2 weeks with the first 6 weeks of chemotherapy) or not. Treatment allocation was through a central randomisation service using a minimised randomisation procedure including age, radiological T and N stage, site of tumour, and presence of defunctioning colostomy as stratification variables. Primary outcome measures of the pilot phase were feasibility, safety, and tolerance of preoperative therapy, and accuracy of radiological staging. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 87163246.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>96% (95 of 99) of patients started and 89% (85 of 95) completed preoperative chemotherapy with grade 3&#x02013;4 gastrointestinal toxicity in 7% (seven of 94) of patients. All 99 tumours in the preoperative group were resected, with no significant differences in postoperative morbidity between the preoperative and control groups: 14% (14 of 99) versus 12% (six of 51) had complications prolonging hospital stay (p=0&#x000b7;81). 98% (50 of 51) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had T3 or more advanced tumours confirmed at post-resection pathology compared with 91% (90 of 99) of patients following preoperative chemotherapy (p=0&#x000b7;10).

Patients were allocated to a treatment group by a telephone or web-based central randomisation service at the University of Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (Birmingham, UK). A computerised minimised randomisation procedure was used to ensure a good balance between groups for age (&#x0003c;50, 50&#x02013;59, 60&#x02013;69, &#x02265;70 years), radiological T-stage (T3, T4), radiological nodal status (Nx, N0, N1, N2), site of primary tumour, and defunctioning colostomy (yes, no).

Radiologically classified tumour characteristics were similarly distributed across treatment groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Patient screening logs suggested that the main reason for clinicians not entering radiologically eligible patients was unsuitability for combination chemotherapy because of age or frailty. Patients were also excluded because of uncertainty about eligibility on CT staging, principally on whether depth of invasion beyond the muscularis propria was 5 mm or more. Premature scheduling of the operation date was also a common exclusion reason before the multidisciplinary teams and individual clinicians adapted to the new care pathway.</p><p>138 of the 150 patients were eligible for <italic>KRAS</italic> testing to establish eligibility for the panitumumab randomisation: two were entered before <italic>KRAS</italic> testing was introduced, six were entered while the panitumumab randomisation was suspended, and four were from centres not taking part in the panitumumab randomisation (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Biopsy samples were obtained for 98% (135 of 138) of these patients and 96% (130 of 135) were successfully tested. 72% (95 of 132 with known <italic>KRAS</italic> status, including the two patients retrospectively tested) were <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either panitumumab or control, with four <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type results arriving too late for panitumumab randomisation and one patient declining randomisation. 46 (31% of all 150 patients) were allocated panitumumab. The median time from consent to <italic>KRAS</italic> test result and panitumumab randomisation was 9 days (IQR 7&#x02013;12).</p><p>Of 99 patients allocated preoperative chemotherapy, 95 (96%) started treatment as planned with one proceeding directly to surgery after diagnosis of a localised perforation and three because of patient or clinician's choice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The mean delay from randomisation to start of chemotherapy was 13 (SD 6) days. 89% (85 of 95) of patients starting preoperative treatment completed the 6-week course with nine stopping early because of toxicity and one withdrawing to off-trial bevacizumab treatment. All 99 patients underwent resectional surgery with a mean time to surgery from start of chemotherapy of 61 (SD 15) days. 83% (82 of 99) continued with postoperative OxMdG chemotherapy. 15 patients had no postoperative chemotherapy; five patients (including three who had no preoperative chemotherapy) did not have postoperative chemotherapy because of low-risk pathology, five because of previous adverse events (four because of toxicity of preoperative chemotherapy, one because of surgical morbidity), three refused, one had metastatic disease, and one died in the postoperative period. Additionally, two had off-protocol treatment (one patient had a different chemotherapy regimen, and one was treated with bevacizumab). 96% (79 of 82) of those starting completed the first 6 weeks (three stopped because of toxicity) and 82% (67 of 82) completed all 18 weeks of postoperative treatment. Toxicity was the most common reason for stopping treatment, with nine patients stopping at some point during postoperative chemotherapy (four during or after the first three cycles of postoperative chemotherapy, one after the second three cycles, and four during or after the final three cycles).</p><p>Of 51 patients allocated postoperative chemotherapy, 94% (48 of 51) had resectional surgery with one dying beforehand and two who were not resected because of inoperable peritoneal spread detected at surgery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). 78% (40 of 51) started postoperative chemotherapy with 11 not having postoperative chemotherapy because of low-risk pathology (seven) or dying beforehand (four). 95% (38 of 40) of those starting completed the first 6 weeks and 72% (29 of 40) completed all 24 weeks of chemotherapy. Toxicity caused six patients to discontinue chemotherapy.</p><p>Thus, a higher proportion of patients started preoperative than postoperative chemotherapy (96% [95 of 99] <italic>vs</italic> 78% [40 of 51]; p=0&#x000b7;001), and chemotherapy completion rates were also higher in the preoperative therapy group with 68% (67 of 99) of those allocated pre plus postoperative chemotherapy completing 24 weeks of treatment compared with 57% (29 of 51) of postoperative chemotherapy patients (p=0&#x000b7;19).</p><p>Accuracy of radiological staging was assessed by pathological examination of resected tumours from the postoperative chemotherapy only group. 86% (43 of 50 [including two that were unresected]) of tumours had adverse features (inoperable tumour, positive lymph nodes, extramural vascular invasion [EMVI], or depth of invasion &#x02265;5 mm) on pathological examination, indicative of a greater than 50% recurrence risk at 3 years. Radiology accurately identified invasion of the muscularis propria, with only 2% (one of 51) of patients in the postoperative group having a pathological T2 (pT2) tumour; a further 12% (six of 51) had pT3 tumours without additional risk factors. Radiology was less accurate in discriminating between T3 and T4 stage, with 47% (eight of 17) of pT4 tumours also T4 on radiological assessment and 50% (8 of 16) of those T4 on radiology were pT3 on pathological assessment. Radiological assessment was more sensitive in detecting nodal spread with 83% (20 of 24) of pathological node-positive patients also node-positive on radiological assessment. However, specificity was low with radiological staging tending to overestimate tumour spread: 44% (16 of 36) of those node-positive on radiology were node-negative on pathological assessment. Similarly, 52% (14 of 27) of those with extramural vascular invasion on radiology were EMVI-negative on pathological assessment.</p><p>One patient in each group needed acute surgery because of incipient obstruction, with both proceeding to resectional surgery. No significant differences were seen in complication rates (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) or median time to hospital discharge (preoperative plus postoperative chemotherapy group: 7 days, IQR 5&#x02013;10; postoperative only: 6 days, 3&#x02013;8; p=0&#x000b7;18) although there was a greater proportion of wound infections in the preoperative group (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The proportions of patients with complications that prolonged hospital stay, or had procedures that resulted in a stoma or required further adominal surgery for anastomotic complications, were much the same for the two groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The median delay after surgery to starting chemotherapy was 47 days (IQR 40&#x02013;55) for patients allocated preoperative chemotherapy and 53 days (44&#x02013;57) for patients allocated postoperative chemotherapy.</p><p>Of those receiving chemotherapy, toxicity was similar between groups in the first 6 weeks and in subsequent treatment (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). 34% (32 of 94) of preoperative and 31% (12 of 39) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had grade 3 or worse toxicity in their first 6 weeks of chemotherapy (p=0&#x000b7;72). 7% (seven of 94) of preoperative and 10% (four of 39) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity; 11% (nine of 85) versus 21% (eight of 38) required dose reductions (p=0&#x000b7;12) and 11% (ten of 95) versus 5% (two of 40) did not complete their first 6 weeks of chemotherapy (p=0&#x000b7;31). Only one patient had surgery delayed, for 2 weeks, because of toxicity of preoperative chemotherapy&#x02014;grade 4 neutropenia. For all 24 weeks of chemotherapy, 49% of patients (47 of 95) in the preoperative chemotherapy group and 51% of patients (20 of 39) in the postoperative group had any grade 3 or higher adverse events, with the most common being haematological (29% [28 of 95] and 28% [11 of 39]) and gastrointestinal (19% [18 of 95] and 21% [eight of 39]) adverse events (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>Significant differences favouring preoperative therapy were seen in apical node involvement in the resected specimens (one of 98 <italic>vs</italic> ten of 50; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), TNM5 staging (p=0&#x000b7;04), resection margin involvement (four of 99 <italic>vs</italic> ten of 50; p=0&#x000b7;002), and retroperitoneal margin involvement (five of 94 <italic>vs</italic> eight of 44; p=0&#x000b7;016; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). 31% of (29 of 94) tumours in the preoperative group with blinded centrally scored regression grades showed moderate to complete regression as compared with 2% (one of 46) in the control series (p=0&#x000b7;0001). There were reductions in tumour diameter, tumour thickness, and depth of spread beyond the muscularis propria in the preoperative group compared with controls. There were two complete pathological responses and seven T2 tumours in the preoperative group, with only one T2 tumour in the control group. However, downstaging as assessed by T stage was not significant (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).

The significant reductions in apical node involvement, incomplete resections, and two pathological complete responses, are noteworthy since all have previously been shown to correlate with protracted disease-free survival.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Tumour regression grading after preoperative chemotherapy also correlates with recurrence risk in other gastointestinal malignancies,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> and longer follow-up of the FOxTROT cohort should establish whether tumour regression grading is similarly prognostic in colon cancer.</p><p>We have also shown that preoperative therapy is practicable and safe with no increase in surgical morbidity or mortality&#x02014;a major focus of the feasibility study. With a 3-week delay after chemotherapy, surgery can be completed within 10 weeks from diagnosis. A small proportion (17%) of patients in the preoperative chemotherapy group had apparent progression between diagnostic radiology and post-resection pathology but, reassuringly, no patients developed incipient obstruction during the 6-week preoperative chemotherapy. A central review of CT scans is being undertaken to investigate whether the apparent upstaging was due to inaccurate initial radiological staging or true progression and will be reported separately. The absence of measurable adverse effects in terms of prolonged hospital stay, stoma formation, reoperation rates, and leak rates is, again, encouraging. A trend towards increased wound and chest infection was expected and seen, but was not significant. Compliance with postoperative chemotherapy, a potential surrogate marker for surgical morbidity, was not reduced in the preoperative group. Diarrhoea and skin rash were lower than previously reported with combination oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidine, and EGFR antibody therapy,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> probably because only 31% received panitumumab&#x02014;the panitumumab comparison is still masked&#x02014;and also because of the short (6-week) duration preoperative treatment.</p><p>Another key finding is that a high-risk cohort suitable for combination chemotherapy can be identified by radiological assessment across multiple sites. The risk of exposing patients with early stage (pT2) disease to inappropriate chemotherapy was low, with only one patient of 51 (2%) being inaccurately upstaged, justifying the ongoing phase 3 trial. Chemotherapy for the 12% with pT3 tumours without additional risk factors is not unreasonable in view of the established efficacy of chemotherapy in stage 2 disease.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> In a parallel audit,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> 93% of patients with radiologically staged T3 tumours with less than 5 mm invasion of the muscularis propria were found to have coexisting high-risk pathological features that justify chemotherapy and the eligibility criteria for the full FOxTROT study have been amended accordingly. As radiological staging of primary colon cancer is underdeveloped, a series of workshops&#x02014;attended by 200 gastrointestinal radiologists&#x02014;were held to standardise radiological selection criteria and similar training would be advisable in other neoadjuvant trials.</p><p>The population studied in FOxTROT seemed typical of those who might be considered for neoadjuvant therapy. The median age of 63 years is 10 years younger than the colon cancer population as a whole, but typical for trials of adjuvant chemotherapy. The distribution of tumours in the study largely reflects that of colonic tumours in the population, other than fewer tumours from the rectosigmoid region, probably because of consideration for radiotherapy, an exclusion criterion. The fairly high (20%) resection margin involvement in control patients is probably explained by more rigorous histopathological assessment and by selection of high-risk patients.</p><p>Delivery of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation analysis across 35 UK sites was another challenge, since delay in treatment would preclude clinical use. Our 9-day median time from consent to <italic>KRAS</italic> testing to randomisation for panitumumab was achieved with a two-stage consent process and, importantly, a histopathology principal investigator at every site who helped to ensure that the biopsy sample was released for analysis promptly. Another concern that testing of small biopsies would be inaccurate also proved unfounded, with an assay failure rate of only 4%, and the concordance between <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation assays of matched samples from the multiple biopsies and resected tumour was 99%,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> showing the reliability of DNA-based assays of colon cancer biopsies.</p><p>A particular strength of neoadjuvant over metastatic studies is that pre-treatment and post-treatment tissue samples are available to assess markers of tumour response. If validated as a surrogate of long-term oncological outcome, regression grading provides the most statistically sensitive measure of chemosensitivity to allow identification of predictive molecular markers and, potentially, to guide postoperative adjuvant treatment. Radiological assessment after preoperative therapy provided supportive evidence for real downstaging and could also be useful in assessment of primary tumour response and the potential value of extending preoperative therapy.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that patients with locally advanced, but resectable, colon cancer can be appropriately selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CT scanning, can be molecularly stratified preoperatively, and can safely undergo preoperative chemotherapy followed by colonic resectional surgery, without incurring significant perioperative morbidity. We have also shown significant downstaging of primary tumours, including fewer incomplete resections and reduced apical lymph node metastases, after only 6 weeks of combination therapy. On the basis of these promising findings from the pilot phase, proceeding to the ongoing FOxTROT phase 3 study is appropriate; we aim to enrol at least a further 900 patients. If preoperative therapy results in fewer recurrences, as well as tumour downstaging, the established pathway of surgery then chemotherapy in the management of colon cancer could potentially change.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Medical
