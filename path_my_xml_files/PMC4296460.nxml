It is estimated that around 50% of the population has one or more sites with 1 mm or more of such root exposure. This prevalence rate increases to &#x0003e; 88% in individuals who are 65 years or older.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Patients often have esthetic concerns due to increased clinical crown height. In some instances, they may experience dental hypersensitivity. Biological and functional issues associated with mucogingival problems also dictate the need for treatment. Key factors in the treatment of gingival recession are to prevent the progressive marginal tissue recession and to facilitate plaque control in the affected area.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Various treatment modalities have been put forth for the correction of gingival recession. These include free gingival autograft, sub-epithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG), coronally advanced flap (CAF). It is seen that the incidence of adverse effects, such as discomfort with or without pain, was directly related to the donor sites of SCTG. Hence despite SCTG being the gold standard for root coverage research is always aimed at finding a suitable alternative to this procedure to reduce patient morbidity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Coronally advanced flap first described by Norberg in 1926. This procedure has been modified by many others with an intention to improve the stability and predictability of this technique. In a recent 14 year follow-up study Pini Prato <italic>et al</italic>. has shown a 39% of recurrence in patients treated with CAF.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Hence this procedure is now generally employed with adjuncts such as guided tissue regeneration membrane, emdogain, acellular dermal matrix and platelet rich plasma to enhance its long term stability. However, evidence regarding the beneficial impact of these procedures on the stability of root coverage is inconclusive.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear polysaccharide found in extracellular matrices of skin. Hyaluronan has many structural and physiological functions within tissues, including extracellular and cellular interactions, growth factor interaction and the regulation of osmotic pressure and tissue lubrication, which helps in the maintenance of the structural and homeostatic integrity of tissues.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Hyaluronic acid is one of the most hygroscopic molecules known in nature. One gram of HA can bind up to 6 L of water. As a physical background material, it has functions in space filling, lubrication, shock absorption, and protein exclusion.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>According to various clinical studies hyaluronan undergoes degradation in chronically inflamed gingival tissues, whereas the proteoglycan associated sulfated glycosaminoglycans, such as chondroitin 4-sulphate and dermatan sulfate, remain relatively intact. HA is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and modulates wound healing due to its ability to scavenge the inflammatory cells-derived reactive oxygen species.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>This study is aimed at testing the efficacy of hyaluronan gel as an adjunct to CAF in root coverage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized clinical trial with split mouth study design, carried out in the postgraduate clinic of Department of Periodontics, Coorg Institute of Dental Sciences, Virajpet. The study sample included 10 subjects of which seven are male, and three female (at least 20 sites) having Miller's Class I gingival recession on the canine and premolar region were recruited from Department of Periodontics, Coorg Institute of Dental Sciences. The sample size was calculated adjusting the minimum acceptable power of study at 80% and maximum allowable alpha error at 5%. The recession defects were designated as experimental and control sites randomly prior to surgery by spin of a coin.</p><p>Experimental group includes hyaluronan gel (gengigel 0.2% gel which is 0.2% hyaluronan gel marketed by Ricerfarma pharmaceuticals, Milan, Italy) with CAF and control group with CAF alone.</p><p>This self-funded study was approved by institutional ethical committee, and the procedure and the procedure was explained to all the subjects who provided signed informed consent before participation. Medical and dental examination was obtained from all the individuals who were followed by complete periodontal examination. Subjects were excluded if they were smokers, pregnant women or medically compromised. Patients with malaligned teeth, teeth in trauma from occlusion, cervical abrasion and restorations were also excluded. Subjects were included who are systemically healthy with two or more sites of Miller's Class I recession and those who can understand and follow oral hygiene instructions properly.</p><p>At baseline the following clinical parameters were measured using UNC 15 probe.</p><p>

The RD was assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks, and the PD and CAL were recorded at 12 and 24 weeks with the patients consent.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>The patients who were selected and gave their approval for the surgical intervention were educated and motivated with more emphasis on proper oral hygiene maintenance. All the patients underwent the initial phase of treatment of thorough scaling and root planning.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>All the surgical procedures were carried out by one operator. The sites were randomly assigned to the control group or the test group using a flip coin technique immediately before surgery.</p><p>The surgical area was prepared with adequate anesthesia using 2% lignocaine HCL containing 1:80,000 epinephrine. After local anesthesia and before the elevation of the flap, both the exposed root surfaces were gently planned with a sharp Gracey no. 1&#x02013;2 curettes to reduce root convexity. Immediately after, the root surface was washed for 60 s with water spray. Intrasulcular incisions were then made with a blade (no. 15) on the buccal aspect of the involved tooth. This incision was horizontally extended to the adjacent papillae avoiding the gingival margin of the adjacent teeth. Two oblique releasing incisions were carried out from the mesial, and distal extremities of the horizontal incision beyond the mucogingival junction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. A trapezoidal full-thickness flap was raised with a periosteal elevator, until the mucogingival junction. Then a partial-thickness dissection was carried out apically leaving the underlying periosteum in place. In addition a mesiodistal and apical dissection parallel to the vestibular lining mucosa was performed with a blade to release residual muscle tension and to facilitate the passive coronal displacement of the flap. The papillae adjacent to the involved tooth were de-epithelized. The flap was then advanced coronally and adapted to cover the cementoenamel junction.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Horizontal and vertical incisions given in relation to 23; (b) Hyaluronan gel applied on the root surface of experimental site; (c) Suturing done.

Suturing of oblique releasing incisions was performed, with 5-0 ethicon nonresorbable sutures, while the coronal mesial and distal extremities of the flap were secured by two single sutures placed in the interdental areas [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>].[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Additional interrupted sutures were applied, when necessary, to close the oblique releasing incisions in the alveolar mucosa.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Postsurgical care</title><p>Immediately following surgery, use of ice packs was recommended for 3 h. All patients were instructed to discontinue tooth brushing, avoid trauma around the surgical site. In the event of pain, the use of ibuprophen + paracetamol (thrice daily) was recommended. A 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution rinse was prescribed 2 times (60 s) daily for the first 10 days. The sutures were removed after 7 days [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>]. The patients were instructed to clean the surgical sites with a cotton pellet soaked in a 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution twice daily for 10 days. Three weeks after surgery, the patients were instructed to resume mechanical tooth cleaning of the treated areas using a soft toothbrush with a careful roll technique. Adverse effects such as inflammation, bleeding on probing, pain and abscess formation were assessed postsurgically by first examiner (MS).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data collection</title><p>The patients were recalled for collection of data at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks using prefabricated acrylic stent.

It is a linear polysaccharide and one of the principle components of the extracellular matrix, which is biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic. HA is a macromolecule of several million Daltons, consisting of repeating units of D-glucoronic acid (1-&#x003b2;-3) N-Acetyl &#x02013;D- glucosamine (1-&#x003b2;4) n.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Exogenous application of hyaluronan has shown to have anti edema, anti-inflammatory and good wound healing properties.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It has been used extensively in the field of dentistry for its various beneficial applications. In periodontics it has been used to treat gingivitis[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and periodontitis[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and more recently in the treatment of periodontal intra bony defects.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The present study was conceived in an effort to merge two simple and cost effective techniques to achieve better root coverage. A split mouth study design was considered appropriate to minimize the bias that would arise due to variations in healing pattern among individuals.</p><p>Complete root coverage was achieved immediately following the surgical procedures in all cases except one in the experimental group. During the study, all patients were recalled after 3 months for oral prophylaxis regimen. After 24 weeks, 100% root coverage was seen in six sites out of which only two were control sites. That is, at the end of 24 weeks, 40% of experimental sites demonstrated 100% root coverage [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>], whereas only 20% of the control sites showed complete root coverage [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>]. This suggests that clinically the root coverage achieved with the use of hyaluronan gel is more predictable at the end of 24 weeks. Percentage of root coverage in the experimental sites was 68.3% and control sites were 61.6%. This is in accordance with the systematic review by Chambrone <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which said that that the mean root coverage for CAF alone was ranging from 55.9% to 86.7%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The biological properties of hyaluronan as reported by studies by Ballini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] suggests that it promotes regeneration. The clinical stability of the root coverage achieved after 24 weeks in this study supports this aspect of previous studies. It has been suggested from previous animal studies[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that there is an increase in hard tissue component of the periodontium following treatment with hyaluronan. It promotes wound healing by cell migration and proliferation, facilitating white blood cell infiltration and improving tissue hydration.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This could contribute to better stability of the root coverage procedures that is seen with the use of hyaluronan.</p><p>Hyaluronan as previously mentioned has been extensively studied in the field of dentistry, but to the best of our knowledge, there is no published data on the usage of HA in the treatment of root coverage procedures. Hence, it is premature at this point to make a comparison of the results of this study with previous studies. The cases were followed for a period of 6 months. A longer follow-up is required to know the long-term stability of the treatment procedures.</p><p>However, this study has some limitations. It is entirely based on clinical parameters, where in the exact nature of periodontal regeneration achieved could be made only by histological evaluation, studies with large sample size and higher statistical power are needed in the future to explore and establish use of hyaluronan as an adjunct in periodontal surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study shows that hyaluronan affects treatment outcome when used as an adjunct to CAF procedure. Although results are not statistically significant, clinically experimental group shows better results as compared to the control group. Though CAF gives 100% coverage immediately following the surgery only 61-64% can be expected 24 weeks after surgery. Hyaluronan can be easily combined with CAF procedure in compromised cases and situations where more stable results are desired.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kassab</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The etiology and prevalence of gingival recession</article-title><source>J Am Dent Assoc</source><year>2003</year><volume>134</volume><fpage>220</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12636127</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gingival recession.
