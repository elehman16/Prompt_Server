as a neuropsychological measure that assesses decision-making (DM) under ambiguity. This
task intends to simulate a real-life decision-making situation, in which the
participants have to choose cards in order to win or lose money. The task enables
classification of a subject&#x02019;s decision-making behavior in terms of risk aversion versus
risk taking.</p><p>The IGT was first developed to investigate the realworld deficits exhibited by patients
with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC)<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Prior to the
development of the IGT, conventional &#x0201c;lab&#x0201d; tasks were not able to index the types of
defective decisions such patients took in their everyday-life. Briefly, patients with
lesions to the VMPC displayed myopia for the future, preferring short-term reinforcement
over long-term repercussions. Despite strong evidence for the IGT&#x02019;s sensitivity to VMPC
functioning, some studies have indicated that the IGT may present some limitations as
regards its lack of specificity. In other words, studies carried out on patients that
have damage in non-VMPC brain areas have also showed impairment in their ability to
decide<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p>One of the hypothetical explanations places emphasis on the IGT&#x02019;s complexity, an aspect
that requires the involvement of other cognitive components besides decision- making. A
first process that seems to be of special relevance concerns behavioral inhibition,
crucial for a decision process to take place<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In other words, in order to allow a balance between different
options of choice, it is necessary to control impulsive behavior enabling appropriate
use of the cognitive process for the information handled. Thus, attention processes seem
to be equally important, enabling relevant aspects of the information on the options to
be highlighted<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, the
information regarding these options must be held in the conscious process for some time
using the working memory, allowing the use of reasoning processes and judgment
concerning the advantages and disadvantages of each option of choice.</p><p>Therefore, it is plausible to assume that particular administration differences amongst
the different IGT versions used, such as the kind of financial feedback provided or
reinforcement used (real or fake money), among others, may be an important factor to
consider. The underlying reason behind this is that these differences may provide
additional important hints that can maximize the participation of some cognitive
components much more than others, or vice versa. For instance, visual feedback can be
memorized differently to verbal feedback, interfering in the memorization process
necessary for appropriate performance of the task.</p><p>Some studies have focused on aspects of administering the task, which vary according to
researcher, aiming to verify whether they can differentially affect the performance of
the participants on the IGT. No difference has been observed regarding the kind of
reinforcement used (real or facsimile money)<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Similarly, no
difference in performance has been found stemming from the kind of version used
(computerized or manual)<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.When
focusing these discussions on the elderly population<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, the hypothesis over
the possible effects of administration differences takes into consideration specific
aspects of the ageing process. Regarding the cognitive changes found in this elderly
population, we have considered segmented studies on memory loss, mainly those showing
significant working memory damage and impaired ability to remember<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Thus, it is plausible to suggest that
usage changes that facilitate the mnemonic process can assist older individuals in their
decision-making process throughout the IGT.</p><p>Denburg, Tranel &#x00026; Bechara<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> carried
out a study in which they observed that a sub group of older adults showed DM impairment
compared to younger individuals. Moreover, when repeating the performance analysis of
the elderly, the study by McPherson, Phillips &#x00026; Della Sala<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, Denburg et al.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> suggest that the same subgroup composition could be found if
the authors had conducted a group subdivision. On the other hand, the study carried out
by Schneider<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> reveals that neither
young nor old people showed evidence of borderline performance when submitted to a
different version of the IGT. Basically, this version shares the same characteristics
found in the original<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, except for a
lack of visual cues concerning the amount of gain and loss throughout the games (green
bar, which increases and decreases). Wagner<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> showed that the aid of a manual visual cue, which interfered in
the decision processes of the older adults, improved the performance in terms of
aversion to risk.</p><p>Considering the arguments presented so far, we note the importance of carrying out
studies with different versions of the IGT to verify in what way the specific changes in
task administration may affect individuals&#x02019; performance. Also, studies of this nature
enable a better understanding about the different components involved in the task,
allowing greater control of its complexity and a consequent increase in its
specification. In this sense, the present study will compare three versions of the IGT
regarding the feedback provided by the test in relation to the amount of money lost or
won during the game. The first version (I) consists of a replication of the original
version<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. It has a computerized
visual aid which is presented by means of a green bar which increases or de-creases
according to the gains or losses. The second version (II) however, will involve a
non-computerized visual aid (cards), which will enable the participants to have some
idea of the amount gained (or lost) at any given time. In the third version (III), the
task will not present any visual aid, thus not offering any idea of the amount won or
lost at any given time.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design and participants</title><p>Older adults were recruited from the community, and randomly assigned to one of

others, including disorders that can generate changes in cognitive functions).
Regarding the inclusion criteria, the minimum age was 56 years old, and
participants must have received at least 4 years of formal education.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures and procedures</title><p>The older adults were invited to participate in the study as volunteers. All the
participants lived in the community, and had never been institutionalized. After
being informed about the objectives of the study and having signed the Consent
Agreement, the participants were submitted to evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-report questionnaire of social-demographic and cultural data</title><p>Firstly, the Brazilian older adults completed a socialdemographic and cultural
data self-report questionnaire, in order to obtain data to characterize the
sample studied. Through this form it was possible to glean information such as
age, education, social-economic level, reading and writing habits, among others.
The data on demographic variables were obtained through objective questions.
Regarding the North American sample, the participants were submitted to a
semi-structured interview<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>,
which had similar objectives to those in the Brazilian sample form.</p></sec><sec><title>Iowa gambling test (IGT)</title><p>The IGT is a neuropsychological measure that assesses decision-making ability
(1). The computerized version was used in all three studies, with some
variations, as outlined below. All of the statistical data were analyzed with
SPSS, version 12.</p></sec><sec><title>Original version (with computerized visual reinforcement)<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></title><p>Using monetary choices, the task allows classification of the participant&#x02019;s
performance in terms of aversion or risk taking. The task consists of four decks
of cards of similar appearance (labeled A, B, C and D). The participant is told,
during the initial verbal instructions, to select one card at a time from any of
the fours decks. They are told that each time they choose a card they will win
some money and that occasionally they will also lose some money. They are also
told that the goal of the IGT is to win money, or maximize profit.</p><p>For instance, when the participant chooses a card from Decks A and B, they win R$
100,00, whereas when they choose from Decks C and D, they might win R$ 50,00.
Decks A and C have frequent but low penalties whereas Decks B and D have
occasional penalties but of high values. Despite the large amount of money one
can win, Decks A and B are considered disadvantageous because the losses
outweigh the gains, yielding an overall net loss. However, Decks C and D are
considered advantageous, because the gains outweigh the losses, yielding an
overall net gain. The task continues until all 100 cards are selected. During
the task, the individual can obtain an estimate of the value won so far, but
cannot know the amount exactly. This is possible because the computer offers a
cue informing the participant about the losses and gains. Specifically, there
are two bars are displayed on the computer screen, one that does not change
representing the initial situation (the loan the participant receives), and
another indicating the gains and losses, that increases or decreases in size as
the wins and losses are accumulated. As the participant performs the task, this
bar provides information (not exact numbers) of the remaining monetary
balance.</p></sec><sec><title>Version with non-computerized visual reinforcement<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></title><p>This task is the same as the original version<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, with one variation. At every selection, besides the
message of receiving or losing money on the computer screen, the participant
gains or loses the equivalent in colorful tokens presented by the examiner. The
tokens used are of three colors: yellow (worth R$ 25,00), blue (worth R$ 50,00),
and pink (R$ 100,00 each).</p><p>The older adults were not informed about how much each token was worth, only that
they represent money won by them during the test. As money is lost or won,
tokens of the corresponding values are placed into or withdrawn from sight of
the participant. The participants were not told to make precise calculations of
losses or gains. The objective was that only an estimate of the balance was
available, from the accumulation or loss of colorful tokens. The indexes used
for the calculations were the same as in the original version.</p></sec><sec><title>Version without visual reinforcement<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></title><p>This version without visual reinforcement was adapted by Schneider<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and is administrated
according to standard protocol<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, except for one aspect. In this version, the participants
had no computerized bars with the direction of the gains and the losses, where
this aid is believed to facilitate the development of an approximation of the
value obtained throughout the experiment. The participants received computerized
feedback related to the amount lost or gained, without, however, receiving the
mnemonics given by the green bar, which increased or decreased according to the
losses and gains. Thus, participants were informed of the wins and potential
losses for each card choice, but were not provided a directional visual
depiction of cumulative gains and losses.</p></sec><sec><title>Calculation of the aversion to risk and classification of the
participants</title><p>The same calculation of the aversion to risk was used in the three versions
studied, and this served as the main dependent variable. From the result of
choices from the four decks we were able to establish an index through the
following operation [(C+D)-(A+B)]. The performance of each
participant was classified after the calculation according to the criteria of
Denburg et al.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, under of the
three following categories:</p><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(1) <italic>Participant unimpaired</italic> (aversion to risk);</p></list-item><list-item><p>(2) <italic>participant borderline</italic>; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>(3) <italic>participant impaired (risk attraction)</italic>.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Scores below zero indicate loss of money and risk attraction, whereas scores
greater than zero indicate gain of money and an aversion to risk. The Chi-square
test (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) was used to calculate data related to the
<italic>Iowa Gambling Test</italic> (aversion to risk).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>Participants in each of the three groups completed an evaluation according to the
bioethical norms governing research on humans. For Brazilian participants, these
rights were assured according to norms<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. The research
project related to group II went before the Research Ethics Committee of the
Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (CEP/UFRGS) and was registered under
number 2005463. This was approved at meeting number 43, of 24/11/2005, minute
n&#x000ba; 64, and deemed ethically, and methodologically adequate<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>Regarding the North American participants, they were invited to participate in
the research, and given the choice whether they would like to take part in the
study or not. If they agreed, they would receive the Informed Consent Document,
which included the purpose of the study in detail. Additionally, the
participants were paid for taking part in this research study ($12.50 per hour).
All the research assistants completed the online course &#x0201c;Human Participant
Protections Education for Research Teams&#x0201d;, sponsored by the National Institute
of Health (NIH).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The data related to the <italic>Iowa Gambling Test</italic> (calculations of aversion
to the risky decks) were analyzed using the Chi-square (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) test.
As can be seen from the data provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table
2</xref>, the participants without any cues had only borderline performance,
whereas out of those with non-computerized cues, twice the number of participants
showed attraction to risk than those with aversion. The participants of the
computerized cue version were homogeneously spread across the three groups
(Impaired, borderline and unimpaired performance). The analysis was firstly
performed using the test of Chisquare. The distribution of the three groups was
significantly different (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=40, 99 df=4, p value less than 0.001).
The expected value corresponds to 10, which enables comparison through the
Chi-square, in spite of the two occurrences lower than 5<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Since this position does not extend to the
statistic studies<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, a second
comparison grouped the borderline patients with the patients with attraction to
risk. The Fisher&#x02019;s exact test showed a significant difference between the cueless
version compared to both the computerized cue version (p&#x0003c;0.001) and the
non-computerized cue version (p&#x0003c;0.001). Thus, even with a smaller group receiving
no computerized cues, significant differences were obtained. However, the
computerized cue version did not differ significantly from the non-computerized one
(p=0.61).</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Number of participants with or without aversion to risk in the three

whereas the manual cue showed a more restricted range, with a slightly greater
number of participants having negative scores. The group without cues, on the other
hand, resulted in little variation in the scores of participants, showing a curve in
a central position near zero. In other words, the computerized cue version lead to
the choice of one of the tendencies, while the version without cues with the result
around zero indicates that the participants made similar choices for advantageous
decks as well as disadvantageous.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Graph of the dispersion of the three groups of elderly.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dn-01-01-0066-g01"/></fig></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, the participants in the <italic>computerized cue
version</italic>, version I, were spread more homogenously across the three
subgroups of performance classification, that is, one third showed impaired
performance. For group II, <italic>non-computerized visual reinforcement</italic>,
in spite of the fact that the majority had their performance classified as
borderline, twice as many participants showed impaired performance in relation to
those with aversion to risk. The older adults belonging to group III, without cue
version, showed borderline performance in relation to aversion to risk, as their
behavior did not significantly differentiate from the value &#x0201c;0.&#x0201d;</p><p>The first explanation for the difference in performance among the groups is related
to the complexity of the process in the decision-making and consequently of the IGT
itself, that could have stemmed from administration differences. decision-making is
a complex cognitive process, which involves other cognitive components throughout.
Given the IGT involves these components to measure the decision process, any
alteration in instructions might decrease the role of some specific and hierarchal
subordinated cognitive processes, such as working memory, explicit
learning<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and attention,
minimizing the influence of these in the process of making choices during the task.
Although not addressed in the present study, motivation might also play an important
role in the performance on the IGT<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>Empirical evidence corroborates the notion of the involvement of other cognitive
components in DM. Besides the emotional factors clearly presented in the somatic
marker hypothesis<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, DM involves the
learning processes (through association between specific categories of stimuli and
specific categories of somatic states), attention processes and working memory
components, making this outcome feasible<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>The working memory acts by aiding the temporary holding of information concerning
different options of choice in conscious processing, allowing processes of logical
thinking and reasoning about advantages and disadvantages of each option to be
employed. The working memory is also responsible for the challenging task of
considering past events and projecting them to a scenario in the future, based on
the present situation<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>On submission to the IGT, the cognitive and emotional information that has already
passed is reactivated when the individual considers the characteristics involved in
each deck, contributing to the analysis of the actual chances. Attention processes
seem to be also required, enabling those relevant aspects of the information of
choices to be highlighted<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this sense, it is plausible to consider that the introduction of a reinforcement
cue albeit visual or computer based, authorizes the allocation of more cognitive
resources for the decision. Thus, the use of a cue would facilitate the task,
especially amongst the aged, by allowing lesser interference of the cognitive,
attention, and mnemonic processes in the decisional process.</p><p>Although some studies investigating the role of the working memory in the performance
of individuals on the IGT have presented contradictory results<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, an alternative explanation is proposed. This proposes that
the working memory and decision-making are asymmetrically dependent, evidencing a
simple dissociation<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. This implies the
working memory is not dependent on impairment in decision-making, in other words,
participants can present a working memory in the presence or absence of a deficit in
decision-making. However, integrity of decision-making seems to depend on a working
memory without impairment.</p><p>Revisiting the model of the somatic markers, it is valid to consider that beyond the
attention and mnemonic processes involved in the judgment and analysis of the choice
options, as well as in decision-making, the emotional learning that the individual
develops during the course of the task makes it equally important. Thus, besides
involving cognitive processes usually accessed by conventional tests that measure
executive powers, the IGT calls on participants&#x02019; feelings regarding the options,
which can be characterized as an emotional anticipation of the
consequences<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.
Kahneman<sup><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> follows a
similar line, when defending two cognitive function approaches: an intuitive way
involving fast and automatic decision-making, implicitly, and a controlled side,
which involves a slower and pondered process.</p><p>Regarding the performance of the individuals on the IGT, when the necessity of
resources of working memory is minimized, the role that this would assume long ago,
mainly in the aged population, seems to be reduced. In other words, if when offering
a visual cue of the value gained (or lost) at the time one gives the elderly more
information regarding the task, the work of the calculation during the course of the
process is facilitated. Hence, it can be inferred that a more controlled learning is
facilitated, since these cognitive processes are less vulnerable to error,
increasing the role of the most implicit processes when choosing the decks.</p><p>This hypothesis requires further studies verifying its assertions empirically.
Firstly, because even though the alterations in the instruction of the task may have
reduced the role of some resources of memory and attention, much of these are still
necessary for a satisfactory result. Furthermore, the notion that a greater role of
the implicit components would have led the aged to demonstrate a higher attraction
to risk contradicts the ideas of some empirical evidences demonstrating a preserved
emotional process of positive and negative valences in this population, compared
with the young<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p><p>Amongst other possible variables involved in the choice of the process, it is
reasonable to believe that characteristics of personality exert a certain tendency
in preferences. Besides the related cognitive and emotional processes, some studies
have shown that characteristics of personality can have some effect on the choices
made, if added to the influences of the somatic marker and the executive
processes<sup><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.</p><p>In addition to the complexity of the process of DM, a second, nevertheless no less
important explanation for the results involves the possible influence of cultural
aspects on the performance of the individuals in the different versions. Some
authors have shown the influence of factors such as education and partner-cultural
level in different neuropsychological tests, as well as those that evaluate
executive powers<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>,
attention<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>,
perception<sup><xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>,
memory<sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>,
language<sup><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and
constructive praxis<sup><xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. However, in
the case of the IGT, the importance of gambling habits and values of a particular
culture may influence the greater or lesser tendency for risk. Therefore, the
continuity of relevant studies comparing the same version of the task in different
cultures is important.</p><p>Finally, it has been verified that there might be many variables involved in a
decisional process, as measured by the IGT. Additionally, consensus is lacking among
researchers on how much each variable is essential for the learning developed in the
task.More studies are necessary controlling the different variables involved in the
performance of individuals on the IGT, in order to better understand the process,
thereby improving its specificity as a neuropsychological measure of DM.Moreover,
further studies must be conducted, focusing on the validation process of the
different versions, especially the version with non-computerized reinforcement.
Given the demographic differences observed in the Brazilian population, the
investigation of such effects on individuals&#x02019; performance on the IGT may be an
important direction for the continuity of this research.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bechara</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Damasio</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Damasio</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human
