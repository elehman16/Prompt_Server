Very few literature are available analyzing the quality of epidural labor analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aim:</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 0.1% levobupivacaine and 0.1% ropivacaine with fentanyl as an adjuvant for epidural labor analgesia in terms of onset, duration, quality of analgesia, and degree of motor blockade.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Methodology:</title><p>Sixty nulliparous parturients, with singleton uncomplicated pregnancy, were recruited by continuous sampling. Parturients were randomized to receive either levobupivacaine 0.1% or ropivacaine 0.1% with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml fentanyl as an intermittent epidural bolus. The epidural analgesia was initiated with 12 ml of study drug solution in the active stage of labor (cervix 3 cm dilated). Demand bolus was given whenever the visual analog scale (VAS) score &#x0003e;3. Onset, duration, and quality of analgesia and degree of motor blockade were analyzed. Maternal outcome was evaluated in terms of mode of delivery, duration of labor, and assisted vaginal delivery.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Statistical Analysis:</title><p>All the data were recorded in Microsoft Office Excel. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM SPSS, USA) software with Regression Modules installed. Descriptive analyses were reported as mean and standard deviation of continuous variables.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean onset of analgesia was shorter in ropivacaine (21.43 &#x000b1; 2 min) than in levobupivacaine group (23.57 &#x000b1; 1.71 min) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000).

Levobupivacaine produced a better quality of analgesia in terms of not perceiving pain and uterine contraction during labor analgesia but was associated with 37% incidence of instrumental delivery.

We hypothesize that intermittent bolus administration of levobupivacaine provides better analgesia than ropivacaine without affecting the maternal and fetal outcomes. Hence, we compared the effectiveness of 0.1% levobupivacaine and 0.1% ropivacaine with fentanyl as an adjuvant during epidural labor analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ethodology</sc></title><p>Following approval from the Hospital Ethical Committee, this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted in our institute on all pregnant women requesting labor analgesia from December 2013 to May 2014. All parturients were educated on methodology and advantages of epidural labor analgesia. Sixty primigravidae of age between 18 and 32 years with a singleton pregnancy were enrolled in our study by continuous sampling. Parturients with high-risk complicated pregnancy, cephalo pelvic disproportion (CPD), fetal anomaly, and any contraindication for neuraxial block were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all the parturients [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-28-g001"/></fig><p>During the early stage of labor, parturient was shifted to the operating room, and epidural catheter was secured at L2&#x02013;L3 space. Three milliliters of 1.5% lignocaine with 15 &#x000b5;g adrenaline was given as a test dose. Parturients were shifted to the labor ward after ruling out intravascular and intrathecal catheter placement. Parturients were randomly divided into two groups of thirty each, Group L and Group R by sealed envelope technique. The study solution was prepared aseptically by an anesthetist who was not directly involved in this study. Parturients in Group L received 12 ml of 0.1% levobupivacaine (Abbott Laboratories, Elverum, Norway) with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml fentanyl and Group R received 12 ml of 0.1% ropivacaine (Astra Zeneca, Zug, Switzerland) with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml fentanyl as an adjuvant. When the parturient had progressed to the active stage of labor (cervical dilatation &#x0003e;3 cm), the epidural analgesia was initiated after assessing the baseline pain score by VAS of 10 cm line from 0 to 10.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The primary outcome measures were onset, duration, and quality of analgesia and degree of motor blockade. The secondary outcome measures were maternal outcome in terms of mode of delivery, percentage of instrumental delivery, maternal satisfaction score, and neonatal outcome (Apgar score at 1 and 5 min).</p><p>The time of the initial dose was kept as time zero and assessments were scheduled accordingly. The adequacy of analgesia was assessed at 5 min interval. The onset of analgesia is defined as the time from the first dose to the time of achieving VAS &#x0003c;3. If analgesia was inadequate in 30 min, an additional 12 ml of the same drug solution was repeated, and VAS score was assessed at every 5-min interval. The parturient was excluded from the study if analgesia was still inadequate.</p><p>Quality of analgesia and extent of motor blockade were assessed 15 min after achieving adequate analgesia (VAS &#x0003c;3). Quality of analgesia was assessed by the verbal scoring system (score 0 - no pain and no awareness of uterine contractions, score 1 - aware of contractions but not painful, score 2 - aware of pressure but tolerable discomfort, score 3 - distressing pain or pressure).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The presence of any motor blockade was assessed using a modified Bromage score (score 0 - no weakness able to rise straight leg against resistance; score 1 - not able to straight leg raise; score 2 - unable to flex knee able to flex ankle; score 3 - unable to move lower limb).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] All parturients with motor blockade score 0 were given a supervised trial walk to assess their ability to ambulate. The parturients were encouraged to ambulate for about 5 min at every 10-min interval. Augmentation of labor was done by either oxytocin infusion or artificial rupture of membranes as decided by obstetrician. Whenever parturient complains pain (VAS &#x0003e;3), epidural top-up was given with the 12 ml of the same study drug solution. During the second stage of labor, top-up with 12 ml of same drug solution was given in sitting posture. Heart rate, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate were monitored at 10-min interval throughout the study.</p><p>Side effects such as pruritus and nausea if reported were treated accordingly. Hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure of &#x0003c;90 mmHg) was treated with a bolus of 6 mg intravenous mephentermine. Bradycardia (defined as heart rate &#x0003c;60 bpm) was treated with a bolus dose of 0.6 mg intravenous atropine sulfate. The study was terminated after baby delivery or when parturient required cesarean section.</p><p>Anesthesia for cesarean section was achieved by epidural injection with 12&#x02013;15 ml of 2% lignocaine with adrenaline. Neonatal outcome was assessed with Apgar score at 1 and 5 min. Maternal satisfaction was graded as 3 - excellent pain relief, 2 - good pain relief, 1 - fair pain relief, and 0 - poor pain relief, and it was obtained during the 2<sup>nd</sup> postnatal day when the parturients were comfortable.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>From the previous study by Gautier <italic>et al</italic>., the mean onset time for ropivacaine was 14 min with standard deviation (SD) of 6 min.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On hypothesizing that levobupivacaine has better potency than ropivacaine to find the difference of 4 min mean onset time with a power of 0.8 (&#x003b1; =0.05), the sample size required was 29 in each group.

Hence, we preferred to provide analgesia by intermittent bolus technique.</p><p>In our study, the onset of analgesia was delayed in both levobupivacaine (23.57 &#x000b1; 1.71 min) and (21.43 &#x000b1; 2 min) ropivacaine groups when compared to studies by Gautier <italic>et al</italic>., Purdie and McGrady, and Sah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This could be attributed to the lower concentration of local anesthetics (0.1%) and fentanyl (24 &#x000b5;g) used in our study. On comparing between these two drugs, the mean onset time of analgesia was higher for levobupivacaine than ropivacaine which we contribute to the pharmacokinetic property of ropivacaine which is less fat-soluble than levobupivacaine.</p><p>The mean duration of analgesia was 68 &#x000b1; 11 min and 60 &#x000b1; 14 min with levobupivacaine and ropivacaine, respectively, in our study.

In our study, both groups had no lower limb motor blockade. However, the incidence of operative vaginal delivery was high in levobupivacaine group due to laxity in pelvic floor muscle producing a delay in the internal rotation of the fetal head. In addition, the greater sensory deafferentation of the pelvis produced by levobupivacaine blunted Ferguson's reflex, decreasing oxytocin secretions, causing ineffective uterine contractions, bringing down the urge to bear down in the second stage of labor.</p><p>Maximum Apgar score at 1 min and 5 min was 8 and 9, respectively. The good fetal outcome can be attributed to hemodynamic stability due to the usage of low local anesthetic concentration.
