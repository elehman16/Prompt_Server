The pathways affected by tofacitinib and the effects on gene expression in situ are unknown. Therefore, tofacitinib effects on synovial pathobiology were investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised, double-blind, phase II serial synovial biopsy study (A3921073; NCT00976599) in patients with RA with an inadequate methotrexate response. Patients on background methotrexate received tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily or placebo for 28&#x02005;days. Synovial biopsies were performed on Days -7 and 28 and analysed by immunoassay or quantitative PCR. Clinical response was determined by disease activity score and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response on Day 28 in A3921073, and at Month 3 in a long-term extension study (A3921024; NCT00413699).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Tofacitinib exposure led to EULAR moderate to good responses (11/14 patients), while placebo was ineffective (1/14 patients) on Day 28. Tofacitinib treatment significantly reduced synovial mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-3 (p&#x0003c;0.05) and chemokines CCL2, CXCL10 and CXCL13 (p&#x0003c;0.05). No overall changes were observed in synovial inflammation score or the presence of T cells, B cells or macrophages. Changes in synovial phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 strongly correlated with 4-month clinical responses (p&#x0003c;0.002). Tofacitinib significantly decreased plasma CXCL10 (p&#x0003c;0.005) at Day 28 compared with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Tofacitinib reduces metalloproteinase and interferon-regulated gene expression in rheumatoid synovium, and clinical improvement correlates with reductions in STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. JAK1-mediated interferon and interleukin-6 signalling likely play a key role in the synovial response.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT00976599.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokines play a critical role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> Targeted biologics that block individual cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL)-6, have demonstrated clinical efficacy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Targeting intracellular pathways represents a novel approach of inhibiting the effects of multiple cytokines.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

Therefore, a double-blind, placebo-controlled serial synovial biopsy study was performed in patients with RA with an inadequate response to methotrexate. Treatment with tofacitinib reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IFN-regulated genes in rheumatoid synovium. Reduction of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 measured in synovial biopsies at Month 1 was highly correlated with clinical improvement at Month 4. These data are consistent with tofacitinib acting on synovial JAK/STAT targets and suggest that JAK1-mediated signalling of IFNs and IL-6 plays a role in the synovial response to JAK blockade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II, 28-day clinical study was performed across six centres in the USA (A3921073; NCT00976599).

Tofacitinib reduced the synovial expression of MMPs and IFN-regulated genes in rheumatoid synovium. Analyses of the open-label LTE study 3-month efficacy data demonstrated a clear correlation between inhibition of synovial STAT1 and STAT3 activation after 1&#x02005;month of therapy during the synovial biopsy portion of the study and the magnitude of clinical improvement assessed in the LTE (total 4&#x02005;months of treatment with tofacitinib). These data suggest that JAK1-mediated signalling of IFNs and IL-6 plays a key role in the synovial response to JAK blockade.</p><p>Since cytokine inhibitors decrease disease activity in RA, blocking kinases in the signal transduction cascade could potentially have the same benefit. Targeting JAK proteins has met with success in clinical trials, and several JAK inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in RA, similar to biological agents, in particular, tofacitinib.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In addition to tofacitinib, these include several other JAK inhibitors with varying specificities for JAK isoforms, including baricitinib, VX509 and GLPG0634.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The four JAK proteins (JAK1, 2, 3 and Tyk2) form a family of signalling molecules that associate with cytokine receptors.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Combinations of JAK1 and/or JAK2 can transduce signals when members of the IL-6 family ligate their receptors, thereby activating their downstream targets, for example, STAT1 and STAT3.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although the TNF receptor does not directly signal through JAKs, synoviocyte activation by TNF stimulation can be affected by JAK-dependent pathways.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The relative contribution of specific JAK isoforms remains uncertain. In the present study, synovial biopsies were performed pretreatment and after 4&#x02005;weeks of study treatment and correlated with clinical outcome. The selection of week 4 for the second biopsy and 4&#x02005;months total exposure for clinical evaluation was based on our goal of identifying leading synovial biomarkers of clinical response rather than concomitant response. The 4-month time point allows comparison with the full clinical response.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Unexpected issues in the current study were differences in disease duration and baseline severity between the two treatment groups, which were due to chance. The imbalance highlights the relatively small size of the study and the resulting limitations in statistical power which restricts the ability to perform stratification of subjects based on synovial architecture or clinical characteristics at baseline. This imbalance could contribute to differences when comparing synovial analytes in the placebo group with the tofacitinib group. Thus, relative changes of biomarkers within the groups were considered especially important.</p><p>Some therapeutic agents, such as TNF inhibitors and intra-articular steroids, cause a rapid and dramatic decrease in synovial inflammation;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> others show modest effects (methotrexate). Abatacept and rituximab cause minimal or no effect on the total cellular inflammation score at early time points.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This is also the case with tofacitinib because cell infiltration is not significantly changed after 4&#x02005;weeks of therapy. Individual cell lineages can be depleted with other agents, most notably B cells with rituximab; no significant effects of JAK inhibition on macrophage, B cell or T cell infiltration were observed at month 1.</p><p>The synovial biomarker study was notable for tofacitinib-induced decreases in expression of genes implicated in RA, including MMPs and chemokines. No significant effects were observed for any biomarker in the placebo group. Pretreatment levels of synovial biomarkers did not predict which patients would respond to tofacitinib and response was not associated with high or low relative synovial STAT phosphorylation at baseline.</p><p>Blood biomarkers were also assessed. A rapid and sustained decrease in CXCL10, which was also decreased in synovial tissue, was observed. Although CXCL10 serum protein and synovial mRNA levels were reduced by tofacitinib, changes in expression did not correlate to each other. CXCL10 is especially interesting because an anti-CXCL10 antibody has demonstrated some clinical benefit in RA.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Therefore, the effect on this particular chemokine could be useful as a pharmacodynamic marker of tofacitinib activity. The role of CXCL10 as a type I IFN-induced and STAT-regulated chemokine suggests a role for IFN-mediated mechanisms. The ultimate utility of serum CXCL10 measurements could best be resolved in larger clinical studies.</p><p>Perhaps the most important finding of our study was the correlation between suppression of STAT activation, evidenced by STAT phosphorylation, and later clinical improvement. The pretreatment levels of pSTAT did not predict response to therapy possibly because the tofacitinib-treated group had greater disease severity. However, the declines in synovial pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 after 1&#x02005;month were highly correlated with the degree of clinical response, as determined by change in DAS28. The correlation of change in pSTAT with clinical response, taken with the lack of change in synovial cellularity, suggests that the effect is transcription dependent. Further evaluations of tofacitinib inadequate responders, particularly those with high pSTATs at baseline, could provide insights into other roles of JAK-STAT signalling in RA.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The biomarker data provide some clues to the mechanism of action of tofacitinib. Interfering with the JAK1-STAT3 pathway suggests that blocking IL-6 signalling contributes to the mechanism of action. However, the effects on pSTAT1 and IFN-regulated genes, such as CXCL10 production, suggest that the mechanism also involves blockade of IFN signal transduction. The potential importance of IFN blockade in clinical efficacy is supported by our recent observation that TNF-mediated synoviocyte activation is mediated by IFN production and JAK/STAT-induced expression of chemokines such as CXCL10.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, tofacitinib can block IL-6 signalling directly and TNF function through an indirect mechanism. The contribution of individual synovial cell types to tofacitinib therapeutic sensitivity is still unknown and requires a larger study to evaluate the individual roles of B cells, T cells, macrophages and synoviocytes.</p><p>In conclusion, the data suggest that tofacitinib regulates JAK-mediated events in the rheumatoid synovium. Rather than blocking a single cytokine, tofacitinib modulates IL-6 and IFN signalling. JAK1 inhibition, with early suppression of STAT1 and STAT3, correlates well with longer-term clinical benefit. Finally, the effects of tofacitinib on blood chemokines such as CXCL10 suggest that biomarkers might be used to either predict or evaluate therapeutic response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2014-206028-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e879" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients who were involved in this study.
