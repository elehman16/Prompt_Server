REA is a brief (an average of 6&#x000a0;weeks long) qualitative intervention designed to map the ethical terrain of the research setting prior to a research team starts recruiting participants with the purpose of connecting ethical principles to contexts and realities on the ground. REA attempts to discover, describe and respond to the ethical issues specific to a particular research setting, and help researchers to address the issues that genuinely matter to proposed study participants and their community. REA methodology involves interviews, focused discussion and observation conducted among key stakeholders to inform the design of the particular research project. Its findings are utilised to inform and guide the research consent process; ranging from the conception and development of the consent form, to the way consent is obtained. It has been documented that REA is considered relevant and of utmost use for researchers in low income settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the effects of REA on study participants&#x02019; level of comprehension, recruitment and retention and quality of informed consent have not been documented.</p><p>The current study investigated effects of REA on informed consent comprehension, study compliance and quality of informed consent in a low-income setting.

Accordingly the IRB-approved consent form (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) was revised for the intervention group (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The revisions made were: use of additional local terminologies, concrete explanations of study information with examples, and contextual clues based on the REA findings. Consent information was provided by reading the information sheet to participants in both groups. In the intervention group, this was accompanied by additional narratives which were attached to the consent document based on the issues identified by REA. Accordingly participants were asked whether they had any questions after reading each section of the form, and once more after the end of the entire reading. Consent in the control group, was obtained by signing on the consent form, but verbally in the intervention group with data collectors signing as witnesses. Sentences and paragraphs in the revised version of informed consent form were relatively short, and the words chosen were more familiar and local.

We used Modular Informed Consent Comprehension Assessment (MICCA) and Brief Investigator Questionnaire (BIQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to measure informed consent comprehension of participants; and Quality of Informed Consent (QuIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to assess quality of the informed consent process. The MICCA and BIQ instruments for our assessment were developed by adopting the existing generic tools (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Both tools have the flexibility to test comprehension specific to a particular trial, yet can be utilized across a variety of trials. MICCA measures comprehension by incorporating both generic and trial-specified approaches. Psychometric evidence suggests that MICCA can be utilized in various trial settings and can produce reliable and valid scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Comprehension was assessed as a function of understanding and recall. Understanding refers to the concepts explained in the consent process such as purpose, benefits and risk. Recall refers to issues that needed to be memorized such as date of appointment, and specific procedures such as signature, copy of consent given or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A total of 25 questions were used to assess informed consent comprehension of participants; 13 questions were used to assess levels of understanding and 12 questions to asses levels of recall. Test items consisted of both generic and trial specific questions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Of the 25 test items, 14 were generic test items that appeared on each version of MICCA, 6 were trial-specific test items which were generated based on responses to BIQ and the remaining 5 were trial-specific test items in which the response options for each of the test items are generated based on response to BIQ. QuIC consisted of 13 subjective questions on the perceived quality of the informed consent process (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Each correct response was scored as 1, while each incorrect response was scored 0. For multiple choices with more than one correct response a score value of 1 was given for each possible answer.

REA conducted prior to recruitment of participants revealed a number of relevant and context-specific ethical issues concerning the HPV study and its targeted study population. These findings helped in adapting the study information sheet, consent form and consent procedures to the local culture and educational level of the population. The HPV study was selected for the REA intervention due to expressed interest from the investigators and expressed concerns in relation to the sensitivity of the issues as the study deals with cancer of the reproductive organ and sexually transmitted infection. Such parameters which suggested that REA will be relevant as the study was expected to generate ethical issues related to the sensitivity of the subject, ambiguity of terms, and decision-making dynamics of the community. The study was conducted in a well-defined population group with relative homogeneity in language, ethno-cultural and geographic parameters. The two study sites (intervention and control) were similar to each other on major societal parameters. They were geographically adjacent to each other and belonged to the same ethno-cultural cosmos including the health system. The socio-demographic characteristics of study participants in both locations revealed overall similarity except few irregularities. We employed MICCA and BIQ for measuring comprehension and QuIC for assessing quality of informed consent. The tools were able to capture both standard informed consent items as well as study-specific test items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Certain allowable practical adjustments were done on the tools and some of the components, otherwise both tools have been validated for use by researchers in different settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Recruitment rate and the recruitment index are considered important parameters in monitoring the quality of research implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this study higher rates of both recruitment and retention were documented for the intervention group. While we documented strong statistical association between study retention rate and use of REA-based revision on informed consent process, no statistically significant difference was documented between the recruitment rates of the two groups. Previous studies have tried to identify potential contributors to recruitment rates of study participant such as 'opt-out' approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], early consideration of participants' perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], addressing ethical issues such as the therapeutic misconception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and establishing trust between researchers and potential participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The recruitment rate, however, may have been affected by other factors beyond the consent information as the complexities of the challenges of recruitment are also determined by the complexities of the respective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and decisions being made prior to recruitment based on information circulating in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Recruitment rate has been documented as an important determinant of subsequent retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Other factors affecting retention include mental state of the person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], availability of tracking and follow-up mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], availability of mechanisms addressing community and context-specific issues and needs in special communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However every study has its own peculiar features and it may be difficult to generalise these factors. The registered improvement in the study retention rate in our study may have resulted from improved understanding of the consent information.</p><p>The current study documented significant differences in the comprehension levels (understanding and recall) between the intervention and control groups. REA-based adjustments to the content and delivery of consent information in the intervention group were linked to the improved levels of understanding and recall in the intervention group. These findings concur with studies which have reported improved consent information comprehension with appropriate interventions such as provision of more explanation and socio-culturally tailored approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Provision of tailored terminologies and additional narrative explanations on the pre-identified ethical issues and allowing more time for discussion and questions from the participants in the intervention group might have been potential determinants. There was no significant difference in comprehension levels related to disease information between the intervention and control group. The reasons for non-significance could be the sensitivity and novelty of the issues of cervical cancer in the area.</p><p>In the study there was a significant difference in the overall levels of perceived quality of the consent process in the intervention compared to the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in all but three of the components of quality assessment; whether consent form was read and explained carefully; whether consent from was important source of information; and whether consent form was important for consent decision. Possible reasons for the improved perception of the quality of the consent process in this study include the improvements made in the consent information and the revised consent procedures both of which were geared to the needs and concerns of the potential participants, based on the REA. There are several possible reasons for lack of statistically significant improvements in three areas. Regarding readability, the participants in the intervention groups mainly had the form read to them rather than reading it themselves. Another reason is that all three measures already scored highly in the control group with little room for improvements. Though not significant, there were improvements observed in the three categories and if a larger sample had been used this might have been significant. Quality of informed consent depends on factors such as type of consent information provided, amount of information, adequacy of comprehension, and the voluntariness of decision making by the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the clinical set up, participant-related factors such as age, IQ, level of cognitive function and external locus of control were associated with poor quality and information recall. Written information provided immediately before admission was associated with better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Various researchers have utilized different interventions to improve the consent process and understanding, such as use of local narratives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], extended one-to-one discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], enhanced consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], a revised consent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and a booklet of participants&#x02019; rights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Cultural and linguistic modifications to the informed consent process were considered to significantly enhance understanding by study participant in low income settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. On the other hand it has been shown that lexicosyntactic readability improvement of the consent form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], multimedia enhanced consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and use of a concise version of the consent form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] do not have effects on comprehension. There are still ongoing evidence-based debates as to which interventions are effective in enhancing comprehension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The intervention in this study involved improvements changes in the consent procedures based on REA findings.</p><p>One of the ethical dilemmas faced by the researchers while revising the consent form is what level of change on an IRB-approved form would be appropriate and allowable once in the field, and what principles should govern this. According to existing guidelines, any amendments of an approved research project require further IRB approval before implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The only exceptions to this are if the changes are immediately and urgently required for the safety of the subjects. In this case, the IRB must be informed immediately after establishing the need for the changes -in most cases within five business days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The other possible exception to this rule is if the study is a determined to be non-research by the IRB and does not need further IRB follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We made revisions to the consent form in the field on the following basis; a) that the revision added to the approved consent and did not reduce any major component (the consent form content and structure approved by IRB were maintained with improvements); b) that the comprehension assessment project and the possibility of revising the consent form were already approved by IRB; c) that the changes were important for the welfare of the subjects in the study. Since getting approval from IRB for the modification might take time, some provision for making appropriate adjustment without tampering with the basic components of consent may be necessary in future.</p><p>The Ottawa Statement provides a framework for addressing ethical issues around cluster randomised trials. According to the statement on the Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomized Trials, "When participants&#x02019; informed consent is required, but recruitment of participants is not possible before randomization of clusters, researchers must seek participants&#x02019; consent for trial enrollment as soon as possible after cluster randomization&#x02014;that is, as soon as the potential participant has been identified, but before the participant has undergone any study interventions or data collection procedures" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In the current study consent was obtained soon after recruitment in to the planned study without further additional approval of the REA based revisions on the originally approved consent form, based on the premises presented above.</p><p>The study has some potential limitations. Efforts were made to ensure the uniformity of the intervention and control sites, however there may have been undocumented differences in the settings which may have confounded the study outcomes. Both levels of comprehension and quality of the informed consent process are based on participant perceptions using questionnaire based interviews which were not accompanied by independent observation methods. This might reduce the objectivity and validity of the responses. Reasons for loss to follow-up of those who did not attend were not documented, and neither did we document the basic socio-demographic characteristics of non-attendees. The sample size determination was done based on assumptions from other countries as there was no local estimate available. In addition we assumed a 10&#x000a0;% non-response rate while the non-response rate for the study was about 15&#x000a0;%. The single cluster intervention also might have reduced the study power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on our findings, REA is associated with improved understanding of study concepts, purposes and procedures and participants&#x02019; perceptions of the informed consent process. Investing in an intervention which enhances researchers' understanding of the local context and tailoring the consent information and process is associated with improvement s in overall consent comprehension, study recruitment rates and retention rates in low-income settings. REA is also an appropriate intervention for further use in similar settings and situations.</p><p>We would like to encourage researchers and research ethics committees and policy makers to employ REA to improve research consent comprehension, recruitment and retention levels in certain low income settings. As this is the first study exploring the effects of REA on comprehension, additional studies in other settings with more objective methods of measurement would provide greater insight into the overall effects of REA on comprehension of consent. Such studies might even expand into consent processes for medical interventions. Ethicists and research policy makers are encouraged to explore the consequences of utilizing REA in the light of IRB requirements and operating procedures. In future studies, if REA is planned, it should be included in the research proposal, so it and any subsequent consent form modification are approved by the IRB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANC, Ante natal care; BIQ, Brief investigator questionnaire; HPV, Human papilloma virus; IRB, Institutional review board; MICCA, Modular informed consent comprehension assessment; QuIC, Quality of informed consent; REA, Rapid ethical assessment; SPSS, Statistical package for social sciences</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12910_2016_127_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Standard information sheet and Consent form for &#x0201c;HPV-Subtype Prevalence Study&#x0201d;.
