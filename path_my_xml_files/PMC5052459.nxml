Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus <italic>vs</italic> other limb <italic>vs</italic> axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no <italic>vs</italic> yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, doxorubicin 37&#x000b7;5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1 and 2 (on weeks 1 and 6) followed 3 weeks later by high-dose methotrexate 12 g/m<sup>2</sup> over 4 h. The MAPIE regimen consisted of MAP as a base regimen, with the addition of high-dose ifosfamide (14 g/m<sup>2</sup>) at 2&#x000b7;8 g/m<sup>2</sup> per day with equidose mesna uroprotection, followed by etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day over 1 h on days 1&#x02013;5. The primary outcome measure was event-free survival measured in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT00134030" id="interrefs20">NCT00134030</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62&#x000b7;1 months (IQR 46&#x000b7;6&#x02013;76&#x000b7;6); 62&#x000b7;3 months (IQR 46&#x000b7;9&#x02013;77&#x000b7;1) for the MAP group and 61&#x000b7;1 months (IQR 46&#x000b7;5&#x02013;75&#x000b7;3) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group <italic>vs</italic> 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group <italic>vs</italic> 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0&#x000b7;98 [95% CI 0&#x000b7;78&#x02013;1&#x000b7;23]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0&#x000b7;0003). The most common grade 3&#x02013;4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP <italic>vs</italic> 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP <italic>vs</italic> 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP <italic>vs</italic> 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group <italic>vs</italic> 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin).

We did this trial to assess whether the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to standard postoperative MAP would improve event-free survival in patients whose primary tumour showed a poor response to preoperative MAP.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>Osteosarcoma is a rare disease but is the most common bone tumour in children and adolescents and is associated with high mortality. Treatment for osteosarcoma involves multimodality therapy with chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and further chemotherapy. Before the EURAMOS-1 trial started, there has never been a study randomising patients with osteosarcoma following surgery to add chemotherapy to the preoperative backbone, and a formal literature review was not possible. Through collaborations and PubMed searches, we were aware of the relevant publications in osteosarcoma which were about importance of histological response and use of Ifosfamide in treating patients with a poor histological response. Histological response, as assessed by examination of the surgical specimen, is one of the strongest predictors of longer-term outcome for patients with osteosarcoma. Patients who have a poor response to chemotherapy (&#x02265;10% viable tumour) have a substantially worse survival than those with a good response (&#x0003c;10% viable tumour) with 5-year overall survival of around 45&#x02013;55% and 75&#x02013;80%, respectively. Several studies suggested that altering postoperative therapy might improve the outcome for patients with a poor histological response. Only one of the studies reporting improved outcome for patients with a poor response was randomised. However, the randomised study question was a comparison of upfront three-drug therapy versus three-drug therapy plus ifosfamide. The postoperative treatment for patients with a poor response was non-randomised and altered to include ifosfamide. Therefore, no previous study has assessed in a randomised comparison whether adding an ifosfamide containing combination to standard treatment improves the outcome for patients identified as having a poor histological response.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>Randomisation of patients with a poor response in EURAMOS-1 trial represents a large, international comparison, with patients registered at the start of treatment and randomly assigned after surgery. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy was with methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MAP), with half of the patients also assigned to receive ifosfamide and etoposide. Our findings do not support the intensification of postoperative chemotherapy by adding ifosfamide and etoposide for patients with a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Only a few randomised trials exist of this rare disease. The results of this randomised controlled trial will change clinical practice and help inform physicians' decisions when managing patients with osteosarcoma whose tumours show a poor histological response. Research is needed to improve outcomes for all patients with osteosarcoma and future trials need access to newer or targeted drugs, driven by improved understanding in the biology of the disease.</p></boxed-text></p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>EURAMOS-1 was an open-label, international, randomised, phase 3, controlled trial. The structure and design of this trial have been previously published.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> After a diagnostic biopsy, patients with newly diagnosed osteosarcoma could be registered to this trial. Patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. The main eligibility criteria for registration included having high-grade localised or metastatic extremity or axial osteosarcoma deemed resectable by the treating team, age 40 years or younger at diagnostic biopsy; Karnofsky or Lansky status of at least 60, normal cardiac function (shortening fraction &#x0003e;28%), normal hearing, normal bone marrow as shown by an absolute neutrophil count of at least 1&#x000b7;5&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L (or a white blood cell count of at least 3&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L if neutrophil count is not available), and a platelet count of at least 100&#x02008;000 platelets per &#x003bc;L. Patients were also required to have a serum bilirubin concentration of at most less than 1&#x000b7;5 times the upper limit of normal and a normal creatinine concentration for their age as per protocol. Enrolment criteria also included no previous treatment for osteosarcoma, and if the osteosarcoma was a second malignancy, patients could not have received previous chemotherapy. Patients' life expectancy was at least 3 months.</p><p>The main eligibility criteria for randomisation were registeration before definitive surgery to take part in EURAMOS-1; assessment of histological response in the primary tumour and randomisation within 35 days of definitive surgery (assessment by reference pathologist where possible); age 5 years or younger at biopsy for patients with good response; provision of all essential data (entry form, preoperative chemotherapy forms, surgery, and pathology report); receiving exactly two courses of cisplatin and doxorubicin, at least two courses, and no more than six courses of methotrexate; macroscopically complete surgical resection of the primary tumour; no evidence of local disease progression; recovery from previous therapy allowing administration of postoperative chemotherapy as planned; no progression of metastatic disease or new metastases and removal of metastases (in patients with metastatic disease at registration) done or deemed feasible (to be done after primary surgery); macroscopically complete surgical resection of the primary tumor; and written consent to participate in the study.

Metastases were defined as at least three lesions bigger than 5 mm or a single lesion bigger than 1 cm. Patients with lung lesions not meeting these criteria were classified as having possible metastases. Patients were randomised centrally through Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit (COSS, EOI, SSG) and COG. The randomisation lists were prepared by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit for COSS, EOI, and SSG and by COG for COG sites. Each treating institution was responsible for enrolling their patients into the trial, and patients were assigned to interventions using the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit randomisation system (for COSS, EOI, and SSG sites) and the COG randomisation system (for COG sites). Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Baseline assessment required a complete blood count, complete set of chemistry test data (including liver and kidney function), a baseline echocardiogram and hearing test, imaging with an MRI of the primary site, and a chest CT scan and a bone scan (a PET scan could be used instead). All patients received preoperative therapy with MAP<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>) for 10 weeks consisting of cisplatin 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (4 h infusion of 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day for 2 days in COG sites; continuous 72 h intravenous infusion in other sites) and doxorubicin 37&#x000b7;5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1 and 2 (on weeks 1 and 6). This was followed by high-dose methotrexate 12 g/m<sup>2</sup> over 4 h (maximum dose 20 g at COG institutions) with hyper-hydration, alkalinisation, and standard leucovorin rescue at a dose of 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> starting 24&#x02013;48 h from methotrexate infusion and continuing until methotrexate concentration was less than 0&#x000b7;1 &#x003bc;M (weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Leucovorin rescue was adjusted with the dosing nomogram according to the methotrexate concentration. Patients were assessed with complete blood counts twice a week and with chemical tests (including liver and kidney function tests) before every cycle of chemotherapy. To begin myelosuppressive cycles, patients needed an absolute neutrophil count of at least 750 cells per &#x003bc;L and a platelet count of at least 75&#x02008;000 platelets per &#x003bc;L. Criteria for administering high-dose methotrexate were different and included an absolute neutrophil count of at least 250 cells per &#x003bc;L and a platelet count of at least 50&#x02008;000 platelets per &#x003bc;L.</p><p>Patients were restaged at 10 weeks preoperatively (with the same imaging studies done at diagnosis) and investigator-assessed response was reported according to Response to Treatment In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, version 1. Those patients identified at their local institution to have no local or metastatic disease progression (defined as &#x0003e;20% increase in any primary tumour dimension associated with increased pain or inflammation) had primary tumour resection with centrally reviewed assessment of histological response.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Because all patients received the same preoperative therapy and treatment assignment was decided after pathology review, there was no masking. Eligibility for postoperative randomisation included macroscopic tumour resection, at least 10% morphologically viable tumour, no disease progression, no or resectable metastases, and ability to resume therapy within 35 days after surgery. We did not include central imaging review to confirm resectability of the disease or radiological response. We did not collect the percentage of viable tumour for each individual patient but rather whether they had at least 10% morphologically viable tumour.</p><p>Postoperative therapy is depicted in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 10)</xref>. Therapy consisted of MAP or MAPIE. Complete macroscopic resection of all disease for patients with initial metastases between weeks 11 and 20 was recommended. Imaging recommendations during treatment included a chest CT, a bone scan, and a plain radiograph of the primary tumour at 4-month intervals.</p><p>Cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate were administered at the same doses as given preoperatively. Ifosfamide (high dose 14 g/m<sup>2</sup>) at 2&#x000b7;8 g/m<sup>2</sup> per day with equidose mesna uroprotection was administered, followed by etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day over 1 h on days 1&#x02013;5 (three postoperative cycles). Two additional cycles of ifosfamide 3 g/m<sup>2</sup> per day with mesna uroprotection on days 1&#x02013;3 (9 g/m<sup>2</sup>) were given, with standard doxorubicin. Investigators were allowed to use supportive care with myeloid growth factor support according to local practice.</p><p>Patients treated with MAP received 29 weeks of treatment or four cycles of MAP and two cycles of methotrexate and doxorubicin (cisplatin was discontinued after a cumulative dose of 480 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The protocol provided recommendations for dose reductions on the basis of the toxicity (from the common toxicity criteria) and therapy delays.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measure was event-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation until first event (local recurrence, evidence of new or progressive metastatic disease, second malignancy, death, or a combination of those events) or censoring at last contact. Data were provided to the Medical Research Council by each group, but the outcome was not centrally reviewed. Secondary outcomes were overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause or last contact), short-term and long-term toxicity, and quality of life. Toxicity was measured by the treating institution and submitted to the Medical Research Council. Targeted toxicities included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fever without neutropenia, electrolyte abnormalities, cardiac dysfuction, renal dysfuction, and second malignancies. Serious adverse events were expedited (reported within 1 business day). Quality of life was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30; for patients at least 16 years of age) and the Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedsQL; for patients younger than 16 years of age). Questionaires were administered at baseline (before cycle 2), at week 20&#x02013;22 (on active treatment), 18 months after start of treatment, and 3 years after starting treatment. Quality of life results will be published separately.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>With international accrual, we sought to randomise 693 patients with poor response to preoperative MAP.

A preplanned subgroup analysis for patients with localised disease required 270 events to detect an 11% improvement, from 50% to 61% (HR 0&#x000b7;71) in 3-year event-free survival, and 5-year survival (two-sided significance level 5%, power 80%), assuming 85% of randomised patients would have localised disease (&#x02265;590 patients expected).</p><p>Primary and secondary outcomes were measured in the intention-to-treat population. Toxicity was assessed in the safety population which consisted of patients who started postoperative chemotherapy and who were assessed for toxicity. Statistical tests were done at a two-sided significance level of 0&#x000b7;05. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival functions, log-rank test for differences between survival curves and Cox models (adjusted for stratification factors) to estimate the treatment effect. Median follow-up was calculated with reverse censoring on death. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used in a prespecified analysis to compare the proportion of patients with grade 3 or worse toxicity between the treatment groups. Interim analyses were done at regular intervals and presented to the independent data monitoring committee. The Haybittle-Peto stopping rule was used, and the trial was planned to stop if the p value for the event-free survival analysis was less than 0&#x000b7;001. The interim analyses were designed to examine safety of the patients, and therefore the protocol prespecified that if at interim analysis, the lower bound of the 95% CI for the proportion of patients in each group who died because of toxicity exceeded 3%, the future of the trial would be discussed with the Trial Steering Committee.</p><p>The proportionality of hazards for the treatment effect over time was tested. In the presence of non-proportionality, the difference between the groups was estimated with restricted mean survival time (RMST)<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> after fitting a flexible parametric model. RMST for event-free survival measures a mean time-to-first event, when time of consideration was restricted to t* years after randomisation; here t* was 6 years. The consistency of treatment effect in patients with localised or metastatic disease was tested by fitting a flexible parametric model with interaction between allocated treatment and metastases.</p><p>The treatment effect was estimated separately in the prespecified localised disease subgroup, and in the following subgroups defined post hoc: sex, age, site of disease, location of cancer on bone, and baseline metastases (lung and non-lung). Local recurrence, new metastases, progression of existing metastases, death, or a combination of those events were considered a competing event for reporting second malignancy.

The dataset was frozen on Nov 19, 2014. 618 patients were randomly assigned from the poor responders group: 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>); this was lower than the anticipated target of 693. The main reasons for non-randomisation were no provision of consent (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>). Baseline characteristics at registration for the randomly assigned patients were similar between the groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Median follow-up for the entire trial population was 62&#x000b7;1 months (IQR 46&#x000b7;6&#x02013;76&#x000b7;6); 62&#x000b7;3 months (IQR 46&#x000b7;9&#x02013;77&#x000b7;1) for the MAP group and 61&#x000b7;1 months (IQR 46&#x000b7;5&#x02013;75&#x000b7;3) for the MAPIE group. For patients last reported alive and not lost to follow-up, 325 (87%) of 373 had follow-up within 14 months before the data freeze. 29 (9%) of 310 patients in MAP and 23 (7%) of 308 patients in MAPIE were permanently lost to follow-up more than 14 months before the data freeze.</p><p>307 event-free survival events were reported: 153 in the MAP group and 154 in the MAPIE group.

MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity (35 [12%] of patients in the MAP group <italic>vs</italic> 71 [24%] of 298 patients in the MAPIE group), mainly because of infections with absolute neutrophil count of less than 1&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> neutrophils per L, febrile neutropenia without documented infection, and hypophosphataemia (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one due to infection although they had a normal absolute neutrophil count (MAP group), and one due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (MAPIE group). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate. 19 patients discontinued because of drug-related toxicity; three in the MAP group and 16 in the MAPIE group. Dose was reduced or delayed according to criteria in the protocol for 176 (58%) of 301 patients in the MAP group and 184 (62%) of 298 patients in the MAPIE group.

There was no consistent pattern of reversibility for left ventricular systolic dysfunction or renal events, as some patients improved, whereas others did not, but the number of events was too small to analyse further.</p><p>13 second primary malignancies were reported (three in the MAP group <italic>vs</italic> ten in the MAPIE group; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 5, 6</xref>). Cause-specific HR estimate for MAPIE versus MAP was 3&#x000b7;24 (0&#x000b7;87&#x02013;12&#x000b7;06), p=0&#x000b7;079; subdistribution HR was 3&#x000b7;21 (0&#x000b7;87&#x02013;11&#x000b7;85), p=0&#x000b7;081; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>). Most of the second malignancies were myeloid (myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia): two of three in the MAP group and eight of ten in the MAPIE group, mostly recording cytogenetic abnormalities causally associated with administration of alkylating drugs (monosomy-7 or chromosome-5 abnormalities) or etoposide (11q23 abnormalities). One of three patients in the MAP group and two of ten patients in the MAPIE group had second solid tumours. A longer follow-up will allow for more precise estimates.</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>Standard treatment for high-grade osteosarcoma includes preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although previous uncontrolled studies<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> suggested that altering therapy on the basis of histological response improved outcome, this had not been tested in randomised controlled trials. EURAMOS-1 is, to the best of our knowledge, the first collaboration to assess in a randomised manner whether altering chemotherapy on the basis of histological response improves outcome for patients with osteosarcoma. Our results for patients with a poor histological response show that the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to standard postoperative therapy does not improve outcome and rather increases the incidence of toxic effects.</p><p>A previous randomised controlled trial<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> of around 240 patients assessed the addition of ifosfamide to standard MAP chemotherapy for patients with osteosarcoma. This trial included an upfront randomisation to MAP versus MAP plus ifosfamide, with postoperative ifosfamide given to those who had received it preoperatively or whose tumour showed a poor histological response to preoperative MAP (&#x0003c;90% necrosis). No significant difference in outcome was observed between the two groups and the timing of the addition of ifosfamide made no difference to outcome. On the basis of these data and our EURAMOS results, we recommend continuing with the same chemotherapy as used preoperatively for patients with a poor histological response to preoperative treatment.</p><p>Our results are also consistent with the results of a previous randomised controlled trial<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> by the COG, which COG assessed the role of ifosfamide and mifamurtide in patients with osteosarcoma. The study assessed whether the addition of ifosfamide or mifamurtide to the MAP regimen improved long-term outcomes; patients were treated preoperatively with either MAP or MAP plus ifosfamide, and subsequently postoperatively treated with or without mifamurtide. No difference in histological response was observed after the preoperative period, and no difference in event-free survival or overall survival was observed between the two chemotherapy groups. Our results are also consistent with the conclusion of a meta-analysis<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> where outcomes for osteosarcoma patients were improved with the use of at least three drugs, but no improvement was noted with the use of MAP plus ifosfamide versus MAP.</p><p>EURAMOS-1 was complicated by a lower than anticipated randomisation rate, probably related to the timing of the randomisation, close to the time of the intervention, after patients had been exposed to significant treatment-related toxicities. Non-randomisation was 42% in known poor responders and occurred in all four trial groups (COG, COSS, EOI, and SSG) ranging between 33% and 45%. Disease progression during preoperative treatment was reported in some patients, who were ineligible for randomisation. Four patients were considered ineligible at retrospective central pathology review. These patients were included because the treating clinician thought them eligible. This highlights the diagnostic difficulties facing physicians, pathologists, and patients.</p><p>As anticipated, a larger number of MAPIE-treated patients developed second malignancies than patients treated with MAP, although the difference was not statistically significant. Most of these second malignancies were myeloid in origin, which is not unexpected given the short follow-up and the natural history of therapy-related myeloid disorders.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The cytogenetic abnormalities in some of these leukaemias were consistent with exposure to alkylating drugs<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and etoposide.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Although second solid malignancies are more common after combined modality therapy, including irradiation,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> alkylating drugs also contribute to this risk. Therefore, continued follow-up is crucial to identify any second solid malignancies occurring as later events in this patient population. Overall survival will additionally be analysed with longer follow-up.</p><p>The number of events was lower than anticipated, as event-free survival results were based on 307 event-free survival events, rather than the planned 378; event rate was lower than predicted and our 3-year event-free survival estimate for MAP was 55% (95% CI 49&#x02013;60) rather than 45%. Follow-up visits started later in the MAPIE group because treatment was longer (40 weeks <italic>vs</italic> 29 weeks). Therefore early imaging assessments might not have been identically timed by group, resulting in the apparent early separation observed in the event-free survival curve in favour of the MAPIE group.</p><p>The timing of our intervention might have been too late because the first cycle of ifosfamide plus etoposide was administered at week 17 (5 weeks from resumption of postoperative therapy). Also, the overall intensity of therapy might have contributed to the inability of MAPIE-treated patients to receive all intended treatment. Ultimately, the best strategy for patients with a poor histological response might not be therapy intensification since this approach has been unsuccessful in childhood soft tissue sarcomas<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and in a previous study in osteosarcoma.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The use of functional imaging early during treatment might identify patients who will have a poor response and allow incorporation of alternative treatment strategies earlier. This technique has been assessed in patients with osteosarcoma<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and found to predict both histological response and outcome.</p><p>We included patients with both initially localised and initially metastatic disease in the same trial because it was not always possible to differentiate up-front between patients with localised disease and those with metastatic disease, and we have therefore also included patients with &#x0201c;possible&#x0201d; metastatic disease; other prognostic factors are the same in patients with both metastatic and localised disease. The inclusion of patients with initial metastases into the EURAMOS-1 trial was unique. The patients with localised disease needed to have no metastatic progression during preoperative therapy to be eligible for randomisation. Additionally, these patients had to undergo resection of all metastatic lesions during the postoperative period. The 3-year event-free survival for patients with metastases was 24% (13&#x02013;38) in the MAP group and 18% (6&#x02013;33) in the MAPIE group, and these results are similar to those of other published series.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The EURAMOS-1 trial included only 77 patients with metastases, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the outcome for these patients. Additionally, since the EURAMOS-1 patients with metastases needed to have resectable disease, the population included might not be entirely comparable to those included in the previous trials.</p><p>Our trial has several strengths, including being an international randomised controlled trial in a rare disease with widely applicable results. It also has several limitations including the lower-than-expected acceptance of randomisation and the lower-than-predicted observed event rate. The percentage of viable tumours<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> at the individual patient level was not collected in this study. This limits our ability to assess overall prognosis by percentage of viable tumour. Because the study question was whether altering therapy on the basis of histological response improved outcome, we do not think collection of those data is crucial to the study results overall. Another potential limitation is the fact that we did not include central imaging review. This could have resulted in local sites removing patients from the study for apparent local disease progression, which might actually have had represented only pseudoprogression. In addition, the inclusion of patients deemed to have resectable metastases without undergoing central review increases the possibility that those patients did not truly have resectable disease. The fact that a higher proportion of patients with metastatic disease were not randomised raises the possibility that some local institutions misjudged the ability to do a complete resection. The number of patients removed from protocol therapy because metastases were unresectable might be anticipated to be balanced between the treatment groups. Lastly, although we collected total dose received by each patient, we did not collect it in a way that allows us to present relative dose intensity received. This is a potential limitation especially because patients treated in the experimental group appeared to receive less of the intended therapy.</p><p>The addition of mifamurtide to the MAP chemotherapy regimen for patients with localised osteosarcoma resulted in improved overall survival.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The drug was approved for use in Europe on the basis of those results, but has not been approved for use in the USA. However, the results suggest that assessment of drugs such as mifamurtide that stimulate the immune system might improve outcome. We have subsequently reached an apparent plateau in outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> The development of strategies to better understand the biology of this tumour<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> might aid in the identification of drug targets. Collaboration with veterinary oncologists might speed up target identification in human beings as canine osteosarcoma is more common than human osteosarcoma.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Genome-wide analysis of osteosarcoma samples might also help identify important targetable genetic mutations.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> The identification of genetic alterations that could be used as therapeutic targets is an important step to develop better treatment approaches.</p><p>Overall, EURAMOS-1 showed that treatment with MAPIE resulted in similar event-free survival to MAP, results in increased toxicity, decrease in total received doses, and more second malignancies. Therefore, we argue strongly against adding ifosfamide and etoposide to the backbone of MAP therapy for patients whose tumour shows a poor response to preoperative treatment. Future strategies might seek to incorporate drugs with different mechanisms of action either alongside postoperative chemotherapy or earlier in the treatment pathway of appropriately identified patients. Such trials will require continued international collaboration by the EURAMOS group.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
