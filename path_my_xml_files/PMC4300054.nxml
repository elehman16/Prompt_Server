Approximately one in five young Canadians may experience a mental disorder requiring professional care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The majority onset prior to 25&#x000a0;years of age and often follow an extended pattern of remission and relapse over the life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite the great burden of disability they create [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the majority of youth needing care do not receive it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Unrecognized and/or untreated mental disorders can lead to a variety of negative outcomes including poor educational/vocational achievement, problematic interpersonal and family functioning, and reduced life expectancy due to associated medical conditions and suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interventions leading to early identification along with effective treatment increase the possibility of positive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Increasingly, policy makers, mental health professionals and educators are recognizing the important role that schools may play in addressing the mental health needs of young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For example, the Department for Education in the United Kingdom has recently released a seminal policy on this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Earlier, the U.S. Surgeon General&#x02019;s report has identified schools as important in early identification and treatment of mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates for mental health promotion/prevention in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. School-based mental health interventions are endorsed by Canadian mental health policy documents, such as the <italic>Evergreen Framework: a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Framework for Canada</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Ontario&#x02019;s Policy Framework for Child and Youth Mental Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], <italic>Nova Scotia&#x02019;s Kids and Learning First Plan</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and non-government organizations such as Children&#x02019;s Mental Health Ontario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Essential to enhancement of both individual and population health is the improvement of health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and this necessity has been endorsed by international health organizations such as the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and nationally by provinces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and federal organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] alike. Similarly, mental health literacy is an essential and foundational component for mental health promotion, prevention, early identification and intervention. Mental health literacy has been defined as &#x0201c;knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. More recently this definition has been enhanced to be: the capacity to understand how to enhance and maintain good mental health; understand mental disorders and their treatments; decrease stigma against those living with mental disorder; and enhance help-seeking efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This definition is consistent with global public health frameworks such as the Ottawa Charter of Health Promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and a comprehensive approach to addressing mental health as promoted by national [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and international [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] mental health frameworks.</p><p>Schools are an ideal venue in which to embed mental health literacy at both the individual and population levels because schools are where most young people can be reached and classroom-based educational activities are familiar to students and educators alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Embedding mental health literacy into existing school curriculum can potentially reach all students, normalizes mental health as part of everyday activities and engages teachers to become literate in youth mental health as part of their professional activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Current school-based mental health literacy programs have usually followed one of two directions: programs addressing specific conditions (e.g., depression, eating disorders, and schizophrenia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and programs for general understanding of mental health and mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A systematic review, conducted by Wei and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] identified 15 reviews that examined the outcomes of high school-based general mental health literacy programs. The majority of these were found to be associated with no or only minor gains in the students&#x02019; knowledge and/or attitudes towards mental disorders. This review revealed that only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] has reported on a mental health literacy intervention in Canadian high school students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>We examined the impact of a recently developed school-based mental health literacy resource, Mental Health &#x00026; High School Curriculum Guide (<italic>The Guide</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] on students&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes related to mental health. <italic>The Guide</italic> is a mental health literacy resource designed to inform junior high and high school curriculum. It was developed in collaboration between mental health experts, educators and the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA), a national mental health non-governmental organization. <italic>The Guide</italic> has been endorsed by the <italic>Canadian Association for School Health,</italic> is certified by <italic>Curriculum Services Canada</italic>, is embedded into the Provincial grade nine school curriculum in Nova Scotia, is currently being used in hundreds of additional schools across Canada and was extensively field-tested, in both English and French schools prior to its application in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p><italic>The Guide</italic> is a manualized mental health literacy resource consisting of six modules that are delivered in 10&#x02013;12 hours of class time through a mix of didactic instruction, group discussion, group activities, self-directed learning and video presentations. Modules cover topics including stigma and mental illness, understanding mental health and mental illness, information on specific mental illness, first voice experiences and impact of mental illnesses on individuals and families, help-seeking and the importance of positive mental health. <italic>The Guide</italic> also includes a teacher self-study module that provides teachers more in-depth understanding of the materials they teach. It can be obtained at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.teenmentalhealth.org/">www.teenmentalhealth.org</ext-link>. In usual application, teachers using <italic>The Guide</italic> in their classrooms undergo a single training day to familiarize themselves with the materials. The effect of this on teachers own mental health literacy has been examined and has shown significant and substantial positive impact on their knowledge and attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>This study extends evaluation of the use of the mental health literacy curriculum delivered by usual classroom teachers in usual school function. It examines the impact of <italic>The Guide</italic> on the mental health literacy of high school students. Specifically, we were interested in evaluating if students&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes related to mental health changed following participation in <italic>The Guide</italic> mental health literacy curriculum delivered by their usual classroom teachers, as part of their usual school curriculum in their usual classroom settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Between February and June 2012 <italic>The Guide</italic> was implemented as a regular component of Grade 9 health classes in high schools of the four school boards in the regions of Durham and Peterborough/Kawartha (i.e., Durham District School Board [DDSB], Durham Catholic District School Board [DCDSB], Kawartha Pine Ridge School Board [KPRSB], and Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board [PVNCCDSB]), in the province of Ontario, Canada. Durham region is an administrative area, just east of the largest city in Canada (Toronto). Its population is predominantly urban, of European ethnic origin with immigrants from the Caribbean and Asia accounting for most of the remainder. About 14% of its population is between the ages of 15 &#x02013; 24&#x000a0;years, over eighty percent of families are two parent families and the average household income is greater than the Ontario average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Schools were representative of the region.</p><p>For evaluation purposes, school personnel collected anonymous survey materials from students regarding knowledge and attitudes towards mental health before and after the delivery of <italic>The Guide</italic> (pre-test and post-test) as well as at 2-month follow-up.</p><p>A secondary analysis was conducted on this anonymous survey material originally gathered for program evaluation purposes. We examined available student surveys and compared responses gathered before the implementation of <italic>The Guide</italic> (pre-test), with those gathered immediately following the implementation of <italic>The Guide (</italic>post-test) and also with responses gathered at 2-month follow-up. Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board of OSCMHS, affiliated with the University of Toronto along with the research committees of each participating school board.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Measures</title><p>The knowledge and attitude survey is composed of two sections.

The second section uses eight items to examine attitudes related to mental disorders/illness. These items include statements about mental disorders and/or individuals with a mental illness and ask respondents to select their level of agreement using a seven point Likert scale (i.e., from &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;) (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the student survey). To ensure the anonymity of the survey, five linking questions were predesigned to match participants&#x02019; pre-test, post-test and follow-up test. This includes participants completing the survey sheet with their first pet name, birth month, postal codes, shoe size, and the last two digits/number of their phone number. Unmatched surveys were excluded from the data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>In order to determine the significance of observed scores between pre-test, post-test and follow-up, a series of paired-samples <italic>t-</italic>tests were employed to compare changes in the total number of correct scores on survey items pertaining to general mental health knowledge and total attitude scores.

Taken as a whole, these data suggest that providing teachers with the resources and training to implement mental health literacy into usual school curriculum and then using <italic>The Guide</italic> to direct classroom application of this material can improve knowledge and attitudes of both teachers and students alike.</p><p>These findings further support the perspective of authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] who argue that adolescents&#x02019; negative attitudes towards individuals with mental disorders may be amenable to change through educational programming related to mental illness and that this may lead to improved attitudes and increased access of mental health care by youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This approach, applied in this study, differs markedly from commonly employed stand-alone stigma reduction programs, which have not been extensively shown to decrease stigmatizing attitudes in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In this study, the use of a school-based curriculum delivered by usual classroom teachers based on <italic>The Guide,</italic> demonstrated significant reduction in stigmatizing attitudes following implementation, and although attitude scores decreased somewhat over time, they still remained higher than at baseline. This suggests that embedding mental health literacy into usual school curriculum may be an effective and sustained anti-stigma approach for young people.</p><p>Educators, health professionals and policy makers alike have recognized the importance of mental health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For example, a recent Canadian survey on educators&#x02019; perspectives of school mental health demonstrated that they considered mental health to be extremely important, but lacked confidence in addressing it due to a lack of knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Similar to health literacy, mental health literacy is a necessary foundation for mental health promotion, prevention and interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Therefore, exposure of young people to effective mental health literacy programs can be considered a fundamental first step in addressing a host of mental health related activities. Unfortunately, prior to the results reported herein, most school-based mental health literacy approaches have not demonstrated robust or sustained outcomes in knowledge and attitudes in students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Some researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] have argued that this may be due to the type of material provided and method by which it is provided, often in stand-alone extra-curricular workshop sessions. Integration of mental health literacy materials in usual junior/high school curriculum taught by trained teachers using <italic>The Guide</italic> may mitigate these concerns.</p><p>This study examined changes in knowledge and attitudes through the implementation of <italic>The Guide</italic>. Its positive results encourage further research, particularly into whether this approach contributes to positive behavioral change (such as increased help-seeking behaviors, decreased rates of bullying) in both students and teachers who are exposed to <italic>The Guide</italic>-directed curriculum. Such studies are currently being planned. Further studies, evaluating teachers reports on the challenges and impact of implementing <italic>The Guide</italic> resource in their classrooms are underway.</p><p>This study has some limitations. It is a secondary cross-sectional survey; the time to the second point of post-exposure was limited to two months and did not allow for a control group or randomization. Further, the slightly high attrition (35%) at 2-month follow-up requires caution in interpreting the data from this time point. The improvement in attitudes although statistically robust was based on a small absolute score improvement, which raises a question about how much improvement in attitude scale scores may be needed to translate into de-stigmatized behaviors. This problem of interpreting changes in attitudes scores is not unique to this study and future research will need to consider how to determine the relationship between significant changes in attitude scale scores and meaningful changes in attitudes and behavior. Costs of the application were not addressed, but were minimal and the approach lends itself to the creation of teacher training teams that may provide sustainable and cost-effective capacity that is administratively easy to implement. We are aware of these limitations and a randomized control trial and further evaluations that may effectively address them are currently underway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that the application of a curriculum embedded mental health literacy resource (<italic>The Guide),</italic> delivered by usual classroom teachers may play a substantive positive role in facilitating significant and sustained improvements in mental health knowledge and decreases in stigmatizing attitudes in high school students. To our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to demonstrate this degree of robust findings in school-based approaches to mental health literacy among the student population. This approach fits very well with the usual operation of schools, in which usual classroom teachers provide instruction based on defined curriculum. Such an approach does not require significant amounts of external resources added to schools and is not dependent upon mental health experts, which may not be easily available in most jurisdictions. As such, it fits well into whole school approaches and builds on existing professional pedagogic capabilities of teachers, while at the same time &#x0201c;normalizing&#x0201d; the approach to mental health as not a stand-alone item, but as integrated into usual learning and school activity. In this way, it may have global applicability as world-wide, common elements of schools include the presence of curriculum and the use of teachers to deliver it. Indeed, international applications of this approach are now being evaluated.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec8"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12888_2014_379_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
