It was hypothesized that PO administration of clindamycin to healthy cats would cause AAGS, but administration of a synbiotic 1 hour after clindamycin would lessen the severity of, or prevent development of, AAGS.</p><sec id="jvim14795-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim14795-sec-0009"><title>Animals</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Tennessee, College of Veterinary Medicine (Protocol number 2375). Sample size calculation, performed using data from a previous study,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1003">1</xref> was performed for each of 3 variables: food intake, vomiting, and fecal score. These calculations indicated that 7 cats per group would need to complete each study period to detect a 10% difference in food intake, 10% difference in vomiting, or a 1&#x02010;point difference in fecal score between groups with an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2, in the absence of period effects. To accommodate potential exclusion of cats from enrollment because of potential health conditions and removal as a consequence of severe AAGS during treatment, 19 overtly healthy, purpose&#x02010;bred, domestic short&#x02010;haired research cats initially were enrolled in the study. After completion of physical examination and laboratory assessment (CBC, plasma biochemistry, urinalysis), 3 cats were eliminated from the study: 1 each because of aggression, abnormal physical examination findings, and abnormal laboratory test results.</p><p>One week before the start of the study, the 16 remaining cats were moved from group housing to individual cages. No other changes were made to the cats&#x02019; husbandry during the study. Cats were maintained on their individual maintenance diet plans and portion&#x02010;fed during both individual and group housing. During the week of acclimation, daily food intake was quantitated, cats were monitored daily for the presence of vomiting, and photographs of daily voided feces were taken by an independent observer for scoring using a published fecal scoring system<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1005">3</xref> by 1 investigator (JCW).<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Based on appropriate caloric intake relative to current weight and body condition score, lack of vomiting, and normal fecal scores (median, 2; range, 1&#x02013;3), all 16 cats were considered healthy and were retained in the study. Based on review of their medical records, 14 cats had received antibiotics during their lifetime: 12 cats received antibiotics &#x0003e;2.5 years before the start of the study and 2 cats within the previous 6 months. Thus, cats were stratified by previous antibiotic use and then randomized to 1 of 2 groups (A or B) with a random number generator.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1006">4</xref>

Each study period was 4 weeks long, comprised of a 1&#x02010;week baseline followed by a 3&#x02010;week treatment period. For the first 5 weeks of the washout period, cats were returned to group housing, after which they underwent 1 week re&#x02010;acclimation to individual housing in order to identically match the 2 treatment periods.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14795-sec-0011"><title>Treatments</title><p>Each cat received 75 mg clindamycin PO once daily (median dosage, 18.0 mg/kg/d; range, 12.1&#x02013;22.7 mg/kg/d) after being fed its daily ration of commercial food. One hour after antibiotic administration, each cat received either 2 capsules of the synbiotic<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1004">2</xref> or placebo PO. Cats in Group A received placebo in period 1 and synbiotic in period 2. Conversely, cats in Group B received synbiotic in period 1 and placebo in period 2. All cats were syringe fed 2 mL of water after each treatment. If a cat vomited an intact capsule within 1 hour of administration, a new capsule was administered.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14795-sec-0012"><title>Animal Observations</title><p>An observer blinded to the treatment group quantitated daily food intake and vomiting (present or absent). Any vomiting, including vomiting of hairballs, was considered true vomiting for the purposes of the study. Feces also were photographed daily by the blinded observer. Body weight was measured every 7 days. Cats were removed from a treatment period if they had &#x0003c;50% of baseline food intake for 3 consecutive days, vomited on 3 consecutive days, or lost &#x02265;6% of body weight.</p><p>After completion of each treatment period, photographs of daily voided feces were randomized so that investigators were blinded to cat identity, time point, and treatment group. Investigators independently scored photographs of feces with a published fecal scoring system<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1005">3</xref> after completion of each treatment period, instead of after completion of the study, as a consequence of the performance of an interim analysis after the conclusion of the first treatment period (see <xref rid="jvim14795-sec-0014" ref-type="sec">Results</xref> below).</p></sec><sec id="jvim14795-sec-0013"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable. Samples were analyzed for normality using the Shapiro&#x02010;Wilk test and for the presence of outliers using box&#x02010;and&#x02010;whisker plots. Age and weight for the 2 sequence groups were compared using an independent 2&#x02010;sample Student's <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;test. Mean percent food intake, percent days of vomiting, and mean fecal scores were determined for each week of each study period (baseline and treatment weeks 1, 2, and 3). Mean food intake for each week in each study period was calculated as a percentage of food intake during the acclimation week. Inter&#x02010;rater correlation coefficients were calculated for fecal scores. The mean of fecal scores assigned by the 2 investigators was used for all further statistical analyses. Successful completion of treatment was defined as completion of a treatment period (e.g., not being removed from treatment because of excessive hyporexia, vomiting or weight loss). Cats that did not complete a treatment period were censored from data analyses at the point of removal from treatment.</p><p>Because there was a marked difference in successful completion of treatment of the first study period between the 2 groups (see <xref rid="jvim14795-sec-0014" ref-type="sec">Results</xref> below), an interim analysis was performed during the washout period to confirm that continuation of the trial was necessary and, thus, ethically appropriate. For the interim analysis, successful completion of treatment, mean food intake, percent days vomiting per week, and mean fecal score were compared between groups using a repeated measures split plot design with covariates. Treatment (A or B), week, and cat were included as categorical variables. Treatment, week, and the treatment&#x02010;by&#x02010;week interaction were included as fixed effects. Week was included as a repeated measure with subject as cat. Age, weight, and sex were included as covariates. Cat nested within treatment was included as a random effect. A 1&#x02010;sided Fisher's exact test was used to compare completion of treatment between groups. Although the treatment completion percentage of sequence Group B was significantly higher than Group A (Group A, 50%; Group B, 100%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04), no other statistically significant differences were found. The second treatment period therefore was performed.</p><p>For the final analysis, a 2&#x02010;treatment, 2&#x02010;sequence, 2&#x02010;period AB/BA crossover design with repeated measurements within periods was performed that included fixed effects of treatment (A or B), order of treatment, week, and treatment&#x02010;by&#x02010;week interaction. Age, weight, and sex were included as covariates in the analysis. The repeated measure of time period was accounted for in a repeated statement. Cat nested within sequence group was included as a random effect. A compound symmetry variance/covariance structure was incorporated into each model to account for the inclusion of constant covariates over time (age and weight). The Shapiro&#x02010;Wilk test of normality of the residuals was evaluated for each marker to confirm that the assumption of normally distributed residuals had been met. Model assumptions regarding equality of variances were verified using Levene's test for equality of variances. Differences in least squares means were determined for markers with significant main effect or interaction terms.</p><p>Commercial statistical software packages<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1006">4</xref>

In our study, administration of a synbiotic 1 hour after antibiotic administration significantly decreased hyporexia in healthy cats receiving clindamycin, although it did not prevent development of diarrhea. Synbiotic administration was associated with increased likelihood of completion of antibiotic treatment as a result of decreased frequency of vomiting on multiple sequential days based on interim analysis, although statistical significance was not maintained after completion of the crossover. Cats initially treated with the synbiotic had a significantly lower frequency of vomiting when treated with antibiotics in conjunction with placebo, compared to cats that initially received the placebo, despite a prolonged washout period. If decreased vomiting reflected habituation to repeated antibiotic administration, then both groups should have experienced equivalent decreases in the frequency of vomiting during the second period of the study. Thus, the presence of significant period effects suggests a prolonged protective effect of prior synbiotic administration against future development of AAGS, even in the absence of repeated synbiotic administration. This finding likely confounded the analysis of successful completion of treatment. Review of the data indicated significantly increased food intake in the absence of weight change 6 weeks after discontinuation of antibiotics for 37.5% (3/8) of cats that initially received placebo, but not for cats that initially were treated with the synbiotic. Fecal scores also were increased during the second baseline for cats that initially received the placebo compared to those for cats treated with synbiotic (although this difference did not reach significance), with 37.5% (3/8) of them having fecal scores &#x0003e;4. In total, changes consistent with chronic enteropathy were noted during the second baseline in 75% (6/8) of cats that initially received the placebo. These results suggest development of antibiotic&#x02010;induced chronic enteropathy in cats treated with the placebo, but not in cats that initially received the synbiotic. These results are consistent with results of a recently completed study that identified persistent antibiotic&#x02010;induced dysbiosis in cats treated with clindamycin.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1003">1</xref>

To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, it is unknown which AAGS are most likely to affect client compliance. Interestingly, some cats in the study had sporadic frequency of defecation (once every 2 days) in the face of marked diarrhea (fecal scores &#x02265;6), suggesting high fecal score might not necessarily equate with defecation urgency. Because privately owned cats typically have free access to either a litterbox or the outdoors for defecation, a cat's fecal score might be less likely to impact client compliance than vomiting, hyporexia, or weight loss in the absence of inappropriate elimination. Because dogs do not necessarily have the same access for appropriate defecation in case of urgent need, potential beneficial effects of synbiotic administration on client compliance should be extrapolated to that species with caution.</p><p>The assumed mechanism for AAGS is an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome.<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Positive effects of probiotics on the intestinal microbiome of healthy cats have been demonstrated previously in 2 studies, as were decreased fecal pH (which can inhibit bacterial enteropathogenic species), fecal ammonia concentrations, plasma endotoxin concentrations, and red blood cell fragility (which could be caused by decreased circulating toxins).<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> Because no studies had been published regarding the effects of different antibiotics on the microbiome of cats at the time of study development, the washout period was chosen after review of the literature regarding antibiotic effects on the microbiome of dogs, as well as the effects of pro&#x02010; and synbiotics on markers of gastrointestinal health and immune function in healthy cats and dogs.

Although the synbiotic was administered PO to assure complete ingestion, many probiotics and synbiotics are formulated to allow administration on or mixed with food without compromising efficacy, eliminating the need for pet owners to directly administer such medications.</p><p>As has been found in people, the incidence and severity of AAGS have been shown to vary by antibiotic in dogs.<sup>30,40,</sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1010">8</xref> Adverse gastrointestinal effects were not noted during or after amoxicillin or tylosin therapy in healthy dogs,<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> but a high incidence of diarrhea (56%) was noted after metronidazole administration in another recent report.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1010">8</xref> The incidence of AAGS in cats similarly might vary for different antibiotics. Clindamycin was chosen for our study because it seems to be associated with a high incidence of AAGS in cats, as has been documented in people.<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Clindamycin is available in liquid and capsule formulations. Because many cats tolerate the taste of the liquid formulation poorly, commercial capsules were used for our study. Variability in the size of subjects resulted in a wide dosing range, but weight (and, thus, antibiotic dosage) was not significantly associated with the frequency of AAGS. However, the value of synbiotic administration in mitigating AAGS might differ for cats receiving antibiotics other than clindamycin.</p><p>A few other limitations to this study should be noted. The first was the use of healthy cats as subjects. Although cats in our study had fewer AAGS while receiving clindamycin during or after synbiotic administration, results might differ in systemically ill cats. Additionally, most of the cats had received antibiotics previously, although only 2 within the previous 2.5 years. Administration of antibiotics, such as macrolides, can cause dysbiosis that persists for up to at least 4 years in people,<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> and we recently have demonstrated persistence of microbiome alterations &#x0003e;600 days after clindamycin administration in cats.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1003">1</xref> Given associations between prior antibiotic administration and increased risk of AAGS in people, AAGS might have been more severe for cats in our study than would be identified in antibiotic&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve cats. Age was positively associated with AAGS, but no interaction between age and response to treatment was identified. Significant differences previously have been demonstrated between the microbiome of older cats (ages 8&#x02013;15 years) compared to kittens.<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> Some studies<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> have found that probiotics do not decrease AAGS in older people (&#x0003e;65 years), although other studies suggest strong benefits<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> and several meta&#x02010;analyses have confirmed their efficacy in adults and children.<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> The lack of collinearity between age and treatment effect in our study suggests that synbiotics have prophylactic effects independent of age in cats. Confirmation of these findings in a study population with a greater percentage of geriatric cats is warranted, however, because the majority of the cats in our study were middle&#x02010;aged, with a median age of 9 years. The association between female sex and vomiting also warrants further scrutiny. No association was found between sex and AAGS in a previous study performed in cats.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14795-note-1003">1</xref> The majority of studies of AAGS in people employ sex&#x02010;matching. However, 1 prospective study in which patients were not sex&#x02010;matched to controls found no association between sex and development of AAGS.<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> Human females, however, have been found to be at increased risk of community&#x02010;acquired, but not hospital&#x02010;acquired, <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection.<xref rid="jvim14795-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref> Patients with community&#x02010;acquired infection were less likely to have prior antibiotic exposure (78%) than those with hospital&#x02010;acquired infection (94%), although the prevalence of antibiotic exposure was extremely high in both groups. Finally, cats were maintained on their individual maintenance diets, instead of being placed on 1 or more standardized diets. Although this design improves the applicability of results to clinical practice in which there is marked heterogeneity in patient diets, it unknown whether results would differ in cats that received concomitant alterations in their diets.</p><p>In conclusion, concurrent synbiotic administration significantly increased the likelihood of completion of a 3&#x02010;week course of clindamycin in healthy cats, and it was associated with improved food intake and decreased frequency of vomiting during antibiotic administration. Initial administration of clindamycin with placebo instead of the synbiotic was associated with persistence of clindamycin&#x02010;induced chronic enteropathy 6 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation in 75% (6/8) of cats. Mitigation of AAGS has the potential to improve patient outcome and decrease community&#x02010;acquired antibiotic resistance by increasing owner compliance in completing antibiotic treatment. Further evaluation of the impact of synbiotic administration in ameliorating AAGS in clinically ill cats and dogs receiving antibiotics is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim14795-sec-0021"><title>Acknowledgments</title><sec id="jvim14795-sec-0022"><title>Conflict of Interest Declaration</title><p>Dr. Whittemore has received honoraria from Nutramax Laboratories for development of educational materials and public speaking.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14795-sec-0023"><title>Off&#x02010;label Antimicrobial Declaration</title><p>The authors declare no off&#x02010;label use of antimicrobials in this study.</p></sec></ack><fn-group id="jvim14795-ntgp-0002"><title>Footnotes</title><fn id="jvim14795-note-1003"><label>1</label><p>Whittemore JC, Stokes JE, Laia N, Price JM, Suchodolski J.
