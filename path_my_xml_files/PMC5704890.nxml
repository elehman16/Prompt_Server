Gait, coordination, and balance are affected even in people with only mild neurological signs. <sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Moreover, after early walking problems have been detected, time until complete loss of independent ambulation is predictable, regardless of the relapsing or progressive onset. Spasticity is frequently experienced by people with MS, negatively affecting patient's motor functional outcome, including walking.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Currently, none of the available MS disease-modifying medications has been shown to stop or reverse gait disability. Recently, the nabiximols has been tested for the treatment of spasticity and walking impairment in MS. Nabiximols (trade name Sativex) is an oromucosal spray formulation containing 1:1 fixed ratio of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) derived from cloned <italic>Cannabis sativa L.</italic> plant. The main active substance, THC, acts as a partial agonist at human cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub>), and may modulate the effects of excitatory (glutamate [GLU]) and inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurotransmitters, leading to muscle relaxation, which in turn is responsible for spasticity improvement.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The last 2 decades have seen a remarkable shift of therapeutic approach toward the neurorehabilitation paradigm, considering plasticity as a fundamental property of the human brain. In particular, gait robotic-rehabilitation (RAGT), with or without body weight support (BWS), may offer advantages beyond overground training, in terms of patient safety, reduced fear of falling, more steps practiced, repeatability, and less fatiguing motor paradigms. However, the current data in literature about the efficacy of neurorobotic training in MS are conflicting,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> although it has been hypothesized that virtual reality may strengthen RAGT thanks to the entrainment of different brain areas involved in motor planning and learning.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Nevertheless, the neurorehabilitation plays a key role in preserving the neural-plasticity mechanisms. Cortical reorganization represents the expression of neuronal plastic changes that follow brain tissue damage in MS. Adaptive plasticity is suggested to maintain the expression of pathology at a subclinical level.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, cannabinoid receptors may modulate both excitatory and inhibitory transmission at central synapses, and have been heavily implicated in multiple forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Indeed, in a previous study implying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique, Koch et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> hypothesized that the activation of cannabinoid receptors by Sativex could modulate the balance between LTP and LTD like plasticity by changing the state of cortical excitability. Recently it has been suggested that Sativex may modulate the cortical excitability by changing the activity of the inhibitory GABAergic cortico-cortical synapses.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p></sec></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Objectives</title><p>Aim of the study is to clarify the role of Sativex coupled to a robotic neurehabilitation training in improving motor outcomes, by means of clinical, kinematic, and neurophysiological measures in patients with MS affected by spasticity.</p></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a rater-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group pilot study to assess the efficacy of Sativex associated with robotic-rehabilitation in improving the motor performances of Multiple Sclerosis patients. This study will be conducted at the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo in Messina, Italy. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical and Research Committee of IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo (13/2016 vers, n 1&#x0200a;23/11/2016). The trial is registered under trial gov. (NCT03186664). The study purpose will be explained to the participants, and patients&#x02019; consent will be obtained before the enrollment by the principle investigator.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>We will enroll 40 MS patients affected by gait disturbances and moderate-severe spasticity: 20 of them in treatment with Sativex (Group A) considered as responders, and 20 treated only with the most common antispastics used in MS (Group B). Inclusion criteria are: age range 18 to 65 years; diagnosis of definite relapsing-remitting or primary-progressive or secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis; absence of clinical relapses from no gadolinium-enhanced lesions on brain and spinal cord MRI performed at least 6 months before study entry; no mood or sleep disorders with an Hamilton score of &#x02264;17; a moderate to severe spasticity in at least 2 districts of upper and/or lower limbs; absence of clinical or neuroradiological relapses from at least 6 months before study entry; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) total score between 3.5 and 7.0; no history of psychosis; no presence of pace-maker, aneurysms clips, neurostimulator or brain/subdural electrodes (safety TMS procedure); right handedness, central conduction time in upper limbs of &#x0003c;8&#x0200a;ms; no robotic gait training contraindications.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>We consider as exclusion criteria the following: history of psychosis, presence of pace-maker, aneurysms clips, neurostimulator or brain/subdural electrodes (safety TMS procedure), central conduction time in upper limbs of &#x0003c;8&#x0200a;ms; RAGT contraindications.</p></sec><sec><label>3.4</label><title>Prescreening</title><p>We evaluated 90 MS patients attending the tertiary MS Center of the IRCCS &#x0201c;Bonino-Pulejo&#x0201d; with a moderate to severe spasticity despite oral antispastic treatment (i.e., Baclofen) and a gait disturbance. We randomly divided the population in 2 groups: one with the same oral therapy and the second with Sativex in add-on. After 1 month, we evaluated the response to Sativex (responder patients&#x02019; amelioration &#x0003e;20% at MRS score).

To clarify the role of Sativex in improving spasticity gait-related symptoms, we will also administer the following scales: 10 meters walking test (10WT) and Ambulation Index (AI). Quality of life will be evaluated by means of MS quality of life 54 (MSQOL-54). The skilled clinician will be blind to the drug treatment. Moreover, we will evaluate some electrophysiological parameters to test cortical excitability: motor-evoked potentials (MEP) amplitude, short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) of the most affected side. The same assessment will be applied at baseline, at the end of the RAGT (T1), and 30 days after the end of the neurorehabilitation training (T2).</p></sec><sec><label>3.7</label><title>Study drug</title><p>Patients in treatment with Sativex will receive cannabis-based medicine extract presented in a pump action sublingual spray. Sativex is composed of whole cannabis plant extract, containing THC (27&#x0200a;mg/mL) and CBD (25&#x0200a;mg/mL), in ethanol/propylene glycol (50:50) excipient. Each actuation delivers 100 KL of spray, containing THC 2.7&#x0200a;mg and CBD 2.5&#x0200a;mg.</p><p>Sativex is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to MS, who have not responded adequately to other antispasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity-related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy (4 weeks). The drug is intended to be taken with another antispastic medication, and treatment should be started under the supervision of a doctor skilled in MS. The number and frequency of dosing (sprays) with Sativex will vary and the correct dose of Sativex for the individual patient might be reached over a couple of weeks. The most common side effects or adverse effects associated with the first 4 weeks of treatment with Sativex in clinical studies of the drug were dizziness (occurring mostly during the early stages of treatment when the dose is titrated) and fatigue. During the initial Sativex titration period, it is necessary to gradually increase the number of sprays that you take per day. You should leave at least 15 minutes between sprays and should not exceed 12 sprays per day.</p></sec><sec><label>3.8</label><title>Neurorobotic treatment</title><p>The neurorobotic treatment will be performed by using the Lokomat (Lokomat, Hocoma, Volketswil, Switzerland) device. The Lokomat is a robotic device, consisting of a powered gait orthosis with integrated computer-controlled linear actuators at each hip and knee joint, a BWS, and a treadmill. Gait pattern and guidance force are individually adjustable to the patient's needs to optimize the functional training in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes. Moreover, the new Free-D module allows pelvic rotation and weight shifting with a more physiological deambulation. The system can also evaluate the physiologic stiffness of the patient's hip and knee joints and the isometric force exerted, respectively, for hip and knee extension by the L-STIFF and the L-FORCE software module. The workload will be progressively adjusted based on the improvement of motor performances. Training parameters (weight support, gait speed, guide force) will be individually adapted. During the first Lokomat session, support will be set at 50% of the body weight and will be adapted on observation of the gait. In particular, after 2 weeks, the body weight support will be probably reduced to 30% and in another 2 weeks to 20% of the patient's body weight.</p><p>The Lokomat motor guidance system will be first set at 100%, corresponding to a passive walk. The guidance will be reduced as much as possible on observation of the gait pattern. Walking speed will be regulated on observation of gait and will change randomly to simulate normal gait. The locomotor treatment will be administered 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The overall duration of Lokomat therapy, including the time getting in and out, is expected to be 45&#x0200a;minutes, whereas the effective robotic gait training will last about 30&#x0200a;minutes. At the beginning of the treatment, 40% of each patient's body weight will be supported by the harness system.</p></sec><sec><label>3.9</label><title>TMS: recording systems and electrophysiological parameters</title><p>MEPs will obtained through magnetic monophasic stimuli delivered through a high-power Magstim200 Stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, Dyfed, UK). The coil will be placed tangentially to the scalp with the handle pointing backwards and laterally, at a 45-degree angle to the sagittal plane, approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus, on the optimal site of the scalp to get the wider MEP amplitude (motor hot-spot), from the APB muscle of the most affected side. The rise time of the magnetic monophasic stimulus will be about 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;s with a to-zero of about 800&#x0200a;&#x003bc;s. The current flowed in handle direction during the rise-time of the magnetic field, thus with a posterior-anterior direction. We preliminarily will evaluated the resting Motor rMT, defined as the smallest stimulus intensity able to evoke a peak-to-peak MEP of 50&#x0200a;&#x003bc;V in rest APB, in at least 5 of 10 tracks consecutively, and active motor threshold (aMT), defined as the minimum stimulator output that produced MEP of 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;V more in at least 5 of 10 trials with a constant background contraction of 20% of the maximum integrated electromyography. Then, well applied an intensity of stimulation to obtain an MEP amplitude of &#x0223c;0.7&#x0200a;mV. SICI and ICF will be determined according to the paired-pulse method described by Kujirai and co..<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> The intensity of the conditioning stimulus will be set at 80% of aMT. The intensity of the test stimulus (TS) will set to elicit peak-to-peak MEPs amplitude of 0.7&#x0200a;mV. Such intensities will be kept constant throughout the experiment. SICI and ICF will be assessed at an interstimulus interval of 2 and 12&#x0200a;ms, respectively. Mean amplitude of the conditioned MEP will be expressed as percentage of the amplitude of the unconditioned MEP and will be taken as a measure of corticospinal excitability.</p><p>Electromyographic activity will be recorded through Ag-AgCl surface electrodes applied to APB using a classic muscle belly-tendon montage. Signals will be amplified and filtered (from 32&#x0200a;Hz to 1&#x0200a;KHz) via a Digitimer D150 Amplifier (Digitimer Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK), and stored using a sampling frequency of 10&#x0200a;KHz on a personal computer for off-line analysis (Signal Software, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK).</p></sec><sec><label>3.10</label><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Patients will be clinically evaluated by means of an accurate neurological examination by a blind to treatment physician through validated scales: EDSS, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), MAS, NRS, 10mW, 6 minute walking test (6MW), Hamilton rating scale for Depression (HRSD), and MSQOL 54. Muscular stiffness and strength will be also evaluated by means of instrumental measures furnished by the neurorobotic device itself.

A recent study showed that Lokomat training is effective in reducing reflex and intrinsic stiffness (which abnormally increase in spinal cord injury) and improving the abnormal modulation of reflexes over the ankle range-of-motion.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> There is growing evidence that the association between RAGT and specific antispastic therapy (as Tizanidine) is effective in improving training speed in people with spinal cord injury as compared to Lokomat alone.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>Keeping in mind all of these factors, a randomized trial was planned among MS patients that experienced spasticity and gait disturbance to investigate the role of Sativex in boosting the Lokomat effect.
