This study aims to assess the efficacy over time of an internet Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (iCBT) intervention (&#x02018;<italic>Finding My Way</italic>&#x02019;) in improving distress, coping and quality of life for individuals with a recent diagnosis of early stage cancer of any type.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a multi-site Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) seeking to enrol 188 participants who will be randomised to either the <italic>Finding My Way</italic> Intervention or an attention-control condition. Both conditions are delivered online; with 6 modules released once per week, and an additional booster module released one month after program-completion. Participants complete online questionnaires on 4 occasions: at baseline (immediately prior to accessing the modules); post-treatment (immediately after program-completion); then three and six months later. Primary outcomes are general distress and cancer-specific distress, with secondary outcomes including Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), coping, health service utilisation, intervention adherence, and user satisfaction. A range of baseline measures will be assessed as potential moderators of outcomes. Eligible participants are individuals recently diagnosed with any type of cancer, being treated with curative intent, aged over 18&#x000a0;years with sufficient English language literacy, internet access and an active email account and phone number. Participants are blinded to treatment group allocation. Randomisation is computer generated and stratified by gender.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Compared to the few prior published studies, <italic>Finding My Way</italic> will be the first adequately powered trial to offer an iCBT intervention to curatively treated patients of heterogeneous cancer types in the immediate post-diagnosis/treatment period. If found efficacious, <italic>Finding My Way</italic> will assist with overcoming common barriers to face-to-face therapy in a cost-effective and accessible way, thus helping to reduce distress after cancer diagnosis and consequently decrease the cancer burden for individuals and the health system.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=362038">ACTRN12613000001796</ext-link> 16.10.13</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Psycho-oncology</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Distress</kwd><kwd>Coping</kwd><kwd>CBT</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Despite improvements in treatment and survival rates, a cancer diagnosis continues to elicit greater distress than any other medical diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Research has consistently found that 30 to 40 per cent of recently diagnosed patients experience clinically significant depressive or anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Distress is most acute during the first 12&#x000a0;months after diagnosis, when a range of medical treatments take place, following which the prevalence reduces to levels comparable with the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consequently, distress management within the first 12&#x000a0;months after diagnosis has been recognised as an integral component of a patient&#x02019;s clinical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite this, distress and psychiatric disorders among cancer patients often go under-recognised and untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This particularly applies to the 30% of Australian cancer patients who reside in rural or regional areas, where access to specialist cancer services is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Psychological approaches that alleviate distress</title><p>Over the past two decades, a range of psychological interventions to alleviate distress have been empirically investigated, predominantly among women with breast cancer. Intervention research has focused on developing and evaluating interventions that target the known psychological predictors of maladjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], namely, low social support, prior anxiety and depression (vulnerability to distress), and maladaptive coping, particularly repression of emotions, helplessness/hopelessness, and cognitive and behavioural avoidance. Interventions tested have included those based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Supportive Expressive Therapy (SET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], psycho-educational programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], mindfulness-based therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and peer-support groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is clear meta-analytic evidence that all of these conventional psychosocial interventions are efficacious compared to control groups in facilitating adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; with large effect sizes (ES) found for depression (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2), anxiety (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.99), and functional adjustment / quality of life (QOL) (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, CBT has the largest evidence base for treating cancer-related distress to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with most studies suggesting that treatment for distress at the time of cancer diagnosis is more effective than after cancer treatment has been completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Need for novel approaches to improve access</title><p>While demonstrably efficacious, there several barriers to attending face-to-face therapy in the Australian setting. First, there are limited psychosocial services freely available in the public health setting, with the current capacity not sufficient to meet the demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is particularly evident in rural and remote areas where access to multidisciplinary cancer care is problematic, and resulting inequities in health outcomes are well recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Second, even when psychosocial services are offered in urban settings, research suggests that less than 25% of Australians attend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with low attendance attributed to a variety of barriers including: personal barriers, such as ongoing stigma associated with seeking mental health assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and illness-related barriers such as patients&#x02019; reduced physical capacity for additional appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As a result of these barriers, national government supportive care policies have recognised that innovative methods of increasing access to supportive care throughout the treatment trajectory are required for all cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>One such innovative method of increasing patient access to supportive care is through internet-based provision of psychosocial services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Since 2000 a plethora of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews have examined internet-based interventions for both psychological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and physical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] health complaints. Of these interventions, self-guided web-based interventions offer the particular advantage of overcoming the majority of the barriers discussed above for both rural and urban patients, along with anonymity, privacy and convenience of progressing through a program at the user&#x02019;s own pace. Such interventions tend to be highly structured into modules, are derived from theory (predominantly cognitive behaviour therapy), and have been adapted from existing evidence-based print-resources or face-to-face therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consistent with research on face-to-face therapy, internet Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (iCBT) interventions have the largest evidence base for efficacy in improving both mental health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and, increasingly, coping with chronic physical health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Status of iCBT for cancer distress</title><p>Given that cancer consumers prefer multi-media to print resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and that 84% of Australians have access to the internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], web-based interventions, and in particular iCBT-based interventions, appear a logical format for the wide dissemination of psychological treatment for cancer patients. However, the evidence-base for self-guided iCBT-based psychological therapy in cancer is only now emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] developed and evaluated structured self-guided online CBT-based coping programs for women with recently diagnosed early-stage breast cancer. Similar in design, their programs were both multi-component, and contained 6&#x02013;10 self-guided CBT-based modules, biomedical information, links to other cancer resources and websites, and asynchronous discussion boards. Both studies showed evidence for the efficacy of their respective interventions: The smaller of the two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] found one significant interaction where women with poorer baseline perceived health status experienced greater improvements in perceived health over time when assigned to the intervention, despite a small sample and consequent lack of power. The larger study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found the intervention was efficacious in improving self-efficacy for coping with cancer, regulating negative mood, and reducing cancer-related post-traumatic symptoms. However, as each of these studies involved only breast cancer patients, efficacy could not be demonstrated across cancer types.</p><p>In the third study, Duffecy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] ran a small RCT of 31 post-treatment survivors of various cancer types to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week Internet Support Group (ISG) combined with an Individual Internet Intervention (III), compared with the III alone. The study supported feasibility and acceptability of the combined program, and found that both conditions produced large reductions in depressive symptoms in participants with high baseline distress. However, the study was underpowered to detect improvement over time and time x treatment effects; further, it examined efficacy in post-treatment survivors, rather than patients currently undergoing treatment. Current CBT literature suggests that a more effective time to implement such interventions may be in the immediate post-diagnosis period, when patients are likely to be experiencing higher levels of distress generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Our research group was the first to pilot test a 6-week iCBT program for people with any type of early stage/curatively treated cancer, and designed to be delivered soon after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In contrast to the previous three programs which all depended on group-support as a key feature, our study tested an individual self-guided web-based intervention for newly diagnosed patients that was independent of moderators and peer-support components, and was therefore consistent with the large evidence base for CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Program content was derived from our evidence-based print self-help breast cancer workbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but heavily revised and expanded to ensure relevance to heterogeneous cancer populations. In a case-series design, participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) were assessed at baseline and after completing the program. Analysis found the intervention led to reductions with moderate associated effect sizes in negative affect, helplessness/hopelessness, anxious preoccupation, and fatalism. Results therefore provided preliminary support for the potential efficacy of the web-based CBT program for improving cancer-related distress and anxious preoccupation after cancer diagnosis. However, the pilot nature of this study and small sample size meant that the efficacy of the intervention compared with a control condition could not be established.</p><p>In summary, the four studies published to date provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility of iCBT interventions for delivering psychosocial interventions for coping with cancer. However, studies examining the efficacy of iCBT programs aimed at heterogeneous cancer types have so far been limited by either (1) small sample sizes and consequent lack of power, (2) lack of a control condition, and/or (3) not providing analysis of the longer-term impact of the intervention. Further, only our group have investigated a self-guided intervention that is (a) independent of discussion board components and therefore truly self-guided and (b) applicable to delivery soon after diagnosis, as opposed to post cancer treatment, and therefore consistent with CBT literature suggesting that treatment for distress at the time of cancer diagnosis is more effective than treatment for distress after treatment for cancer.</p><p>This paper reports on the protocol for the proposed RCT to examine the effectiveness of the iCBT intervention in a multisite setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the next iteration of our self-help internet cancer coping intervention (&#x02018;<italic>Finding My Way&#x02019;</italic>) in improving wellbeing and quality of life of early-stage cancer patients over time, using a multi-site RCT.</p><p>A secondary aim is to investigate moderators of therapeutic change, consistent with recommendations that RCTs should identify who benefits most, and under what conditions, from psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For the present study, factors that have been previously shown to predict distress will be examined for their potential to moderate the effects of the intervention; namely, availability of social support, cognitive vulnerability to distress, and motivation to seek information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Therefore it is hypothesised that:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Intervention participants will report greater improvements compared to attention-control participants in the primary outcome, distress, from baseline to post-treatment and 3- and 6-month follow-up;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intervention participants will report greater improvements compared to attention-control participants in the secondary outcomes coping and HRQOL over time;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Primary and secondary outcomes will be moderated such that<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The significant changes over time in distress between groups will be moderated by social support, cognitive vulnerability to distress, and motivation to seek information, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>The significant changes over time in coping and HRQOL between groups will be moderated by social support, cognitive vulnerability to distress, and motivation to seek information.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p>Finding My Way (FMW) is a national level multi-site randomised controlled trial registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with the registration number ACTRN12613000001796.

Cancer-specific distress is measured using the 17-item Posttraumatic Stress Scale-Self Report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which measures on a 4-point scale (<italic>0&#x02009;=&#x02009;Not at all or only one time, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 or more times per week / almost always</italic>), the severity of each DSM-IV post-traumatic stress disorder symptom criterion in terms of how often respondents experienced each symptom in the previous week. For this study, the measure was adapted in order to reflect cancer diagnosis as the stressor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcomes for this study include Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), coping, and the economic impact of the intervention in terms of Health Service Utilisation. HRQOL is measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], a 30-item comprehensive health related quality of life assessment for cancer patients which yields a global QOL score, and five functional subscales (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive).</p><p>Coping is measured with the mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (mini-MAC: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]), a 29-item scale yielding 5 factors: Fighting Spirit, Helplessness/Hopelessness, Anxious Preoccupation, Fatalism, and Cognitive Avoidance. Items are responded to on a 4-point scale ranging from &#x02018;<italic>definitely does not apply&#x02019;</italic> to &#x02018;<italic>definitely does apply</italic>&#x02019;.</p><p>Health Service Utilisation is examined using the 17-item Health Service Utilisation Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which assesses health service use in the previous 12&#x000a0;months in terms of whether patients have been hospitalised and the number of visits to doctors and other health professionals. Hospitalisation is indicated as <italic>no</italic>/<italic>yes day only</italic>/<italic>yes spent at least one night</italic> (with number of days then recorded). Visits to GPs/hospital doctors/specialist doctors are indicated on a 7-point scale ranging from <italic>none</italic> to <italic>25 or more times</italic>, and utilisation of other health professionals (e.g. physiotherapist) is indicated as <italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Moderators of outcomes</title><p>Participant and medical characteristics, availability of social support, information-seeking preferences, emotion regulation, vulnerability to cancer-distress, adherence to the program, and participant satisfaction are assessed as postulated moderators of program efficacy.</p><p>Participant and medical characteristics are assessed at baseline only, and consist of age, marital status, occupational status, annual gross income, level of educational attainment, area of residence (rural/urban, state), ethnicity, cancer type, time since diagnosis, treatment received (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, other), any other chronic health conditions, and other support-services accessed.</p><p>Availability of social support is assessed using the 20-item Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which consists of four subscales: emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interactions, with availability of the support type listed in each item rated on a 5-point scale (<italic>1&#x02009;=&#x02009;none of the time, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;all of the time</italic>).</p><p>Information seeking preferences in terms of the type and amount of cancer information sought by patients is measured by the Miller Behavioral Style Scale scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This scale identifies information seekers who look for and amplify threat-related cues (monitors) and distracters who avoid and minimize such cues (blunters), and has been used extensively in cancer populations. The scale asks the respondent to imagine two stress-evoking scenarios, each of which is followed by eight statements that describe different ways of coping with the stressor, with four statements being of a monitoring or information-seeking variety and four of a blunting or information-avoiding variety. Respondents are asked to check all statements that apply to them.</p><p>Vulnerability to distress is assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], a 36-item measure of difficulties in emotion regulation across six dimensions, namely a) lack of awareness of emotional responses, b) lack of clarity of emotional responses, c) non-acceptance of emotional responses, d) limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective, e) difficulties controlling impulses when experiencing negative emotions, and f) difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviours when experiencing negative emotions. Participants respond to each item on a 5-point scale (<italic>1&#x02009;=&#x02009;almost never, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;almost always</italic>).</p><p>Adherence to the study is measured in two ways. First, the self-help compliance scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] measures participant self-reported engagement with program&#x02019;s (i) information, (ii) worksheets, and (iii) weekly time usage. Second, website use indicators are tracked on the website itself, including: number of visits, length of time logged in, and number of modules and worksheets completed.</p><p>Finally, levels of satisfaction with the website will be assessed as a measure of whether this intervention improved psychosocial support for patients. Qualitative feedback will be gathered within the website, and at follow-up assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Sample size</title><p>Longitudinal sample size calculation for repeated measures was conducted using a program developed by Hedeker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Previous online interventions targeting distress in community samples have effect sizes ranging from .42 to .65 for depression, and from .29 to 1.74 for anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, a conservative small-to-moderate effect size was selected for the current study. Based on the pilot RCT findings, an attrition rate of 21% at each of the assessment points can be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus for a study with 2 groups and 4 assessment points, power set at 0.80, statistical significance set at &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05 (two tailed), total attrition set at 21%, an effect size set at 0.35 SD, and an expected primary endpoint standard deviation of 4.0 at each time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], 94 participants per group are required, summing to a total sample of 188 participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Quantitative data will be analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 17.0. Baseline differences between groups will be investigated using t-tests for continuous measures and <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests of independence for categorical measures. Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMEM) will be employed to examine the efficacy of the intervention. The LMEM calculates a regression line for each individual while controlling for baseline observation (fixed main effects). Baseline observations will be entered as covariates to eliminate the influence of baseline variability, resulting in a 2 (group: intervention; control) X 3 (time: post-program; 3-month follow-up; 6&#x000a0;month follow-up) fixed effects model for each outcome variable, with random effects accounting for individual variation. This approach effectively equalises conditions at baseline and consequently allows for direct comparison between conditions at each follow-up point. In this context, (a) interactions between condition and time, (b) main effects of group and (c) post-hoc pairwise comparisons at each follow-up point are all indicators of intervention effects. This analysis offers the benefit of estimation maximisation; it provides joint modelling for each participant of observed and missing data based on maximising likelihood for population parameters as a function of the observed data. LMEM analyses are therefore robust with respect to handling missing data and unbalanced designs in longitudinal research as all participants with at least one observed <italic>post-treatment</italic> data point are included. That is, as baseline data is entered as a covariate, participants who do not complete any of the post-program assessments are not retained. To overcome this limitation and ensure this trial adopts a fully intention-to-treat design, multiple imputation will be performed for participants with only baseline-data. Therefore all participants, regardless of missing data at one or more assessment points, will be included in analyses and accurate parameter estimates obtained. Within-group effect sizes and reliable change indices will be calculated to provide a measure of the magnitude and clinical significance of changes respectively. To test for moderation, separate LMEM analyses will be conducted for each combination of moderator and outcome variable, where the moderator and group are entered in model 1 to control for main effects. The product term is then entered in model 2, to represent the interaction between group and moderating variable, and will indicate the moderating effect.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Internet-based self-help modalities represent one means of overcoming existing barriers to cancer patients accessing supportive care and psychosocial services, including the lack of such services within the public health system, particularly for rural patients, and barriers to attendance even where such services are provided. However, previous studies examining the efficacy of web-based self-help modalities for cancer populations have suffered from a range of limitations including (1) lack of an established psychological model (such as CBT) as the basis for the program, (2) lack of a control condition (3) small sample size and consequent lack of power for analyses, (4) lack of follow-up analysis over time, (5) examining efficacy of programs for one cancer type (i.e. breast cancer) only, as opposed to heterogeneous cancer types, and/or (6) examining programs implemented after completion of cancer treatment, as opposed to soon after diagnosis when distress tends to be highest and psychological treatment most warranted.</p><p>To our knowledge, <italic>Finding My Way</italic> is unique in offering an iCBT intervention applicable to individuals with heterogeneous cancer types soon after diagnosis. The large scale of this national multi-site RCT will therefore enable examination of the efficacy of such a program in reducing patient distress, improving coping and health related quality of life, and reducing health service utilisation in individuals with a range of cancer diagnoses. Furthermore, this study offers the important contribution of evaluating potential moderators of change. This information can be of benefit clinically when determining who to refer for online-interventions (versus who may be more suitably treated via other modalities) as well as benefitting future research via the refinement of inclusion and exclusion criteria, improving trial stratification and increasing power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Indeed, it has been suggested that results of treatment trials are often weak because moderators of treatment are not examined, thus they should be part and parcel of any treatment study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; however, few studies have specifically examined moderators of psycho-oncology interventions.</p><p>If found efficacious, <italic>Finding My Way</italic> will represent an important means of overcoming common barriers to face-to-face therapy in a cost-effective and accessible way, which may particularly assist those residing in rural/remote areas. Integration of such a program into the supportive care offered to cancer patients within the health system will therefore be a promising avenue for reducing patient distress after cancer diagnosis, and consequently for decreasing the cancer burden both on individuals and within the health system.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behaviour therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASS</term><def><p>Depression anxiety stress scales</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ES</term><def><p>Effect size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FMW</term><def><p>Finding My Way</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>Health related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iCBT</term><def><p>Internet cognitive behaviour therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISG</term><def><p>Internet support group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMEM</term><def><p>Linear mixed effects models</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mini-MAC</term><def><p>Mini Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QOL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SET</term><def><p>Supportive expressive therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>Statistical package for the social sciences</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LB design of study protocol, review of manuscript.
