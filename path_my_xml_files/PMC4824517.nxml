In Namibia, patient education and empowerment trainings were conducted in four antiretroviral (ART) clinics to increase patient engagement during patient-provider interactions. This qualitative study supplements findings from a randomized controlled trial, by analyzing data from 10 in-depth patient interviews and 94 training evaluation forms. A blended approach of deductive and inductive coding was used to understand training impact. Findings indicated the trainings increased patients&#x02019; self-efficacy through a combination of improved HIV-related knowledge, greater communication skills and enhanced ability to overcome complex psychosocial barriers, such as fear of speaking up to providers. This study suggests patient empowerment training may be a powerful method to engage HIV patients in their own care and treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the United States President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pepfar.gov/about/">http://www.pepfar.gov/about/</ext-link>) through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hrsa.gov/index.html">http://www.hrsa.gov/index.html</ext-link>) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/">http://www.cdc.gov/</ext-link>), Award # U91HA06801.

An estimated 220,000 adults are currently living with HIV and the prevalence is approximately 14.3% [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over the course of the last decade however, Namibia has made significant progress scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART), increasing access to life-saving treatment for people living with HIV (PLHIV). ART provision began in Namibia&#x02019;s public sector facilities in 2003. As of 2013, Namibia had already achieved one of the highest ART coverage rates in sub-Saharan Africa with 87% of eligible adults and 70% of eligible children receiving ART, for a total of 113,486 people [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>While ART scale-up efforts have enormous potential to impact the course of the epidemic, patient retention in care and adherence to treatment remain challenges. In 2013, an ART adherence baseline survey estimated patient adherence rates at all of Namibia&#x02019;s public health facilities offering ART. The survey determined only 7.3% of patients were categorized as having high adherence to ART (95% adherence or above) [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A 2014 publication found Namibia&#x02019;s retention in care rate of adults on ART after 12 months was 82%, with a range of 64% to 100%, depending on the site. Less than half of all adult ART sites met the target of &#x02265;85% retention at 12 months [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Achieving high adherence is critical because it is associated with sustained HIV suppression and improved life expectancy, [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reduced risk of developing resistance to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and decreased risk of transmitting HIV [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Recent literature from sub-Saharan Africa highlights the importance of patient-provider interactions in retention and ART adherence. Studies found that weak patient-provider relationships [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153042.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] lack of information and understanding about ART (either information not provided or information misunderstood) and disrespectful or harsh treatment by providers, were all barriers associated with decreased retention and adherence [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153042.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Namibia&#x02019;s ART baseline survey cited above identified similar barriers to adherence, including challenges with patient-provider communication, lack of adequate communication materials, and patients not understanding ART-related instructions. The inverse has also been shown to be true: positive patient-provider interactions were linked to increased patient retention and adherence. For example, a 2014 study in Kenya found a higher number of patient-perceived physician communication behaviors were associated with an approximately 25% lower likelihood of patients missing an appointment and a 32% lower likelihood of patients missing medication [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies from Zambia, Tanzania and Ethiopia have shown that knowing providers personally, trusting them and receiving education about ART, motivated patients to take their medication as prescribed [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153042.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153042.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The evidence from studies outside of sub-Saharan Africa shows similar findings. Multiple studies in the United States have demonstrated a significant correlation between ART adherence and patients&#x02019; perceived level of engagement and satisfaction with their providers. In one study clients who were more engaged with their providers missed fewer appointments and reported higher adherence to their medication regimen and provider advice [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to Flickinger, Saha, Moore, and Beach, [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] patients were more likely to keep appointments when they felt their providers &#x0201c;knew them as persons,&#x0201d; treated them with respect and dignity, explained things in ways they could understand and listened carefully to them.</p><p>I-TECH (International Training and Education Center for Health), at the University of Washington, has been working in Namibia since 2003 as a technical partner to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) to support the roll-out of ART. Through interactions with Namibian clinicians, leaders of HIV support groups and others, we learned that patients are often non-communicative during their clinical consultations, even when HIV clinicians encourage patient involvement. This can result in health care providers (HCPs) not providing necessary information to the patient, or overlooking side effects or other challenges the patient is experiencing. We hypothesized that addressing this lack of engagement through patient education and empowerment trainings for ART patients would help to improve patient-provider interactions.</p><p>The need to enhance patient-provider interactions in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly Namibia, has received limited research attention. Most interventions approach the issue from the provider perspective, seeking only to improve the communication skills of the HCP. There are few studies that aim to empower the patient directly by building his capacity to convey and address his needs during consultations [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Against this backdrop, we developed a two-pronged research agenda: the first was to determine the effects of patient education and empowerment trainings on patient-provider interactions through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in four ART clinics in Namibia; the second, presented in this article, was to enrich the RCT findings by examining individual patient perspectives on effectiveness of the trainings through a qualitative study.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of a series of patient training sessions designed to increase patient engagement during clinical consultations. Three 2-hour training sessions on active participation, patient empowerment and communication were provided to groups of 4&#x02013;8 adults newly initiating ART at four facilities in Windhoek, Rundu (in the far North), Onandjokwe and Katima Mulilo. The training curriculum was developed by I-TECH in Namibia with the local context in mind and content was translated into the languages spoken at each participating site. The same group of adults attended all three training sessions together and attended the ART clinic for follow up on the same days of the three training sessions.</p><p>The curriculum is informed by Bandura&#x02019;s social cognitive theory (SCT) and particularly, the central construct of self-efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. SCT assumes learning occurs in a social context through observation and modeling of others&#x02019; behaviors, and that adoption of modeled behaviors is determined by the observer&#x02019;s degree of self-efficacy, or confidence in his/her ability to perform the modeled behavior. According to SCT, models should be well-regarded individuals with whom observers self-identify. To this end, the intervention was designed to train HIV-positive Namibians as facilitators. The theory also suggests that goal-setting directs behavior through increased self-efficacy and motivation, particularly when the outcomes are viewed as valuable. Thus the empowerment trainings incorporated activities to help patients set and reach their individual goals. Key to SCT is the notion that repeated practice of the learned behavior leads to skill acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, all three sessions were highly interactive, using a variety of hands-on methods for patients to practice the desired behaviors and gain competence and confidence. A summary of session contents is as follows:</p><p><underline>Session 1:</underline> &#x0201c;Learning to Speak to Providers&#x0201d; begins to teach patients how to ask questions and explain their symptoms to doctors. A game is played to teach patients about HIV, ARV side effects and adherence issues. They discuss what it means to be an active patient and practice asking questions using the &#x0201c;Question Tool&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153042.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). They also set personal communication goals for future doctors&#x02019; consultations.</p><p><underline>Session 2:</underline> &#x0201c;Using Tools to Help Communication&#x0201d; presents different tools to patients to help them prepare for consultations with their doctors, such as the &#x0201c;Body Map Tool&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153042.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and the &#x0201c;Side Effects Checklist&#x0201d; (not shown). A &#x0201c;Pain Scale&#x0201d; (not shown) is also introduced to help patients think about how to communicate pain more effectively to their doctors. Patients are given scenarios to practice using all of the tools together to better communicate health concerns to a doctor.</p><p><underline>Session 3:</underline> &#x0201c;Overcoming Barriers to Communication&#x0201d; helps patients think through any outstanding barriers to communication and strategize on how to resolve them. Patients practice assertive communication skills using role plays and the &#x0201c;I Tool&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153042.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), a tool to help patients address their specific health information needs. They finish with a discussion on mitigating language barriers with doctors.</p><p>In between each session, patients typically attended an ART clinic visit, which they debriefed at the beginning of Sessions 2 and 3. This design was intended to give patients a near-immediate opportunity for real life application of the knowledge and skills taught in the trainings, while also providing a systematic means to process patient experiences in a facilitated group setting. Facilitators were trained to offer specific feedback to patients on their improvements in order to enhance their self-efficacy and motivation.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Randomized Controlled Trial</title><p>The effectiveness of the intervention was measured in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 589 patients. The intervention group received training sessions at approximately 2 weeks, 1&#x02013;2 months, and 3&#x02013;4 months after ART enrollment. Control group participants began their trainings six months after ART initiation. The Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) for coding medical dialogue was used to code and quantify patient-provider conversations. RIAS outcomes were compared between study groups at 6 months. Statistically significant improvement was found in 5 of the 13 outcome variables for patient-provider interactions. Key findings included trained patients were nearly twice as likely to ask questions of their providers compared with untrained patients (adjusted difference in score .48, p = .012), and trained patients had greater positive patient affect and satisfaction with their providers than the controls (adjusted difference in score 2.08, p = .002). Doctors also gathered more information from trained patients (adjusted difference in score 2.96, p = .000) and showed a stronger positive emotional affect during encounters (adjusted difference in score .60, p = .02). A more comprehensive description of the RCT research design and findings were published in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Qualitative Evaluation of Trainings</title><p>As part of the RCT we conducted this qualitative study in order to enhance the interpretation of its findings by exploring individual patient perspectives on their training experience through in-depth interviews. Open-ended evaluation forms completed by facilitators on all three training sessions provided additional evidence on patient reactions to the training. Specifically, we aimed to identify how patients perceived the effects of the training intervention on their capacity to engage with providers and thereby understand more the underlying mechanism by which the trainings led participants to feel an increased sense of self-efficacy to be active and engaged patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Data Collection</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Patient Interviews</title><p>Between February and June 2013, 10 in-depth interviews using semi-structured interview guides were conducted with trained patients at Onandjokwe ART Clinic (4 patients) and Katima Mulilo Hospital (6 patients) to understand if/how they were personally affected by the trainings. Patients were eligible to participate if they completed all three of the training sessions. Questions were open-ended and probing was used to investigate other topics of interest that emerged during the interviews.</p><p>Sampling was based on convenience and included any eligible patients who were already attending one of the two clinics for other purposes. Interviews were carried out on-site at the health facilities in a private setting. They were conducted in Silozi (Katima Mulilo) and Oshiwambo (Onandjokwe) by trained local facilitators (not the facilitators of the trainings), digitally recorded, transcribed and translated into English by the bilingual study site coordinators.

The evaluation forms described facilitators&#x02019; perceptions of what worked well with the training and areas for improvement, and sometimes included summaries of reactions and quotes from individual training participants. During the RCT these evaluation forms were intended to provide facilitator feedback on the trainings in order to assure training quality. A total of 94 training evaluation forms (50 from Training 1, 32 from Training 2, 12 for Training 3) were collected during the course of the intervention, between January and November, 2012. Facilitators were asked to document the concepts participants appeared to appreciate most, areas they found unclear, topics they needed more information about and any participant concerns. Information gathered from the forms was used as &#x0201c;shadowed data&#x0201d; to supplement that of the in-depth patient interviews, as this permitted the inclusion of a wider breadth of perspectives on the trainings from beginning to end. Shadowed data also provide a better sense of the range of experiences beyond an individual&#x02019;s personal experience [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

While the RCT determined the effects of the trainings on patients&#x02019; and providers&#x02019; communication behaviors, this study afforded a deeper awareness of the context in which behavior changes occurred. The joint implementation of qualitative studies with RCTs is useful and often necessary when quantitative methods alone are insufficient to evaluate complex behavioral interventions, particularly those with psychosocial components [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Qualitative studies allow for greater and more meaningful interpretation of trial findings, enabling researchers to unpack the intervention&#x02019;s &#x0201c;black box&#x0201d; by understanding which aspects were effective and why [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Patient self-efficacy is widely recognized as a requisite factor for health behavior change, influencing not only the decision-making process but also the likelihood of initiating and sustaining behavior change [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The primary aim of this intervention was to increase the quality of patient-provider interactions via patient empowerment and education. Findings from this study strongly suggest the trainings enhanced patients&#x02019; self-efficacy to engage with providers during medical consultations. Increased self-efficacy does not always translate to actual behavior change; however, in this case, qualitative results are supported by RCT findings, which showed a statistically significant increase in trained patients asking questions of providers. Our findings resonate with those of a similar intervention in Indonesia, which found patient education and empowerment coaching led to improvements in active patient communication, due to increased patient confidence and communication skills to talk openly with providers [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additional research is necessary to establish whether patient-targeted education and empowerment interventions can generate sustained benefits, especially for HIV/AIDS patients, who face a lifetime of care and treatment.</p><p>Our intervention&#x02019;s theory of change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153042.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) proposed higher quality patient-provider interactions would ultimately lead to better ART adherence via enhanced patient adherence self-efficacy. This model is well-supported by the literature. A 2014 meta-analysis of 207 studies, reporting on over 100,000 ART patients, found self-efficacy to be the factor most strongly associated with adherence. Trust and satisfaction with the HIV care provider were also associated with greater adherence, especially in low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our qualitative and RCT study results serve to strengthen the evidence from these publications, as not only did trained patients have greater positive affect and express satisfaction with their providers&#x02019; responses, but doctors collected more information from patients and had a more positive emotional affect during consultations. This suggests empowered confident patients, motivated to be &#x0201c;treated well&#x0201d;, engaged more actively with providers. It is possible that this encouraged provider dialogue which, in turn, motivated doctors to collect more information from patients and, in the end, led to the provision of better care [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153042.s004">S4 Fig</xref> with the arrow from the physician pointing toward improving patient self-efficacy. Positive patient-provider interactions have been shown to generate greater adherence, due to patients&#x02019; feeling respected and understood [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which subsequently enhances their confidence in their ability to maintain their treatment regimen [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Findings from this study suggest a major factor behind the intervention&#x02019;s success was its three-pronged approach to improving patient engagement with providers, which included: 1) overcoming patients&#x02019; psychosocial barriers, such as the fear to &#x0201c;speak freely&#x0201d; with providers and &#x0201c;legitimizing patients&#x02019; right to speak,&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] 2) improving patients&#x02019; HIV-related knowledge; and 3) enhancing patients&#x02019; communication skills. An important feature of the approach is the interdependent relationship between these training components, as each relies and builds upon the other in order to more comprehensively address patient training needs. For example, acquiring an understanding of one&#x02019;s CD4 count (knowledge) is greatly enhanced by a patient&#x02019;s ability to ask the doctor for his lab results (communication skills). Making such a request for results would not be conceivable for patients who are afraid to ask questions of their providers, or who do not understand that they have the right to do so (psychosocial barriers).</p><p>Our study findings support the hypothesis presented in the theory of change diagram (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153042.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), which posits the three training components would collectively lead to an increase in patients&#x02019; self-efficacy to be active and engaged with providers during medical encounters. The need for a more comprehensive approach to address health behavior change is well documented. In order to enhance the likelihood of behavior change and achieving related health outcomes, there is evidence that it is necessary to go beyond traditional knowledge-based approaches and target patient understanding and self-efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, in contexts where major psychosocial obstacles to patient communication exist, such as patient fear of questioning providers or lack of awareness of patient rights, our study contributes to existing research which proposes that addressing these barriers is essential [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By overcoming such obstacles, patients are given the opportunity to fully realize the potential of their acquired knowledge and communication skills. Similar to other studies, our findings suggest that clarifying patient-provider roles and explicitly &#x0201c;permitting&#x0201d; and encouraging patients to speak up to providers, were effective tactics [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153042.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Another barrier that was discussed frequently by patients in this study was language. While patient-provider language barriers are not unique to Namibia, it is worth noting that a medical school did not exist in the country until 2010. As a result, the vast majority of its public sector ART doctors are non-Namibian and do not speak the native languages of their patients. Moreover, none of the 8&#x02013;10 ART doctors who participated in our study was Namibian. This suggests there are likely cultural barriers in addition to the linguistic hurdles that patients face during consultations. A study conducted in South Africa found language and cultural barriers had adverse impacts on HCPs and patients, such as negative patient and staff attitudes towards each other, decreased quality of and patient satisfaction with care, and cross-cultural misunderstandings leading to poor patient-provider communication [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further studies are needed to better understand how these factors affect patients&#x02019; experiences in Namibia.</p><p>A variety of training methods were used to enhance patients&#x02019; confidence to engage with providers. These methods align with Bandura&#x02019;s suggested means of increasing self-efficacy in order to change behavior [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The trainings actively involved patients by giving them opportunities to practice active patient behaviors and process their experiences through constructive facilitator feedback, self-reflection and group discussion. This experiential approach for patient empowerment and education interventions is well-supported by the literature [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The trainings also included an exercise in Session 1 in which patients defined individual, communication-related goals for future consultations. At subsequent trainings, patients debriefed their consultation experiences with the group, including the successes or challenges in meeting those goals. The importance of goal setting as a method to empower patients and enhance self-efficacy is widely discussed in the literature, as it can help to gauge progress, strengthen patients&#x02019; sense of control, and motivate them to achieve the desired change [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153042.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153042.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. HIV-related information in the trainings was taught using interactive techniques like the &#x0201c;knowledge game&#x0201d;, to keep patients engaged while providing them with important knowledge about their disease and treatment. A 2012 review of patient engagement interventions emphasized the need to use more participatory, patient-centered methods to increase health literacy and empower patients, versus the more traditional directive, advice-laden styles of teaching, which can lead to patient resistance or a sense of hopelessness [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The same review described how the provision of health information, via both written and oral means, can increase patients&#x02019; sense of empowerment, improve their ability to cope with challenges and may reduce anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Question prompts have also been linked to increased patient self-efficacy, reinforcing our findings from patient interviews, which suggest patients&#x02019; confidence was enhanced by using tools like the Question Tool. Finally, a sub-Saharan Africa-focused meta-ethnography found the use of patient groups as social support helped to strengthen HIV patients&#x02019; self-efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our study assigned patients to training groups based on their ART initiation date and the same group makeup was maintained for all three training sessions. While information on the training groups was not specifically elicited from patients, many described appreciating the group discussions, &#x0201c;enjoying talking about our experiences in medication and HIV life&#x0201d; (P5) and numerous evaluation feedback forms remarked on patients&#x02019; high levels of engagement with the groups. Therefore, it is possible that these training groups functioned as patient support groups as well.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Study Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Patients overwhelmingly reported a high level of satisfaction with the training activities. The few concerns mentioned by patients about the training sessions were regarding training length (that they should be longer than two hours and continue beyond three sessions) and translation issues. In order to convey information to patients in different parts of the country, who speak different languages, materials were originally developed in English and translated into local languages before the trainings by the training facilitators. Some patients remarked that their facilitators had a difficult time finding the correct words to use, which may have impacted the integrity of the materials&#x02019; content. Practically speaking, it also took more time to explain the content depending on the group&#x02019;s translation needs, which likely resulted in less time for discussion or other activities compared to groups who required less translation.</p><p>The limited sample size and sampling methods of interviewed patients prevent generalization of the findings to other patients. Evaluation forms were not collected from every training and thus do not represent a complete universe of all trainings. Analysis of the evaluation forms and in-depth interviews did, however, reveal strong thematic saturation, suggesting the data&#x02019;s rigor and reliability [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Use of project staff as facilitators to record data the training evaluations possibly introduced self-report bias, as facilitators may have been concerned that negative comments would reflect badly on staff performance. The high degree of agreement across all evaluation forms and the positive feedback from patients themselves makes this seem less plausible, particularly because facilitators tended to complete the forms collectively with patients, and often noted patient quotations directly (e.g., &#x0201c;We especially enjoyed the knowledge game&#x0201d;). We further attempted to minimize this bias by assigning the site coordinators, rather than the actual trainers, to facilitate evaluation discussions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Conclusion and Implications for Practice</title><p>This study, in combination with the RCT, showed that trained, Namibian ART patients increased their confidence and competence to actively engage with providers due to the patient education and empowerment intervention. These results may lay the foundation for new, innovative interventions for patients living with HIV in Namibia. For example, it may be practical and cost-effective to have existing community counsellors at clinical sites communicate with patients about increasing their participation in care and treatment. They might also be able to encourage patients to practice their right to speak to doctors, or lead sessions to teach patients how to communicate effectively with their health care providers.</p><p>The rapid scale-up of ART in Namibia has meant that more patients are seeking necessary care in an already overburdened health system. Lack of effective patient-provider communication can result in providers not offering some necessary information to the patient, or overlooking symptoms, side effects and other challenges that the patient is experiencing, but is hesitant to report. Given the incredibly limited time providers have with ART patients, empowering patients to use effective communication strategies may be the key to bridging this gap. Furthermore, this strategy can serve to prevent HIV-related complications as some may be avoided if adherence is supported and side effects addressed early through effective patient-provider interactions [<xref rid="pone.0153042.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this setting all patients had routine counseling and education sessions, both group and individual, for all patients on ART. Given our findings, this routine pre-ART counseling could be augmented to take into consideration patient empowerment support.</p><p>Patient empowerment training may also be a powerful way to engage patients in their own care and treatment. Without basic information about how to take their medication and manage their HIV disease, patients will not be able to make informed decisions about their lifestyle. In addition, feeling empowered to ask their providers specific questions about managing their disease is one way to improve patient engagement in chronic disease management. This training curriculum may be a promising resource for those who work with HIV/AIDS patients in resource-limited settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153042.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Question Tool.</title><p>Questions depicted in the tool were for illustrative purposes only.
