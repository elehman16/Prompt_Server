The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by multiple institutional review boards. Study participants provided written informed consent. All participants were at least 18-years old and had type 1 or 2 diabetes. Detailed descriptions of study eligibility criteria and the structured anti-VEGF retreatment algorithm were specified in the study protocol. At the baseline visit, 660 participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment groups for management of DME: 2.0 mg intravitreous aflibercept, 1.25 mg intravitreous bevacizumab, or 0.3 mg intravitreous ranibizumab. Retreatment with the assigned anti-VEGF agent could occur as frequently as monthly through 2 years, but was deferred once study eyes met prespecified sustained stability or success criteria related to changes in visual acuity and central retinal thickness on optical coherence tomography. If indicated, the same anti-VEGF was given in the nonstudy eye as in study eye, but treatment frequency was at investigator discretion.</p><p>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured three times using the same automated blood pressure monitor (Omron 10 Series Plus; Omron Healthcare, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) after participants had been sitting for 10 minutes at the following visits: baseline, 4, 8, 12, 52, and 104 weeks. Using the average of the three measurements, blood pressure was categorized into four groups: normal (systolic &#x0003c;120 mm Hg and diastolic &#x0003c;80 mm Hg), borderline elevation (systolic 120&#x02013;139 mm Hg or diastolic 80&#x02013;89 mm Hg), mild elevation (systolic 140&#x02013;159 mm Hg or diastolic 90&#x02013;99 mm Hg), and moderate elevation (systolic &#x02265;160 mm Hg or diastolic &#x02265;100 mm Hg).<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-3-1199-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was also calculated.</p><p>At the baseline and 52-week protocol visits, urine samples were collected to assess kidney function. The samples were frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C and shipped within 7 days of collection to the Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Minnesota for measurement of urinary albumin and creatinine. Urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) was calculated and categorized into three levels: no albuminuria (&#x0003c;30 mg/g), microalbuminuria (30&#x02013;300 mg/g), or macroalbuminuria (&#x0003e;300 mg/g).<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-3-1199-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In addition, participants were asked to return 2 to 3 days after one of the first three injections for an optional visit to obtain a blood pressure and urine sample.</p><p>The MAP treatment group comparison was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with adjustment for baseline level.

Substantial changes in UACR were uncommon across all three treatment groups. Approximately equal percentages of participants had improvement or worsening in blood pressure at 2 years. Previously published results from this trial stated that 7% to 12% of participants in each treatment group developed hypertension and 11% to 12% experienced renal events based participant self-reporting through 1 year of follow-up.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-3-1199-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> By systemically evaluating changes in blood pressure and UACR measurements over time, this study provided additional quantitative information on systemic side effects when ocular anti-VEGF agents were administered over 2 years of follow-up.</p><p>In the current era, approximately 27% of United States adults with diabetes have albuminuria, of whom approximately 75% have microalbuminuria and 25% have macroalbuminuria.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-3-1199-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, in this trial, at baseline, approximately two-thirds of participants had albuminuria, among whom approximately half had microalbuminuria and half macroalbuminuria; interestingly, only 13% of participants self-reported a history of kidney disease. Multiple studies have reported associations between diabetic nephropathy and DR.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-3-1199-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-59-3-1199-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> As a result, one might expect that kidney disease in this cohort of participants with DME to be more prevalent than among patients with diabetes with earlier or no retinopathy.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no published reports providing baseline levels of UACR in a large cohort of patients with DME to determine prevalence of kidney disease in similar cohorts. However, unpublished data (Karen Chu, personal communications, 2017) from the VISTA trial that measured urine protein and creatinine ratio (UPCR) at baseline among 461 participants with similar characteristics as Protocol T, showed that approximately 70% of participants had a normal UPCR (&#x0003c;1 g).<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-3-1199-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In the VISTA trials, approximately 54% of participants were on ACE inhibitors and 29% of participants were on receptor blockers compared with 50% and 21% (including 2% on both) in the DRCR.net trial. Given the substantial differences between baseline measures indicative of potential kidney disease between the two studies, the true rate in patients with DME remains to be determined.</p><p>There are several limitations of the study. First, all participants received an anti-VEGF drug and there was not a control group for comparison. Therefore, no assessments can be made with respect to whether anti-VEGF treatment has an effect on UACR or blood pressure. Second, over 80% of participants were on blood pressure lowering medications at the time of study entry, which could impact the ability to assess the effect of anti-VEGF treatments on blood pressure changes. In addition, at each time point blood pressure was only measured on 1 day and could be affected by changes in or compliance with antihypertensive medications. Although it is presumed that this would not bias treatment group comparisons, the incidence of blood pressure worsening cannot be readily determined from the study data. Finally, this study did not measure estimated glomerular filtration rate, which could indicate diabetic nephropathy without micro- or macroalbuminuria.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, there do not appear to be differences in changes in blood pressure over 2 years or kidney function as assessed by UACR through 1 year based upon treatment with aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab. In addition, anti-VEGF treatment with any of these agents does not appear to substantially increase the risk of developing or worsening hypertension or proteinuria during this follow-up period.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (EY14231, EY23207, and EY18817).
