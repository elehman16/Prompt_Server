Typical features at death are high parasite loads and obstructed micro- vasculature. Infected erythrocytes (IE) containing mature parasites bind to the host receptor heparan sulfate, which is also an important receptor for merozoite invasion. To block merozoite invasion has not previously been proposed as an adjunctive therapeutic approach but it may preclude the early expansion of an infection that else leads to exacerbated sequestration and death.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Sevuparin in phase I study</title><p>The drug sevuparin was developed from heparin because heparan sulfate and heparin are nearly identical, so the rationale was that sevuparin would act as a decoy receptor during malaria infection.

The mean relative numbers of ring-stage IEs decreased after a single sevuparin infusion and mature parasite IEs appeared transiently in the circulation.

Improvements of supportive care, including novel drugs, could lower the fatality rate and diminish neurological- and cognitive dysfunctions seen in some survivors of the four million or so who develop severe malaria each year. Historically, adjunct therapies have been found to be of benefit to animals in models of severe malaria [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the effects have not been possible to reproduce in humans infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> likely because the hosts, the parasites and the pathology that bring about severe malaria are only partially alike in animals and man [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Indeed, no adjunct treatment with acceptable safety profile has been shown to be of benefit to humans with severe malaria [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Excessive sequestration of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infected erythrocytes (IE) and inflammation are typical features of severe malaria but it is also known that patients with complicated disease carry higher parasite loads, a larger biomass, than those with mild malaria [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We hypothesized that ring stage parasitemia in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infected humans is maintained by an asynchronous rupture of schizonts, the subsequent invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites and the development of the parasites into ring- and adhesive trophozoite stage IE. The time of development of a merozoite into an adhesive IE that may obstruct the micro-vasculature is about 18&#x02013;20 hours and the majority of deaths in severe malaria occur the first day of hospitalization during an equivalent timespan [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In historical studies, heparin has been found to reduce the mortality from severe <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria if it was given as an adjunct to anti-plasmodial drugs, but its use was stopped because of the risk of hemostatic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of heparin on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sequestration and merozoite invasion was found to be independent of its anti-coagulant activity [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Notably, preclinical investigations have demonstrated that sevuparin, an acidic, negatively charged, antiadhesive polysaccharide drug manufactured from heparin with eliminated antithrombin (AT) binding site, affects both merozoite invasion and sequestration of IE.</p><p>Sevuparin blocks <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> merozoite invasion into fresh erythrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, and both disrupts and blocks the binding of IE to uninfected erythrocytes (rosetting) and binding to vascular endothelial cells (cytoadherence) <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, from i<italic>n vivo</italic> studies sevuparin has been demonstrated to block IE from binding in the micro-vasculature of the rat but also to de-sequester IE, i.e. release already sequestered IE into circulation, both in rats and in a non-human primate [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, sevuparin binds to the N-terminal extracellular, heparan sulfate binding structure of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), the Duffy-binding like domain 1&#x003b1; (DBL1&#x003b1;), known as a vital contributor to sequestration of IE [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the results of both a phase I study in healthy volunteers and a clinical study with sevuparin in patients with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Sevuparin</title><p>Sevuparin, like other members of the chemical class of heparins, is polydisperse, encompassing a range of polysaccharide chain lengths.

Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days was not allowed.</p><p>The study was designed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of sevuparin when administered as a short (five minutes) i.v. infusions as adjunctive therapy to standard care i.e. a fixed dose combination of 1000 mg atovaquone and 400 mg proguanil (Malanil&#x000ae;) once daily for three days, in subjects affected with uncomplicated <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria, as compared to sole atovaquone/proguanil (Malanil&#x000ae;) treatment (control). An artemisinin combination therapy was not used, because the broad stage specificity and the rapid onset of action of the artemisinins prevents maturation and subsequent sequestration IEs, thus obscuring the effects of sevuparin. Subjects were treated with sevuparin during three consecutive days (12 doses, 6 hours apart). In part 1 of the study, the pharmacokinetic parameters of sevuparin were studied in cohorts of 3 patients receiving 12 consecutive i.v. infusions of 1.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg sevuparin in addition to standard of care. Doses were selected following a safety evaluation of the single dose data from the phase I study. The dose 1.5 mg/kg every six hour for three days corresponds the no observable effect level (NOEL) of sevuparin at 2 hours after treatment and is 4-fold below the dose of the 360 mg, which was well tolerated when given every six hours to healthy volunteers. The selected starting dose is also in the range of the therapeutic dose of heparin and LMWH in adults as well as in children. Taken into account the significant decreased anticoagulant potency of sevuparin compared with heparin, the dose of 1.5 mg/kg is considered to have a sufficient safety margin for the intended patient population. This dose was therefore considered justified as a safe starting dose in 18&#x02013;65 years old adults suffering from acute uncomplicated malaria disease. Subjects were enrolled in cohorts of three in each, and escalation of dose to the next cohort was determined based on evaluation of DLTs in the previous cohort, following a dose escalation strategy. After all three subjects in one cohort had been observed for a minimum of 14 days an evaluation of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was done and reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Part 2 of the study was open label and with patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio, in blocks of 10 (sequentially numbered containers), to receive either 12 consecutive i.v. infusions (6 hours apart) of sevuparin 3 mg/kg in addition to standard of care, or standard of care alone. This part of the study could only be initiated following a safety evaluation of part 1 data performed by the DSMB. The dose to be used was recommended by the DSMB due to increased, but not above stopping criteria, APTT, and no obvious improved efficacy with higher dose. Study design and dosing regimen of part 1 and part 2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188754.g002">Fig 2</xref>.</p><p>The primary endpoint of part 2 was area under the curve (AUC) of the graph plotting the throphozoite stage peripheral blood parasitemia over time of sevuparin treatment as adjunctive to atovaquone/proguanil in comparison to atovaquone/proguanil treatment alone.

AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule, differences between groups were assessed using Mann- Whitney tests. Categorical variables such as gender, blood type etc was analyzed using the Fishers exact test.

The first part included 9 patients who were administered 12 doses of sevuparin at 1.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg every 6 h for three days (three patients/ dose level). After the dose escalating part (part 1) safety data were reviewed by a data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Pre-defined stopping criteria included individual APTT &#x02265;1.5 x ULN 5 hours after dose 1 or dose 5, mean APTT in one cohort &#x02265; 3 x ULN 2 hours after dose 1 or dose 5, mean APTT in one cohort close to, or &#x02265;3 x ULN 2 hours after dose 12, or at the Investigator&#x02019;s discretion, but had not been reached in any dose group. However, as the dose 6.0 mg/kg 6 q6h did give higher APTT values than the lower doses and in one patient APTT was up to 120 seconds 1 hour after the dose (ULN = 33 sec), the DSMB considered the risk of adverse events was potentially increased and recommended that the study should continue to part 2 with 3.0 mg/kg sevuparin q6h. Forty-four patients were enrolled in the second part of this 1:1 randomized and open-label study, 21 were given i.v. sevuparin infusions in addition to the oral atovaquone/proguanil, and 23 patients were only given oral atovaquone/proguanil.

A relatively high frequency of abnormal liver transaminases and high bilirubin levels at baseline was observed and was likely due to the malaria infection and the antimalarial treatment with atovaquone/proguanil [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

The mean percentage of ring-stage IEs decreased by 50% after 8 hours of the combined sevuparin and atovaquone/proguanil treatment, whereas it took more than 13 hours for the patients in the control group to reach this level. Significant differences between the groups, as calculated by the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test, were observed at one hour (H1, p = 0.022), two hours (H2, p = 0.025), three hours (H3, p = 0.003), four hours (H4, p = 0.028) and six hours (H6, p = 0.035) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188754.g004">Fig 4A&#x02013;4C</xref>). The largest mean difference occurred at three hours after the first infusion (H3, p&#x0003c;0.005). Furthermore, the relative mean number of ring-stage IEs was also lower during the rest of the study period in the sevuparin-treated group compared to the control group, but the difference was not significant, likely due to the effect of atovaquone/proguanil on the parasites in both groups of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188754.g004">Fig 4A&#x02013;4C</xref>).

However, the late differences were not significant, likely due to the anti-parasitocidal effects of atovaquone/proguanil that start to have an influence on the parasites in both groups of patients at this time. The very first effects of artesunate are seen at four hours post-invasion, thus merozoites and very early ring-stage IE are refractory to artesunate during the first hours of hospitalization and it takes longer to obtain the full effect. Even so, the surprisingly rapid effects of sevuparin described are at place already before those of both atovaquone/ proguanil and artesunate [<xref rid="pone.0188754.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and warrant assessment of its potential as an adjunct to current treatment regimens for severe and complicated malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188754.s001"><label>S1 Supportive Information</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist resub.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188754.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188754.s002"><label>S2 Supportive Information</label><caption><title>CSRS_TSM01.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188754.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188754.s003"><label>S3 Supportive Information</label><caption><title>CSP_TSM02_V4_20120414.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188754.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188754.s004"><label>S4 Supportive Information</label><caption><title>TSM02Part1_Listings_20140501.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188754.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188754.s005"><label>S5 Supportive Information</label><caption><title>TSM02Part2_Listings_20140501.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188754.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188754.s006"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Individual total parasitemias and ring-, trophozoite- and schizont- stage IE, over the complete treatment period in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> patients treated with oral Malanil&#x000ae;
