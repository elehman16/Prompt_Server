This single blinded, dose escalating, controlled Phase 1 study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of recombinant Pfs25 and Pvs25 formulated with Montanide ISA 51, a water-in-oil emulsion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The trial was conducted at The Johns Hopkins Center for Immunization Research, Washington DC, USA, between May 16, 2005&#x02013;April 30, 2007. The trial was designed to enroll 72 healthy male and non-pregnant female volunteers into 1 group to receive adjuvant control and 6 groups to receive escalating doses of the vaccines. Due to unexpected reactogenicity, the vaccination was halted and only 36 volunteers were enrolled into 4 groups: 3 groups of 10 volunteers each were immunized with 5 &#x000b5;g of Pfs25/ISA 51, 5 &#x000b5;g of Pvs25/ISA 51, or 20 &#x000b5;g of Pvs25/ISA 51, respectively. A fourth group of 6 volunteers received adjuvant control (PBS/ISA 51). Frequent local reactogenicity was observed. Systemic adverse events included two cases of erythema nodosum considered to be probably related to the combination of the antigen and the adjuvant. Significant antibody responses were detected in volunteers who completed the lowest scheduled doses of Pfs25/ISA 51. Serum anti-Pfs25 levels correlated with transmission blocking activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>It is feasible to induce transmission blocking immunity in humans using the Pfs25/ISA 51 vaccine, but these vaccines are unexpectedly reactogenic for further development. This is the first report that the formulation is associated with systemic adverse events including erythema nodosum.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00295581">NCT00295581</ext-link>

Of the four species of malaria parasites that infect humans, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the majority of these deaths while <italic>P. vivax</italic> accounts for over 50&#x00025; of all malarial infections outside Africa as well as 10&#x00025; of those in Africa. Spreading drug resistance of the malaria parasite makes chemotherapy increasingly difficult. Alternative strategies to prevent the infection and disease spread are urgently needed.</p><p>Malaria is transmitted by <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Measures to block transmission have been integral to malaria control strategies. Use of insecticide-treated bed nets in endemic regions reduces the number of infectious bites thereby reducing morbidity and mortality <xref rid="pone.0002636-Lengeler1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Malaria transmission blocking vaccines, which target the sexual development of the parasite in the mosquito vector, could be another effective means to reduce malaria transmission. Overall, a sustained reduction in transmission, when used as a component of a control program, could contribute to sustained local elimination of the disease.</p><p>Pfs25 and Pvs25 proteins expressed on the surface of ookinetes in the mosquito stage of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>, respectively, are leading candidates for malaria transmission blocking vaccines. In animal studies, these antigens are able to generate strong transmission blocking activity <xref rid="pone.0002636-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In an early human trial volunteers were primed with NYVAC-Pf7, a viral vector expressing seven <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes including the Pfs25 gene, followed by a boosting dose with a recombinant Pfs25 protein <xref rid="pone.0002636-Kaslow1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These volunteers developed some anti-Pfs25 antibodies that had marginal activity in blocking transmission. The first human vaccine trial targeting <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria transmission tested a recombinant Pvs25 formulated with Alhydrogel. Antibodies that developed in some of these volunteers were able to significantly inhibit parasite development in mosquitoes <xref rid="pone.0002636-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, but the levels were too low for an effective vaccine.</p><p>In order to enhance the immunogenicity of Pfs25 and Pvs25, we selected Montanide ISA 51 to formulate the vaccines as water-in-oil emulsions. Montanide ISA 51 has been used as an experimental adjuvant for protein and peptide vaccines. Like Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (FIA), it is based on mineral oil with a mannide mono-oleate emulsifier. In contrast to FIA, a highly purified emulsifier is used in Montanide ISA51, thus avoiding impurities that contributed to the toxicity of some batches of FIA. It also uses a different ratio of emulsifier to oil, resulting in a more consistent and controllable emulsion <xref rid="pone.0002636-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002636-Aucouturier2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Experience in human trials indicated that Montanide ISA 51 was an effective immune enhancer and was generally well tolerated. Most reported adverse reactions were transient local reactions, including local swelling and pain with or without fever. In these studies, mild injection site nodules were reported that resolved within weeks without medical intervention <xref rid="pone.0002636-Carr1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002636-Trauger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In this paper we report the results of a Phase 1 trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the malaria transmission blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25/ISA 51 and Pvs25/ISA 51 in healthy US adults.

A hexa-His tag was added to the C-terminus of the recombinant proteins to facilitate purification and characterization. Clinical grade Pfs25 and Pvs25 were produced at the Department of Biologics Research Pilot Bioproduction Facility, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR, Silver Spring MD), under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions. Each protein was supplied in sterile solution, and underwent comprehensive quality control analyses to ensure purity, identity, and integrity.</p><p>The vaccines were formulated as previously described with slight modifications <xref rid="pone.0002636-Miles2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Briefly, the Pfs25 or Pvs25 at a concentration of 320 &#x000b5;g/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 155 mM NaCl, 1 mMKH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>3</sub>) was aseptically emulsified with an equal volume of Montanide ISA 51 to give a final vaccine concentration of 160 &#x000b5;g/mL. The emulsion was achieved by homogenizing the mixture in a volume of 200 mL in a 400-mL vessel at room temperature for 6 min at 6000 rpm using an Omni Mixer-ES homogenizer (Omni International, Warrenton, VA). Three lots of clinical grade vaccines were prepared and vialed by the Pharmaceutical Development Section, The Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health: Pfs25/ISA 51, 160 &#x000b5;g/mL; Pvs25/ISA 51, 160 &#x000b5;g/mL; and an adjuvant control vaccine containing PBS/ISA 51, with volume weighted average droplet sizes of 0.816 &#x000b5;m, 0.803 &#x000b5;m, and 0.824 &#x000b5;m, respectively.

Rabbits were selected as the model species because they produce immune responses to both vaccines, and they can be administered the full dose intended for humans by the intramuscular route. A 14-week study was performed using 84 rabbits in 4 groups. Groups 1, 2, and 3 (24 rabbits in each group, 12 males and 12 females) were each given 80 &#x000b5;g Pfs25/ISA 51 vaccine, 80 &#x000b5;g Pvs25/ISA 51 vaccine, or PBS/ISA 51 in a volume of 0.5 mL, respectively. The preclinical vaccines were prepared following the same procedures as for the clinical vaccines described above. The fourth group containing 6 male and 6 female rabbits was given PBS alone as a control. Although we planned to give human volunteers 2 vaccinations at a 4-month interval, the toxicology study design was more aggressive: each rabbit received 4 immunizations at 1-month intervals. Animals were observed during the course of the study for morbidity, mortality, general health and signs of toxicity, food consumption, body weight, clinical observations including skin and fur characteristics, eye and mucous membrane, respiratory, circulatory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor and behavior patterns, ophthalmologic examination, and dermal Draize observations. Hematology, blood chemistry, and immunological analyses were performed on days 4, 32, 60, 88 and 99 (approximately 4 days post-each immunization). Major tissues and organs were examined histologically on necropsy. Half of groups 1, 2 and 3 were sacrificed 3 days after the fourth immunization (day 88) for assessment of acute local reactogenicity. The remaining half of the three groups was sacrificed 14 days after the fourth immunization (day 99). The PBS control group was sacrificed 14 days after the fourth immunization.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention: Phase 1 Study Design</title><p>This was a partially blinded, dose escalating, controlled Phase 1 study in healthy US volunteers. The study was intended to enroll 10 volunteers in each of three dose levels (5, 20, and 80 &#x000b5;g per dose in 0.5 mL) for both vaccine candidates, and a total of 12 controls for a total of 72 volunteers. Investigators were blinded as to whether or not a volunteer received vaccine or the adjuvant control, but were aware of the dose of vaccine to be administered. Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive Pfs25/ISA 51, Pvs25/ISA 51, or PBS/ISA 51, and were sequentially assigned to higher dose groups as they were enrolled. Vaccinations were staggered within each dose cohort such that 4 volunteers were vaccinated a minimum of three weeks prior to the remaining 8 volunteers. A minimum interval of three weeks was required between completion of vaccination of the first dose cohort and start of vaccination of the next dose cohort. In addition, approval by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) was required prior to escalation to a higher dose for each vaccine. Volunteers were scheduled to receive two immunizations 4 months apart. Vaccinations were given by IM injection in the deltoid muscle, with the successive vaccination given in the alternate arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this Phase 1 trial was to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of the transmission blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pvs25, both adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 51. Secondary objectives were to assess the duration of specific antibody response over an 18 month period and to assess the effect of a second booster dose on antibody levels. Tertiary objectives were to measure the ability of vaccine-induced antibody to inhibit oocyst development in a mosquito membrane feeding assay, to determine the relationship between antibody levels and degree of transmission blocking, and to establish human standards for immune assays to be used for further development of transmission blocking vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcomes: Safety and Tolerability</title><p>Safety and tolerability outcomes were the frequency of immediate, systemic, and local adverse events, by severity and relationship to vaccine. Following each vaccination, volunteers were observed for 30 minutes for immediate adverse reactions. The follow-up visits were scheduled for days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 for evidence of local and systemic reactogenicity. Volunteers were seen again at study days 30, 60, and 90 following vaccination for evaluation of any acute complaints, local reactogenicity, and assessment of immune status. Volunteers returned on study day 120 for a second vaccination and were followed on the same schedule as described above, with the exception of the study day 90 visit. Volunteers were seen 5 months, 8 months and 12 months following second vaccination for physical evaluation and immunological assessment. Local adverse events included erythema, induration, swelling, and tenderness at the site of injection. Solicited systemic adverse events included fever (oral temperature&#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C), headache, nausea, malaise, myalgia, and arthralgia. Volunteers recorded local and systemic events daily, as well as their oral temperature three times daily, on diary cards for twenty days following each vaccination. An abbreviated history and physical examination was performed at each follow-up visit. All new or abnormal signs and symptoms were considered as adverse events. Each adverse event was graded for severity and assigned causality relative to the study vaccine. Severity was graded as either absent/none (Grade 0), mild (Grade 1, easily tolerated), moderate (Grade 2, interfered with activities of daily living), or severe (Grade 3, prevented activities of daily living). Erythema, induration, and swelling at the injection site were graded as follows: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;absent, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x02013;20 mm, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20&#x02013;50 mm, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0003e;50 mm. Fever (oral) was graded as 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0003c;37.5&#x000b0;C, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37.5&#x02013;38&#x000b0;C, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;38&#x02013;39&#x000b0;C, and 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0003e;39&#x000b0;C. A complete blood count and white blood cell differential, as well as serum creatinine and aspartate amino transferase (AST) concentrations were performed immediately prior to each vaccination and on days 3, 14, and 60 after each vaccination. A complete blood count was also obtained on day 7 following vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any adverse event resulting in death, life threatening, requiring hospitalization, resulting in disability or incapacity or congenital anomaly or birth defect, or any other event which required intervention to prevent such outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Outcomes: Immunogenicity</title><p>Anti-Pfs25 and anti-Pvs25 IgG levels induced by the vaccines were evaluated by a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure serum antibodies to Pfs25 and Pvs25 proteins <xref rid="pone.0002636-Miura2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with Pfs25 or Pvs25. Sera collected from volunteers were tested against a set of serially diluted reference standard serum.

The anti-Pfs25 reference standard serum was generated from one volunteer who developed significant antibody responses after the second immunization. These reference standards were assigned ELISA unit values equal to the reciprocal of the dilution giving an OD<sub>405nm</sub> of 1. Absorbance of the set of serially diluted reference standards was fitted to a 4-parameter hyperbolic function to generate a standard curve. Using this standard curve, the absorbance of an individual test serum was converted to an antibody unit value.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Outcomes: Transmission Blocking Activity</title><p>Transmission blocking activity (TBA) of the sera was tested by an ex vivo membrane feeding assay as described previously<xref rid="pone.0002636-Quakyi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> with following modifications: test sera were heat-inactivated and diluted with a na&#x000ef;ve human serum pool to a desired concentration.

An in vitro gametocyte culture of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (NF54 line) was evaluated for percentage of Stage V gametocytes (&#x0003e;0.5&#x00025;) and the vitality of exflagellation centers observed at 400&#x000d7; magnification. The culture pellet was diluted with normal O&#x0002b; RBC (Interstate Blood Bank, Memphis, Tennessee) and normal heat-inactivated O&#x0002b; human serum pool (Interstate Blood Bank, Memphis, Tennessee) to achieve 0.15&#x00025;&#x000b1;0.05&#x00025; concentration of Stage V gametocytes and haematocrit of 50&#x00025;.

Mosquitoes were kept for 7&#x02013;8 days after the feed at 26&#x000b0;C and high humidity conditions to allow parasites to develop into oocysts. Infectivity was measured by dissecting at least 20 mosquitoes per sample, staining the midguts with 0.05&#x00025; mercurochrome solution in water for at least 20 min, and counting the number of oocysts in each midgut. The feeding experiment was not analyzed unless the average oocyst count in mosquitoes fed with na&#x000ef;ve human serum pool was more than four. Percent inhibition of oocyst development per mosquito was determined by the formula:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002636.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>where the negative control feed used pre-vaccination sera from the same volunteer.

</p><p>In the groups receiving antigen with ISA 51, 6 volunteers experienced severe local reaction, 4 experienced moderate local reaction, and 14 experienced mild reaction (maximum severity for each). Four of six volunteers who received the control vaccine (PBS/ISA 51) complained of mild injection site pain lasting up to 4 days and two recipients reported mild erythema for one day. Local adverse events are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002636-t002">Table 2</xref>. Injection site induration began 13 to 21 days after vaccination and, in all but one volunteer, resolved within eight weeks. Induration in this volunteer slowly resolved over the course of approximately six months. The induration observed in volunteers receiving 5 &#x000b5;g dose of Pfs25/ISA 51 was much more firm than that observed in recipients of either dose of Pvs25/ISA 51.

Systemic events after one dose of 20 &#x000b5;g Pvs25/ISA 51 included two cases of erythema nodosum with associated headache, arthralgia, and myalgia, and a leukemoid reaction (described below).</p><p>
<italic>Leukemoid reactions</italic>
</p><p>Two volunteers developed leukemoid reactions during the course of this study. One volunteer in the 5 &#x000b5;g Pfs25/ISA 51 group developed a leukemoid reaction 14 days after receiving his second dose of vaccine, with a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 35,700 cells/&#x000b5;l, and an absolute neutrophil count 27,489 cells/&#x000b5;L with 2&#x00025; bands (left shift). The volunteer was clinically well, and reported that he had donated blood one day before at his workplace requiring three attempts at phlebotomy. The CBC was repeated one day later and WBC count was 14,500/&#x000b5;L. Blood cultures were also obtained and were negative; C-reactive protein (CRP) level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. The WBC count returned to baseline within one week and remained within normal limits. The volunteer remained otherwise well for the duration of the study. The leukemoid reaction was graded as possibly related to vaccination.</p><p>One volunteer in the 20 &#x000b5;g Pvs25/ISA 51 group was seen for regularly scheduled study follow up 120 days after receiving vaccination. She was clinically well at that time but her WBC count was 34,600 cells/&#x000b5;L with a left shift. The volunteer did not return to the clinic for repeat lab testing and evaluation until four weeks later, despite numerous requests. Her WBC count was repeated at that time and was normal. It remained normal on subsequent visits. This reaction was also graded as possibly related to vaccination.</p><p>
<italic>Erythema nodosum</italic>
</p><p>Two volunteers who received one dose of 20 &#x000b5;g Pvs25/ISA 51 developed erythema nodosum, both at 18 days after vaccination. One volunteer was a 25 year-old Asian female; the other was a 26 year old Caucasian female; both were taking oral contraceptives. Symptoms in the 25 year old were graded as moderate and included painful nodules on the lower legs, and erythematous macules on the arms and legs. The other volunteer had symptoms graded as severe with fever, headache, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis in addition to painful nodules on her anterior lower legs. A transient elevation of CRP occurred in both volunteers: a CRP level of 75 mg/L (upper limit of normal is &#x0003c; 8 mg/L) was seen in the volunteer with the severe reaction while the other volunteer had only a mild elevation of CRP with a value of 8 mg/L. An elevated level of complement (CH50) was also found in the volunteer with the moderate reaction. A dermatology consult was obtained and erythema nodosum-like syndrome was diagnosed in both volunteers, with skin biopsy results for the patient with the severe reaction showing non-specific panniculitis consistent with erythema nodosum. The other volunteer did not undergo a skin biopsy. The severe reaction resolved at 38 days, and the moderate reaction resolved at 12 days. Both were graded as probably related to vaccination.</p><p>This study was closed to enrollment and vaccinations were stopped due to the erythema nodosum reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b3"><title>Immunogenicity Data</title><p>Pvs25/ISA 51 group: Sixteen of the 20 volunteers, including one with a leukemoid reaction and one of the two with grade 3 induration, failed to develop detectable antibodies against Pvs25 (i.e. antibody levels were lower than 25 ELISA units, the background level) at any time during the follow-up period. The other volunteer with grade 3 induration developed measurable antibodies with a peak level of 96 units on day 120. Antibodies were first detectable at day 60, about 3 weeks following resolution of the induration. Both volunteers with erythema nodosum had detectable antibody levels starting at day 30. The volunteer with a severe reaction had a peak antibody level of 219 ELISA units on day 60, whereas the volunteer with a moderate reaction had a peak level of 583 units on day 150.

Two previous human trials with a similar recombinant Pfs25 antigen, one in which the antigen was adsorbed to Alhydrogel&#x000ae; and one where a prime/boost strategy was used, also showed an adverse event pattern limited to local reactogenicity, although one volunteer had an atypical contralateral hypersensitivity reaction thought to be due to free antigen dissociated from the alum <xref rid="pone.0002636-Kaslow1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002636-Stowers1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Due to Pfs25's poor immunogenicity and inadequate binding to Alhydrogel, a different adjuvant platform using Montanide ISA 51 was explored for its further clinical development</p><p>Montanide ISA 51 has been used as an adjuvant with investigational agents in a large number of clinical trials, with the most common adverse reactions being local injection site pain or swelling, although some studies have reported injection site nodules and sterile abscesses, <xref rid="pone.0002636-Aucouturier3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002636-Gringeri1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Other water-in-oil formulations (e.g. FIAt and Montanide ISA 720) have also occasionally caused moderate to severe local reactions, including sterile abscesses. This class of adjuvant has thus far been free of reports of severe vaccine associated-systemic reactogenicity. Since the frequency of the local reactions varies greatly according to antigen and dose, it is difficult to predict if a new antigen will give rise to an unacceptable frequency of reactogenicity. In some situations, a relatively high incidence of moderate or severe local injection site reactions may be an acceptable safety risk in a vaccine with a high benefit potential, such as with malaria vaccines <xref rid="pone.0002636-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Therefore it was considered acceptable to proceed with a Phase 1 study with staggered vaccinations, designed to allow safety assessment prior to the next dose cohort and minimize the number of severe adverse events.</p><p>Despite the lack of issues identified in preclinical studies including a toxicology study conducted in rabbits, both Pfs25/ISA 51 and Pvs25/ISA 51 proved to be quite reactogenic in humans. Two types of local reactogenicity were observed: local tenderness and swelling occurring within a few days of vaccination, and induration that occurred approximately 2 weeks after vaccination. In this study development of induration did not seem to be associated with higher antibody response whereas in previous studies, indurations tended to be associated with the subjects with the highest antibody responses <xref rid="pone.0002636-Audran1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Although indurations and other local reactogenicity were of concern, these were not regarded as severe enough to stop the trial. The trigger to cease vaccination was development of erythema nodosum like symptoms in 2 of 10 volunteers who received 20 &#x000b5;g Pvs25/ISA 51. Erythema nodosum is an inflammatory panniculitis, commonly associated with underlying systemic disease or infections such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis. It is more common in women and is also associated with the use of oral contraceptives <xref rid="pone.0002636-Requena1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Erythema nodosum has been reported in association with both plasma derived and recombinant hepatitis B vaccines, and with typhoid vaccination <xref rid="pone.0002636-Rogerson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002636-Thomson1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Given the parallel timing and presentations of these two reactions, the likelihood of a causal relationship to vaccination is high. The two leukemoid reactions were less similar in that they occurred in volunteers who received different vaccines, and one occurred 14 days after vaccination and one occurred 120 days after vaccination. However, given the absence of any other plausible explanation for these events a causal relationship is possible, and perhaps likely for the reaction which occurred 14 days after vaccination.</p><p>It is unlikely that observed systemic adverse events were associated with the antigen alone. Three cases of systemic reactions (2 erythema nodosum cases and 1 transient leukemoid case) occurred in cohorts receiving Pvs25/ISA 51 vaccine. The same production lot of Pvs25 was used to produce the Pvs25/Alhydrogel vaccine that was well tolerated in humans <xref rid="pone.0002636-Malkin4" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Both stored Pfs25/ISA 51 and Pvs25/ISA 51 vaccines met specified criteria in routine stability and potency studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002636-t001">Table 1</xref>). Combining the evidence from the literature and our observations in this trial, it seems likely that the erythema nodosum reactions and possibly the transient leukemoid reactions were related to the specific antigen/adjuvant combinations. These reactions were not predicted by the toxicity study conducted in rabbits, nor have they been seen in other trials in mice, <italic>Aotus</italic> monkeys and rhesus monkeys.</p><p>Although the trial was stopped due to adverse events, the data from volunteers receiving 2 doses of 5 &#x000b5;g Pfs25/ISA 51 clearly show that it is possible to induce antibody in humans that can effectively block parasite development in mosquitoes. The data also enabled an estimate of antibody levels (1093 with 95&#x00025; CI 683&#x02013;1565 ELISA units) required to give 50&#x00025; blockage of oocyst development. Using this figure and results from recent modeling of the impact of mosquito stage transmission blocking vaccines <xref rid="pone.0002636-Saul2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, the average antibody levels (geometric mean of 1295 units) in this dose group would correspond to a 1.5 fold decrease in inoculation rates if 90&#x00025; of the gametocyte carriers in a village were vaccinated, even though 5 &#x000b5;g was the lowest dose group in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalization</title><p>In addition to local reactogenicity, this study observed for the first time an association between systemic adverse events and a specific antigen-Montanide ISA 51 formulation. These results highlight the need for careful trial design in Phase 1 studies with novel antigen/adjuvant combinations <xref rid="pone.0002636-Saul3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The induction of transmission blocking antibodies in volunteers who received the lowest scheduled doses of Pfs25/ISA 51 demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. However, the severity and duration of the local reactions seen in this study, combined with the observed systemic reactions, make further progression of the Montanide ISA 51 formulations unlikely. Current efforts are focused on the development of a well tolerated formulation capable of inducing strong immune responses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002636.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.85 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002636.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002636.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Consort Checklist.</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002636.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank A.
