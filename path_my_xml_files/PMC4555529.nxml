The Kirschner wires were extracted after 6 weeks. Nonoperatively treated patients received a reduction splint for 4 weeks. At the 18- to 20-year follow-up, the Constant, University of California at Los Angeles Shoulder Rating Scale (UCLA), Larsen, and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores were obtained, and clinical and radiographic examinations of both shoulders were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Twenty-five of 35 potential patients were examined at the 18- to 20-year follow-up. There were 11 patients with Rockwood type III and 14 with type V dislocations. Delayed surgical treatment for ACJ was used in 2 patients during follow-up: 1 in the operatively treated group and 1 in the nonoperatively treated group. Clinically, ACJs were statistically significantly less prominent or unstable in the operative group than in the nonoperative group (normal/prominent/unstable: 9/4/3 and 0/6/3, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .02) and in the operative type III (<italic>P</italic> = .03) but not type V dislocation groups. In operatively and nonoperatively treated patients, the mean Constant scores were 83 and 85, UCLA scores 25 and 27, Larsen scores 11 and 11, and SST scores 11 and 12 at follow-up, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in type III and type V dislocations. In the radiographic analysis, the ACJ was wider in the nonoperative than the operative group (8.3 vs 3.4 mm; <italic>P</italic> = .004), and in the type V dislocations (nonoperative vs operative: 8.5 vs 2.4 mm; <italic>P</italic> = .007). There was no statistically significant difference between study groups in the elevation of the lateral end of the clavicle. Both groups showed equal levels of radiologic signs of ACJ osteoarthritis and calcification of the coracoclavicular ligaments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Nonoperative treatment was shown to produce more prominent or unstable and radiographically wider ACJs than was operative treatment, but clinical results were equally good in the study groups at 18- to 20-year follow-up.

</p><p>The nonoperative group of ACJ dislocation patients was treated using a Kenny-Howard reduction splint, which is designed to reduce the dislocated ACJ.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Today, the use of the Kenny-Howard splint has declined because of poor patient compliance and lack of evidence of its superiority in conservative treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In our study, no complications associated with the use of the reducing splint were noted, but all nonoperatively treated ACJs analyzed showed exceptionally prominent or unstable though painless joints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2325967114560130">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The Tossy classification<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> was applied in the inclusion criteria for this study. We did a post hoc analysis of the classification of the study patients using the Rockwood classification system.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The distribution of Rockwood types III and V dislocations (11 and 14, respectively) in our study was similar to the material in another study including patients with Tossy type III dislocation.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The mechanisms of injury and demographics of the ACJ dislocation patients were also analyzed and were similar to those in other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>
</p><p>The 18- to 20-year follow-up clinical examinations showed the only statistically significant differing variable to be in the palpation of the ACJ. ACJs were prominent and unstable in all (n = 9) patients in nonoperative treatment, whereas 9 of 16 operatively treated ACJ dislocations were stable on clinical examination. This is in concordance with the results of another study.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In the subgroup analysis, nonoperatively treated type III ACJ dislocations were statistically significantly more unstable and prominent, but not in the type V ACJ dislocations. However, the number of patients in these subgroups was less than 15, and given the post hoc power analysis, too small to prove statistical significance. No other variables measured were different between the treatment groups, and patients were equally satisfied when evaluated according to clinical shoulder scores. Unfortunately, no ACJ-specific scores such as the Taft or ACJ instability scores were used, nor did the authors<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> assess possible cervical and scapular problems, which have been connected to ACJ instability.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> None of the nonoperative group ACJs were painful, but 2 of the patients in the OT group had painful ACJs, both with palpation and the cross-arm test. These 2 patients in the operative group had KL 0 and KL 1 radiological osteoarthritic classifications in their ACJs and radiographically observed calcification of the AC ligaments but no osteolysis of the lateral clavicle.</p><p>In earlier follow-up studies of ACJ dislocations, a 6- to 10-year follow-up of temporary K-wire fixation in Rockwood type III injuries was reported to give good functional results. The mean Constant score was 88 in the follow-up groups of 19 patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In another recent long-term study, at least 15 years of retrospective analysis of Rockwood type V dislocations treated mainly with temporary K-wire fixation showed successful functional results and a mean CS of 90 in both the injured and uninjured contralateral shoulder.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Our result, with a mean CS of 84, is slightly lower than in the previous studies. In a long-term study by Lizaur et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> the mean UCLA scores were 31 for the injured and 32 for the uninjured shoulder; these values were also higher than in our study (mean UCLA score, 25 for operative and 27 for nonoperative groups). Mean SST values were at the same level in the study by Lizaur et al<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and in our study (11.5 vs 11, respectively). We could not find any other long-term comparative studies including groups with both operative and nonoperative treatment.</p><p>Conservative treatment was recommended for ACJ dislocation of Rockwood type I to III in several recent reviews.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> There are no long-term studies of Rockwood types IV to V dislocations including a conservative treatment group, but in 1 study with a 6-year follow-up, half of the patients (8/16) with Rockwood type IV or V dislocation who were initially treated conservatively needed late ACJ reconstruction.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In another retrospective analysis concerning Rockwood type III dislocations, conservative treatment resulted in inferior results compared with operative treatment after a mean follow-up of 36 months: The mean CS was 81 in the conservative group and 90 in the operatively treated group.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In contrast, a report exists with a 12.5-year follow-up that includes Rockwood type III ACJ dislocations treated nonoperatively with good functional results.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Our long-term results with the NOT group are in concordance with the results of Rawes and Dias.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
</p><p>The present study showed that the nonoperative treatment produced a wider ACJ space than the operative treatment, and there was also a statistically significant difference in the type V subgroups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2325967114560130">Table 5</xref>). No differences between the OT and NOT groups were found in the vertical position of the lateral end of the clavicle in long-term follow-up. There were no significant differences in ACJ osteoarthrosis, osteolysis of the lateral clavicle, or calcinosis of CC ligaments between the study groups in either the injured or the contralateral noninjured shoulder (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2325967114560130">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Both treatment methods showed a statistically significant radiographic rise of the lateral clavicle when compared with the uninjured ACJ. Obviously, temporary fixation of the ACJ with Kirschner wire was insufficient to restore normal acromioclavicular stability, and an anatomical method of reconstruction may yield different, more satisfying anatomic results.</p><p>In our study, complications were more common in the OT group than in the NOT group, but the difference was not statistically significant. In another study with a short follow-up,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> the most common complications in the operative treatment group were pin migration and unattractive scar, and in the NOT group, all patients were considered to have deformity in the ACJ. In our study, we did not define ACJ deformity as a complication, but using this definition from the other study,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> all the patients in the NOT group could be described as having a complication of ACJ deformity. However, the deformity did not bother the patients at long-term follow-up. The complication of pin migration was common in our study as in other studies concerning this surgical method of ACJ reconstruction.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><sec id="section8-2325967114560130"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strengths of this study are its prospective and randomized setup, long follow-up, and comparison groups of OT and NOT methods. Follow-up analysis was strictly conducted.</p><p>There are some limitations to the study. The study was underpowered and therefore unable to yield definitive evidence for differences in the treatment groups. The inclusion criteria included all Tossy type III dislocations, meaning variable types of ACJ injuries (Rockwood types III and V), which reduces the subgroups and obscures analysis of the results. Stress panorama views, which have been proposed to better indicate the different classes of ACJ dislocation,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967114560130" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> were not performed in our study. The shoulder scores selected for this study may not be sensitive for disorders of the ACJ, and other scores such as the Taft or ACJ instability scores developed specifically for ACJ pathology may have indicated more evident differences between the study groups.</p><p>We were unable to examine all patients who were eligible, and so there is a risk of selection bias. Ten of 35 (29%) potential patients were lost to follow-up. Most of these (8/10) were from the nonoperative group. Three patients could be contacted and did not have complaints about their injured shoulder. Seven of 10 could not be contacted at all in spite of repeated invitations to the follow-up visit.</p><p>There is no published material on this trial from earlier follow-up time points. The follow-up data were inadequate to include early and mid-term results for this study report. There is therefore a possibility of differences in the results between the study groups in earlier phases, but this cannot be confirmed from our material.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section9-2325967114560130"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rockwood types III and V ACJ dislocation treatment with either operative K-wire fixation and coracoacromial ligament suturing or nonoperative treatment gave good long-term functional results. Nonoperative treatment more frequently produced a bony prominence or unstable ACJ still detectable 18 years after injury, but with no additional functional disability for the patient. Further level 1 studies with larger samples of patient material, specifically planned inclusion criteria, anatomic reconstruction techniques, and well-conducted follow-up are needed to determine the optimal treatment method for high-grade ACJ dislocations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-2325967114560130" fn-type="conflict"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: A.J. was supported by a grant from the Research Fund of Kuopio University Hospital District (EVO-grant).</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank research nurse Marja-Liisa Sutinen for her invaluable assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2325967114560130"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
