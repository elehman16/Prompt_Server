patients fail to respond to or cannot tolerate oral iron. This double-blind safety and efficacy
study of the intravenous (IV) iron, ferumoxytol, randomized patients with a history of
unsatisfactory oral iron therapy, or in whom oral iron could not be used, to ferumoxytol
(<italic>n</italic> = 609) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 203). The proportion of
patients achieving the primary endpoint (hemoglobin increase &#x02265;2.0 g/dL at Week 5) was
81.1% with ferumoxytol versus 5.5% with placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).
The mean increase in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5, a secondary endpoint (also the alternative
preplanned primary efficacy endpoint for other health authorities), was 2.7 versus 0.1 g/dL
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Achievement of a hemoglobin &#x02265;12 g/dL, time to a
hemoglobin increase &#x02265;2.0 g/dL, and improvement in the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy Fatigue score also significantly favored ferumoxytol over placebo at Week 5
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Ferumoxytol treatment-emergent adverse events were mainly mild
to moderate. Ferumoxytol was effective and well tolerated in patients with IDA of any underlying
cause in whom oral iron was ineffective or could not be used. This trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as #NCT01114139.

to be one of the most common types of anemia. Blood loss from chronic gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding
is the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in men and postmenopausal women <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Patients with abnormal
uterine bleeding (AUB), postpartum blood loss, GI disorders, and cancer commonly present with IDA
due to a number of pathophysiological processes, including blood loss, malabsorption, inadequate
intake, and inflammatory disease <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Anemia impacts patients' quality of life and is associated with a variety of
well-recognized clinical consequences, including fatigue, low energy, exercise intolerance,
decreased physical functioning, decreased vitality, feeling cold, reduced cognitive abilities, and
cardiac dysfunction <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, as well as increased hospitalizations, blood transfusions, operative morbidity, and

respond adequately to this therapy, or frequently they do not tolerate oral iron and withdraw from
therapy <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In
addition, oral iron absorption is reduced in many patient populations, such as those with cancer,
chronic inflammatory disease, or infection <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p><p>When oral iron therapy fails, treatment with intravenous (IV) iron should be considered. While
several IV irons have been used in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those on
dialysis, at the time of the study iron dextran was the only IV iron product indicated for the
treatment of iron deficiency in patients for whom oral iron is unsatisfactory, including those
without CKD. Unfortunately, healthcare providers may be reluctant to use the iron dextrans to treat
these patients because of the risk of life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, the limitation to low
individual doses (100 mg), and the requirement for a test dose <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Thus, there is an unmet need for
additional therapies to replenish iron stores in these patients with IDA who cannot tolerate oral
iron.</p><p>Ferumoxytol (Feraheme&#x000ae;, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA) is a colloidal iron oxide,
coated with a semisynthetic carbohydrate specifically designed to minimize immunological reactivity.
In addition, ferumoxytol has been formulated to be isotonic, eliminating the disadvantages of high
osmolality and the need for a prolonged, diluted infusion <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>Ferumoxytol was approved in June 2009 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of IDA in adults with CKD <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Two Phase 3 trials
evaluating ferumoxytol for the treatment of IDA in adults who have a history of unsatisfactory oral
iron therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used have been completed, and a supplemental new drug
application has been submitted to the FDA. Here, we present the results of one of these trials
comparing ferumoxytol to placebo. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of a 1.02-g course of IV ferumoxytol administered as two doses for the treatment of IDA in
patients with IDA of any cause. The effect of ferumoxytol on patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
compared with placebo was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients, Materials, and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter global clinical study was
conducted at 182 sites in Canada, Hungary, India, Latvia, Poland, and the United States between June
2010 and February 2012 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier:
NCT01114139). The study consisted of a screening period of up to 2 weeks followed by a 5-week
treatment period. The 5-week treatment period consisted of six study visits: Day 1 (Baseline, dose
1), Week 1 (dose 2; 2&#x02013;8 days postdose 1), and weekly thereafter to Week 5. The study was
conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and in compliance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the ethics committee or institutional
review board of each participating center before the commencement of the study. All patients
provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were men and women &#x02265;18 years of age with a history of IDA, defined as a
hemoglobin (Hgb) level &#x0003c;10.0 g/dL and a transferrin saturation (TSAT) &#x0003c;20%, and
a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used. Serum ferritin
was not utilized as an entry criterion, because, although indicative of iron deficiency if low, for
example, &#x0003c;100 ng/mL, it is an acute-phase reactant and may be artifactually elevated in the
face of inflammation. Patients were not eligible for participation if they had a history of allergy
to IV iron, a Hgb level &#x02264;7.0 g/dL<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>, serum ferritin
&#x0003e;600 ng/mL, known causes of anemia other than iron deficiency, active infection, hematologic
malignancies, were on dialysis or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;30 mL/min/1.73
m<sup>2</sup>, or were pregnant, intended to become pregnant, or were breastfeeding. Patients who
received another investigational agent or IV iron therapy within 4 weeks of screening or who had
received oral iron therapy or blood transfusion within 2 weeks before screening were also
excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Study medication</title><p>Patients were randomized using an Interactive Voice Randomization System in a 3:1 ratio to
receive either parenteral ferumoxytol (1.02-g course) or placebo, and were stratified by Baseline
Hgb level (&#x0003e;7.0 to &#x02264;8.5 g/dL; &#x0003e;8.5 to &#x0003c;10.0 g/dL) and by categories of
underlying condition (AUB, cancer, GI disorders, postpartum anemia, and Other [included
patients with nutritional iron deficiency, heart failure, and/or rheumatoid arthritis]).</p><p>Patients received an IV injection of either ferumoxytol 510 mg (17 mL) or normal saline,
administered as a rapid IV injection in under 1 min at Baseline (Day 1), with a second dose
2&#x02013;8 days later. Blinding was accomplished by having both ferumoxytol and normal saline
administered in a shrouded manner by an unblinded Test Article Administrator, while both study
participants and all other study staff including the investigator were blinded to what was
administered. In addition, investigators and their staff were blinded to the results of laboratory
test results that could potentially unblind treatment. Ferumoxytol for IV injection was supplied by
AMAG Pharmaceuticals, (Lexington, MA) and normal saline for IV injection was supplied by Hospira,
Inc. (Lake Forest, IL).</p></sec><sec><title>Study endpoints and assessments</title><sec><title>Primary efficacy endpoints and assessments</title><p>Blood samples to assess Hgb were performed at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5 and
were blinded to the study staff. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients
achieving a Hgb increase of &#x02265;2.0 g/dL at any time from Baseline to Week 5. To meet the
requests of different health authorities, an additional alternative efficacy analysis was conducted.
The primary efficacy endpoint for the alternative efficacy analysis was the mean change in Hgb from
Baseline to Week 5.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary efficacy endpoints and assessments</title><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving a Hgb level &#x02265;12
g/dL at any time from Baseline to Week 5, the mean change in TSAT from Baseline to Week 5, and the
time to Hgb increase of &#x02265;2.0 g/dL or to &#x02265;12 g/dL from Baseline. All efficacy endpoints
were obtained at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5. PROs included the mean change from Baseline
to Week 5 in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale
score (obtained at Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), and the Vitality domain of the
Short-Form-General Health Survey (SF-36) <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and the Energy
domain of the Linear Analogue Scale Assessment (QOL LASA) (obtained at Baseline and Weeks 3 and
5).</p><p>Subgroup analyses included an assessment of efficacy (i.e., the proportion of patients achieving
a &#x02265;2.0 g/dL increase in Hgb at any time from Baseline to Week 5; mean change in Hgb from
Baseline to Week 5) among patients with various underlying disorders (i.e., AUB, cancer, GI
disorders, postpartum anemia, and Other).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety endpoints and assessments</title><p>Patients in both treatment groups were closely monitored for 60 min following IV study drug
administration for adverse events (AEs). The primary safety analysis was a descriptive comparison of
AEs experienced by patients in both the ferumoxytol and placebo groups. Safety data included AEs,
clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examinations, and vital signs. AEs were assessed by the
investigators for severity (mild, moderate, and severe) and potential relationship to study
medication. AEs were considered &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d; if they resulted in death, were
life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization or persistent or significant disability or incapacity,
or were considered an important medical event, that is, one that was not immediately
life-threatening but clearly jeopardized the subject and/or required intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Determination of sample size</title><p>A sample size of 800 patients (600 exposed to ferumoxytol and 200 exposed to placebo) provided
99% power for the assessment of superiority of ferumoxytol to placebo, assuming a two-sided
<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of 0.05, a placebo efficacy rate of 20%, and a ferumoxytol efficacy
rate of 60% for the difference between treatment groups. A sample size of 600 patients
exposed to ferumoxytol was calculated as sufficient to identify possible key safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) Population (the primary efficacy analysis population) included any
randomized patients with exposure to study drug (ferumoxytol or placebo) by randomized treatment
assignment. The Safety Population included all randomized patients who received study drug based on
actual treatment. The two populations were identical in this study. For the primary efficacy
endpoint and other categorical endpoints, the <italic>P</italic> value was calculated using a
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusted for Baseline Hgb level and underlying condition. Statistical
significance (and superiority) was established if the <italic>P</italic> value was &#x02264;0.05.
Continuous efficacy endpoints were calculated using an analysis of covariance model, adjusted for
Baseline Hgb level and underlying condition. Statistical significance was established if the
<italic>P</italic> value was &#x02264; 0.05.</p><p>All data were analyzed by representatives of the clinical and biostatistical groups of AMAG
Pharmaceuticals. All authors had access to the clinical trial data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>A total of 812 patients were randomized (ferumoxytol, <italic>n</italic> = 609; placebo,

patients (ferumoxytol, <italic>n</italic> = 608; placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 200).
Details of patient disposition and patient flow are summarized in the figure in the Supporting

(three [0.5%] patients) in the ferumoxytol group and anemia (three
[1.5%] patients) in the placebo group, occurred in single subjects. There was
no clustering of SAEs to suggest a safety signal. Reported treatment-related SAEs were those known
to be associated with the class of IV iron products, and included one (0.2%)
ferumoxytol-treated patient with an anaphylactic reaction and three (0.5%)

signs/symptoms of hypotension or hypersensitivity associated with IV iron use, were identified in

patients (ferumoxytol, 3.6%; placebo, 1.0%); most were mild-to-moderate in intensity,
with two meeting serious criteria. Most of these AESIs were considered related to study medication
and all resolved with treatment. A Composite Cardiovascular Adverse Event Endpoint was predefined
and specifically included nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, moderate-to-severe
hypertension, and hospitalization due to any cardiovascular event. Six events were reported in five

reported in more than a single ferumoxytol-treated patient was hypertension (two events in two

in the placebo group (malignant lung neoplasm). All deaths occurred more than 35 days post-treatment
and none were considered by investigators to be related to the study drug. Evaluation of clinical
chemistries and vital signs did not demonstrate any relevant clinical differences between the two
treatment groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Oral iron is the traditional first-line treatment for patients with IDA. However, oral iron is
poorly absorbed and some patients have an inadequate response or intolerance to oral iron, resulting
in treatment noncompliance and discontinuation due to adverse effects. IV iron therapy is therefore
an important treatment option for such patients. However, the only currently approved products for
patients with IDA who do not have CKD are the IV iron dextrans, which have a boxed warning <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Although off-label
administration of the dextrans is at times accomplished by means of a slow infusion over 1&#x02013;4
hr <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, the individual daily dose of the dextrans is limited,
per the prescribing information, to 100 mg or less because of their safety profiles, thereby
requiring multiple doses (&#x02265;10) to administer a full 1-g treatment course. The need for
repeated dosing with the iron dextrans potentially increases patients' exposure risk <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, lowers treatment compliance <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, and leads to greater nursing time and higher administration costs <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. This has likely further limited their use in patients in whom oral
administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. Thus, there is an unmet need for additional
therapies to replenish iron stores in these patients with IDA who cannot tolerate oral iron.</p><p>In this Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, ferumoxytol 1.02 g,
delivered as two doses of 510 mg, was shown to be well tolerated and effective in correcting anemia
in a relatively short time in adults with IDA and a history of unsatisfactory response to oral iron
therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used. That ferumoxytol was superior to placebo was
demonstrated by the fact that &#x0003e;80% of ferumoxytol-treated patients achieved the
primary efficacy endpoint (proportion of patients with a &#x02265;2.0 g/dL in Hgb at any time from
Baseline to Week 5), which was &#x0223c;15-fold that seen with placebo (5.5%). The ferumoxytol
group also had a superior increase in mean Hgb levels from Baseline to Week 5 (2.7 g/dL) compared
with the placebo group (0.1 g/dL). Superiority was consistently demonstrated for ferumoxytol at all
secondary endpoints, providing further corroboration of its therapeutic efficacy and treatment
benefit for patients with IDA with a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom oral
iron cannot be used.</p><p>The clinical benefit of ferumoxytol treatment was further supported by the consistent, positive
results from multiple PRO tools. Ferumoxytol reduced fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) and increased both
vitality (SF-36-Vitality) and energy (LASA-Energy) in parallel with the rise in Hgb levels. The
improvements from Baseline to Week 5 were clinically meaningful and exceeded the minimall important
differences (MID) previously reported for these measures <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. For the LASA Energy domain, a previously
estimated value for the MID was 9.81 <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. For the SF-36
Vitality domain, a difference of 5.0 points has been indicated as the MID, and for the SF-36
Vitality domain, a decrease of 5&#x02013;10 points has been correlated with an increased risk of
negative outcomes <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that the therapeutic usefulness of ferumoxytol may extend beyond
its currently approved indication (i.e., the treatment of IDA in adults with CKD) to the broader
population of patients with IDA with a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom oral
iron cannot be used <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>.</p><p>Overall, this study demonstrated that ferumoxytol was well tolerated in this population of
patients with IDA, with the types and incidence rates of TEAEs consistent with those reported in
previous studies. No new safety signals were identified and the majority of reported TEAEs were
mild-to-moderate in intensity. The safety profile of ferumoxytol was shown to be generally
comparable to placebo. As with all IV iron products, serious hypersensitivity (0.3%) and
anaphylactic reactions (0.2%) were reported. However, these responded to standard medical
therapy and resolved without sequelae. No serious hypotensive reactions were reported with
ferumoxytol.</p><p>In this study, a full 1.02-g treatment course of ferumoxytol was administered with only two
injections of 510 mg each in 17 mL over a short time frame (each injection took 17&#x02013;60 sec),
with no requirement for the administration of a test dose and no need for premedication. In
contrast, boxed safety warnings for iron dextran require the administration of a test dose and there
is a limitation on the daily therapeutic dose that can be administered (&#x02264;100 mg/day). This
results in the need for multiple office visits (as many as 10 visits) and repeated IV placements to
administer the typical 1-g therapeutic dose of iron dextran. In contrast, ferumoxytol offers the
ability to deliver the total 1.02-g dose with two clinic visits, possibly improving treatment
compliance <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, efficiency, and cost savings <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Being able to deliver the full therapeutic course in two doses
also has the potential to reduce patient exposure to the risk of AEs that exist with each individual
IV administration <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. The ability to administer 510 mg of
iron in a single dose and the low rate of AEs observed in this study suggest that ferumoxytol may
offer advantages over IV iron dextrans, which are the only IV iron formulations currently approved
in the US for the treatment of IDA of any cause. This study further demonstrated the symptomatic
improvement of patients treated with ferumoxytol, with a reduction in fatigue and increases in
vitality, energy, and quality of life as assessed with PRO instruments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this large Phase 3 study, ferumoxytol was shown to be well tolerated and effective in patients
