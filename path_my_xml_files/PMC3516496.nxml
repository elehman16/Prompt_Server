Limbal hyperemia remained mild at visit 2 in both eyes. No bacteria were recovered from either eye at visit 2 or visit 3. At visit 3, bulbar conjunctival injection was absent in both eyes, although ocular discharge remained mild in both eyes. No adverse events were reported at any study visit. Visual acuity worsened to 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS at visit 2 improving to 20/50 OD and 20/30 OS at visit 3. There were no changes in fundus pathology findings at visit 3. The patient exited the study with no follow-up needed.</p><p>Case 5 was a 2-year-old white, non-Hispanic male with a history of amoxicillin allergy. At baseline, he presented with ocular discharge characterized as severe in both eyes and bulbar conjunctival injection of moderate severity in both eyes. In addition, moderate lid hyperemia and mild lid swelling was observed in both eyes. Baseline ophthalmoscopy did not reveal any fundus pathology. The young age of the patient prevented measurement of visual acuity, but the child could fix and follow in both eyes. Baseline conjunctival specimens yielded <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (50 cfu/mL) from the right eye; no bacteria were recovered from the left eye. The patient was randomized to bilateral treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% twice daily for 3 days. By visit 2, both ocular discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection was absent OU with no further biomicroscopy findings. Conjunctival samples taken at visit 2 and visit 3 failed to recover any bacterial pathogens in either eye. No adverse events were reported at any study visit, visual acuity did not change from baseline at any follow-up visit, and visit 3 ophthalmoscopy findings remained unremarkable.</p></sec><sec><title>Integrated clinical outcomes</title><p>Clinical outcome data for the five patients with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections at baseline randomized to treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension were integrated.

As expected, few patients (n = 9) had infections due to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at baseline, resulting in an incidence rate of 0.7% across four clinical studies in bacterial conjunctivitis, lower than rates reported by Cavuoto et al (4.5%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-6-1987">8</xref> and Adebayo et al (4.8%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-6-1987">9</xref> These latter studies were retrospective analyses using banked isolates collected during routine medical practice and likely limited to infections of relatively greater clinical severity, with resulting smaller isolate &#x0201c;denominators&#x0201d; for frequency calculations. In contrast, the current analysis was based on prospective, multicenter studies in which all conjunctivitis infections were cultured.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-opth-6-1987">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-opth-6-1987">29</xref> Few patients with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections at baseline were infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> only. Concurrent bacterial pathogens at baseline included <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-6-1987">Table 1</xref>). Two additional patients developed infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at follow-up visits, one with unilateral conjunctivitis treated with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% for a <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and one with bilateral conjunctivitis treated with besifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.6% for an <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection. These findings suggest that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may have been opportunistic in these individuals. The MIC<sub>90</sub> for besifloxacin against all 11 isolates was 2 &#x003bc;g/mL, well below reported mean besifloxacin concentrations in human tears following a single topical ocular administration (610 &#x003bc;g/g 10 minutes following administration and remaining over 10 &#x003bc;g/g at 12 hours following administration).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-opth-6-1987">32</xref></p><p>Five patients with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections at baseline were randomized to treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6%. Patient ages ranged from 2 years to 81 years, three were female and two were male, and the severity of conjunctivitis was moderate on average. Eradication of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cultured at baseline was achieved by the first follow-up visit in all five patients treated with besifloxacin. The first follow-up visit occurred on day 5 &#x000b1; 1 in the studies with 5-day three times daily treatment regimens and on day 4 or 5 in the study with a 3-day twice-daily treatment regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-6-1987">Figure 1</xref>).

Clinical resolution, which has been reported to be delayed compared with bacterial eradication,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-opth-6-1987">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-6-1987">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-opth-6-1987">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-opth-6-1987">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-opth-6-1987">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-opth-6-1987">44</xref> was achieved in two of five (40%) patients by the first follow-up visit and four of five (80%) patients by the second follow-up visit. Treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% did not present any safety concerns in these five patients. There were no adverse events reported in any of these patients. No patient had an increase in severity of any biomicroscopy findings. There were no incident fundus pathologies in any of the patients, and visual acuity was the same or improved relative to baseline. Although not the focus of this study, comparative outcomes among non-besifloxacin-treated patients with baseline <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection are worthy of mention, of which there were four such cases. Three patients randomized to treatment with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% all achieved bacterial eradication by the first follow-up visit, while the one patient randomized to treatment with vehicle (formulation without active) failed to achieve bacterial eradication. Clinical resolution was observed in one moxifloxacin-treated patient at the first follow-up visit and in two of three patients at the final follow-up visit.</p><p>There are few reports in the literature on the treatment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ocular infections with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6%. Michaud reported successful use of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension in the treatment of a corneal ulcer due to presumed <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection in a 33-year-old North African soft contact lens wearer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-opth-6-1987">45</xref> Aggressive treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension (hourly for the first 2 days during waking hours, every 3 hours overnight along with ciprofloxacin ointment, tapered thereafter) led to a full recovery by the patient. Turaka et al described the successful use of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension in the treatment of a 75-year-old woman with giant fornix syndrome and a soft contact lens lodged in the upper fornix.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-opth-6-1987">46</xref> She had dry eye symptoms and a history of chronic conjunctivitis in the right eye. Blepharitis, diffuse mucoid discharge, conjunctival injection, and follicular and papillary reaction were observed OD and a conjunctival culture grew <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Upper eyelid eversion revealed a soft contact lens lodged in the upper fornix, a thick pseudomembrane, and a deep superior conjunctival fornix. She had diffuse superficial punctate keratitis in the right eye. Following removal of the contact lens and debris, she was treated with topical besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension (dose regimen not stated). One month later, her visual acuity had improved to normal and she was free of infection. Finally, Sanders et al reported a reduction in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cfus in rabbit models of keratitis induced by quinolone-susceptible or quinolone-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-opth-6-1987">47</xref> In these models, keratitis was induced by intrastromal injection with 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/eye quinolone-susceptible or quinolone-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> into rabbit corneas, and the rabbits were treated 16 hours later with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% or a comparator antimicrobial every 15 minutes for 5 doses and then every 30 minutes for 14 doses. Control animals were treated with phosphate-buffered saline. None of the active treatments produced a significant reduction in clinical severity of infection. However, treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension resulted in a 72% reduction of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> cfus in the cornea in the quinolone-susceptible <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> model and a 61% reduction in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> cfus in the cornea in the quinolone-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> model compared with treatment with phosphate-buffered saline (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 for both).</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this post hoc analysis show that while the incidence of bacterial conjunctivitis due to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was low across four bacterial conjunctivitis studies, treatment of patients with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections using besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% led to bacterial eradication of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by the first follow-up visit and high rates of clinical resolution by the second follow-up visit. These results are consistent with previous reports on the use of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension for the treatment of ocular infections due to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and suggest that besifloxacin may be an appropriate choice for ocular surface infections with this pathogen, although large, prospective studies are needed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-opth-6-1987"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This post hoc analysis was sponsored by Bausch and Lomb Inc, which designed and conducted the original studies.
