The basic material for the bulk of daily diagnostic work in a pathology laboratory is the paraffin section, usually stained with H and E.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] H and E is a universal stain and is a primary contrast method in medical diagnosis of biopsy specimen. H and E staining is remarkably robust. It is used to discriminate between a broad range of cytoplasmic, nuclear and extracellular matrix features.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] This staining procedure has remained unchanged for over 150 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Apart from hematoxylin and eosin, the components in the H and E staining procedure are the xylene and graded alcohols. These chemicals are used to carry out the intermediate steps of rehydration and dehydration of tissue sections during the staining. The lacunae however that continue to persist in this age-old procedure are the cost containment, toxicity, problem of disposal of the hazardous chemicals; xylene and methanol, and a polluted working environment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Exposure to xylene in a laboratory occurs during tissue processing, deparaffinization of tissue sections, cover slipping, cleaning tissue processors and recycling. Exposure to methanol occurs during tissue processing and dewaxing the sections before staining.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>In the quest to eliminate the use of xylene from the laboratory, numerous substitute chemicals like limonene reagents, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, vegetable oils, olive oil, and mineral oil substitutes have been utilized. However, these chemicals were used to substitute xylene as a clearing agent during routine processing, while the exposure and handling of xylene is maximum during dewaxing of the tissue sections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Basic aim in any field of life sciences is to utilize eco-friendly chemicals which are nontoxic, less biohazardous, and are economical. Liquid dish washing soap (DWS) forms a part of the day-to-day household job. It is a detergent liquid used to clean the greasy utensils in a kitchen.</p><p>The innovative concept of using liquid dish washing detergent to dewax the tissue sections by eliminating both xylene as well as alcohol from the staining task was experimented by Falkeholm <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aim</title><p>Therefore, an experimental, cross-sectional study was carried out,</p><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was carried out in the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. Sixty paraffin blocks of the routine biopsy specimen were retrieved from the Department.</p><p>Two paraffin sections of 4 microns each were cut from each of the 60 paraffin blocks of routinely processed tissue specimen. One was stained with the conventional (routine) H and E staining method. The standard time period of the H and E staining procedure ranges from 70 to 75 minutes [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] and the other section was stained with the XMF H and E staining method. This H and E staining procedure is completed in 30 to 35minutes [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Thus, a total of 120 sections were studied.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Routine (conventional) H and E staining procedure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOMFP-15-161-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Xylene and alcohol free H and E staining procedure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOMFP-15-161-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Sixty tissue sections stained with conventional H and E&#x02014;(Group A) and 60 sections stained with the XMF method&#x02014;(Group B) were coded.

Each section was scored and analyzed by a single oral pathologist who was blinded.</p><p>H and E-stained sections were graded based on the parameters of nuclear staining (Adequate = score 1, Inadequate = 0), cytoplasmic staining (Adequate = score 1, Inadequate = score 0), clarity of staining (Present = score 1, absent = score 0), uniformity of staining (Present = score 1, absent = score 0), and crispness of staining (Present = score 1, absent = score 0). The scores for each slide were totalled. A score of &#x02265; 2 was graded as inadequate for diagnosis, slides with score 3-5 were assigned as adequate for diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Adequate nuclear staining was noted in 96.66% of sections of group A as compared with 98.33% in Group B (Z = 0.59, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>], adequate cytoplasmic staining was noted in 93.33% of sections in group A as compared with 83.33% in Group B (Z = 1.97, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>], clarity was present in 85% of group A and in 88.33% of group B sections (Z = 0.27, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>], uniform staining was present in 70% of group A and in 50% of group B (Z = 1.94, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>], and a crisp staining was seen in 76.66% of sections in group A as compared with 83.33% in Group B (Z = 1.98, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>].

The historical use of xylene in the histology laboratory is an example of a failed substitution. Starting as the safest alternative to dangerous chemicals such as aniline oil, benzene, chloroform, dioxane, and toluene in the 1950s, by the 1970, there were great concerns about its safety. Toxic effects of xylene include acute neurotoxicity, cardiac and kidney injuries, fatal blood dyscrasias, skin erythema, drying, scaling, and secondary infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Methanol is also known to be toxic. The knowledge of xylene toxicity resulted in 41% of US histology laboratories to use xylene substitutes. Countries like US have provisions like OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist). These bodies have established standards for biological exposure limits, for monitoring exposure and managing the disposal and recycling of xylene.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, in most of the developing countries, especially in India, we find no such provisions. The institutional and private pathology laboratories in developing countries have neither any mechanism for monitoring the exposure nor any standardized methods for disposal of xylene.</p><p>Therefore, any technique that minimizes the use of xylene by using non-biohazardous substitutes, reduces staining time, and does not compromise the staining quality will be very valuable for diagnostic reasons as well as for maintaining a healthy laboratory environment, thereby minimizing the risk to the laboratory personell. Thus, in an effort to improve the working conditions in a histopathology laboratory, we investigated the less toxic, cheap, easily available diluted liquid DWS as a deparaffinizing agent for H and E staining method.</p><p>The results showed that of the 60 sections studied, 98.33% of the Group B (XMF) slides showed adequate nuclear staining as compared with 96.66% of the conventional H and E [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The difference was not statistically significant (Z = 0.59, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) suggesting that there was no difference in the two staining methods in producing adequate nuclear staining [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Graph 1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 1</xref>]. The nuclear staining in the xylene-free staining method was done using Mayer's hematoxylin. Commercially available Mayer's hematoxylin (Yucca Diagnostics, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India) was used. It is a progressive stain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Progressive staining can be easily controlled, with less chances of overstaining. There is no differentiation required (thereby saving time) unlike with the regressive hematoxylin stains like Harri's and Delafield's hematoxylin. Moreover, incomplete differentiation following regressive staining can result in inadequate cytoplasmic staining due to the binding of aluminium hematin in the cytoplasm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The degree of crispness of nuclear staining with Mayer's was found to be nearly equivalent to Harri's hematoxylin.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Graph 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of adequacy of nuclear staining in group A and B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOMFP-15-161-g009"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Photomicrograph showing adequacy and clarity of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (a) Routine H and E staining, (H and E, 100&#x000d7;), (b) Xylene- and alcohol-free H and E staining, (H and E, 100&#x000d7;)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOMFP-15-161-g010"/></fig><p>83.33% of XF sections had adequately stained cytoplasm as compared with the 93.33% of the conventional H and E sections (Z = 1.97, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. A statistically significant downgradation of cytoplasmic staining was noted in the xylene-free H and E-stained sections [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Graph 2</xref>]. Commercially available water-soluble 1% Eosin Y (Yucca Diagnostics, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India) was used with the XMF staining. Eosin Y brought out the maximum details of the cytoplasm in 50 of 60 XMF sections studied [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 1</xref>]. Ten sections showed a deteriorated cytoplasmic stain. The sections appeared bluish [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 2a</xref>]. Eosin is an acidic dye with optimum staining occurring at a pH of 5.2 to 5.4. It will rinse out in any alkaline solution.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The pH of eosin was found to be adequate. The other sources of alkalinity was the tap water wash used before and after the eosin staining step. Therefore, the tap water was analyzed for the pH. It had a pH of 7.01. Lithium carbonate was another source of alkalinity. Increase of alkalinity had probably resulted in eosin being washed out, resulting in a light staining. The pH of tap water was found to be adequate for bluing and hence lithium carbonate was eliminated. This resulted in overcoming this problem.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Graph 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of adequacy of cytoplasmic staining in group A and B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOMFP-15-161-g011"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Photomicrograph showing (a) deterioration of cytoplasmic staining in (10 of 60) xylene- and alcohol-free sections.

No statistically significant difference was noted in the two staining methods followed, suggesting that the XMF H and E are at par with conventional H and E in producing clarity in staining [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Graph 3</xref>]. Xylene is a known carcinogen with numerous biotoxic effects. Histology, however, continues to use large quantities of organic solvents and remains a major producer of organic solvent effluent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The diluted liquid DWS is an extremely cheap, nontoxic substitute for xylene. It is readily available in any stationery stores. The liquid DWS is composed of sodium laureth sulfate, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, cocamidopropyl betaine, and nonionic surfactants. These components are anionic surfactants commonly used in detergent soaps and shampoos.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] These chemicals form a part of the products which are used daily. Their concentration in these products is already well monitored by the manufacturing companies. Moreover, we are diluting only 25 ml of the liquid DWS in 1 500 ml of distilled water. Thus, there are meager chances of this product being toxic to the laboratory personnel.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Graph 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of clarity of staining in group A and B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOMFP-15-161-g013"/></fig><p>The uniformity of the stained section was downgraded significantly in the XMF sections as compared with the conventional H and E sections (70%) (Z = 1.94, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). This was shown in the results which showed only 50% of the XMF sections to be uniformly stained [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Graph 4</xref>]. Out-of-focus areas seen in the section compromised the uniformity. This was a consistent problem encountered as seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 2b</xref>. Out-of-focus areas can be due to the reasons like tear or rip of section, introduction of extraneous tissue, unclean blade, dirty microscopic lenses, thick section, and moisture on coverslip.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] All of these reasons were ruled out. Careful scrutiny and retrospective analysis of the staining procedure led to an important conclusion that the xylene-free staining procedure is highly temperature sensitive. The diluted 1.7% liquid DWS-I and II and the distilled water I and II had to be strictly maintained at 90&#x000b0;C. A slight drop in the temperature failed to deparaffinize the sections completely. This resulted in microscopic amounts of residual wax on the tissue sections that resulted in out-of-focus areas.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Graph 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of uniformity of staining in group A and B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOMFP-15-161-g014"/></fig><p>83.33% of the XMF sections revealed a crisp staining as compared with 76.66% of the conventional H and E stain [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>].

The combination of 1.7% liquid DWS along with water-soluble Mayer's hematoxylin and eosin Y brings about an ideal degree of crispness. Deparaffinization with diluted liquid DWS is achieved in only 4 minutes unlike 20 minutes required for deparaffinization with xylene and alcohol in the routine H and E staining.
