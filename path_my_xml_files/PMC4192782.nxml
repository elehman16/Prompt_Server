Icter happens when liver cannot pick enough amount bilirobin from the plasma, which may be due to high bilirobin Production (generally because of increased hemoglobin degradation) and also the limitation of bilirobin clearance (reduced uptake, reduced conjugation and less excretion) by the liver. On the other hand, the increase in enterohepatic circulation, which is proven undeniably in newborns than the adult, may play a role in icter development together with the previously mentioned reasons.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>If the level of indirect bilirobin Increases in the plasma to a level which denotes the probability of dangerous toxic complications, the basic intervention for it, i.e., phototherapy, must be carried out immediately. Nowadays phototherapy, although not defined as a standard, is not only method of decrease or avoidance of plasma indirect bilirobin, but also used widely in neonatal health care centers according to the devices available.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Considering the effect mechanism of phototherapy in the treatment of, we should note that light, affecting the unconjugated bilirobin in the skin, subcutaneous and capillary reduces the level of indirect plasma bilirobin in three separate processes:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>One of these important processes is the creation of numeral photo isomers out of indirect bilirobin in a way that the indirect bilirobin, while normally exposing the 15Z, 4Z spatial formation, produces other spatial formations (4E, 15Z; 4Z, 15E; 4E, 15E) by the absorption of light especially in the range of 460 &#x000b1; 10 nm. These formations of photo isomers, known as E isomers, are bile soluble and enter the digestive system without the need for conjugation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lumirubin, a structural isomer formed by the effect of light on unconjugated bilirobin, is bile and urine soluble and it can be excretion without the need for conjugation</p></list-item><list-item><p>A new photo catabolism method is recently discovered for the unconjugated bilirobin which is followed by the products of unconjugated bilirobin oxidation (biliverdin, dipyrroles and monopyrroles) and is thought to be excreted in the liver or kidneys without any need for conjugation.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Among all these routes, geometric photo isomerization has the most important role (80%) in reduction of the unconjugated bilirobin level through phototherapy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Considering the light spectral which can facilitate bilirobin photo catabolism, we can say that bilirobin widely absorbs the electromagnetic wavelengths in the range of 340 nm to 540 nm, which is identical to the range of spectral visible purple (less than 455 nm) to green (more than 492 nm); however, the absorption of photons is maximal in the range of blue color (420 nm to 480 nm) and specially for the wavelength of 458 nm (special blue) (for non-albumin bound bilirobin this wavelength is less [440 nm/460 nm] than the albumin bound bilirubin). This criterion for the light source phototherapy is measured by spectrophotometry.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of phototherapy in the treatment of hyperbilirobinemia also depends on another characteristic than the quality of spectrum (wavelength), named Irradiance. Irradiance in fact manages the packs of photons and as more photons are absorbed by the unit of surface, more energy is provided for photo catabolism of bilirobin. This effective factor in the dose of phototherapy is measured by a radiometer and the minimum irradiance acceptable for the phototherapy is about 6-12 &#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup>/nm and if a light source can produce irradiance higher than 25 &#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup>/nm in the surface unit of skin, it would be referred to as intensive phototherapy. We must also pay attention to the point that irradiance, other than the technical characteristics of the light from the source, relies on the distance of the light source from the skin.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Light emitting sources which are used for phototherapy are categorized in the four following classifications based on the technology used in them and aim to produce a beam of light which has the highest care efficacy and the lowest risk of complications.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Fluorescent lamps (FLs); FLs which have been used widely in the treatment of newborns icter during the last 40 years are categorized in two groups of long tubes and folded (compact) tubes and their most important advantage is that these devices are cheap; however, during their application it should be noted that theses lamps lose irradiance through time and they have a limited life span. Moreover, their irradiance alters according to the beam's color (blue, white, or green)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Halogen light emission sources or quarts halogen incandescent filament lamps (QHIFL) or simply halogen bulbs; halogen lamps, which are designed based on emission of light from an Incandescent string, provide a wide light output (white) based on the wavelength which covers the yellow to red bands with a high irradiance; however, due to the high level of heat emission we cannot place them close to the skin. These light sources, as opposed to FLs, do not pose the limitation of losing irradiance through time and considering the white light emitted, their usage imposes less tension in the work atmosphere</p></list-item><list-item><p>Metal halide gas discharge lamps; this group of light sources, which are also referred to as exhaustive lamps, are designed on the basis of electric discharge in a gas environment, like FLs and they produce a blue-white light but with high irradiance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Light emitting diodes (LED); blue LED light sources are based on electric stimulation of a mineral (gallium nitride) and due to pure emission in the range of blue light, they produce less heat. Therefore, we can place these light sources very close to the skin, which in turn maximizes the absorbed irradiance at the surface of the skin.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In fiber optic phototherapy systems, the light emission source can be one of the following sources, whereas the light is transferred to a contact pad on the newborn's skin surface through optical fibers.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Considering the point that the technological characteristics implemented in these devices are comprehensively analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic>, it can be concluded that studies done on the relation of their performance <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with each other are very limited, hence, considering the development and evolution of these devices, making such comparisons through clinical trials seems increasingly necessary.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial done at Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Isfahan, Iran from February 2012 to March 2013.
