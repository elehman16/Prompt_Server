This type of exercise can be defined as very driven and rigid exercise behaviours and attitudes. Although compulsive exercise has been linked to poorer physical and mental health outcomes, little is known about how it impacts on an individual&#x02019;s quality of life, and their motivation to change their eating disorder. We conducted a study with 78 adults with AN (including 4 males) who were taking part in a larger eating disorder treatment study. Before they started treatment, participants completed questionnaires which asked about eating disorder symptoms, compulsive exercise, quality of life, symptoms of anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive features, and their motivation to change. Our results found that people who exercised compulsively experienced more severe eating disorder symptoms. They also demonstrated poorer quality of life relating to their eating disorder and more elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety. Focusing on compulsive exercise in treatment for AN may help patients to improve their quality of life and mood.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par26">Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with a variety of negative physical, psychological and psychosocial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], as well as functional impairment and reduced quality of life (QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adding to the illness burden are common co-morbidities such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or obsessive-compulsive traits as well as low levels of treatment engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An important aspect of AN psychopathology, given scarce attention in the QoL and treatment engagement literature, is compulsive exercise. This is lacking despite the high prevalence of problematic exercise, its association with compulsivity, and detrimental effects on treatment and illness course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Compulsive exercise can be described as an individual&#x02019;s extremely driven and inflexible exercise patterns, together with a perceived lack of capacity to stop exercising, despite awareness of its negative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It has been associated with higher levels of psychological distress in AN, including greater depressive and anxious traits. A conceptual model of compulsive exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] emphasizes both the positively and negatively reinforcing contributions of this type of exercise on affect regulation. Although patients exercise to improve their mood, compulsive exercise can also be maintained by the individual to reduce high levels of negative emotions, primarily anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is often performed to avoid withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and low mood. These symptoms can occur when an individual is unable to exercise due to treatment restrictions/recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In community samples, two characteristics of exercise have been significantly associated with lower QoL and higher ED psychopathology: (1) feeling guilty when unable to exercise; and (2) exercising predominantly to change weight or shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These findings in the community underline the need to explore associations between compulsive exercise, QoL and ED psychopathology in patients with AN.</p><p id="Par29">Another important facet of AN which can impact upon treatment is the presence of obsessive-compulsive traits. These are a common comorbidity of AN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and are closely related to the concept of compulsivity, a key maintaining factor in Meyer et al.&#x02019;s cognitive-behavioural model of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A positive association between problematic exercise in AN and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) traits has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, studies of the relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and excessive exercise have been inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It may be that examining obsessive-compulsive traits could be more relevant in patients with AN. An updated conceptualization of compulsive exercise and a corresponding self-report measure have since been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and this relationship can now be examined more closely.</p><p id="Par30">Low motivation to change can also have a significant impact upon progress in treatment for AN, and has been associated with lower BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], slower weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and poorer overall QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, little is known about the relationship between compulsive exercise and motivation to change. As compulsive exercise has been associated with other indicators of eating disorder severity such as being a predictor of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and having longer hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], it would be interesting to assess whether there is an association between exercise and motivation to change before treatment. Many patients with AN endorse compulsive exercise driven by shape and weight concerns, and as a method of affect regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is an area we wish to explore as it can be argued that these characteristics could contribute to reduced motivation to change. The trans-theoretical model of motivation to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] has been applied to patients with AN and posits that patients (with various illness diagnoses) can move between 6 stages of change ranging from pre-contemplation to maintenance and termination.</p><p id="Par32">In summary, compulsive exercise is a core feature of AN, which can add great complexity to the course of the illness and have a negative impact upon treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, exercise is associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology and higher levels of depression and anxiety. The relationship between compulsive exercise and QoL has been demonstrated in non-clinical studies but needs to be replicated in the clinical population. Little is known about the relationships between compulsive exercise and QOL, and between compulsive exercise and motivation to change in patients with AN. As obsessive-compulsive traits can compromise treatment outcome, the relationship between exercise in AN and these traits also requires further examination.</p><p id="Par33">The current study thus aimed to assess the relationships between severity of compulsive exercise with subjective ratings of eating disorder psychopathology, QOL, psychological distress and motivation to change pre-treatment. It was hypothesized that compulsive exercise would be negatively related to QOL, but positively related to psychological distress. Given the paucity of previous research investigating compulsive exercise and motivation to change, no specific hypothesis was made for this relationship.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par34">A total of 78 adults (including 4 males) participated in the current study, all of whom were enrolled in a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) &#x0201c;Taking a LEAP forward in the treatment of anorexia nervosa&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The trial took place in Leicester, United Kingdom; Sydney, Australia; and New York, United States of America. The main aim of the parent trial was to examine a novel cognitive-behavioural therapy module for compulsive exercise (compu<bold>L</bold>sive <bold>E</bold>xercise <bold>A</bold>ctivity thera<bold>P</bold>y or LEAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and to determine if it improved treatment outcomes for patients with AN who exercise. Participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups. The first group completed 34 sessions of mCBT-AN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) which aims to normalize eating and help patients reach and maintain a healthy weight. The second group had eight sessions of LEAP treatment, and 26 sessions of mCBT-AN. LEAP aims to provide psychoeducation to patients about distinctions between healthy/balanced and compulsive exercise, utilizing CBT techniques to manage unhelpful exercise behaviours and beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A pilot study of LEAP for inpatients with AN has demonstrated its acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">All participants were recruited for the trial through referral from an eating disorder clinic/service, or from public advertising. Potential participants had to be 18&#x000a0;years or older to enrol in the trial, have a DSM-5 primary diagnosis of AN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] using the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 14 and 18.5. Participants were assessed for medical stability and this was monitored regularly throughout the trial. To enrol in the trial, participants had to have participated in exercise in the previous month, as indicated on the Exercise Participation Screening Questionnaire (participated in an activity on at least one occasion in the previous 4&#x000a0;weeks) or scored at least one time in the past month on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, i.e. self-report that he/she participated in at least one occasion of exercise in the past 4&#x000a0;weeks (EDE-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This criterion was broad as the study aimed to recruit participants performing a range of exercise behaviour, but participants did not need to view their exercise as compulsive. Exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of psychosis or bipolar disorder, current substance dependence, high suicidality, medical instability and concurrent treatment for their eating disorder. There were 574 potential participants who expressed interest in the trial. However, 496 were deemed ineligible or did not wish to participate, hence there were 78 who were enrolled and randomized in the trial.</p><p id="Par36">Ethics was approved at each site: the Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee; National Health Service Research Ethics Committee in the UK, as part of the Health Research Authority; and the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University in New York, USA.

Of the participants, 32.1% were born in Australia, 50% were born in the UK, 11.5% in the USA, and the remaining 6.4% were born elsewhere. A total of 52.5% of the sample had completed university, whilst a further 35.9% had completed at least 10&#x000a0;years of schooling. At the time of the study, 57.7% worked full-time or part-time, 26.9% were students, 12.8% were unemployed and 2.6% completed full-time house duties. Most participants were single (69.3%), 26.9% were married or living in long-term relationships, and 3.8% were separated or divorced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par38">Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing ED psychopathology, compulsive exercise, psychological distress, motivation to change and quality of life.

Confirming the hypotheses, baseline correlations demonstrated weak positive associations between compulsive exercise (CET-Total) and psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms on the K-10), aligning with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. There was also a weak positive relationship between exercise and obsessive-compulsive traits, confirming previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, this contrasted Bewell-Weiss and Carter&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], which also used the Padua Inventory and found excessive exercise to be negatively associated with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Their study utilized a quantitative definition of compulsive exercise and categorized patients as excessive exercisers if they endorsed obligatory exercise for at least 1&#x000a0;h per day, on at least 6&#x000a0;days per week for 1&#x000a0;month. Our use of the CET examines the cognitive-behavioural characteristics of compulsive exercise, rather than the obligatory and quantitative aspects of compulsive exercise which may account for our different results.</p><p id="Par50">A novel aspect of the current study was the examination of the relationships between compulsive exercise and quality of life. At baseline, compulsive exercise was moderately associated with poorer ED-related quality of life (EDQoL) and weakly associated with lower general physical-health quality of life (SF-12 PCS). There are few studies reporting upon these relationships in a clinical sample of outpatients, and our results emphasize the detrimental impact exercise can have upon patients&#x02019; general functioning. Mond and Calogero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] found that the two factors which differentiated between eating disorder patients and healthy women were the same as those associated with poorer quality of life in community samples, i.e. exercising for shape and weight reasons, and avoidance of guilt if exercise was missed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, they did not specifically investigate quality of life in this study. Other research examining an Australian sample of inpatients with EDs found a significant positive relationship between QOL and driven exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Their study used the Quality of Life-Eating Disorders measure (QOL-ED) from the computer-generated Eating and Exercise Examination (EEE-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] but looked only at the frequency of exercise and did not directly assess the compulsive qualities of exercise.</p><p id="Par51">As compulsive exercise is associated with a wide range of physical health complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it was expected that there would be a significant relationship between compulsive exercise and poorer physical health QoL (measured by the PCS on the SF-12) prior to treatment. However, an unexpected finding was that the association between compulsive exercise and the mental-health component of the SF-12 (MCS) approached significance but was not significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05). The MCS measures the functional impairment from emotional issues upon work and social activities. Patients may experience their exercise to be adaptive, in that the behavior serves as both a way to improve their mood and to avoid/manage feelings of guilt and depression if they are unable to exercise. This could have impacted upon their ratings of functional impairment. Although the SF-12 has been evaluated as a sensitive measure of changes in ED pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], it may also be that the MCS is not as sensitive to the positively and negatively reinforcing functions of compulsive exercise behavior.</p><p id="Par52">Compulsive exercise was not significantly associated with lower motivation to change (ANSOCQ) in this pre-treatment sample (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.055). However, we know that patients with a lower level of motivation for change demonstrate a greater rigidity of ED beliefs and are more ambivalent about reducing their ED behaviours. Given these negative characteristics of the illness are associated with poorer motivation to change, it is integral that therapists and medical specialists accurately assess patients&#x02019; motivation to change. Future research should investigate this relationship longitudinally across treatment, as it may be that focusing on and addressing exercise in treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] is more important for those who demonstrate lower motivation to change.</p><p id="Par53">There were several strengths in the current study, namely that it incorporated both ED specific and general health QOL measures, as this has been recommended in recent reviews in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This study is novel in that no previous research has specifically investigated the relationships between compulsive exercise, quality of life and motivation to change in a clinical sample of outpatients with AN. It did include a small group of male patients with AN, but unfortunately it was not possible to conduct analyses based on gender due to our sample size. Men may experience more functional impairment than women from some ED symptoms e.g. objective binge eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], thus it would be beneficial for future studies to utilize larger samples of males with clinical EDs.</p><p id="Par54">This study utilized a range of quality of life measures, however another eating disorder specific measure of HRQoL, e.g. Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] may have been a useful addition. As our participants were medically stable and seen on a regular basis as outpatients, our results may not generalize to inpatients or day program patients. Although most of the correlations between compulsive exercise and variables of interest were significant, some of the correlations were weak in magnitude, e.g. K-10, Padua and SF-12 PCS. Finally, our patients were enrolled in an RCT addressing compulsive exercise and it was a criterion of entry that they had participated in at least one form of physical activity in the past month. These low exercise inclusion criteria were used to generalize as best as possible to patients with AN who engage in exercise (of any frequency), however it is important to acknowledge that these results may not generalize to all patients with AN. Despite having a low entry threshold for exercise, the mean CET score in this sample still fell above the clinical cut off score of 15 indicated for patients with AN who are compulsive exercisers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">This study demonstrated that greater compulsive exercise is moderately associated with poorer ED quality of life, and higher levels of ED psychopathology. Greater compulsive exercise is also weakly associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Addressing compulsive exercise is integral to reducing the burden of illness from AN and may be important in improving people&#x02019;s engagement in treatment. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between these variables, and to utilize longitudinal designs to assess if severity of compulsive exercise predicts these factors over time and throughout treatment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AN</term><def><p id="Par7">Anorexia Nervosa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANSOCQ</term><def><p id="Par8">Anorexia Nervosa Stages of Change Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par9">Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p id="Par62">Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CE</term><def><p id="Par10">Compulsive Exercise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CET</term><def><p id="Par11">Compulsive Exercise Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-5</term><def><p id="Par12">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p id="Par13">Eating Disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDE-Q</term><def><p id="Par14">Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDQoL</term><def><p id="Par15">Eating Disorder Quality of Life scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>K-10</term><def><p id="Par16">Kessler 10-item Distress Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LEAP</term><def><p id="Par63">Loughborough Eating disorders Activity theraPy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCS</term><def><p id="Par17">Mental Health Component Summary Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCD</term><def><p id="Par18">Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCPD</term><def><p id="Par19">Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p id="Par20">Physical Health Component Summary Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par21">Padua Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QOL</term><def><p id="Par22">Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par23">Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p id="Par24">Short Form-12 Health Status Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to sincerely thank Andreea Heriseanu, Jackie Wales, Jessica Lerman and Lauren Belak for their work as research coordinators for the LEAP trial.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par56">This study was supported by an NHMRC Project Grant no. 634922.
