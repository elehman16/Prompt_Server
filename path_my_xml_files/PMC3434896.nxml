Considering that shoulder complex contains a large number of muscles, various exercises should be performed to specifically strengthen each muscle during each session of training program. Additionally, exercises may be done at home through guided self training in certain cases in which the pain and inflammation are considerably reduced. The increasing costs of rehabilitation also support the use of guided self-training (home exercises) in some cases. Several studies have shown that home exercises can be as effective as exercises that are carried out under the supervision of therapists in clinics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Therefore it would be of great value to offer a combination of exercises that can be considered a significant challenge for every glenohumeral and scapulothoracic muscles.</p><p>Bradley and Tibone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, Moseley et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> and Townsend et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> determined a shoulder core exercises program for glenohumeral and scapulothoracic muscles. Townsend et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> found four exercises [scaption with humeral internal rotation (SIR), flexion, horizontal abduction with externally rotated (HAER) and press-up] were considered core to the strengthening of glenohumeral muscles because this combination were responsible for a high level of EMG activity in all glenohumeral muscles (three parts of deltoid, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major and rotator cuff muscles). McCarrick and Kemp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> reported an increase in internal and external rotation peak torque after 12 weeks of resistance training including three exercises: external rotation, SIR and HAER. The study conducted by McCarrick and Kemp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> only measured the torque output of rotator cuff muscles in isometric internal and external shoulder rotation. Jobe and Moyness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> stated that the rotator cuff muscles should be evaluated individually. Jenp et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> found the positions for isolated testing and strengthening of the rotator cuff muscles.</p><p>Although previous studies showed high EMG activity of all glenohumeral muscles during suggested core exercises, no study has been conducted to identify whether this core exercises program in progressive resistance training can lead to strength improvement of all glenohumeral muscles. We hypothesized that, if it would be possible to ascertain that a limited number of exercises could strengthen glenohumeral muscles to an acceptable level, preference may be given to such exercises over specific exercises of individual muscles of shoulder, where the objectives are to increase the general strength of glenohumeral muscles or the use of home exercises. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of glenohumeral core exercises on isometric torque of glenohumeral joint movements in isolated activity positions of glenohumeral muscles.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized control trial has been carried out in the biomechanical laboratory of University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences in 2008 and 2009.</p><p>A sample of 36 female students with normal shoulders which were selected by convenience sampling method participated in this study.

Subjects were excluded if they had shoulder and cervical pain and pathology, shoulder instability, previous shoulder surgery, any upper extremity or spine abnormality. All subjects were right hand dominant with no history of resistance training. The right shoulder was examined.

Once the 10 RM was determined, training were divided into the following regimen: 3 sets of 10 RM, the first series with 50% of the 10 RM, the second series with 75% of the 10 RM and the third series with 100% of the 10 RM. The training was carried three times weekly. The 10 RM load was re-evaluated weekly.</p><p><bold><italic>The training protocol for press-up exercise:</italic></bold> The subjects were instructed to continue the exercise until reaching to the limit of fatigue. After determining the maximal repetition of press-up exercise, the subjects performed 3 sets of maximal repetition every session and three times weekly.

Three minutes rest period between each set and 15 minutes rest period between each exercise were allowed.</p><p><bold><italic>Test procedures:</italic></bold> In both groups, isometric peak torque of the glenohumeral motions was measured at the beginning and after six weeks with a Dynatorque device (EASYTECH, S.R.L). Each participant undertook a familiarization session. After a brief explanation of the testing procedures, participants were asked to execute three submaximal trials to familiarize themselves with Dynatorq and the tests procedures. Test sessions consisted of five minutes warm up of shoulder stretching exercise. The subjects were seated in a chair, the trunk and non dominant arm were stabilized by straps. Maximal isometric torques of deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor, subscapularis, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi musculatures were measured as follows:</p><p>

The isometric peak torque of scaption movement in dependent arm increased 58.1%. Scaption in dependent arm used to optimal position in generating maximal isometric deltoid torque.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Abduction movement at 90&#x000b0; elevation in scapular plane showed 36.4% increase in peak torque. This position was regarded as the optimal shoulder position in generating maximal supraspinatus muscle torque.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Optimal functions of deltoid and rotator cuff muscles are essential for smooth and efficient motion of the glenohumeral joint. The supraspinatus has been identified as the most frequently injured muscle of the rotator cuff group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Thus, restoration and maintenance of supraspinatus strength is one of the important components of shoulder rehabilitation. EMG has been commonly used as the primary criteria for selecting strengthening exercises.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Jobe and Moyness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> were the first who recommended SIR (empty can exercise) to strengthen the supraspinatus muscle using EMG finding. In Townsend et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> study on EMG activity of the supraspinatus muscle during a rehabilitation program, SIR or flexion exercises generated at least 50% of its manual muscle test. Similar findings have been reported by others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> Reinold et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> and Malanga et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> compared three exercises (HAER, SIR and scaption with external rotation) and concluded that these exercises showed similar activity of the supraspinatus. The obvious explanation for increasing of isometric peak torques of scaption in dependent arm and 90&#x000b0; arm elevation is that the supraspinatus and deltoid are adequately exercised with SIR, flexion and HAER that were included in our training program. Thigpen et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> however, found that there is more scapular internal rotation and anterior tipping during SIR compared to scaption with external rotation exercise. The empty can exercise was used in this study, because it was one of the exercises that were responsible for a high level of electromyography activity in all glenohumeral muscles. Scaption with external rotation (full can exercise) demonstrated a significantly lower amount of middle and posterior deltoid activity compared to the SIR and HAER exercises. Reinold et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> however suggested that the middle and anterior deltoid may have significant impact on superior humeral translation, and exercises with high levels of middle and anterior deltoid such as empty can exercise, should likely be minimized for rotator cuff pathology or a deficiency in glenohumeral stabilization that are symptomatic. Thus, when maintenance of the subacromial space is important (such as impingement syndrome patients), use of scaption with external rotation exercises seems most appropriate for supraspinatus strengthening,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> though asymptomatic subjects were included in our study. However, Levy et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> found that anterior deltoid rehabilitation was effective in improving the function and pain in elderly patients with massive cuff tears.</p><p>Our training also produced 47.7% increases in peak torque of subscapularis that was measured during internal rotation when the arm was positioned in scapular plane, elevated to 90&#x000b0; and in neutral rotation. Jenp et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> found the scapular plane with 90&#x000b0; of shoulder elevation in neutral rotation best isolated the subscapularis from pectoralis major .In Townsend et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> study, side lying internal rotation at 0&#x000b0; of abduction failed to activate the subscapularis at levels that met their criteria. The flexion and SIR exercises have been considered as the optimal exercises for subscapularis muscle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Hintermeister et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> also identified internal rotation elicited lower peak activity of subscapularis than did the shrug and seated rowing exercises. Decker et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> reported similar results in which the activity of subscapularis in push up plus and diagonal exercises was higher than traditional internal rotation exercise. Interestingly, internal rotation, which is commonly used for selective subscapularis muscle strengthening, is not an optimal exercise. In agreement with our results, McCarrick and Kemp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> reported increasing of internal rotation peak torque after 12 weeks of resistance training including HAER and SIR exercises.</p><p>Another finding of the present study was 52.9% increases in maximal isometric strength of infraspinatus and teres minor that was measured during external rotation peak torque when the shoulder was positioned at 90&#x000b0; elevation in sagittal plane and half external rotation with 90&#x000b0; elbow flexion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> There was no significant difference in post-test score of external rotation torque between the two groups. Although external rotation torque in the experimental group changed from 8.36 (pre-test) to 12.07 (post-test) but in the control group were 10.56 and 10.59 in pre-test and post-test measurements, respectively.</p><p>Several authors have advocated emphasis on shoulder external rotation strengthening during rotator cuff pathologies rehabilitation or overhead athletes conditioning programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref> Townsend et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> determined that the best exercises for infraspinatus and teres minor muscles were to perform HAER and side lying external rotation. Reinold et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> suggested that the side lying external rotation produce the highest amount of muscle activity for the external rotators. However, their statistical analysis showed no significant differences among side lying external rotation and HAER.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> Blackburn et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> also reported high levels of EMG activity of the infraspinatus and teres minor during prone shoulder external rotation and HAER. McCarrick and Kemp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> also reported an increase in eccentric external rotation strength after 12 weeks of resistance training including three exercises (HAER, SIR, External rotation).</p><p>It was also found that the glenohumeral core exercise training can increase maximal isometric strengths of horizontal adduction (56.4%) and extension (51.9%) that were considered as isolated test positions for pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi respectively. The exercise that was known as optimal for both latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major in Townsend et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> study was press-up. The press-up exercise is a complex-closed kinetic chain exercise. It has been shown that closed kinetic chain upper limb training facilitates co-contraction of shoulder muscles, improving functional joint stability and strengthening the weak and strong muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref> Bang and Deyle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> reported a positive effect of exercises, such as press-up on impingement syndrome patients.</p><p>Several limitations of the present study must be addressed. Our sample was a homogeneous group of healthy and non-athletic females. Subjects with shoulder pathology and history of resistance training may respond differently to a strengthening program. It is unclear if our results can be applied across populations. Given this limitation, caution should be used in applying these results to the injured and athletic population, so further study in those areas would be necessary. Another limitation of this study is that measurements were taken at the beginning and end of the training by the same and no blinded examiner. However, all subjects were instructed in a similar manner. Finally, it is important to note that in the present study, only maximal isometric torque of glenohumeral motions was measured. We cannot definitely claim that our measurement improvements were due to muscular hypertrophy. The measurement of hypertrophy, as assessed with imaging techniques or neural factors, as judged from EMG activity were not included in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Shoulder core exercise training leads to increase peak torque for all glenohumeral movements and this can be considered in strengthening programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>ANM carried out the design and coordinated the study, participated in most of experiments and prepared the manuscript.
