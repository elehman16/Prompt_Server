The definition of an optimal vitamin D level in different types of patients is currently under discussion <xref rid="pone.0102965-Mosekilde2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. When 25(OH)vitamin D concentrations decrease below 75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml), the parathyroid hormone levels (PTH) begin to increase <xref rid="pone.0102965-Lips1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102965-Lips2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

High serum concentrations of 25(OH)vitamin D are associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD), prevention of fractures, reduced fall risk, increased lower-extremity function and low incidence of colon cancer <xref rid="pone.0102965-BischoffFerrari1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Improving vitamin D status could therefore be of potential health benefit. A large amount of vitamin D supplements are bought &#x0201c;over-the counter&#x0201d; by healthy people. However, the safety and possible adverse reactions of high intake of cholecalciferol in the general population has to be considered. Indeed, Melamed et al found a U shaped relation between survival and level of 25(OH)vitamin D in the general population, questioning the safety of high 25(OH)vitamin D levels <xref rid="pone.0102965-Melamed1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Kidney stone disease typically presents between the ages of 20 and 60 years. Most recurrent kidney stone formers do not have a recognized underlying cause. High urine calcium is the single most common abnormality of urine chemistry in recurrent stone formers <xref rid="pone.0102965-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> indicating that hypercalciuria is an important risk factor for development of kidney stones.</p><p>Little is known about high dose vitamin D supplements and the risk of hypercalciuria in healthy people.

Whether this is due to increased sunlight exposure causing increased vitamin D synthesis is uncertain.</p><p>Vitamin D intoxication is traditionally considered related to hypercalcemia. It presents with nausea, dehydration and lethargy.

However, a positive calcium balance may induce hypercalciuria even before hypercalcemia develops.

In the Women Health Initiative Clinical trial a large randomized trial of around 36,000 postmenopausal women a 17% increased risk of kidney stone formation was found in women receiving 400 IU cholecalciferol and 1000 mg calcium per day compared to placebo. Whether this increase was due to calcium, vitamin D or both is difficult to distinguish, and the study did not report data on urinary calcium excretion <xref rid="pone.0102965-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A unique bone metabolism in postmenopausal women may explain higher calciuria after vitamin D therapy, and it is unknown whether these results are applicable to healthy subjects.</p><p>Isidro et al demonstrated that during 12 months of treatment with calcidiol (max dose 960 IU) mean urinary calcium excretion increased significantly <xref rid="pone.0102965-Isidro1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, the participants in this study were patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. These subjects are probably not comparable to healthy subjects with normal bone metabolism.</p><p>Our findings in healthy individuals are supported by two other trials: In a prospective, yet not placebo-controlled study by Vieth et al, healthy men and women were randomly assigned to receive either 25 &#x000b5;g or 100 &#x000b5;g vitamin D<sub>3</sub> per day for 2&#x02013;5 months. Serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion did not change significantly at either dose during this study <xref rid="pone.0102965-Vieth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In a 6 months prospective, randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study aiming to determine the intake of vitamin D needed to raise 25(OH)vitamin D&#x0003e;75 nmol/l (mean daily dose 3440 IU) a few subjects had hypercalciuria, but no difference in the number of active and placebo subjects evidencing hypercalciuria <xref rid="pone.0102965-Aloia1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our trial, as well as the trials mentioned above, are small, and there may be minor changes in urinary calcium excretion that are not detected due to the limited sample size. We found an increase in urinary calcium excretion outside the laboratory reference interval, in three individuals in the cholecalciferol treated group. The absolute increase in dU-calcium in these individuals was higher than in the remaining group. Furthermore, 4 subjects in the cholecalciferol group showed a decline in dU-calcium, despite an increase in 25(OH)vitamin D. These findings indicate that the sensitivity to the calciuric effect of vitamin D may differ between individuals. This variation in sensitivity to the calciuric effect of vitamin D and the clinical consequences remains to be further explored, especially taking other risk factors for developing kidney stones into account including life style and dietary factors such as fluid intake, high salt intake, low calcium intake, hypocitraturia, high animal protein intake and hyperoxaluria <xref rid="pone.0102965-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A recent uncontrolled trial in kidney stone formers found no significant increase in calciuria during eight weeks of ergocalciferol 50000 IU per week. However, 11 subjects had an increase in dU-calcium above 20 mg/d <xref rid="pone.0102965-Leaf1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This supports our thesis that some individuals might be more sensitive to the calciuric effect of vitamin D. It is unclear whether the magnitude of increase in urinary calcium excretion can be attributable to dietary changes. Although, we made an effort to standardize the dietary intake prior to the baseline and the final visit, there still may be some variation in the calcium intake influencing the urinary calcium excretion.</p><p>The reference interval for dU-calcium applied in the present study is based on a normal population material from before 2007. High dose of vitamin D supplements were not recommended at this time. A high frequency of vitamin D supplementation in the general population may increase the level of the reference interval. Whether, an increased level of dU-calcium in the general population would lead to increased incidence of kidney stone formation is unknown. However, it is well known that hypercalciuria is present in 40 to 60% of patients with calcium containing stones <xref rid="pone.0102965-Lerolle1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and it appears plausible that an increase in dU-calcium may increase the incidence of kidney stone formation.</p><p>A great variability in the dU-calcium baseline value was found among the healthy Danish subjects with vitamin D deficiency in the present study. We even found subjects with a baseline value close to upper reference limit (8.1 mmol/24 h). We were surprised not to find any correlation between baseline 25(OH)vitamin D and baseline dU-calcium among our subjects. The reason may be individual differences in calciuric response to vitamin D as mentioned above.</p><p>The levels of 25(OH)vitamin D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D increased significantly in the cholecalciferol treated group compared to the placebo group. Oral vitamin D is rapidly absorbed from the intestine and 25-hydroxylated in the liver. This process is not rate limited <xref rid="pone.0102965-Holick2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. An increase in serum 25(OH)vitamin D is therefore expected. In case of vitamin D deficiency 25(OH)vitamin D is further hydroxylated mainly in the kidney by the enzyme 1-alpha hydroxylase to the active metabolite 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D. In the present study the inclusion criteria was vitamin D deficiency. Although, initial serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D value was in the normal range we observed a significant increase. This increase in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D is consistent with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0102965-Dusso1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102965-Zisman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D are regulated by a negative feed-back of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D on 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase and a positive regulation of 24-hydroxylase <xref rid="pone.0102965-Brenza1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102965-Omdahl1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The observed increase in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D may indicate a deficiency that is corrected when the levels of the precursor 25(OH)vitamin D are increased. Indeed, we found a negative correlation between baseline levels of 25(OH)vitamin D and the increase in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D. The small changes in the placebo group confirms that high levels of 25(OH)vitamin D stimulates a decrease in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D and low levels stimulates an increase in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D. These changes are more pronounced in the intervention group where the level of 25(OH)vitamin D are increased, and when pooling both groups there is enough power to demonstrate a significant correlation.</p><p>The reason for the increase in 25(OH)vitamin D in the placebo group remains uncertain. We did not collect data on travel to areas with more sun exposure or use of solarium. Participation in the study could lead to changes in the dietary habits in the participants. The increase in 25(OH)vitamin D in the placebo group may explain the significant increase in the dU-calcium in the placebo group, and may be the reason why we did not find a difference between treatment groups in dU-calcium.</p><p>We found a significant increase in FGF23 in patients treated with cholecalciferol, although no significant difference in FGF23 changes was found between groups. This may be due to the small sample size, or the increase in 25(OH)vitamin D in the placebo group.</p><p>This is to our knowledge the first randomized controlled study to explore the changes in FGF23 during treatment with cholecalciferol in healthy men and women. This supports the increase in FGF23 after replacement of vitamin D deficiency, which has been demonstrated after substitution with 50000 IU ergocalciferol <xref rid="pone.0102965-BurnettBowie1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and the increase in FGF23 observed in an uncontrolled trial of cholecalciferol substitution in women only <xref rid="pone.0102965-Uzum1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>The influence of cholecalciferol and active vitamin D metabolites on FGF23 has also been described in patients with chronic kidney disease. Both 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D, other 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylated vitamin D analogues <xref rid="pone.0102965-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102965-Wetmore1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and cholecalciferol in doses of 40000 IU per week increase the circulating levels of FGF23 <xref rid="pone.0102965-Marckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> in patients with chronic kidney disease. The response to vitamin D may differ between healthy and uremic patients. Indeed in bone cultures derived from uremic rats the response to calcitriol was found to be more pronounced than in normal rats, probably due to up-regulation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The induction of the VDR that occurs in the calvaria of the uremic rats differs from the major loss of VDR in other regulators of mineral metabolism as the parathyroid glands or the kidney during uremia <xref rid="pone.0102965-Saji1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>FGF23 inhibits the renal phosphate reabsorption and forms a counter regulation of the vitamin D induced increase in intestinal phosphate reabsorption. However, in this study we did not detect any difference in the urinary phosphate excretion or circulating phosphate levels. Whether changes in FGF23 are involved in kidney stone formation is unexplored. Increasing levels of FGF23 are associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality in the community <xref rid="pone.0102965-Arnlov1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102965-Seiler1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Whether the observed increase in FGF23 in the present study is of clinical importance is unknown.</p><p>There are some limitations to the present study. Based on the common use of vitamin D supplements among otherwise healthy subjects we found it necessary to investigate possible side effects. However, the results of this study will be less applicable to patients with chronic illness or diseases affecting bone metabolism. Second, the sample size was calculated to be 20 in each arm. Unfortunately, 22 completed the study in the cholecalciferol group and only 18 in the placebo group. This decreases the power to detect a relevant difference between groups. Third, this study was powered to detect a difference of dU calcium of 2 mmol. Differences less than dU calcium 2 mmol may exist, which the present study would not have the power to detect. Fourth, a larger variation in baseline urinary calcium was found in the active treated group as compared to placebo group. Fifth, we only measured calcium in one 24-hour urine sample before and after intervention. Two 24-hour samples would be optimal. However, we sought to standardize the dietary intake for each individual in order to minimize the day to day variation. Sixth, this study was performed in wintertime. The results during summer may differ, as 25(OH)vitamin D is known to increase due to sun exposure during this period of the year in the northern hemisphere <xref rid="pone.0102965-Hypponen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present randomized controlled trial, we found that 3000 IU of cholecalciferol per day during 16 weeks increased vitamin D levels both in terms of 25(OH)vitamin D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D compared to placebo.
