women, it seems that gynecologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists should be more
attentive to identify and treat these disorders. The aim of this study is to determine the
effect of E-cognitive group therapy with emotional disclosure on mentwal health status
of infertile women who are receiving assisted reproduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial study, 80 infertile women who
were receiving hormonal therapy or other assisted reproductive technologies (ART)
were randomly allocated to the cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) group or the control
group. The CBT group had a weekly 12-hour meeting for a period of three months.
They also participated in some painting sessions (art therapy) and written and verbal
emotional disclosure (both individually and in group presentation). The Depression,
Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) test and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) were
used for data gathering.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Results showed the level of psychological distress decreased in the control
group, but not significantly. Psychological intervention in the treatment group
significantly lowered the level of psychological distress; the mean score of DASS
in all aspects was significant. The difference between the mean score of the two
groups after intervention was significant (p=0.001) and also according to ANCOVA
(p=0.002). Differences were significant between the mean scores of both groups in
the PSWQ (p=0.001), Inventory Test (p=0.001), which was confirmed by ANCOVA
(p=0.009).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>These finding suggest that CBT with emotional self-disclosure promotes
coping strategies among infertile women. Results also show that these approaches develop
mental health and decrease stress in infertile women. Using a psychiatric approach
in medical settings could help infertile women to promote their adjustment with mental
health problems due to of in infertility.

with positive emotions. Evidence suggests that the
anxiety and depression associated with infertility are
similar to those associated with other serious medical
conditions, such as cancer and human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Infertility is a major medical
problem that affects many couples (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). About 10%-
15% of childbearing-age couples experience infertility,
which can affect them physically, emotionally,
financially, socially, and psychologically (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The psychological aspect of infertility is much
more difficult diagnose and treat. This is one of the
greatest issues for many couples (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The recognition
of the painful character of infertility diagnosis
and treatment has led to the development
of several psychosocial interventions for infertile
couples. Psychological treatments include psychotherapy
and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
and can diminish several mental disorders, such
as phobia, depression, and anxiety. They can also
enhance one&#x02019;s physical health, thus resulting in a
successful pregnancy (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Infertility should be considered a bio-psychosocial
crisis, with psychological counseling being an
integral part of a multidimensional solution (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A
decrease in the level of depression, anxiety, mental
distress, and rate of pregnancy have been reported
in some studies following psychosocial interventions
(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Many studies have assessed other
dimensions as well, including self-efficacy, implantation
rate, desire for a child, and the positive
impact of psychological interventions on pregnancy
rates (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>It is a chance for clinical specialists in the
field of mental health to treat couples dealing
with infertility (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Due to the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders
in infertile women, doctors, psychiatrists, and
psychologists should look more carefully for both
early detection and treatment of these disorders
(<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). According to the emotional distress as a consequence
of infertility and the problems in treating
them, several studies have recommended psychological
intervention for infertile couples. However
couples, themselves, sometimes wish obtain additional
psychosocial support (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The aim of
this study is to assess the impact of group behavioral
therapy with emotional disclosure on infertile
psychological stress (anxiety-depression-stress)
and infertility concerns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>This is a randomized clinical trial on 80 infertile
women chosen by simple sampling in the Jahrom
Gynecology Clinic, affiliated with Jahrom University
of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Infertility was defined as at least one year of unprotected
coitus without conception. Women who
met the inclusion criteria were recruited to our
study. All participants who had primary infertility,
with no somatic and psychiatric problems, who
were residents of Jahrom, ages 20-40 years, had
a valid cell phone number, were able to read and
write, and who were interested in participating in
regular group meetings were selected for our study.
All patients signed a consent form to participate in
our study and there was no obligation for them to
participate in this research. The Institutional Ethics
Committee approved the study protocol.</p><p>A total of 80 infertile women consecutively included
in infertility therapy or other ART were randomly
allocated either to the cognitive-behavioral
treatment (CBT) group or to the control group.</p><p>In the first two sessions, 16 patients were absent
and some did not complete the entire questionnaire,
therefore the study continued with
two groups of 32 patients in the CBT group
and 33 in the control group. 12 meetings were
provided for a period of 3 months, as a 2 hour
weekly meeting.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive-behavioral treatment group meeting</title><p>The group therapy used in this study addressed
causes of infertility and aimed to teach participants
how to recognize and challenge negative thoughts
and irrational beliefs. Also CBT group therapy, included
cognitive reconstructing, negative thought
blocking, spirituality (finding the meaning of life in
the heart of the problem), and the behavioral techniques
included muscle relaxation, birth exercises,
imagination(replacing negative thoughts with positive
thoughts in mind), self-disclosure and biofeedback
in group, 2 hours weekly to 12 sessions. All of participants received positive massages about cognitive
reconstructing; changing negative thoughts and
how to induce positive thoughts about their infertility
and brief messages regarding the results of the session.
All participants had emotional disclosure in 30
sessions. Participants expressed positive or negative
feelings about their problems and their peers could
give them feedback. In some sessions, participants
painted their feelings by means of art therapy for
emotional disclosure. All paintings were analyzed
by expert specialists and participants individually
received feedback from group leaders about their
emotions. Participants also presented positive and
negative emotional feelings about their problems
as a written task or expressed them in a group.</p><p>At the beginning of each session and in two additional
sessions, we used interactive animation videos
about the infertility medical approach and specialists
responded to personal questions about the infertility
interventions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> is refers to contents and duration

test was used to collect data. This test is the shortform
of the DASS-21, which served as a standard
reference. The DASS-21 is a 21-item exam
designed to measure the three negative affective
states of depression, anxiety, and stress. According
to Lovibond and Lovibond, "The depression
scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation
of life, self-deprecation, and lack of interest
or involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety
scale assesses autonomic arousal, situational
anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect.
The stress scale assesses difficulty relaxing,
nervous arousal, and being easily upset or agitated, irritable, or over-reactive and impatience." (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).
Using the cutoff scores suggested by Lovibond
and Lovibond (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the psychometric properties
of the DASS have been extensively evaluated,

validity of data obtained with the instrument

consisted of 16 Likert items and showed excellent
internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and

approach such as a CBT or E cognitive message
with self-disclosure has a significant impact on psychological
distress and improved infertile women&#x02019;s
mental health.</p><p>Many studies have investigated the effect of the
psychiatric approach on infertile women. Since
new methods are constantly being introduced in
the field of infertility, the psychological issue has
recently become an important issue that needs to
be addressed (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>In one study, it has been reported that providing
information about the technical aspects of infertility
treatment can facilitate coping with infertility
and medical treatments. This information can be
given from booklets, interactive films, and multimedia.
Although the internet is the fastest and
easiest way to obtain information on infertility and
related treatments, there is the possibility of wrong
or misleading information.</p><p>Telephone counseling can be useful in providing specific information about infertility, but in difficult
psychological issues it is not a substitute for
face-to-face counseling (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Studies have confirmed our results, showing
the impact of interactive multimedia on infertile
psychological distress. Multimedia methods
may act as a novel and real intervention for infertile
patients, which can be a solution in cases
of limited local access to educational and support
services (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>We used paintings as a method of expressing
feelings. Some research has shown the effect of
this method in lowering the negative emotions of
infertile women.</p><p>Art therapy is an inexpensive, non-pharmacological
intervention associated with decreased
levels of hopelessness and depression in subfertile
women. It also provides insight into the meaning
and emotional implications of subfertility for patients
and caregivers (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Other studies state that self-psychology therapy
provides a valuable framework for the therapist,
given the profound and multiple narcissistic assaults
on self-esteem, consolidation of identity,
developmental aspirations, and other self attributes
which infertility causes. The therapist&#x02019;s empathy
becomes the primary tool of both understanding
and alleviating suffering resulting from
infertility (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). More studies are needed to confirm
these results.</p><p>Using multimedia and the internet significantly
reduced the depression level of clinically distressed
and depressed participants. Internet-based
interventions have been show to be promising new
approaches for infertile patients (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The treatment
was assessed as positive or very positive by
80% of the participants. However, further research
is needed.</p><p>In many studies, cognitive behavioral approaches
have been shown to be effective for individuals
dealing with anxiety and assist infertile patients in
challenging and coping with anxiety.</p><p>While some research findings have demonstrated
that psychiatric interventions (behavioral, cognitive,
psychotherapy) increase the rate of pregnancy, others
have not found improved pregnancy rates, but noted
decreased rates of depression and anxiety (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of clinical and mental disorders,
the use of psychological approaches can increase
chances of pregnancy in patients. Using a psychological
approach is a proper treatment, especially
for those who are not receiving medical
treatment (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Stress management is an effective treatment and
should be offered to patients before, during, and
after undergoing the additional stress of assisted
conception treatments (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have stated that both psychotherapy
and CBT are well-established treatments for
depression and anxiety (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Tarabusi et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)
and Kupka et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) have shown that CBT avoids
'waiting stress' that could be useful for stimulating
discussion and awareness for the couple.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the importance
of the mind&#x02013;body connection and fertility
(<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Domar et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), Terzioglu (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and
Place et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) have reported that psychiatric
interventions led to significant decreases in
anxiety and depression and an increased chance
of pregnancy.</p><p>Some studies have shown that various psychological
treatments can make a contribution to lower
stress, but they rarely increase the possibility of
pregnancy (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Pakenham and Rinaldis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and Hart (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). have
reported that psychological intervention in 14% of
cases is conducive to spontaneous pregnancy and that
it can be a consequence of reduced stress (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>In our study there was a wide age range of
between 20-40 years. This might have confessional
result, as women in their 40s may have
more depression compared with women in their
20s because of the possibility of being infertile
for a longer time.</p><p>Additional factors such as women&#x02019;s social
skills and their perception of their own mothers&#x02019;
acceptance or rejection could cause depression
(<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). These factors and the effect of e-cognitive
group therapy with emotional disclosure
should be addressed in future studies. We suggest
that the first clinical impressions about the
usefulness of the body-mind group program in
fertility clinics seems to be promising. Further
research is needed to assess its effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Typically, group therapy involves a group of individuals
with a similar struggle, sitting together
and talking about their lives and concerns under
the guidance of a certified counselor. According
to the results and in attention to the effect of this
approach to infertile psychological distress, we
suggest psychological approaches associated with
other new methods which can help couples to handle
their problem. This approach can also help to
improve mental health status in infertile women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Jahrom University
