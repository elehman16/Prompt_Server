stimulation (tDCS) on depression and quality of life (QOL) in patients with stroke, by
conducting conventional occupational therapy with and without tDCS on 20 patients each.
[Subjects and Methods] The experimental group (N=20) received both tDCS and conventional
occupational therapy, while the control group (N=20) received false tDCS and conventional
occupational therapy. The treatment was conducted 20 times over a four-week period; each
session was 30 minutes long. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to score
the depression levels in patients before and after the intervention, while the
stroke-specific quality of life (SS-QOL) was measured to compare the QOL. [Result]
Following the intervention, the patients in the experimental group showed a significant
decrease in depression and an increase in the QOL. In contrast, the control group showed
no significant changes in depression or QOL. Our findings indicate that tDCS decreased
depression while increasing QOL in patients with stroke. [Conclusion] In other words, our
study confirmed that the application of tDCS during stroke rehabilitation improves the
depression symptoms and QOL in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients experience depression and a decrease in the overall quality of life (QOL)
due to long-term disability and loss of motor and cognitive functions from brain damage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The QOL of stroke is a comprehensive index
of stroke recovery comprising physical, psychological, emotional, and social aspects of
recovery<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it is difficult
to recruit patients who are depressed as their willingness to be involved decreases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) is one of the most convenient and safe rehabilitation methods designed for patients
with stroke, as it allows changes in brain plasticity through direct stimulation of the
brain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. When tDCS is administered in
patients with stroke, they show improvements in hand function, sense of balance, lower limb
function, kinesthesis, visual perception ability, and activities of daily living (ADL)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no previous study has investigated
depression, which is an important psychosocial factor that must be addressed during recovery
from stroke. Thus, the QOL and depression remain insufficiently studied. Therefore, the
present study aims to investigate how tDCS influences the QOL and the overall psychosocial
health of stroke survivors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The patients recruited to this study were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and were admitted to the M rehabilitation center in Busan for four
weeks between January and March 2016. This study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Kaya University Institutional Review Board
(Kaya IRB-145). The final group of participants consisted of patients who were confirmed to
be severely depressed (as evidenced by a score above 16 on the Beck Depression Inventory),
understood the purpose of our study, and provided their written consent. The 40 patients
selected based on these criteria were divided into two groups (containing 20 patients each):
an experimental group that would receive conventional occupational therapy and tDCS, and a
control group that would receive conventional occupational therapy and false tDCS. The
participants were divided according to their order of admission, such that patients with an
odd admission number were assigned to the control group, while patients with an even
admission number were assigned to the experimental group. The tDCS protocol involved
generating a direct current using FDA-approved batteries (Phoresor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PM 850
(Phoresor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> II Auto Model No. PM 850, IOMED, Inc., Salt Lake City, USA)).
According to the International 10&#x02013;20 system, the anode was wrapped in straps and attached to
the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), while the cathode was attached in the same
manner to the right DLPFC<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
experimental group received tDCS applied at 2 mA 20 times over the course of four weeks
(five times a week), for 30 minutes during each session based on the stability study by
Bueno et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the control group, the
anode and cathode positions were the same as in the experimental group; however, the
stimulation was stopped 30 seconds after the application without letting the participants
know until 30 minutes elapsed. The BDI developed by Beck in 1961 was used to investigate
depression levels<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study targeted
patients with severe depression (BDI scores of 16 and higher). The Stroke-Specific Quality
of Life (SS-QOL) developed by Williams et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to investigate QOL<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mean and standard deviation of all scores in the two groups
were calculated using descriptive statistics. The difference between scores measured before
and after treatment was determined using a paired t-test. The statistical significance level
(&#x003b1;) was set at 0.05. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS v22.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The experimental group consisted of 17 men and 3 women, while the control group consisted
of 13 men and 7 women. The experimental group had 13 patients with left paralysis (and 7
with right paralysis), while control group had 5 patients with left paralysis (and 15 with
right paralysis). The mean age (in years) of the patients in the experimental and control
groups was 51.0 &#x000b1; 11.7 and 62.4 &#x000b1; 12.4, respectively. As for the disease duration, the
experimental group consisted of 9 patients who had stroke for 7&#x02013;12 months, 7 patients who
had stroke for 13&#x02013;24 months, and 4 patients who had stroke for over 24 months; while the
control group consisted of 8 patients who had stroke for 7&#x02013;12 months, 8 patients who had
stroke for 13&#x02013;24 months, and 4 patients who had stroke for over 24 months. Homogeneity tests
conducted on the general characteristics of patients from the two groups revealed no

levels in the experimental group. The anode stimulation is known to increase the
excitability of cerebral cortex and enhance awareness, while the cathode stimulation is
known to suppress the excitability of the cerebral cortex and make the subject quieter and
passive<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on these observations,
it can be assumed that the decrease in depression levels was caused by the enhancement of
awareness resulting from the increase in brain activity in patients with stroke. Our
findings are in line with those observed by Valiengo et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, who used 10 applications of tDCS to the DLPFC of 23 stroke
survivors with aphasia, and found that their depressive symptoms decreased after four weeks.
In addition to the improvement in depression symptoms, our study found a significant
increase in the QOL of the experimental group. This result is similar to that of the study
by Viana et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which an
experimental group (n=10) received virtual reality therapy (VRT) as well as tDCS, while the
control group (n=10) received VRT and false tDCS. The authors reported significant
improvement in the QOL as well as upper limb function in the experimental group. Our study
is significant as it confirms that tDCS, a method to increase brain plasticity in patients
with decreased QOL, improves depression and QOL in stroke survivors with depression.
Moreover, our results indicate that tDCS can be effectively applied in the patients&#x02019;
depression treatment in order to improve their QOL. This study has two limitations: 1) the
results are difficult to generalize due to the small sample size, and 2) other factors
influencing QOL have not been investigated. Therefore, future studies should investigate a
larger number patient in order to allow generalization of the results, and conduct
continuous research on depression and improvement in QOL in patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Haghgoo</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Pazuki</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><name><surname>Hosseini</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Depression, activities of daily living and quality of life
