The impact of treatment on the relationships between time-averaged disease activity (TA-DAS28(CRP)) and changes in JE/JSN and associations of JE/JSN with the disability index of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ-DI) at baseline and weeks 52 and 104 were assessed through non-parametric approaches of analysis of variance and quantile regression.

Although JSN was not associated with HAQ-DI at baseline, it was at 52 and 104&#x02005;weeks. In contrast, JE was not associated with HAQ-DI at any time point examined.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Although the portion of physical disability that is associated with inflammation is generally reversible, the component associated with joint damage is thought to be largely permanent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Given the tight correlation between physical disability and loss of social and economic opportunities in patients with RA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> treatment options capable of profoundly interfering with joint damage and inflammation would appear to be of greater individual and societal value.</p><p>The combination of a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor and methotrexate reduces the risk of joint damage onset or progression and improves physical function more effectively than methotrexate alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10">5&#x02013;10</xref> These benefits are thought to result partly from a more rapid and intense inhibition of inflammation with combination therapy than with methotrexate alone. However, patients treated with combination therapy tend to have minimal or no progression of joint damage regardless of inflammatory activity; whereas the level of joint damage tends to reflect the extent of inflammation in methotrexate-treated patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13 R14 R15">11&#x02013;15</xref> suggesting that combination therapy may inhibit joint damage through mechanisms that are independent of inflammatory activity. Alternatively, the TNF cytokine may cause joint damage only after it exceeds some threshold that is greater than that required to cause inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>Joint damage results from the destruction of bone and cartilage, which can be visualised through radiography as joint erosion (JE) and joint space narrowing (JSN), respectively. While JSN is a surrogate marker for loss of cartilage, it may also reflect damage to other (soft) tissues causing joint dislocation, a phenomenon that is less prevalent among patients with early RA. Although JE historically has been perceived to be the most critical indicator of permanent disability in RA patients, recent data suggest that, early in the disease process, JSN may be the more important predictor of irreversible physical disability, as measured by the residual score on the disability index of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ-DI) in patients whose disease is in remission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>

A time-averaged DAS28 (TA-DAS28) was calculated in order to control for intergroup differences in speed of responses and longitudinal fluctuations in inflammation. To obtain TA-DAS28, areas under the curve were determined for all time intervals of available DAS28 values from baseline to 52 or 104&#x02005;weeks for individual patients. Values were summed and divided by the total time interval. The distribution of TA-DAS28 values for all patients was then divided into tertiles at each assessment point. Radiographs of the hands and feet were taken at baseline and weeks 52 and 104. Two readers, blinded to patient and sequence, scored radiographs individually for bone erosion (JE, range 0&#x02013;230) and JSN (range 0&#x02013;168) using a modified form of the Sharp scoring method (modified total Sharp score; mTSS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>

Treatment with the combination of a TNF inhibitor and methotrexate often limits, or even prevents, joint damage in patients who may lack an otherwise measurable clinical response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13 R14 R15">11&#x02013;15</xref> Our results further refine the understanding of this clinical and functional benefit by demonstrating that ADA+MTX protects against JE and JSN onset or worsening; both of these benefits are also largely independent of the therapeutic effect on inflammatory activity.</p><p>Earlier analyses have not evaluated the individual effects of anti-TNF plus methotrexate on JE and JSN progression in response to disease activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13 R14 R15">11&#x02013;15</xref> These findings reveal that both JE and JSN increase consistently with increasing disease activity in patients treated with methotrexate monotherapy. Interestingly, a similar trend in JE and JSN increase in relation to disease activity is seen with adalimumab monotherapy. However, a recent analysis suggests that adalimumab provides better joint protection than methotrexate in individual joints with pre-existing damage, irrespective of the presence of synovitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Importantly, ADA+MTX reduces the progression of both JE and JSN in a manner that is independent of disease activity. Interestingly, the relationship between disease activity and JSN progression appeared less prevalent than with JE progression, suggesting that ADA+MTX may have even stronger inhibitory effects on JSN progression than on JE progression, despite persistent inflammation. Alternatively, the threshold of TNF required to elicit JSN may be higher than that required to cause erosive damage. This novel finding on the abrogation of effects of disease activity on JSN by combination therapy with ADA+MTX appears to be of particular importance in light of recent observations that JSN may affect physical function more profoundly than bony joint damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Indeed, the present analysis expands these findings by demonstrating that in early RA patients progression of JSN, but not JE, is not only significantly associated with loss of physical function, but that JSN progression also has an adverse effect on employment status not seen with JE progression, even at this early stage of disease.</p><p>A positive association between physical function and joint damage has been documented in advanced RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>

No relationship between JSN and HAQ-DI was apparent at baseline; however, JSN and HAQ-DI were associated following both 52 and 104&#x02005;weeks of treatment. It is possible that baseline disease activity masked the relationship between JSN and HAQ-DI, and this relationship only became discernible once treatment reduced disease activity sufficiently. Alternatively, the inability to detect this relationship at baseline may have reflected the short duration of disease in these patients, as an impact on physical function may require a threshold of accrued damage not yet achieved at baseline. In addition, an earlier analysis from PREMIER identified no relationship between concurrent values of the mTSS and HAQ-DI, but a change in the mTSS was significantly associated with HAQ-DI,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> suggesting that progression of joint damage may be more predictive of future function than existing damage in early RA. The consistency of the relationships reported across the evaluated 2-year period suggests that these results may be extrapolated to patients with a longer duration of disease than those included in this study. Indeed, the observed coefficients, although indicative of a weak association, are consistent with those obtained from longitudinal analyses of patients with more advanced disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> the relative contribution of JE and JSN progression to employment status has not yet been evaluated. Our data indicate that progression of JSN plays a more prominent role than JE in determining employment status. Patients with RA frequently lose their jobs early in the course of the disease, with 20&#x02212;30% experiencing permanent work disability during the first 2&#x02212;3&#x02005;years after diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> These data indicate that early control of JSN progression is important not only to protect patients&#x02019; physical functioning but to help them maintain the lifestyle they had before RA diagnosis. A similar association with reduced physical function and job impairment is observed in patients with osteoarthritis;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> however, there is no evidence that existing osteoarthritis independently impacted JE or JSN progression or HAQ-DI scores in this database.</p><p>Several limitations must temper the interpretation of the results of this study. Although the radiographic endpoints used are widely reported and validated, they remain surrogate measures that rely on visual representation and interpretation of joint damage and can be subject to error and bias. Furthermore, as JSN is not a direct measure of cartilage damage, surrounding tissues may also be damaged, and the JSN measurement technique cannot determine the relative contributions of these tissues. Still, such contribution is less likely at this early stage of disease. The joints analysed for JE and JSN also offer limitations. Larger joints, such as joints of the knee, may impact physical function and employability to a greater extent than the joints of the hands, wrist and feet that are scored for JE and JSN, and an examination into grip strength in relation to these patient-reported outcomes may have produced greater correlations. However, it is important to note that this study included patients with an average disease duration of less than 1&#x02005;year; therefore, finding a statistically significant association between these variables at this early stage of RA portends a high risk of a much larger consequence if damage were allowed to accrue over longer periods. Differences in patient discontinuations over time represent a further limitation. Still, the observed differences between treatment groups may have been more pronounced had rates of discontinuation been comparable across treatment groups. Finally, the post-hoc nature of these analyses should be considered to be hypothesis generating and require confirmation in other databases of patients with early RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this population with early, progressive RA, JSN progression was associated with impairment in physical function and work status throughout 2&#x02005;years of treatment, but JE progression was not. Because of the clinical implications of JSN progression for disability and work impairment, protection from the onset or worsening of JSN should be an important factor when choosing between therapeutic modalities. Combination therapy with ADA+MTX suppresses JE and JSN progression and does so in a manner independent of clinical disease activity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance in the development and revision of this manuscript was provided by Benjamin Wolfe, PhD, and Troy Scott, DVM, of Abbott, and Ellen Stoltzfus, PhD, and Robin Stromberg, PhD, of JK Associates, Inc.
