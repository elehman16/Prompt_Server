<bold>Background and study aims:</bold> Delayed gastric emptying is a significant factor in
incomplete small bowel capsule examinations. Gastric transit could be hastened by external
magnetic control of the capsule. We studied the feasibility of this approach to improve
capsule endoscopy completion rates. </p><p>
<bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial
involving 122 patients attending for small bowel capsule endoscopy using MiroCam Navi.
Patients were randomized to either the control group (mobilisation for 30 minutes after
capsule ingestion, followed by intramuscular metoclopramide 10&#x0200a;mg if the capsule failed to
enter the small bowel) or the intervention group (1000&#x0200a;mL of water prior to capsule
ingestion, followed by positional change and magnetic steering). Outcome measures were
capsule endoscopy completion rate, gastric clarity and distention, relationship of body
habitus to capsule endoscopy completion rate (CECR), and patient comfort scores.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> 122 patients were recruited (61 each to the control and intervention
groups: mean age 49 years [range 21&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;85], 61 females). There was no significant
difference in CECR between the two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.39). Time to first pyloric image
was significantly shorter in the intervention group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03) but there was no
difference in gastric transit times (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.12), suggesting that magnetic control
hastens capsular transit to the gastric antrum but does not influence duodenal passage.
Gastric clarity and distention were significantly better in the intervention group
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.0001 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.0001 respectively). </p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Magnetic steering of a small bowel capsule is unable to overcome
pyloric contractions to enhance gastric emptying and improve capsule endoscope completion
rate. Excellent mucosal visualisation within the gastric cavity suggests this technique
could be harnessed for capsule examination of the stomach.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Capsule endoscopy is a first-line investigative modality for the small bowel that can be
used to obtain circumferential and often detailed mucosal views of the narrow lumen during
transit. <xref rid="JR320-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is noninvasive, does not require sedation, and is much
preferred by patients to intubational endoscopy. <xref rid="JR320-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Intuitively,
however, it seems likely that the volume of the stomach, its collapsed state when fasted,
and unusual configuration will hinder the ability of capsule endoscopy to reliably identify
pathology proximal to the small bowel.</p><p>However, we have shown that magnetically-assisted capsule endoscopy (MACE) detects beads
sewn into all areas of an ex vivo water-containing porcine stomach as reliably as
conventional esophagogastroduodenoscopy, implying that a degree of control may allow a
complete examination. <xref rid="JR320-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Preliminary human studies using magnets
to control capsule movement in fluid-filled stomachs also suggest diagnostic yields that
compare favorably with esophagogastroduodenoscopy. <xref rid="JR320-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Marelli et al., however, identified gastric pathology using a
capsule with a higher frame acquisition rate and imaging devices at either end (Pillcam Eso,
Given Imaging, Yoqneam, Israel) without using magnets or other methods of control and with
much smaller ingestion volumes.<xref rid="JR320-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This is consistent with
studies of anemic patients having capsule endoscopy primarily to image the small bowel (but
providing some gastric images during transit) identifying pathology in the esophagus,
stomach and duodenum, missed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, in up to 10&#x0200a;% of cases. <xref rid="JR320-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These data raise the question as to whether the degree of
control is sufficient to add significantly to the diagnostic potential of this developing
technology.</p><p>Transit of the capsule through the pylorus is easily recognized and identification of the
first duodenal image to mark the beginning of the small bowel is standard practice during
capsule endoscopy reporting. By using this landmark, studies suggest that delayed gastric
emptying is a major factor in incomplete small bowel capsule endoscopy examinations, which
are thought to occur in up to 30&#x0200a;% of small bowel capsule endoscopy procedures. <xref rid="JR320-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The use of prokinetics to stimulate gastric peristalsis has
been shown to be effective in reducing gastric transit time and improving CECR. <xref rid="JR320-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These medications carry a risk of adverse reactions,
parenteral administration is uncomfortable, and a simple mechanical method that allows
sufficient control to steer the capsule into the small bowel may be a desirable
alternative.</p><p>Understandably there has been an assumption in most trials that volume distension of the
stomach using swallowed water will allow visualisation of a greater surface area, act as a
mucosal cleansing agent, and provide a suitable medium in which a magnetically controlled
capsule can move. Whether it is distension, mucosal cleansing, purging or a combination of
these actions, preparation clearly improves mucosal visibility and improves diagnostic
yields in small bowel capsule endoscopy. <xref rid="JR320-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Control of capsule movement in a stomach prepared to
optimize distension and visibility may pave the way for noninvasive gastric magnetically
assisted capsule endoscopy (MACE).</p><p>In this study we have compared MACE with a standard protocol to determine if control using
a magnet can be demonstrated by the achievement of a readily definable and, in terms of
small bowel examination, clinically useful endpoint: small bowel CECR. We have compared two
different preparation regimens in terms of clarity of gastric mucosal images and distension
to determine if higher volume fluid ingestion improves the quality of gastric
visualisation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients referred to our institution for small bowel capsule endoscopy between February
2014 and February 2015 were invited to participate. Patients who were younger than age 20,
pregnant, unable to speak or understand English or who had permanent pacemakers,
intracardiac devices or any other magnetically or electrically controlled devices were
excluded. Patient age, sex, height, weight, waist-hip ratio, and body mass index (BMI)
were recorded. Small bowel capsule endoscopy was performed after a 12-hour fast and
ingestion of 2&#x0200a;L of polyethylene glycol during the evening prior to the morning
examination.</p><p>Procedures were performed using MiroCam Navi (Intromedic, Seoul, Korea), a small bowel
capsule endoscope containing magnetic inserts (dimensions 24&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;11&#x0200a;mm, weight 4.2&#x0200a;g, field
of view 170&#x000b0;, depth of view 30&#x0200a;mm, operation time 8 hours) (<xref rid="FI320-1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;1</xref>). Images acquired from one end are captured at a rate of 3 frames per
second and transmitted to a data recorder via electric field propagation. These images can
be viewed in real-time via a wireless connection to an iPad (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA)
and subsequently after downloading onto a computer workstation. Each participant completed
a numeric rating scale questionnaire based on that used by Irvine et al <xref rid="JR320-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> documenting their comfort before and during their procedure,
plus a statement as to whether they would be willing to undergo a repeat procedure. </p><fig id="FI320-1"><label>Fig.&#x0200a;1</label><caption><p>

regional ethical review board (NRES Committee Yorkshire &#x00026; The Humber 14&#x0200a;/YH/1010,
Clinical trials number: NCT0228). Patients were randomized using a computer-generated
random number sequence to enter one of two protocols:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Control protocol</p><p>The standard small bowel capsule endoscopy protocol at our institution was used. The
capsule was ingested using 200 mLs of water with 5 drops of simethicone. Patients then
mobilized around the department for 30 minutes. The position of the capsule was
established using a real-time viewer. If the capsule failed to enter the duodenum,
metoclopramide (10&#x0200a;mg intramuscularly) was administered, followed by further
mobilization. If the capsule remained in the stomach after a further 30 minutes, an
intravenous dose of erythromycin (250&#x0200a;mg in 100&#x0200a;mL normal saline) was given.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intervention protocol</p><p>A gastric distention volume of 1000 mLs of water containing 5 drops of simethicone
was ingested by the patient immediately prior to capsule ingestion. The patient
swallowed the capsule with water ad libitum in the sitting position and subsequently
adopted the supine position to allow examination to commence. MACE was performed by a
single operator (MFH) using a handheld magnet (Navi Controller, Intromedic Ltd).
Holding the magnet over the abdominal wall, the capsule could be rotated along its
longitudinal axis to obtain close-up images of the gastric mucosa or the lumen by
altering the polarity of the magnet with pronation and supination of the wrist.
Movement of the magnet in a longitudinal or transverse direction across the abdominal
wall was used to achieve subtle movements of the capsule within the dependent pool of
water. Larger movements of water were used to wash the capsule from one area to
another by positional change of the patient from supine to the right lateral position,
occasionally using the left lateral position if orientation of the capsule within the
stomach was proving difficult.</p></list-item></list><p>Once enough imaging had been acquired to allow orientation within the stomach, the
maneuvers described were used to try and drag the capsule into the antrum and orientate it
toward the pylorus. Thereafter, a variety of approaches were used to assist transpyloric
passage, most commonly involving the patient leaning toward the right lateral position and
the magnet held over the right lateral chest wall or posteriorly as far as the vertebral
column. If the capsule failed to pass through the pylorus using magnetic control, within
the allotted time limit of 30 minutes, the patient transferred to the relevant section of
the control protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Based on the available literature and our local data, assuming a CECR of 70&#x0200a;% using our
standard (control) protocol, 60 patients were required per group to be able to detect a
20&#x0200a;% improvement in small bowel (CECR) with a 5&#x0200a;% two-sided significance level, 80&#x0200a;%
power. Quantitative data are summarized with parametric statistics, the mean and standard
deviation or with non-parametric statistics, the median and interquartile range. The
unpaired <italic>t </italic>test was used to compare age between the two study groups and the &#x003c7;&#x000b2;
test was used to compare sex and indication for small bowel capsule endoscopy between
study groups. First pyloric view and gastric transit time were not normally distributed
and thus the Mann Whitney test was used to compare the differences in these variables
between the two groups. Gastric distention and mucosal visualisation (as measured on a
1&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;4 scale) between the two groups was also compared using a Mann Whitney test, although
we must highlight there are some limitations of using this test when there are only four
possible outcomes to compare. Small bowel transit time between the two groups was compared
using an unpaired <italic>t </italic>test. Linear regression was used to assess the correlation
between BMI or waist-hip ratio and gastric transit time. An unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was
used to assess the correlation between BMI or waist-hip ratio and CECR. The diagnostic
yield, CECR and patient willingness to undergo a repeat procedure were measured as a
simple &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; and thus were examined using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.</p><p>The small bowel capsule endoscopy videos were read and reported in the conventional
manner, which included annotation of the anatomical landmarks (first gastric, duodenal and
cecal images), by one of two experienced capsule endoscopists (K.D, M.E.M). One individual
(M.E.M) studied all gastric imaging, assigned a score (adapted from that used by Eliakim
et al. 1: excellent; 2: good; 3: fair; 4: poor) <xref rid="JR320-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> for both
clarity of the gastric mucosa images and distension of the gastric lumen and also marked
the first image seen during the examination of the pylorus. All reviews were done in
random order and blinded to the protocol assigned.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure for the effect of magnetic control on transpyloric transit of
the capsule was CECR. Secondary outcome measures were gastric mucosal clarity, gastric
distension, relationship of body habitus to CECR, and patient comfort scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 122 patients were prospectively recruited to the study between February 2014 and

to the right lateral position was required in some participants. Once the pylorus was
visualized, further movements with the external magnet over the epigastrium, right upper

habitus, degree of gastric distention and likely surface anatomy of the stomach in varying

assist in small bowel capsule endoscopy and this was not affected by body habitus. However,
the more rapid identification of the pylorus suggests that a magnet can exert a degree of
control that allows endoscopist orientation in the stomach and which is likely to be
clinically useful for gastric capsule endoscopy. Gastric preparation with a liter of
ingested water containing simethicone offers better gastric mucosal clarity and distension
than a 200-mL volume. It follows that a clean, adequately distended stomach is an important
aspect of successful MACE, allowing the operator to identify gastric landmarks more easily
and thus manipulate the capsule more effectively to achieve the required end. Importantly,
MACE is a procedure that induces no measurable pain, discomfort or distress in patients.
Further studies of control and preparation are needed to understand the potential of MACE as
a noninvasive upper gastrointestinal diagnostic tool.</p><p>After ingestion, the capsule commonly dropped to the dependent part of the distal gastric
body and could be manipulated to view both the antropyloric region and upper gastric body
simultaneously. As with the study by Rey et al. using the Siemens electromagnetic guidance
system, the pylorus was readily identified and while progress could be made towards it, it
could not be done sufficiently quickly to avoid posterior displacement by powerful
antropyloric contractions. <xref rid="JR320-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Efforts to do so were further
hampered by the need to place the magnet behind the patient to attempt to pull the capsule
along the superoposterior axis in which the antroduodenum tends to lie. <xref rid="JR320-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore as a tool to enhance GTT to optimize small bowel
examination, it does not appear to be better than a standard protocol using prokinetic
agents. For the purposes of gastric examination, however, retention of the capsule is
desirable and the antropyloric region, a common site for pathology, was well visualized
(&#x0200a;<xref rid="FI320-4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref>). Furthermore, peristaltic contractions could, of
course, be attenuated using anticholinergic agents such as hyoscine <xref rid="JR320-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Whether a combination of a promotility agent and magnetic
steering could be used together to enhance pyloric transit of the capsule would require
further research.</p><fig id="FI320-4"><label>Fig.&#x0200a;4&#x02003;a</label><caption><p>

<xref rid="JR320-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, because magnetic control failed to offer any
advantage over a standard protocol when using CECR as the main outcome measure, it seems
unlikely that this question has been adequately addressed and further study is needed using
different markers of control. </p><p>Inflation of the stomach during esophagogastroduodenoscopy allows the endoscopist to
distend the stomach and flatten rugal folds, maximizing the chances of visualising the whole
gastric mucosal surface, therefore minimizing the risk of missed pathology. Such a facility
is not an option in a remote technology like capsule endoscopy, but may be afforded
indirectly by the ingestion of water or gas-producing substances. Our study shows that
ingestion of a liter of water significantly improves gastric mucosal clarity and distension
compared to a 200-mL volume. Other studies have empirically used water volumes of 300&#x0200a;mL
<xref rid="JR320-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and 1300&#x0200a;mL (in three divided doses over 75 minutes) <xref rid="JR320-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

1000&#x0200a;mL <xref rid="JR320-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> with gas-producing substances. The addition of
simethicone as an anti-foaming agent may have contributed to opacity of the gastric content
in other studies <xref rid="JR320-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="JR320-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> but appears to have been used in larger doses than in our
protocol. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal preparation, but the
evidence from this study is that higher ingestion volumes improve the distension and
visibility of the gastric mucosa and, thus, the overall quality of the examination.</p><p>The Siemens guidance system generates a magnetic field of varying strength and capsule
movement is controlled using joysticks. It may, therefore, allow more subtle control than is
afforded by a handheld magnet, which is reliant on the operator adjusting the distance of
the magnet from, and location over, the skin surface. The magnet weighs 1.2&#x0200a;kg, so subtlety
of control probably diminishes as the arm fatigues. However, endoscopists have long been
used to learning complex procedures that require high levels of manual dexterity and the
attraction of a handheld magnet is simplicity of operation, portability and comparatively
minimal cost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Manipulation of a capsule endoscope in the stomach using magnetic steering is feasible but
it does not overcome pyloric contractions to enhance gastric emptying or improve CECR.
Improved gastric mucosal clarity and distension are observed using higher volumes of
ingested water and the addition of simethicone. Further work is recommended to explore the
potential of this novel technology.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="d31e128" fn-type="conflict"><p>
