This multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study evaluated whether Chinese men with ED preferred 20-mg tadalafil or 100-mg sildenafil. After a 4 weeks baseline assessment, 383 eligible patients were randomized to sequential 20-mg tadalafil per 100-mg sildenafil or vice versa for 8 weeks respectively and then chose which treatment they preferred to take during the 8 weeks extension. Primary efficacy was measured by Question 1 of the PDE5 Inhibitor Treatment Preference Questionnaire (PITPQ). Secondary efficacy was analyzed by PITPQ Question 2, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) erectile function (EF) domain, sexual encounter profile (SEP) Questions 2 and 3, and the Drug Attributes Questionnaire. Three hundred and fifty men (91%) completed the randomized treatment phase. Two hundred and forty-two per 350 (69.1%) patients preferred 20-mg tadalafil, and 108/350 (30.9%) preferred 100-mg sildenafil (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) as their treatment in the 8 weeks extension. Ninety-two per 242 (38%) patients strongly preferred tadalafil and 37/108 (34.3%) strongly the preferred sildenafil. The SEP2 (penetration), SEP3 (successful intercourse), and IIEF-EF domain scores were improved in both tadalafil and sildenafil treatment groups. For patients who preferred tadalafil, getting an erection long after taking the medication was the most reported reason for tadalafil preference. The only treatment-emergent adverse event reported by &#x0003e; 2% of men was headache. After tadalafil and sildenafil treatments, more Chinese men with ED na&#x000ef;ve to PDE5 inhibitor preferred tadalafil. Both sildenafil and tadalafil treatments were effective and safe.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>erectile dysfunction</kwd><kwd>patient preference</kwd><kwd>phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects millions of men worldwide,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and can be distressing because of its effect on self-esteem, quality of life, and interpersonal relationships.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> From the relational component, the quality of the relationship represents another important determinant that the impairment of relational factors independently predicted ED severity.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, it is not easy to evaluate all these aspects for a correct diagnosis and essential step for the right ED treatment prescription. Besides correcting lifestyle changes and risk factors whenever possible, and providing sexual education and counseling, a first-line treatment strategy usually includes a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor either administered on-demand or on a daily basis.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Currently, PDE5 inhibitors are as the first-line treatment choice for ED in Western society.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used in China for the treatment of impotence, more men are switching to PDE5 inhibitors for ED treatment.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although, it is still a matter of debate if and how any information on the patient and any characteristic of his disease should lead to the selection of one treatment rather than another, a particular PDE5 inhibitor often relies more on personal beliefs than on solid evidence.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In China, there are three PDE5 inhibitors: sildenafil citrate (sildenafil), tadalafil, and verdanafil hydrochloride (verdanafil) as needed (<italic>pro re nata</italic> [PRN]).

At the moment this study was conceived, the majority of patients in China were prescribed sildenafil or tadalafil. Hence, we designed a crossover randomized, open-label trial to compare patient's preference of tadalafil 20-mg with sildenafil 100-mg over 8 weeks of each drug. Patients who completed both treatment arms chose either tadalafil or sildenafil as the treatment of choice to be continued for gratis during an 8 weeks extension phase. At the end of the extension period, patient's sexual quality of life was assessed. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment preference of tadalafil as the treatment of choice compared with the most widely prescribed PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, in Chinese men with ED.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This choice of continued therapy was a behavioral indicator of which drug the patient prefers.

For the three traditional PDE5 inhibitors, sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil, their efficacy has been confirmed. Among the three inhibitors, tadalafil is likely to be the most effective one for ED because tadalafil also has many other advantages in additional to safety and well toleration, such as patient preference, which may be considered the first choice for ED patients.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>In this study, after receiving both treatments, 69.1% patients preferred tadalafil, and 30.9% patients preferred sildenafil (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Of the patients who preferred tadalafil, 38% strongly preferred it; of those who preferred sildenafil, 34.3% patients strongly preferred the sildenafil. The preference for tadalafil in Chinese patients is similar to that in the previous Eardley study.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In the answers to the DRAQ, more patients (55.0%) responded that when using tadalafil treatment, they were able to get an erection long after having drug than those treated with sildenafil (11.1%) and it is the main reason patients preferred tadalafil. The IIEF domain scores were obviously improved in both the tadalafil and sildenafil treatments, and there is no significant difference between the two treatments. In SEP2 and SEP3, there were obviously improved scores in both the tadalafil and sildenafil treatments. The incidences of TEAEs (most were mild) were low in both the tadalafil and sildenafil treatments in the pre-extension (tadalafil: 8.3%; sildenafil: 7.2%) and extension periods (tadalafil: 3.0%; sildenafil: 1.9%). No severe TEAEs reported in tadalafil treatment.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that tadalafil was efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in the treatment of ED. The reason why patients preferred tadalafil compared to sildenafil was mainly because of the longer duration of action that increased the patient's freedom in sexual life.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The preference for tadalafil was established in an open-label study that switched patients who had previously used 25, 50, or 100-mg sildenafil to treatment with 20-mg tadalafil.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In this China preference study, the doses selected were 20-mg tadalafil and 100-mg sildenafil represented the approved maximum label doses. The selection of sildenafil as the primary comparator was appropriate because it was the most commonly prescribed oral PDE5 inhibitor worldwide. The highest dose of the comparator was selected to minimize any difference in preference due to efficacy.</p><p>Tadalafil differs from the other two PDE5 inhibitors in its&#x02019; pharmacokinetic characteristics. The mean half-life of both sildenafil and vardenafil is approximately 4 h,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> with demonstrated improvement in EF up to 8&#x02013;12 h postdose;<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> whereas the mean half-life of tadalafil is 17.5 h,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> with demonstrated improvement in EF up to 36 h postdose.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The difference between the tadalafil and sildenafil pharmacokinetic profiles grants patients more freedom to perform sexual intercourse with less need to plan ahead.</p><p>Considering the limitations of an open-label study design, investigators and/or patients could have been influenced by marketing messages of both tadalafil and sildenafil creating initial preconceptions. However, the use of 4 weeks treatment periods and the randomization by sequential 20 mg tadalafil per 100 mg sildenafil or vice versa and a 4 weeks assessment phase was expected to minimize this potential bias. In addition, the study population included only men who were na&#x000ef;ve to treatment with PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of ED, removing any influence of including patients who were previous responders or nonresponders to PDE5 inhibitors.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Twenty milligram tadalafil and 100-mg sildenafil were effective and safe treatments for men with ED na&#x000ef;ve to PDE5 inhibitor treatment who had a broad range of demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions that are representative of the general patient population of men with ED in China. After experiencing both tadalafil and sildenafil treatments, more patients and partners preferred to choose the tadalafil during the study extension phase because the patients were able to get an erection long after tadalafil dosing and the patients had less time concerns and more spontaneity.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>WJB, HJL, YTD, XYH, YRH, JHL and XFW contributed to the data collection and intellectual revision of this manuscript.
