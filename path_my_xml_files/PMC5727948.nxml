We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a trial of an adapted home-based CR programme, &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019;, for patients following a TIA/minor stroke, participants&#x02019; views on the intervention and, to identify the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Clinicians were asked to identify patients attending the Ulster Hospital, Belfast within 4&#x000a0;weeks of a first TIA or minor stroke. Those who agreed to participate underwent assessments of physical fitness, cardiovascular risk, quality of life and mental health, before random allocation to: Group (1) standard/usual care; (2) rehabilitation manual or (3) manual plus pedometer. All participants received telephone support at 1 and 4&#x000a0;weeks, reassessment at 6&#x000a0;weeks and an invitation to a focus group exploring views regarding the study. Two trained review authors independently assessed the manual to identify the BCTs used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Twenty-eight patients were invited to participate, with 15 (10 men, 5 women; 9 TIA, 6 minor stroke; mean age 69&#x000a0;years) consenting and completing the study. Mean time to enrolment from the TIA/stroke was 20.5&#x000a0;days. Participants completed all assessment measures except VO<sub>2max</sub> testing, which all declined. The manual and telephone contact were viewed positively, as credible sources of advice. Pedometers were valued highly, particularly for goal-setting. Overall, 36 individual BCTs were used, the commonest being centred around setting goals and planning as well as social support.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Recruitment and retention rates suggest that a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel home-based CR programme, implemented within 4&#x000a0;weeks of a first TIA/minor stroke is feasible. The commonest BCTs used within the manual revolve around goals, planning and social support, in keeping with UK national guidelines.

Therefore, the immediate period after a TIA and &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke is a crucial time to intervene to reduce the risk of future strokes and the impact that these conditions have on society.</p><p id="Par23">Evidence is growing regarding the contribution of change in modifiable risk factors to reductions in cardiovascular deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and there is a need to consider how to promote non-pharmacological measures within secondary prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the knowledge surrounding vascular risk factors and the recognition that TIA/&#x02018;minor&#x02019; strokes carry a significant morbidity and are often the precursors of disabling strokes, stroke remains the leading cause of adult disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Cardio- and cerebro-vascular disease share common underlying pathological mechanisms and risk factors, but cardiac rehabilitation for secondary prevention is only offered to patients in the UK with cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and further research has been highlighted as required in assessing the impact of lifestyle interventions post-stroke and TIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The benefit of cardiac rehabilitation for secondary cardiovascular prevention is well-evidenced. Indeed a systematic review of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction (MI) found statistically significant reductions in re-infarction (odds ratio 0.53), cardiac mortality (odds ratio 0.64), and all-cause mortality (odds ratio 0.74) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. More recently, Rauch et al.&#x02019;s review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] has confirmed the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation for mortality despite recent advances in medical and surgical treatments.</p><p id="Par25">Lennon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and McKay-Lyons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have described randomised trials of community-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes in both TIA and stroke patients. These studies did not review the use of home-based programmes, which we know are at least as effective as community-based options whilst being more cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and did not include a pedometer arm. These studies finished early, with no results available in their clinical trials registry entries or published. Both described a relatively long-period from the event to entry into the trial (up to 90&#x000a0;days for both studies). However other research has shown that vascular risk factors should be addressed as quickly as possible following the initial vascular event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Prior et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have described a pilot study of a community-based cardiac rehabilitation in 100 post-TIA and &#x02018;mild&#x02019; stroke subjects and showed important reductions in biological markers linked to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality. Thus community-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes appear feasible in this patient group. However the study did not include a control group, patients were eligible for inclusion up to 1&#x000a0;year post-event, the researchers did not offer home-based rehabilitation and did not include pedometers in the rehabilitation programme. Other authors have also piloted community-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes in the TIA and minor stroke population, with patients eligible for inclusion up to 1&#x000a0;year post-event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] but no authors have previously assessed the feasibility of adapting a home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme, with or without an added pedometer intervention, for use within this patient population in the sub-acute period following diagnosis.</p><p id="Par27">Compliance as well as uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], particularly among women and the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], with cardiac rehabilitation programmes is an issue, which can be improved through home-based options. Cochrane Reviews have demonstrated that home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes can result in similar health gains to hospital-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], or centre-based programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with home-based programmes improving adherence to the programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, home-based cardiac programmes have shown longer term sustainability of health benefits compared with hospital-based programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Physical inactivity is one of the most important recognised risk factors for cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and pedometers have been shown to be effective in promoting physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] through different behaviour change methods, including goal setting, providing feedback, and monitoring of activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Pedometers appear feasible for use by patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and also promote walking, which is one of the commonest forms of physical activity for older adults to engage in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A systematic review on the role of exercise post-stroke has however highlighted the lack of studies of pedometers in the acute and sub-acute periods of TIA or stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Pedometers also appear to promote physical activity in the long-term, with De Cocker et al. showing that after 4&#x000a0;years of follow-up, the pedometer intervention group had higher physical activity levels than the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Comprehensive programmes, which try to alter participants&#x02019; behaviours, are complex: information about their &#x02018;active&#x02019; ingredients, such as specific BCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], would facilitate their replication and the implementation of guidelines for good clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Identifying behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used in different behaviour change programmes has also been identified as a national research priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019;, adapted from the &#x02018;Heart Manual&#x02019;, the only validated home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme supported by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for patients who have had a myocardial infarction (MI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], is being developed following the MRC guidelines for developing complex health service interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], to maximise secondary prevention post-TIA and minor stroke.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research aims</title><p id="Par30">The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of evaluating the effectiveness of a novel adapted home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme, &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019;, with or without a pedometer intervention, initiated within 4&#x000a0;weeks of a first TIA or minor stroke of atherosclerotic origin.

A measure of deprivation (multiple deprivation measure (MDM)) was derived from their postcode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

In terms of programme content, &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019; contained an introduction, telling the user how to use the manual, medical and social information about TIAs/&#x02018;minor&#x02019; strokes and how to set goals and action plans for changing certain aspects of their lives. There was then sections focusing on topics relevant to cardiovascular risk (smoking, physical and sexual activity, mental health issues (primarily anxiety and depression), community resources (e.g. smoking cessation support; exercise classes), diet and secondary prevention medication). The manual was supported with telephone follow-up by a health professional, a General Practitioner (GP). Participants were given advice about how to know that they were participating in moderate intensity activity. Those with a pedometer were advised that a cadence of 100 steps/min corresponds to moderate physical activity and for those who did not have a pedometer, they could use the &#x02018;talk/sing test&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

Participants in Groups 2 and 3 were informed about the national UK physical activity guidelines as well as how to achieve moderate and vigorous physical activity intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

The focus group discussion was led by NH, audio-recorded with the consent of participants, lasted approximately 1&#x000a0;h and was transcribed by NH. Content analysis was undertaken with the practical purpose of eliciting views about the acceptability and usability of the intervention and research methods and how these could be refined. NH, a male GP, and MD, a male health services researcher/health psychologist, read and reread the transcripts and coded the content independently. NH and MD met to discuss the main areas covered within the transcripts. MC, a female professor of GP, acted as a referee as required as well as appraising critically the categories and the degree to which the transcript extracts and quotations supported the themes. The transcripts were not returned to participants for comment and/or correction and participants were not asked to provide feedback on the qualitative results. NH has basic training in qualitative research methods whilst MD and MC are experienced qualitative researchers. The independent results of the qualitative analysis and data interpretation were discussed with the entire research team, to ensure clear definition of themes and that appropriate supporting evidence was identified for each.

A Logic Model has been developed for this feasibility study and is included in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Intervention logic model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12872_2017_717_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Comparison with previous literature</title><p id="Par76">In comparison with previous studies of community-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with TIA or &#x02018;mild&#x02019; stroke, we have achieved higher rates of recruitment (50% of those invited) and retention (100%). A feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported 62% retention of 85 patients enrolled and, in a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], approximately 50% of 100 invited patients consented to participate and roughly 80% completed the study. Of note, home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are reported to improve programme adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and to show longer-term sustainability of health benefits compared with hospital-based programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">An interesting finding was that all participants declined to undertake a maximal VO<sub>2</sub> test, both pre- and post-intervention, whereas all other assessments were well received. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report this finding. Exercise testing is safe to undertake among patients with TIA and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] as well as generally within the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] but our participants felt unable to complete it. Thus, for further work, we have omitted the maximal exercise test, adding the Timed Up and Go test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and accelerometer assessments of physical activity pre- and post-intervention, which are reliable objective measures of physical activity in stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and amongst the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. However, the Timed Up and Go test is a short test of physical performance which can be insufficient to capture deficiencies in cardiovascular endurance. Thus, we plan also to use accelerometry to assess participants&#x02019; physical activity levels, as well as to measure gait speed during the 2-min walk tests as this has been shown to be an important predictor of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">The Group 3 participants increased their physical activity by 1400 steps/day over the study period of 6&#x000a0;weeks. Indeed, walking ability has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] as well as being helpful in guiding prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Moreover, an increase in steps/day walked after cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce overall risk of mortality and hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] Therefore the improvement in physical activity levels (steps/day) demonstrated within this feasibility study could contribute to making our TIA and &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke patients live longer as well as healthier lives. Previous studies have also shown that there is potential for larger increases to be achieved with pedometer interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], with potential to reduce cardiovascular risk factors further, particularly amongst those who are the least active. It has been suggested that healthcare workers should enquire regularly about the walking status of their patients and that this should be viewed as an another &#x02018;vital sign&#x02019; in healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Pedometers are also accurate and reliable in measuring ambulatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] whilst also being relatively inexpensive. Yamax pedometers have been shown to be the most accurate waist-borne instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">The intervention appeared to improve quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L VAS scale and mental health, as measured by the HADs questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], although numbers were small and no significance testing was carried out. In keeping with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] which found a prevalence within TIA survivors of anxiety symptoms of up to 30% and depression symptoms of up to 21%, our focus group participants were anxious and fearful about having future events. Patients appreciated the explanations and reassurance provided by the manual.</p><p id="Par80">It is important for complex health service interventions to be evidence-based and to know that they are not only effective but how and why they are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Specifying and describing how a programme of behaviour change actually works is also advocated by UK national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], with journal editors requesting detailed descriptions of the active intervention within their reporting guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Thus, the active ingredients within a programme should be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] have advocated the use of BCTs which have been proven to be effective in promoting behaviour change, particularly &#x02018;goals and planning&#x02019;; &#x02018;feedback and monitoring&#x02019;; and, &#x02018;social support&#x02019;. &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019; includes goal-setting for behaviour change, with agreed action plans and relapse prevention (&#x02018;if-then&#x02019;) plans for each behavioural cardiovascular risk factor. These goals and plans are reviewed and refined in follow-up contacts with the health professional/facilitator. The manual includes feedback and monitoring as a BCT, for example, based on review of pedometer step counts. Social support is promoted through contact with health professionals and encouraging the person to share the manual with their family and friends and get them to join in the behaviour change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par81">This is a feasibility study and therefore no statistical analysis was undertaken on the outcomes. Baseline assessments were completed before participants were allocated to different groups, to avoid allocation bias. The qualitative work undertaken included participants from each treatment group, of varying age and both sexes, with a range of different symptoms and experiences and they identified valued components of the rehabilitation programme. The educational attainment of our participants was less than third level (post secondary school education), with only one having a University degree and no one reported any difficulty in following guidance or understanding information within the manual. This was reassuring since, in developing it, we had performed a readability check (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/check.php">http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/check.php</ext-link>), showing it to be readily understandable to 13 to 14&#x000a0;year olds.</p><p id="Par82">The pragmatic approach, whereby TIA and &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke diagnosis was made by the lead clinician at each clinic, may have led to variation in the case mix due to differing interpretation of clinical data but this was accepted as a reflection of &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; practice. There was no post-intervention blinding of assessments so that it is possible that some measurement bias may have occurred. Also, Group 3 participants were not blinded to their step counts in the first week of the study, so that the baseline measure may be inflated and not a true reflection of levels of physical activity at this time in TIA and minor stroke patients.</p><p id="Par83">Whilst initial discussions with clinical staff regarding the process of identification and invitation of eligible patients had included a plan to record anonymously the numbers of all eligible patients, this information was not recorded. Thus, although data suggested that 79 of the 107 clinic attendees during the recruitment period were ineligible, this could not be confirmed and limits our interpretation of the feasibility and acceptability of the research.</p><p id="Par84">A strength of our study is the careful approach we have taken to identifying the &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of the intervention. However, we recognise that our focus was on the manual content and that other BCTs were also involved in the delivery of the programme, during telephone contacts. No monitoring of the fidelity of these contacts was undertaken but this could be achieved in further study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Implications for future work</title><p id="Par85">In planning further development and evaluation of the intervention, &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019; we will conduct a pilot study, involving other hospital clinics and ensuring that information is recorded regarding all eligible patients. In setting step-count goals for physical activity, only Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701 pedometers will be used. We will discard the maximal VO<sub>2max</sub> exercise test and instead use the Timed Up and Go test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] pre- and post-intervention, with accelerometer assessments, which provide reliable objective measures of physical activity in stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. We will also include a &#x02018;patient story&#x02019; in the &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019;, in-keeping with previous authors&#x02019; work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], and will place information about TIAs and strokes at the start of the manual.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par86">Our findings show the feasibility, acceptability and potential significance of implementing, early after TIA or &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke, a novel home-based programme, &#x02018;The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual&#x02019;, with or without an added pedometer. The main BCTs utilised within the manual included use of a credible source, social support and goal setting, in keeping with current UK national guidance for behaviour change. This preliminary work has informed the design of a pilot study which is in progress, with longer follow-up, recruitment from a range of settings and refined methodology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02712385)). This future work should provide evidence of the value of early intervention that is focused on behaviour change for patients following TIA or minor stroke.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec27"><title>Focus group topic guide</title><p id="Par93">
