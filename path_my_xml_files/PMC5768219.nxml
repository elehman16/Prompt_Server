More specifically, radiographic confirmation of a patient having had OA within 12 months before study screening was required, with no other etiology demonstrated as the source of knee pain. Patients reported that they had suffered from OA pain for approximately 10 years (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and most entered the study with prior diagnoses of OA of the knee as evidenced by prior treatments received, medications taken, and independent radiographic assessment. The diagnosis was reconfirmed by study investigators before entry into the trial using this previous information, as well as patient presentation and physical examination. Subjects with bilateral knee OA were not excluded; only 1 knee was screened and enrolled as the &#x0201c;index knee&#x0201d; for treatment. Inclusion criteria included (1) knee pain for 6 months or more that was unresponsive to conservative treatments (physical therapy, oral analgesics, intra-articular injections with steroids, and/or viscosupplementation); (2) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score of 6 or greater for the index knee; (3) radiological confirmation of OA grades 2 to 4 noted within 12 months of enrollment; (4) Oxford Knee Score (OKS) of 35 or less; (5) positive diagnostic genicular nerve block (defined as a decrease of &#x02265;50% in NRS score); and (6) if the patient was taking an opioid or other morphine-equivalent medication, the dose must have been clinically stable (&#x0003c;10% change in dosage for &#x02265;2 months prior to the screening visit). Exclusion criteria included (1) body mass index of greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and (2) history of systemic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or uncontrolled diabetes, cancer, previous total knee arthroplasty, previous knee RF block or ablation, or coagulopathy.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Study Subject Demographics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aap-43-84-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>Described here is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter (eleven sites) clinical study with a parallel-group design to compare CRFA utilizing the Coolief System (Halyard Health Inc, Alpharetta, Georgia) with IAS injection. Enrolled subjects underwent CRFA or corticosteroid injection in a 1:1 randomization scheme, and study follow-up visits occurred at 1, 3, and 6 months after study interventions. At the 6-month follow-up visit, patients randomized to the IAS cohort were allowed to &#x0201c;cross over&#x0201d; and receive CRFA treatment.</p><p>Subjects were permitted to use analgesics as needed during the study, but the total daily dose had to be the equivalent of or less than 60 mg of morphine at intake. Dosing for membrane stabilizers and antidepressants for pain remained constant throughout the study, unless approved otherwise by the investigator.

Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the index knee was performed using fluoroscopic visualization of anatomical landmarks for proper cooled radiofrequency (CRF) probe placement (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Subjects were placed supine on a radiolucent table, with the treatment knee slightly flexed on a bolster. After anesthetizing the skin and soft tissue, a 75- or 100-mm, 17-gauge CRF introducer was placed at the appropriate locations. If blood or fluid was observed after removing the stylet, the CRF probe was repositioned and reaspirated. True lateral fluoroscopic visualization, making sure to account for valgus or varus deformities, confirmed accurate probe positioning at 50% depth of the femur and tibia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). A 4-mm, 18-gauge, internally cooled active tip electrode was placed into the introducer needle, and positioning was reaffirmed in the anteroposterior (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) and lateral (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) fluoroscopic views. Motor stimulation at 2.0 V established no muscular contractions, and sensory stimulation at less than 0.5 V in all 3 locations reproduced concordant knee pain. Motor stimulation was required in all cases solely as an additional safety check to ensure that there were no motor nerves present in the area being lesioned. The optional sensory stimulation provided supplemental confirmation that the target nerve locations identified during blocks were accurate and ensured proximity of the probe to each of these nerves prior to lesioning. Most of the initially treated subjects required local anesthesia, whereas 19 (28%) of the 67 required conscious sedation.</p><p>Each neural element was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine prior to CRFA at 60&#x000b0;C for 150 seconds. The heat generated from the RF energy produces thermal energy with average maximum tissue temperatures greater than 80&#x000b0;C.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The needles were then removed, and study subjects were allowed to properly recover prior to discharge. All subjects were discharged to home with instructions for self-care.</p></sec><sec><title>Intra-Articular Steroid Injection</title><p>Study subjects randomized to IAS underwent 1 corticosteroid injection in the index knee. Subjects were placed supine, with the index knee prepared in a sterile fashion. A topical anesthesia was accomplished using ethyl chloride spray or local anesthetic. An appropriately sized needle per the investigator's routine practice was placed into the suprapatellar pouch, and a steroid dose equivalent to 40 mg Depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone acetate) was injected into the joint space. Across the study, Depo-Medrol, Kenalog (triamcinolone topical), and betamethasone were used in 70%, 18%, and 12% of treatments, respectively. Subjects were discharged to home with instructions for self-care.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects whose knee pain was reduced by 50% or greater from baseline at 6 months after treatment.

Outcome data were captured according to subjects' impressions made during the week preceding data collection at each study visit (baseline to 6 months).</p><p>All subjects were evaluated for adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) at each visit. Adverse events were any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study procedure, regardless of relationship to the device.

None of the SAEs were related to the study treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussions"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Cooled radiofrequency ablation reduced index knee pain by at least 50% at 6 months in 74.1% of treated subjects compared with 16.2% in the IAS-treated subjects. Consistent with this, the LOCF data revealed that the number of subjects who experienced at least a 50% drop in pain at 6 months was higher in the CRFA group (67.2%; 95% CI, 55.9&#x02013;78.4) than in the IAS group (15.7%; 95% CI, 7.2&#x02013;24.2). The CRFA group consistently experienced greater pain relief throughout the study, with a mean NRS reduction of 4.9 compared with 1.3 in the IAS group at 6 months. A greater proportion of CRFA study subjects (60%) reported low-level residual knee pain (NRS score &#x02264;2 at 6 months) compared with the IAS study group (7%).</p><p>At 6 months, a greater proportion of the CRFA group (40%) reported satisfactory knee function on the OKS compared with the IAS group (3%). Patient self-perceived overall health status (GPE) improved in 91% of the CRFA compared with 24% in the IAS group. A greater proportion of the CRFA cohort (36%) compared with the IAS cohort (3%) experienced both low-level (NRS score &#x02264;2) index knee pain and concurrent satisfactory knee joint function (OKS &#x02265;40) at 6 months. Despite statistically significant reduction in knee pain and disability, concomitant opioid analgesic use was not different between the 2 groups and remained similar to baseline use. Possible reasons for this include the fact that (1) the study protocol did not include a plan to wean opioids; (2) 43% and 60% of patients in the CRFA and IAS groups who were taking opioids as of the study's baseline assessment were using such medication for medical indications beyond OA-related knee pain; and (3) patients who were using opioids at baseline indicated that they had been taking that medication for a significant period of time (mean, 2.3 [SD, 3.3] and 2.4 [3.4] years, CRFA and IAS, respectively) before the study's inception. Thus, the study's ability to identify a decrease in opioid usage was limited given these findings. Further research in a patient population using opioids strictly for OA-related knee pain would eliminate the confounding nature of opioid use in this current study and may reveal opioid use changes that are commensurate with the respective effects of CRFA and IAS on pain in this study. In contrast, a reduction in nonopioid analgesic medication did occur coupled with improvements in pain and function.</p><p>The results of IAS injection seen in this research are consistent with those that previously cited the limited effectiveness of corticosteroid injections to elicit analgesia for those with knee OA.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These results suggest that, compared with a single IAS, CRFA provides a clinically meaningful reduction in knee pain associated with improved knee function.</p><p>Cooled radiofrequency ablation is a safe, target-specific treatment that can be performed on an outpatient basis with minimal sedation required and in a short period (typically &#x0003c;45 minutes). As ablated peripheral nerves regenerate,<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> knee pain and disability may reemerge. Longer-term (12-month) data are being gathered to assess the durability of the treatment effect beyond 6 months. As has been reported with medial branch neurotomy,<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> repeat neuroablative procedures reinstate pain relief. Therefore, if the index knee pain eventually did return, repeating the CRFA procedure would be reasonable and sensible, especially if in the interim the patient enjoys reduction in pain, disability, and the need for less specific oral analgesics.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the following: the comparison group (IAS subjects) underwent a singular injection rather than multiple IAS injections, and the 6-month time point at which the primary outcome was assessed is not consistent with the expected duration of effectiveness of a steroid injection.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The IAS injections are not truly a &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; intervention, given that corticosteroids are analgesics.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This was an open-label trial, and so not all study site observers were blinded to procedures. To help mitigate this bias, questionnaires (ie, NRS, OKS, GPE) were self-administered by study subjects. Medication diaries were not used to record medication usage in this study, which introduced potential for error and/or inability to identify acute changes in medication dosage during the study. The effect of each treatment on opioid use for OA-related knee pain could not be specifically measured, because patients in both study groups used opioids for medical indications other than OA-related knee pain. Although there were no specific mobility instructions for the affected joint or a medication utilization protocol, the study outcomes were not influenced by these standardization absences.</p><p>Nonetheless, the findings of this study indicate that CRFA (Coolief) for genicular nerve ablation is superior to a single corticosteroid injection in osteoarthritic subjects for managing knee pain. Cooled radiofrequency ablation is a safe and effective nonopioid option for managing pain and improving physical function and quality of life (ie, based on OKS and GPE results) for patients with OA-related knee pain compared with IAS injection.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Financial support was provided to each of the investigator's institutions by Halyard Health, Inc, to cover the budgeted costs necessary to conduct this study protocol.
