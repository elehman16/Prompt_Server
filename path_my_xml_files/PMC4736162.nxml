The number of injections in the dose escalation of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is small for some currently used hypoallergenic allergoids, but can still be inconvenient to patients and can impair compliance. The aim of this trial was to compare safety and tolerability of an accelerated to the conventional dose escalation scheme of a grass pollen allergoid.
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In an open label phase II trial, 122 patients were 1:1 randomized for SCIT using a grass pollen allergoid with an accelerated dose escalation comprising only 4 weekly injections (Group I) or a conventional dose escalation including 7 weekly injections (Group II).

For more than 100&#x000a0;years, grass pollen allergy has been treated with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) applying increasing allergen doses to reach the efficacious maintenance phase. SCIT was demonstrated to be effective in both allergic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Like all long-term treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], adherence to SCIT is affected by a number of factors. One of the most relevant factors is inconvenience related to commuting to receive the allergy injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Accelerated dose escalation allows patients to reach effective doses faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], while increasing the adherence to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The shift from aqueous extracts to depot preparations, adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide or other adjuvants, allows the number of injections to be reduced significantly. Cluster and rush schemes were introduced with the aim of further accelerating the dose escalation. However, these schemes carry an increased risk of severe systemic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The development of chemically modified allergens (so-called high-dose hypoallergenic preparations or allergoids) achieved the combined goal of accelerating dose escalation and administering therapeutic doses with a reduced potential for side effects while maintaining immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Grass pollen allergoids have been demonstrated to be effective and safe when seven preseasonal injections were used to reach the maintenance dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Accelerated dose escalation schemes with different allergoid preparations have also been demonstrated to be safe and effective in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an accelerated dose escalation scheme for a grass pollen allergoid, allowing the recommended maintenance dose to be reached within a time span of 3&#x000a0;weeks only. This accelerated dose escalation scheme can reduce the inconvenience to patients and improve the attractiveness of SCIT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par19">This was a randomized open label phase II multicentre clinical trial performed in Germany.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">This trial demonstrates that the dose escalation of a high-dose grass pollen allergoid for SCIT can be accelerated to 4 injections in weekly intervals with acceptable safety and good tolerability profiles, overall comparable to those of the conventional dose escalation scheme comprising 7 injections. As expected we observed an increase of systemic events during the accelerated dose escalation corresponding to the high amount of major allergen in the vaccine. However, type and intensity of AEs, drug-related AEs, and systemic reactions were similar between the patients receiving SCIT in the accelerated dose escalation and the patients treated in the conventional scheme. An accelerated dose escalation phase offers several advantages. First of all, it allows the patients to reach the recommended maintenance dose faster. Clinical benefits and immunological responses of SCIT have been shown to appear very shortly after the maintenance dose has been reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Accelerating the dose escalation phase also addresses the issue of adherence to allergen immunotherapy (AIT). It is known from several studies, that the efficacy of SCIT, as with all long-term treatments, can be impaired by poor compliance, even if it can be argued that it is better than in sublingual AIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Lack of compliance is a restraint against AIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, in one study comparing the adherence to rush and conventional dose escalation schemes, the majority of patients who terminated were found in the conventional dose escalation group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Accelerating the dose escalation phase to a duration of 3&#x000a0;weeks, as done in this trial, could reduce inconveniences and increase treatment adherence. Several studies with this aim have evaluated the safety of accelerated dose escalation phases for aeroallergen extracts, either by reducing the number of injections or by adopting rush or cluster schemes. Rush schemes seem to carry a higher risk of systemic reactions; in comparison, cluster schemes are characterized by a better benefit/risk ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, we were able to show that an acceleration of the dose escalation was safe and well-tolerated, though we saw a higher frequency in local reactions and mild systemic events.</p><p id="Par41">The majority of patients and investigators rated the accelerated scheme tolerability as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d;. Some differences in tolerability can also be explained by the open label study design: for safety reasons patients in Group I had to wait 120&#x000a0;min after the injection, and the Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines (Paul-Ehrlich-Institute) requested that all patients in the accelerated dose escalation group were asked to carry a single use indwelling catheter with them during each injection. Therefore, patients in the accelerated dose escalation group may have experienced more psychological stress prior to and after allergen injection than patients treated with the conventional scheme. Nevertheless, the tolerability rating by the patients was positive in both schemes. The difference in the tolerability rating by the investigators may also be explained by the open study design and the additional efforts imposed on the investigators.</p><p id="Par42">Meanwhile, regulatory authorities in Germany have granted marketing authorization for the accelerated updosing scheme of the investigated study drug. Efficacy of the study drug has been shown in double-blind, placebo controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], where in the latter trial a cumulative dose of 12,000 BU per protocol resulted in clinical benefit after one pre-seasonal updosing course. Patients during this study received per protocol a cumulative dose of 20.800 TU (group I) and 24.000 TU (group II), including 2 additional maintenance doses after updosing, respectively.</p><p id="Par43">The efficacy of AIT is known to be dose-dependent at maintenance-dose level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Examination of modified updosing schemes did not alter the induction of systemic IgG4 responses in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">In conclusion, the dose escalation scheme of a grass pollen allergoid can be accelerated from the conventional 7&#x02013;4 injections in weekly intervals with comparable safety and tolerability profiles. This accelerated dose escalation is expected to attract more patients to undergo SCIT and benefit from its clinical and immunological effects.
