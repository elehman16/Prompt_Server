We hypothesized that pharmacological GABAergic modulation attenuates BOLD responses, and that blood concentrations of a positive allosteric modulator of GABA correlate inversely with BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex. We investigated whether or not pure task-related negative BOLD responses were co-localized with pharmacologically modulated BOLD responses. Twenty healthy adults received either 5 mg diazepam or placebo in a double blind, randomized design. During fMRI the subjects performed a working memory task. Results showed that BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex were inversely correlated with diazepam blood concentrations; that is, the higher the blood diazepam concentration, the lower the BOLD response. This inverse correlation was most pronounced in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. For subjects with diazepam plasma concentration &#x0003e; 0.1 mg/L we observed negative BOLD responses with respect to fixation baseline. There was minor overlap between cingulate regions with task-related negative BOLD responses and regions where the BOLD responses were inversely correlated with diazepam concentration. We interpret that the inverse correlation between the BOLD response and diazepam was caused by GABA-related neural inhibition. Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that GABA attenuates BOLD responses in fMRI. The minimal overlap between task-related negative BOLD responses and responses attenuated by diazepam suggests that these responses might be caused by different mechanisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Link&#x000f6;ping University and the County Council of &#x000d6;sterg&#x000f6;tland are gratefully acknowledged for financial support.

Introduction</title><p>Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reflect hemodynamic responses to neural activation [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the responses can become either positive or negative in relation to baseline activity. Positive BOLD responses can be explained by activated neurons that cause increased metabolic demands with accompanying increases of cerebral blood flow and volume [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent findings, however, suggest that positive BOLD responses are associated with vasodilatation mediated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, there are only limited data that explain the neurovascular mechanisms to the frequently observed negative BOLD responses in fMRI [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>A few studies indicate an association between BOLD responses and the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In these studies, GABA concentrations were measured during rest with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and the BOLD responses were measured subsequently during visual or emotional processing. It has also been shown that a positive allosteric modulator of GABA (GABA-PAM) further lowers the negative BOLD response during emotional processing [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other studies have reported dose-dependent relations between GABA-PAMs and decreased cerebral blood flow [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and dose-dependent attenuation of BOLD responses during emotional processing [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, pharmacodynamics vary widely between individuals, and the relationship between the effective plasma concentrations of GABA-PAMs and BOLD responses has not been investigated yet.</p><p>In the current study, we have therefore investigated the relation between plasma concentrations of the GABA-PAM diazepam (DZ) and the BOLD responses in healthy subjects during executive processing. In a previous study we investigated the potential effects of DZ on brain activation, and found no drug-related effects [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, in that study we did not examine negative BOLD responses and we did not take individual plasma concentrations of the GABA-PAM into account. Given lead by previous studies reporting correlations between the GABA system and the vascular response in the cingulate cortex [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the paramount role of the cingulate cortex in executive processing [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the relation between GABA levels measured by MRS and negative BOLD responses in the default mode network (DMN) during working memory processing [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we decided to investigate the effect of the GABA-PAM DZ on BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex during working memory performance. More specifically, we aimed to investigate if pharmacologic GABAergic modulation influences BOLD responses in task-related cingulate regions, or if the pharmacologically modulated responses occur elsewhere in the cingulate cortex. This research contributes importantly to the understanding of the neural mechanisms behind the BOLD response; an issue, which recently has gained much interest and is a matter of debate.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 Subjects</title><p>Twenty healthy adults (10 males and 10 females) aged between 20 to 30 years (mean age = 25 years) were recruited to the study by advertisement. Two of the female subjects were left-handed; the other 18 subjects were right-handed. In a questionnaire administered before the study process, the subjects signed a declaration of health indicating no health problems that could interfere with the study. The questionnaire included questions about alcohol or drug abuse, cognitive impairments such as memory and attention dysfunction, brain surgery, and present use of pharmaceuticals. All subjects signed informed consent and the study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Link&#x000f6;ping (Dnr 03&#x02013;528) and the Swedish Medical Products Agency.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 Study design</title><p>The study had a double blind, randomized, counter-balanced, crossover, and placebo-controlled design. A randomization list and envelopes containing either compressed and non-coated DZ or placebo tablets were prepared by a third party not participating in the study (Apoteket AB, Sweden). Each subject received 5 mg DZ perorally at one fMRI session and placebo at the other. The distribution half-life of DZ is approximately 40 minutes. We used DZ at low dose to obtain &#x02018;minimal sedation&#x02019;, which has been defined as &#x02018;normal response to verbal stimuli&#x02019;; <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., the subject responds normally to verbal commands although cognitive functions may be impaired (American Society of Anesthesiologists, ASA). As the study had a counter-balanced design, half of the subjects received DZ on the first fMRI session and the other half on the second session.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>2.3 Procedure</title><p>All subjects went through three separate MRI examinations on three different occasions, namely: 1) structural MRI, 2) DZ fMRI, and 3) placebo fMRI. On the first occasion, the subjects were informed about the study, and they were examined by structural MRI in order to allow them to be acquainted with the MRI environment. Both fMRI sessions were separated by at least one, and at most six weeks. During the fMRI sessions, three different tasks in randomized order for each subject were administered: 1) working memory (WM), 2) word fluency, and 3) finger tapping (results of the word fluency and finger tapping tasks are not reported here).</p><p>The subjects were instructed not to take alcohol or other drugs for 24 h before the fMRI examinations. In addition, they were firmly instructed not to intake products containing caffeine or nicotine on the examination day. At the fMRI session, the subjects were administered DZ or a placebo approximately 30 minutes before the scanning started. Blood plasma samples for measurements of DZ concentration were collected immediately before and approximately 45 minutes (range 37&#x02013;68 minutes) after the administration of the drug. We aimed to collect blood samples in the middle of the investigation in order to obtain diazepam concentrations as close to the fMRI task as possible. However, due technical issues and previous scans not being completed in time the second blood samples were sometimes drawn later than planned.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>2.4 Blood sample analysis</title><p>Plasma samples were analyzed for DZ concentration at the National Board of Forensic Medicine, Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden. After adding prazepam as an internal standard, each sample was extracted at pH 7. The extract was analyzed with gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II GC, Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, USA). The chromatograph was temperature-programmed. The accuracy of the analysis method was controlled by repeated measurements: five replicates of two low-concentration samples (0.005 and 0.010 mg/g). The coefficient of variation (CV) was 4.08% and 2.00% respectively. More details of the analytic method are reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>2.5 Task design</title><p>The n-back working memory paradigm had a block design with 30 s in each block. The paradigm consisted of three blocks: 0-back, 1-back, and 2-back. All blocks were presented in randomized order with four repetitions of each block. Periods with fixation on a crosshair during 20 s were administrated before the first task set, comprising three n-back blocks presented in randomized order, and after each task set. During the n-back tasks, series of letters were displayed one at a time and the subjects were asked to determine: a) if the current letter was the same as a specified target letter (0-back or baseline); b) if the current letter was the same as the previously presented letter (1-back); c) If the current letter was the same as the letter presented two letters previously (2-back). Each letter was presented for 0.5 s followed by a blank screen, which was displayed for 1.5 s. Each n-back block comprised 15 events (= presented letters), of which four were targets. The level of the upcoming n-back task was indicated on the screen during 5 s before each task block. Total duration of the task was 8 min and 40 s.</p><p>The tasks were presented using a back projection screen viewed via a mirror mounted on the head coil. The participants responded to the given task using a response box (Photon Control Inc., Burnaby, Canada). Response time and accuracy were measured as behavioral performance. The fMRI paradigm was designed using the SuperLab software (Cedrus Corporation, San Pedro, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>2.6 fMRI data acquisition</title><p>An echo planar imaging (EPI) gradient echo sequence optimized for BOLD contrast was used to acquire fMRI data on a Philips Achieva 1.5 T scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands).

The images were firstly corrected for different acquisition timing using sinc interpolation. Thereafter the images were realigned to the mean image to correct for subject movement during scanning.

Finally, the images were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space with voxel size 3x3x3 mm<sup>3</sup>, and smoothed with an 8 mm Gaussian filter to ameliorate differences in intersubject localization.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>2.7.2 First level analysis</title><p>The EPI images were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) implemented in SPM8. To estimate the BOLD responses in each subject, we used the canonical hemodynamic response function implemented in SPM8 and its temporal derivative. Each condition of the n-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) was modeled separately in the GLM analysis. The fixation period was regarded as a short pause and thus not modeled explicitly. Parameters from the movement correction were included as nuisance variables in the GLM to statistically control for signal change related to head motion. In addition, we applied a high-pass filter with cut-off at 128 s and the AR(1) autocorrelation model type. Here, we estimated the BOLD responses during the most difficult condition of the WM task. We did so by calculating contrast images representing differences in the BOLD responses between the 2-back condition and the 0-back condition, which was regarded as a controlled low-level activation baseline. The contrasts were based on the hemodynamic response function and not on its temporal derivative, which was included as a nuisance variable.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>2.7.3 Second level analysis</title><p>In the second level analysis in SPM8, we assessed whole brain positive and negative BOLD responses by one-sample t-tests of random effects using the contrast images from the placebo session.

In this way we could analyze for regions that were more activated during the DZ session compared to the placebo session and vice versa.</p><p>We aimed to investigate which regions of the brain that had BOLD responses that were directly correlated to DZ concentration. Therefore, the plasma DZ levels were included as covariates of interest in the second level analyses of the DZ session. In this way, the correlations between BOLD responses and DZ concentrations in each image voxel were calculated. The contrast estimates from the image voxel with highest correlation between BOLD responses and DZ concentrations were extracted for each subject as measures of brain responses to DZ treatment for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling (see section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">2.12</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>2.8 Regions of interest</title><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate if DZ attenuates brain activation in the cingulate cortex during a working memory task. Therefore we did small volume corrections within the entire cingulate cortex to investigate if there were any pure task-related effects or evidence for DZ-modulation of brain activation during the working memory task. In follow-up analyses, we investigated these effects in cingulate subregions by making statistical analyses in predefined regions of interest (ROI) in the cingulate cortex based on cytoarchitecture and functional studies. The cingulate cortex is divided into four main sub-regions with different cytoarchitectures and functions: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the midcingulate cortex (MCC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PPC), and the retrosplenial cortex [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ACC is further subdivided into a subgenual (sACC) and a pregenual (pACC) portion, which are thought to be involved with affective and autonomic responses, and emotional integration, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

The role of the PCC is multifaceted; it is thought to be involved in diverse functions such as autobiographical memory, spatial learning, and mind wandering [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Furthermore, subjects with high DZ concentration had negative BOLD responses with respect to the fixation baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148737.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Prior studies have shown a general GABA-related reduction of cerebral blood flow [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Reduction of cerebral blood flow is typically connected to increased BOLD responses [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, if the blood flow reduction is caused by neural inhibition, this will lead to attenuated or negative BOLD responses [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, we interpret our findings being caused by GABA mediated neural inhibition (see also discussion in Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec033">4.4</xref>).</p><p>GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain and is therefore essential in the regulation of synaptic activity. GABA-PAMs enhance neural inhibition by increasing chloride influx through the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the relation between inhibitory neurotransmitters and the BOLD response is a matter of debate.</p><p>The BOLD response depends on changes in local deoxyhemoglobin content, which are caused by two separate effects: 1) the hemodynamic response related to increased cerebral blood flow as well as volume, 2) the metabolic response related to increased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The current view is that a positive BOLD response is related to synaptic activity mediated by glutamate in excitatory neurons [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; however, it has been shown that inhibitory neurons also produce increased BOLD responses in some cases [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although negative BOLD responses have been explained by decreases in cerebral blood flow due to blood flow redistribution [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or increases in CMRO<sub>2</sub> without accompanying cerebral blood flow increase [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], previous research suggest that negative BOLD responses are related to neural inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Human and animal studies suggest that negative BOLD responses are caused by direct neural inhibition. Elevated endogenous GABA levels have been shown to correlate with decreased BOLD responses in rats [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], indicating that negative BOLD responses are associated with GABA-related neuronal inhibition. In humans, Northoff and co-workers demonstrated that the resting-state GABA concentrations in ACC predicted the amount of negative BOLD responses in subsequent fMRI; the higher total concentration of GABA, the stronger the negative BOLD response became, suggesting that GABA mediates negative BOLD responses in the ACC [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A recent study by Hu and co-workers also reported that endogenous GABA levels correlate inversely with BOLD responses in the DMN during a working memory task [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>4.3 GABA-related BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex</title><p>A striking feature of our results is the sparse overlap between sub-regions with pure <italic>task-related</italic> BOLD responses and sub-regions with <italic>DZ-modulated</italic> responses. That is to say, the clusters in pACC and aMCC where DZ attenuated the BOLD responses were not primarily found in sub-regions showing pure task-related negative BOLD responses. Therefore, this suggests that the structure and location of the DZ receptor might differ from the GABA receptor that is responsible for the pure task-related negative BOLD response in the cingulate cortex. This might be in part due to the known variation of GABA receptor concentration across the human brain [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and across the cingulate cortex [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>We observed significant task-related negative BOLD responses in pACC and in the posterior parts of the cingulate cortex (pMCC and PPC).

Relevant to our study, GABA-PAM mediated reduction of cerebral blood flow has specifically been observed in the cingulate cortex [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Krause and co-workers also reported strong inverse correlation between GABA levels measured in the ACC and whole-brain blood flow [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] indicating that our results might be caused by vascular effects of DZ unrelated to neural activity. As regions where we found significant inverse correlations between DZ and BOLD responses are located in brain areas with large vessels, we made post-hoc analyses of BOLD responses in the anterior insula where the middle cerebral artery passes through. In the anterior insula, we found no significant DZ-effects or trends thereof. We also made post-hoc analyses of DZ-related responses in the cingulate and anterior insular cortices during the 1-back condition in our working memory task, and also during the verbal fluency task administered in this study (descriptions of the verbal fluency task is found in [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). We found no trends of DZ-modulated responses in either of these post-hoc analyses. We therefore conclude that DZ modulation of the BOLD response is neural in origin and related to the task performed during fMRI.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>4.5 Negative BOLD response and the default mode network</title><p>In the present study we found task-related negative BOLD responses in pACC, pMCC, and PCC during executive processing. Anterior and posterior regions of the cingulate cortex are considered to be parts of DMN as suggested by Raichle and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. DMN is defined as the brain network that is most active during the &#x02018;resting state&#x02019;, when the individual is mind wandering and not focusing on external stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. When an individual is focusing on external stimuli, the regions belonging to the DMN consistently show negative BOLD responses [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], or down-regulation of these regions. These task-related negative BOLD responses are believed to optimize performance by reducing interference from task-irrelevant areas in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that the more difficult the task is, the greater the negative BOLD response becomes [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148737.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Moreover, momentary lapses in attention during cognitive tasks have been associated with less negative BOLD response in the DMN [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Greicius <italic>et al</italic>. studied DMN connectivity during conscious sedation with a GABA-PAM and found that DMN functional connectivity persisted during sedation [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>4.6 Strengths and limitations</title><p>The present study had several methodological strengths. The risk of an intersession effect was reduced by an initial adaptation scan, and the number of subjects was adequate (n = 20). Furthermore, the administered DZ dose was low, ensuring minimal sedation and unperturbed normal response to verbal stimuli. The small modulatory doses of DZ given in the present study did not significantly influence the subjects&#x02019; performance, measured as the number of correct responses and reaction time. This was in our view an important aspect of the experimental design. Nevertheless, it is known that benzodiazepines influence performance in a variety of tasks [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Especially, it is known that benzodiazepines impair higher cognitive function such as attention, memory, or planning [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. One limitation of the present study was that we did not investigate the subjects&#x02019; cognitive function by also administrating more challenging tasks, which might have shown DZ-related performance decreases.</p><p>Another particular strength of our study is that DZ plasma concentration was modeled using a non-linear dose-response analysis, to retrospectively control for individual variations in DZ metabolism. However, although small, non-sedative doses of DZ are often prescribed as calming drugs, the low DZ plasma concentration in some subjects, may nevertheless suggest that more individualized dosage by for example controlling for body weight, length and sex could be explored in future studies. The pharmacokinetic model in the present study suggests that DZ plasma concentration of at least 2.0 &#x003bc;g/kgBW is necessary to obtain 50% of the maximal BOLD response. Although we did control for individual variability regarding pharmacokinetics at the actual time of the experiment, it did not affect the results. According to a pharmacokinetic study by Friedman and co-workers the peak DZ plasma concentration occurs after 0.5 h after administration [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In that study it was also shown that the plasma concentration increases rapidly to a maximum and thereafter decays slowly during several few hours. Shader <italic>et al</italic>. reported similar observations [<xref rid="pone.0148737.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is possible that the blood samples for DZ analysis were taken too early after administration in some subjects. It is also possible that some subjects had a full stomach, which might have slowed the absorption. Another limitation of the present study was that the subjective levels of consciousness were not explicitly measured (such as by self-rating of the sedative effect), although reaction time and task performance were determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>5 Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated inverse dose-response correlation between DZ concentration and BOLD response in the cingulate cortex. Our interpretation is that the inverse correlation between DZ and the BOLD response was caused by GABA-related neural inhibition. A particularly interesting finding was that brain regions with DZ-related BOLD responses did only sparsely overlap with brain regions demonstrating task-related negative BOLD responses. The minor overlap between task-related BOLD responses and responses attenuated by DZ suggests that these responses might be caused by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec037"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148737.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>The supporting information file PlosOneDataDZ.zip contains image and header files relevant to the current manuscript.</title><p>The file 2-backPositive.img contains results from the one-sample t-test of brain activation during the 2-back working memory task obtained during the placebo session.
