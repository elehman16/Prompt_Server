The text has been edited by the RIAT authors but no new material has been introduced.</p><p>The CEA Second-Look Trial was intended to recruit at least 2000 patients over 3&#x02005;years and to follow them for 5&#x02005;years. The study was specifically designed with late randomisation in order to maximise statistical power. It was originally intended to recruit 2000 patients with the anticipation that about 25% would show a CEA rise as the first evidence of possible recurrence. This number would have provided 95% power to detect an improvement in 2-year survival from the second-look procedure from 25% to 55% at &#x003b1;=0.05. The protocol stated that for the trial to be stopped prematurely very stringent levels of significance (p&#x0003c;0.001) would be used. Analyses of the randomised groups were to be by Kaplan-Meier lifetables and the logrank test on &#x02018;intention to treat&#x02019; (Northover and Houghton, 1994, unpublished work).</p><p>Their intentions were explicitly set out as follows in 1981 (Slack WW, Public Health Service Grant Application to NIH, 1981, personal communication):<disp-quote><p>So far as society in general is concerned<italic>,</italic> if CEA monitoring is shown to be of benefit in this study<italic>,</italic> then it will be a powerful incentive to the great majority of surgeons who see no obvious advantage in routine CEA monitoring to adopt the technique<italic>;</italic> as colorectal cancer is the second commonest killing cancer in the Western world<italic>,</italic> the benefits would thus be enormous. If, however, CEA monitoring is shown to be of no long term therapeutic value then it should cease to be used in its presently available form, and patients will thereby be spared the &#x02018;needless anxiety&#x02019;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> of premature knowledge of their impending death.</p></disp-quote></p><p>The CEA trial design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004385F3">figure 3</xref>) was devised so that clinical follow-up would remain unbiased, and allow specific evaluation of the role of CEA-indicated surgery in the treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer. After potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer, all eligible patients were to be monitored identically using conventional clinical follow-up together with regular CEA assay, performed centrally. Clinicians would not be informed of the result. When a &#x02018;significant&#x02019; CEA rise was recorded, patients were to be randomised by the Trials Centre into either &#x02018;Aggressive&#x02019; or &#x02018;Conventional&#x02019; arms. In the case of patients in the &#x02018;Aggressive&#x02019; arm, the clinician would immediately be informed of the CEA rise so that the patient could be urgently screened to exclude widespread metastatic disease or a non-malignant cause for the CEA rise. If neither was found, and the patient was medically fit for operation, the protocol required second-look surgery to locate and remove any treatable recurrence. In the case of patients in the &#x02018;Conventional&#x02019; arm, the clinician would not be informed of the &#x02018;significant&#x02019; CEA rise nor of the fact that they had been randomised to not have the CEA rise revealed.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004385F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the Second-Look Surgery Trial from the 1982 protocol (Slack <italic>et <underline>al</underline></italic>, 1982, unpublished work).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004385f03"/></fig><p>The primary outcome was survival based on death certification through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS; now called the Office for National Statistics (ONS)).

If a &#x02018;significant&#x02019; rise in CEA occurred, the record of the patient was reviewed at the Trials Centre and provided no evidence of suspected colorectal or other disease was recorded in the CRF, the patient was randomised either into an &#x02018;Aggressive&#x02019; or &#x02018;Conventional&#x02019; arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004385F4">figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004385F4" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Decision-making algorithm for CEA to trigger second-look surgery.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013004385f04"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients were randomised equally between the two arms (1:1). Patients whose compliance was between 50% and 70% or whose immediate postoperative sample had not been received within the 4&#x02013;6-week guideline were randomised in a separate stratum. Randomisation was also stratified by participating clinician. A block size of two was used in order to maintain as close a balance as possible between the two treatment arms.</p><p>If the patient was randomised to the &#x02018;Aggressive&#x02019; arm the clinician was informed of the rise immediately by telephone from the trial centre and subsequently in writing and was requested to contact the patient urgently. Patients were informed of their situation including the fact that they had been randomised within the trial to undergo a second-look procedure. This was then undertaken if the patient gave written informed consent. The surgeon carried out a full clinical workup to exclude the possibility of a non-malignant cause for the CEA rise (eg, change in smoking or drinking habit) and to identify any incurable distant spread. In the absence of these conditions the surgeon undertook a mini-laparotomy, proceeding to full laparotomy with macroscopic clearance of disease, should this be possible.</p><p>For patients randomised to the &#x02018;Conventional&#x02019; arm no further action was taken; the clinician was neither informed that the CEA had risen nor that the patient had been randomised.</p><p>If at any stage a patient in the study developed clinical evidence of recurrent disease the clinician was at liberty to manage the patient according to usual practice. If the disease was in the abdomen and was thought to be treatable by a second-look operation with re-resection, this was acceptable. By the nature of the trial design, the clinician was blind as to whether such patients had been randomised to the &#x02018;Conventional&#x02019; arm of the trial or had not been randomised because the CEA had failed to denote the presence of recurrent disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Second<italic>-</italic>look laparotomy</title><p>The surgeon was expected to perform a thorough inspection of the abdominal cavity to locate any recurrent disease. Initially a mini-laparotomy was performed; if widespread tumour was detected all that was required prior to closure, was biopsy. Otherwise following a full excision, bimanual palpation of the old scar, inspection and palpation of the pelvic cavity, the small bowel, the mesentery, the retroperitoneum, the colon and rectum and the anastomosis was undertaken. The liver was fully mobilised to determine whether any tumour was present. Detailed dissection of the pelvic and retroperitoneal areas and therapeutic resection were then carried out with the objective of total extirpation of all recurrence. Complete data recording of the procedure along with the results of the histology of all potentially involved sites was required by the trial&#x02019;s office.</p><p>For patients in whom a radical resection was achieved after second-look surgery (motivated either on clinical information or because the patient had been randomised to the &#x02018;Aggressive&#x02019; arm) the follow-up schedules for clinical examination and blood sampling reverted to those following the primary operation.

Chris McConkey e-mail 1 October 2009, unpublished work and Gray R. Richard Gray e-mail 1 October 2009, unpublished work). We found that the data on paper and on file were accessible and we had no reason to doubt the veracity of individual items. We found that the electronic files had numerous problems with formatting which made the files on the 1447 individual patients difficult to handle but that the data entries were not themselves corrupted.</p><p>One of the RIAT restorative authors (KM) had worked in the Trials Centre during the time the CEA trial data were being accrued and knew the systems in use and their changes but was not directly involved in this trial at any stage.</p><p>The questions raised and the problems encountered were resolved as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The codes indicating that a patient had met the criteria for CEA elevation and whether they were randomised to &#x02018;Aggressive&#x02019; or &#x02018;Conventional&#x02019; arm were preserved and tallied with the number in the 1994 manuscript (Northover and Houghton, 1994, unpublished work).</p></list-item><list-item><p>There were variations in the way dates were recorded in the database. There had been migrations of data from a &#x02018;Prime&#x02019; server using &#x02018;Universe&#x02019; to &#x02018;Excel&#x02019; and the interpretation of the present authors, with information from contemporary witnesses was that in undertaking the task operators did not always correctly specify these data as &#x02018;dates&#x02019; when importing, and/or allowed them to be converted to American date formats. These errors prevented calculations and would have defeated running a survival analysis without correction of the file entries. The dates were however visually readable and not &#x02018;corrupt&#x02019;. Some could be corrected by running current versions of software. Others were manually corrected by re-entering them in a Microsoft date format. Paper records were available to resolve uncertainties.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The next problem was in linking these three groups of patients (randomised to &#x02018;Aggressive&#x02019;, randomised to &#x02018;Conventional&#x02019; and not randomised) to the dates for survival analysis. Individual patients were uniquely identified in the files by seven digit strings to which letters had been added at the beginning and end, possibly for trial administrators&#x02019; checklists or subgroup identification. Once we had established that the initial and terminal letters were redundant for analysis of the primary endpoint, we were able to write the code to restore the seven digit strings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It was evident that the seven digits did not represent a simple sequence but certain positions identified particular characteristics, such as participating centre. We recognised a consistent pattern of mismatch in the fourth digit, a zero in one file was an eight in the other with all other digits remaining the same. It was suggested to us that the fourth digit replacement was used to identify patients suitable for post hoc subgroup analyses but no documentation was found to confirm this. By checking back to the dates of birth we were able to confirm that this systematic correction resolved the problem and most of the data were then usable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>By ranking all the data in the paired files for line by line visual inspection residual discrepancies were identified. Scrutinising the digit strings allowed for seven of the remaining eight pairs to be reconciled and verified on dates of birth. We failed to resolve only 1 of 1447 records in each file. This patient had not been randomised.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Inspection of the accrual of death dates was discontinuous for a couple of years suggesting a lapse in either recovery or entry. The current trials centre obtained permission to re-run the ONS search in July 2012.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In summary, we identified several problems but they were systematic and not random (we would not use the value-laden word &#x02018;corrupted&#x02019;). We were able to rectify the formatting errors and verify that the data used for our analysis were correct. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was re-run.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The original main results 1994</title><p>The study opened to recruitment in November 1982 and was closed by the Working Party, on the acceptance of a recommendation from the DMSC, on 17 February 1993.

CEA monitoring did pick up patients considerably sooner than the clinical methods available at the time by 11&#x02005;months (95% CI 7 to 14&#x02005;months).</p><p>CEA monitoring for the purpose of early detection of asymptomatic cancer is currently recommended at least every 6&#x02005;months in the first 3&#x02005;years.

The methods section of the 1994 manuscript states &#x02018;Subgroup analyses have been performed to address specific issues but these need to be interpreted with appropriate caution&#x02019; (Northover and Houghton, 1994, unpublished work). In the event no completed subset analyses were in the 1994 paper and the closing notes between the authors are on the matter of a subset analysis. We have not attempted any in restoring the trial.</p><p>The answer to the primary research question was clear in 1993 and was the explicit reason for stopping the trial: it was improbable that a benefit from CEA prompted second-look surgery had been missed and in the absence of benefit there was net harm being done to the patients. The forms of second-look surgery now widely practiced in colorectal cancer are liver and lung resection of metastases.
