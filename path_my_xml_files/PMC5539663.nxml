However, the increase in parathyroid hormone in Vitamin D deficiency reduces insulin sensitivity of cells. Moreover, Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory and immune modulating effects and reduces insulin resistance and increased insulin secretion through modulation of the immune system.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In pregnancy, Vitamin D deficiency and Vitamin D insufficiency are also thought to be common. A study in dark- and light-skinned pregnant women residing in the Northern United States found that approximately 29% of dark-skinned pregnant women and 5% of light-skinned pregnant women had Vitamin D deficiency, whereas 54% of dark-skinned participants and 47% of light-skinned participants had Vitamin D insufficiency.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Similar results have been found in Iranian pregnant women.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Differences in latitude have also been shown to influence the concentration of Vitamin D in a majority of pregnant women.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Thus, it may predispose some women to develop diabetes. The resistance stems from the placental secretion of diabetogenic hormones including growth hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, placental lactogen, and progesterone, as well as increased maternal adipose deposition, decreased exercise, and increased caloric intake. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreatic function is not sufficient to overcome the insulin resistance created by changes in diabetogenic hormones during pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency can be associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and insulin tolerance. Results of two systematic reviews showed that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk of GDM and concluded that Vitamin D administration can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is still a serious health problem in pregnant women in Iran, despite Iran being located in a sunny region, pregnant women, and their infants are faced to the risk of Vitamin D deficiency, especially among the low socioeconomic status of Iranian population.</p><p>The aim of this study was survey of the effect of Vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of gestational diabetes in pregnant women referred to gynecology clinics in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial study with Iranian registry of clinical trials code of IRCT201309277513N4, which was carried out on pregnant women referred to obstetric clinics of Alzahra Hospital and Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. The study was conducted from January 2013 for 1 year serum levels of Vitamin D were measured for the participants at the age of 14&#x02013;16 weeks of pregnancy and those with lower serum levels of 10 nmol/L were randomly divided into two groups of A and B using random table. Pregnant women with normal Vitamin D level assigned as Group C. In the table of random numbers for each participant in the study were given a random number and participants were randomly divided into two groups using these numbers. Researcher, the distributors of the drug and the patients, did not know which group was taken the Vitamin D or placebo. After completion of the study, using the label of drug boxes, it was found which patients received the drug and which the placebo. Placebo was omega-3 pearl with the same shape as Vitamin D pearls.</p><p>The pregnant women that referred to gynecology clinic were examined by a gynecologist. Eligible women were informed about the study and intervention, and informed consent was obtained from the participants.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were patients who are willing to participate in the study and signed informed consent, normal body mass index (BMI) that BMI was calculated by measuring height and weight, gestational age (GA) between 14 and 16 weeks that was based on the evaluation of the gynecologist (last menstrual period, or sonography or clinical examination), the absence of a history of Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, and no family history of diabetes in first-degree relatives. Exclusion criteria were discourage patients from continuing to participate in the study, taking Vitamin D supplements incorrect, and unable to follow-up the patients.</p><p>All participants were under glucose tolerance test (GTT), and they had positive GTT were also excluded from the study. GTT was performed in the morning, and the participants were instructed to fast (water is allowed) for 8&#x02013;12 h before the test. At zero time (baseline), blood sample was drawn; then, the participants were given 75 g of glucose in solution to drink within a 5 min time frame. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes can be made in women who meet either of the following criteria: fasting plasma glucose &#x02265;92 mg/dL, but &#x0003c;126 mg/dL at any GA (fasting plasma glucose &#x02265;126 mg/dL is consistent with overt diabetes) and at 24&#x02013;28 weeks of gestation: 75 g 2 h oral GTT with at least one abnormal result: fasting plasma glucose &#x02265;92 mg/dL or 1 h &#x0003e;140 mg/dL or 2 h between 140 and 200 mg/dL.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Flow diagram of study shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-6-79-g001"/></fig><p>Group A was given a Vitamin D supplement of Iranian Drug Corporation of Zahravi dose of 50,000 IU every 2 weeks for 10 weeks, and Group B was not given the supplement and was given placebo.

Three recent case&#x02013;control studies from India, the UK and North Carolina aimed to determine whether early pregnancy 25(OH)D levels were associated with a later diagnosis of GDM.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Results were mixed.

Results of their review showed that the majority of studies reported an inverse relationship between circulating Vitamin D levels and markers of glucose homeostasis associated with gestational diabetes or an increased risk for GDM associated with reduced maternal levels of Vitamin D between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation. Results of their study also showed an association between higher Vitamin D levels and lower fasting glucose and insulin levels.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Some societies consider it unnecessary, and others recommend up to 2000 UI/day. Yu <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that single oral dose of 200,000 IU Vitamin D, a daily supplement of 800 IU Vitamin D from 27 weeks until delivery improved 25(OH)D levels significantly. However, even with supplementation, only a small percentage of women and babies were Vitamin D sufficient.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Some previous cohort studies showed that Vitamin D supplementation likely increases 25(OH)D levels. Supplemented women had less Vitamin D deficiency in three large well-controlled cohorts (<italic>n</italic> = 1539), a similar trend in one poorer quality study (<italic>n</italic> = 201), and no difference in one study with an overall low rate of supplementation (<italic>n</italic> = 559).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Randomized controlled trials of Vitamin D supplementation have consistently shown success in raising 25(OH)D levels in pregnant women and neonates albeit with varying doses of 25(OH)D.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Despite increases with supplementation, 25(OH)D levels remained low in most studies. A recent randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial occurred in pregnant South Carolina women. The treatment arms were 2000 IU Vitamin D daily plus standard prenatal vitamins and 4000 IU Vitamin D daily plus standard prenatal vitamins compared with a placebo arm consisting of a placebo pill plus standard prenatal vitamins. The mean Vitamin D level measured at 36 weeks was 79 nmol/L for the control group, 105 for the 2000 IU group, and 119 for the 4000 IU group. This difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001); however, the levels were higher than most other trials even in the placebo group. In its 2011 report, the Institute of Medicine recommended 600 IU/day of 25(OH)D for pregnant women specifically to support bone metabolism and no more than 4000 IU/day to avoid hypercalcemia.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations and proposes 1000&#x02013;2000 IU/day of 25(OH)D when deficiency is identified (&#x0003c;20 ng/mL).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The results cannot be generalized to all patients, because of genetic and environmental factors may play a role in glucose metabolism. Nonetheless, it is important that Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women should be considered further than before. Because of Vitamin D deficiency can be associated with outcomes such as gestational diabetes.</p><p>The results of this study showed no significant difference between the two groups; however, it still cannot say whether Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of gestational diabetes can be effective or not? And is it a cost-effective prescription?</p><p>Limitations of our study were not measuring Vitamin D in the end of the study and sample size selection from two referral Hospitals in one city.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to the results mentioned Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy due to several complications for mother and fetus is very important and prevention of it is necessary. However, the use of Vitamin D supplements for pregnant women is not universally agreed. Therefore, recommended that future studies on the cost-effectiveness of the use of these supplements during pregnancy be conducted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and
