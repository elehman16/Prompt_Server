Berberine, a major active component of Chinese herbal medicine rhizoma coptidis, has been used to improve insulin resistance to facilitate ovulation induction in women with PCOS but there is no study reporting the live birth or its potential as a complementary treatment to letrozole. We aim to determine the efficacy of letrozole with or without berberine in achieving live births among 660 infertile women with PCOS in Mainland China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study is a multicentre randomised, double-blind trial. The randomisation scheme is coordinated through the central mechanism and stratified by the participating site. Participants are randomised into one of the three treatment arms: (1) letrozole and berberine, (2) letrozole and berberine placebo, or (3) letrozole placebo and berberine. Berberine is administered three times a day (1.5&#x02005;g/day) for up to 24&#x02005;weeks, starting on day 1 after a spontaneous period or a withdrawal bleeding. Either letrozole or letrozole placebo 2.5&#x02005;mg is given daily from day 3 to day 7 of the first three cycles and the dose is increased to 5&#x02005;mg/day in the last three cycles, if not pregnant. The primary hypothesis is that the combination of berberine and letrozole results in a significantly higher live birth rate than letrozole or berberine alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01116167.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by anovulation, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries (PCOs) on scanning and is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age as it affects 5&#x02013;10% of premenopausal women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Insulin resistance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anovulation and infertility in PCOS and abnormalities in insulin action have been noted in a variety of reproductive tissues from women with PCOS and may explain the pleiotropic presentation and multiorgan involvement of the syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>The first-line medical treatment for ovulation induction in PCOS women is clomiphene citrate (CC), which can result in an ovulation rate of 60&#x02013;85% but a conception rate of only about 20%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5 R6">3&#x02013;6</xref> Antioestrogenic effects of CC on the endometrium and cervix mucus are thought to cause the low conception rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Also, CC may have a number of side effects including hot flushes, breast discomfort, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, nervousness, sleeplessness, headache, mood swings, dizziness, hair loss and disturbed vision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, traditionally applied for oestrogen-dependent carcinoma, has been used for ovulation induction for about a decade.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> The effectiveness of letrozole versus CC for ovulation induction has been reviewed by two meta-analyses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> In both meta-analyses that included six randomised controlled trials, it was concluded that even though letrozole was associated with a lower number of mature follicles per cycle, there was no significant difference in the ovulation rate per cycle or the pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or miscarriage rates between letrozole and CC. No difference was found in the live birth rate, although it was only assessed in one meta-analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>Based on the above two meta-analyses, letrozole appears to be at least as effective as CC in ovulation induction with some potential advantages over CC. Although side effects reported by patients in the group receiving CC were higher, while no complication was noted in the group receiving letrozole,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> large sample sized clinical trials are still needed. As far as we know, two large randomised multicentre studies, the Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II (PPCOSII)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> trial and the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> trial are ongoing and can provide definitive evidence for pregnancy outcome with the use of CC versus letrozole.</p><p>Insulin sensitising agents are commonly used as adjunctive medications for women with PCOS and metformin is widely chosen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Although a newly published meta-analysis showed that there was no evidence that metformin improved live birth rates in combination with CC (pooled OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 7 trials and 907 women), the clinical pregnancy rates were higher for the combination of metformin and CC than CC alone (pooled OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.96; 11 trials and 1208 women).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Furthermore, metformin was associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances than placebo (pooled OR 4.27, 95% CI 2.4 to 7.59; 5 trials and 318 women), which hampered its clinical compliance with high dropout rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>Recent studies suggest that several Chinese herbal medicines could be beneficial as an adjunct to the conventional medical management of PCOS, but the evidence is limited due to the poor methodology of existing trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Berberine, the major active component of <italic>rhizoma coptidis</italic>, exists in a number of medicinal plants and displays a broad array of pharmacological effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> In Chinese medicine, berberine has a long history for its antidiabetic effect. A recent meta-analysis compared different oral hypoglycaemics including metformin, glipizide or rosiglitazone with berberine, and found no priority over glycaemic control but a mild antidyslipidemic effect following berberine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The mechanism of its hypolipidemic effect was studied using human hepatoma cells. Berberine acts differently from that of statin drugs as it could upregulate low-density lipoprotein receptor expression independent of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, but dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></p><p>A series of basic research also implicated that berberine could have beneficial effects in women with PCOS. In insulin-resistant theca cells, berberine increased glucose transporter type 4, decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b4; mRNA levels, increased glucose uptake, and reduced insulin resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21 R22 R23">21&#x02013;23</xref> These results indicate that berberine can improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant ovary theca cells. In ovary granulosa cells, berberine was found to reduce the ovarian oestrogenic responsiveness by their insulin-sensitising effects similar to metformin, but different from thiazolidinedione.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Berberine could also alleviate the degree of insulin resistance and androgen synthesis in cultured insulin-resistant ovaries, indicating that berberine may have a favourable effect on fertility in women with PCOS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></p><p>However, there is only one study investigating the effect of berberine in women with PCOS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Eighty-nine Chinese women with PCOS with insulin resistance were randomised to one of the three treatment groups: berberine+cyproterone acetate (CPA; n=31), metformin+CPA (n=30) and placebo+CPA (n=28) for 3&#x02005;months. The author concluded that berberine showed similar metabolic effects on the amelioration of insulin sensitivity and the reduction of hyperandrogenaemia, when compared to metformin. Berberine also appeared to have a greater effect on the changes in body composition and dyslipidemia. That study was limited by its small sample size, incomplete description of the methodology and use of surrogate outcomes (anthropometric measures and hormonal and metabolic value changes). There is also an ongoing trial (NCT01138930) testing the efficacy of berberine on insulin resistance in women with PCOS as measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Berberine was thought to be safe during clinical use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The side effects were commonly gastrointestinal discomforts including constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal distension. Constipation was one of the most common gastrointestinal discomforts, but it is predictable since berberine had a long history of being used to treat diarrhoea in China.</p><p>We aim to determine the efficacy of letrozole with or without berberine in achieving live births among women with PCOS seeking pregnancy in Mainland China. The primary hypothesis is that the combination of berberine and letrozole results in a significantly higher live birth than letrozole or berberine alone.

The first level is the real time logical and range checking built into the web-based data entry system.

The second is the remote data monitoring and validation that is the primary responsibility of the study data manager and programmer. The data manager will conduct monthly comprehensive data checks, as well as regular manual checks (within the database system). Manual checks will identify more complicated and less common errors. The data manager will query sites until each irregularity is resolved. The third level of quality control will be the site visits, where data in our database will be compared against source documents. Identified errors will be resolved between the data coordination centre and clinical sites. The visits will assure data quality and patient protection.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Participation timeline</title><p>This trial was started on October 2009 and the first recruitment was on 15 May 2010.

The analysis of other secondary outcomes measured over time will entail the application of statistical methods that have been developed for correlated data since repeated observations will be made over time on each individual. For secondary outcomes such as hormone levels, a linear mixed-effects model will be fit where the main independent variables will be treatment group, time and their interaction as well as the designed randomisation stratification factors as covariates. Cox proportional hazards models and a Kaplan-Meier method will be applied to compare time to pregnancy in the treatment groups.</p><p>Adverse events will be categorised and percentage of patients experiencing adverse events and serious adverse events in this trial will be documented. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> Tests will be performed to examine differences in the proportion of total, and categories of adverse events within each treatment arm. Unblinding of treatments will take place after all participants have delivered or reported final outcomes or when there are medical emergencies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Summary</title><p>The present study has several distinctive features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial assessing reproductive effects of berberine on women with PCOS using the live birth rate as the primary outcome, instead of surrogate outcomes such as ovulation and pregnancy rates or metabolic index such as insulin resistance and glucolipid profiles. The present trial uses a combination therapy of letrozole and berberine. Effects of berberine on ovulation, corpus luteum, implantation and obstetrics complications as well as teratogenic effects at different stages of reproductive process will be assessed in the present study. Compared with metformin, berberine has less and milder side effects and ameliorating effects on lipid metabolism, which is also a stigma with women with PCOS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e259" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003934.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e260" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003934.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> WX, LH, JL and YL developed the study protocol.
