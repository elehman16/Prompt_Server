Randomized Controlled Trials are known to be the most powerful tools in providing the strongest evidence of the efficacies of interventions. In 2007, an RCT, the first of its kind in India, undertaken in Puducherry by Saptharishi <italic>et al</italic>.,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) to measure and compare the efficacies of the three interventions in the reduction of blood pressure among pre-hypertensive and hypertensive young adults established their efficacy.</p><p>Factors that affect blood pressure, however, are multiple and pervasive, hence difficult to quantify. Therefore, it is a challenge to attribute blood pressure reduction solely to interventions. Therefore, by eliminating the effect of the multiple influences of blood pressure like age, gender, weight, genetic influences, and observer variations, we verified the exclusive effect of the interventions by a cross-over trial of the aforementioned RCT.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) In the process, certain limitation factors observed by Saptharishi <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) like attrition rate of 9.7% and unequal-sized groups, due to early randomization of the subjects into groups prior to obtaining consent, could be eliminated, further strengthening the reliability of the results.

Every fortnight, the compliance was verified through a random quantification of salt intake. Those not compliant were removed from the study. Subjects of the New Yoga Group were taught yoga exercises(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) effective in reducing blood pressure, by a qualified yoga instructor, and pamphlets containing the yoga lessons were distributed.

The male&#x02013;female distribution was similar in all groups except a slight male over-representation in the Physical Exercise group. During the course of the study four participants from the salt restriction group were excluded as they had not complied with the requirements of the intervention. The mean systolic BP in the four groups ranged between 126 and 132 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure between 78 and 81 mmHg [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCM-36-191-g002"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Comparison of pre, post, and modified post-intervention blood pressure values</title><p>On comparing the pre-intervention and post-intervention BP values following cross-over, using the paired <italic>&#x02018;t&#x02019;</italic> test, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) value in the physical exercise group was reduced by 5.4 &#x000b1; 3.1/6.1 &#x000b1; 2.9 mmHg, in the dietary salt restriction group the mean SBP/DBP value was reduced by 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.5/2.0 &#x000b1; 1.6 mmHg, in the yoga group there was reduction by 2.3 &#x000b1; 1.2/2.4 &#x000b1; 1.6 mmHg, and in the control group, the reduction was 0.24 &#x000b1; 1.4/0.5 &#x000b1; 1.4 mmHg.

Although not statistically significant, the control group recorded a reduction of 0.28 mm Hg in SBP and 0.52 mm Hg in DBP. This reduction of BP without any intervention could have been due to subjective BP variation with time or the influence of lifestyle changes in the interventional groups on the cohort of the control group. There could be a slight possibility of the influence of knowledge from the earlier study as all the control group members of this study had belonged to interventional groups in the earlier study. Assuming that the subjects of the three interventional groups would therefore have experienced a fall of at least 0.28 mm Hg SBP and 0.52 mm Hg DBP, even if they had not undergone any intervention, statistical analysis was done to eliminate this reduction of BP by subtracting 0.28 mm Hg and 0.52 mm Hg from the mean reduction of SBP and DBP (i.e., adding 0.28 mm Hg and 0.52 mm Hg to the post-intervention SBP and DBP values), respectively, in each of the intervention groups. The resultant SBP and DBP values were referred to as modified SBP and DBP, respectively. The mean difference in the reduction of both SBP and DBP when the pre-intervention values were compared with the modified post-intervention values in each of the three intervention groups, continued to be statistical significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 in each case), even after the adjustment for baseline reduction in the Control Group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].

Similarly, on comparing the mean reduction in the SBP and DBP of the physical exercise group with the yoga group, the physical exercise group showed a significantly higher reduction (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Therefore, physical exercise was inferred to be more effective than salt reduction and yoga. However, when the effectiveness of restricted salt intake and yoga on the reduction of BP were compared, there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) between the two interventions. Hence, it was deduced that restricted salt intake and yoga practices were equally effective [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Relative efficacies of physical exercise salt intake reduction and yoga</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCM-36-191-g004"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ninety-four out of 98 subjects completed this cross-over RCT, with a calculated attrition rate of 4.08%.

A comparative discussion follows.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Physical exercise</title><p>The present study showed 5.39 mm Hg reduction in SBP and 6.08 mm Hg in DBP in the exercise group against a reduction of 5.3 mm Hg and 6 mm Hg in SBP and DBP, respectively, in the earlier study.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) Anand(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) through his meta-analysis showed that moderately intense exercise, for example, 30 to 45 minutes of brisk walking, four to five days a week, reduces blood pressure.

Similarly Stewart <italic>et al</italic>.,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) in his RCT on a group of hypertensives with a mean age of 63 years did not find a significant reduction in SBP, in spite of an exercise regimen spanning 78 sessions over six months. This could be due to the stiff arterial walls seen in the elderly, as it is known that arterial compliance reduces with advancing age. Church <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) also did not find a significant reduction in BP post physical intervention, done over a period of six months. However, the study sample comprised of only postmenopausal obese women with a mean age of 57 years, who had a sedentary lifestyle. Park <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) reported that accumulation of physical activity appeared to be more effective than a single continuous session, in the management of prehypertension.</p><p>Many published data have shown the association of physical exercise with reduction of blood pressure.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) However, the study designs used in these studies have not addressed whether physical exercise could reduce the BP of any subjects or they had an effect only on a certain group of subjects with some specific characteristic feature.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Salt intake reduction</title><p>A reduction in the dietary salt intake as a strategy to tackle hypertension has been tried in various studies. The earlier RCT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) showed 2.6/3.7 mm Hg reduction and the present study has shown a reduction of 2.57/2.04 mm Hg in BP. Anand(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) showed that 100 mmol/day reduction in sodium intake was associated with a decline of 5&#x02013;7 mm Hg/2.7 mm Hg in hypertensive subjects. De Luis d <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) recorded a 3.6 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure following reduction in dietary salt. The effects of sodium were observed by Sacks <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) As compared with the control diet with a high sodium level, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with a lower sodium level was associated with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at each sodium level, and the difference was greater with high sodium levels than with low ones. Similarly, in the meta-analyses of longer term trials Feng <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) demonstrated a consistent dose response to salt reduction. These two studies have shown a positive correlation between salt intake reduction and fall in BP.</p><p>Fodor <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) found that for normotensive people a marked change in sodium intake was required to achieve a modest reduction in blood pressure. For hypertensive patients, the effects of dietary salt restriction were most pronounced if the age was greater than 44 years. Cook <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>) have substantiated that sodium reduction may also reduce long-term risk of cardiovascular events. All these studies have demonstrated statistically significant evidence of salt intake reduction as an intervention of hypertension, which is a key risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>However, Hooper <italic>et al</italic>.,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) in their meta-analysis of RCTs have determined that there are no significant long-term effects of sodium restriction in the diet and have concluded that intensive interventions provide only small reductions in blood pressure. However, this has been countered by Obarzanek <italic>et al</italic>.,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) who stated that there could be considerable variation in the changes in BP within individuals, even when sodium, weight, and diet were constant and that this could be due to multiple reasons including measurement errors, inherent day-to-day BP fluctuation, environmental or behavioral stresses, and changes in physical activity, and hence conclusions cannot be drawn based on a single measurement or study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Practice of yoga</title><p>The earlier RCT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) showed significant BP reduction (2 mm Hg in SBP, 2.9 mm Hg in DBP) with only yoga as an intervention.

Bijlani <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) concluded that a short lifestyle modification and stress management education program with yoga as the major component led to favorable metabolic effects within nine days. Aivazyan <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) demonstrated a significant reduction in SBP and DBP, peripheral vascular resistance, and hypertensive response to emotional stress, and an improvement in psychological adaptation, quality of life, and capacity for work. Singh <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) reported a significant reduction in blood pressure (12 mm Hg in SBP; 11.2 mm Hg in DBP) with a 40-day yoga regimen among Type 2 diabetics.</p><p>Many studies have shown the association of each of these interventions with a reduction in blood pressure.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) However, it remains to be proven whether the reduction of BP demonstrated was specifically due to the individual intervention irrespective of other influences. In the earlier RCT,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) each intervention group showed a reduction in BP. The newly formed intervention groups in this cross-over trial also showed the same results. Therefore, this cross-over has proved the effect irrespective of other influences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Comparison of relative efficacies</title><p>The earlier RCT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) showed that physical exercise was more effective than the other two interventions (considered individually), whereas, both salt intake reduction and yoga were equally effective non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention and control of hypertension among young adults.</p><p>At the end of this cross-over trial, each intervention had been carried out on two different subgroups of the same study population and the analysis continued to show the same results. Hence, this cross-over RCT reaffirms the effectiveness of Physical Exercise, Salt Reduction, and Yoga, in significantly reducing blood pressure in young adults over and above the effects produced by other covariates and that Physical Exercise would be the most effective choice of intervention. Salt Reduction, and Yoga can however be advocated to the population and people who are unable to perform physical exercise, like the physically challenged, who can be advised dietary salt restriction or yoga. Maintenance of hypertension within normal limits can benefit the individual by protecting him from various cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal complications, as well as the Nation by bringing down the morbidity and mortality due to hypertension and consequently the burden of other related chronic non-communicable diseases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank ICMR, New Delhi and the participants of the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Indian Council for Medical Research</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lawes</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Vander Hoorn</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Law</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>MacMahon</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodgers</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Blood pressure and the global burden of disease 2000.Part II: Estimates of attributable burden</article-title><source>J Hypertens</source><year>2006</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>423</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16467640</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kearney</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Whelton</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Muntner</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Whelton</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global burden of hypertension: Analysis of worldwide data</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>365</volume><fpage>217</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15652604</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title><uri xlink:type="simple">WHOINDIA.org</uri>.
