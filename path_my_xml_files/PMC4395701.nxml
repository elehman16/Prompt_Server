in their 20s with acute low back pain. The subjects were 30 females in their 20s with
acute low back pain. [Subjects and Methods] They were equally and randomly divided into a
t&#x02019;ai chi group and a stretching group. The intervention was applied three times per week,
one hour each time, for a total of eight weeks. During the one hour, the subjects
conducted warm-up exercises for 10&#x02005;min, primary exercises for 40&#x02005;min, and cool-down
exercises for 10&#x02005;min. In order to examine changes in low back pain in the patients
according to the intervention method, muscle activity, pain, and balance elements (left
and right side movement distance, forward and backward movement distance) were measured.
[Results] Muscle activity and the visual analog scale score significantly decreased in
both the t&#x02019;ai chi group and the stretching group. Regarding changes in balance elements,
the t&#x02019;ai chi group&#x02019;s left and right side movement distance decreased, which was
statistically significant. However, the t&#x02019;ai chi group&#x02019;s forward and backward movement
distance and the stretching group&#x02019;s forward and backward movement distance and left and
right side movement distance did not change. [Conclusion] According to the results of this
study, t&#x02019;ai chi is considered an appropriate exercise program to reduce acute low back
pain in females in their 20s. This is because when compared with stretching, it enables
posture maintenance with lesser force due to decreased muscle activity, it is more helpful
for improvements in balance ability, and it is effective in decreasing pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>T&#x02019;ai chi</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain, a representative symptom that appears due to a lowered stability of the body
resulting from imbalance between the trunk flexor and extensor, is one of the most common
disorders in life. Acute low back pain often presents because of excessive movements of the
erector spinae muscle resulting from lowered flexibility caused by an imbalance of the trunk
muscles or weakening of trunk muscle strength<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The weakening of the erector spinae muscle may be caused by a lack
of muscle strength, resulting from insufficient exercise, obesity, and improper posture;
such causes may lead to abnormalities in different structures of the lumbar region,
resulting in acute low back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There
are social and individual problems related to low back pain. Patients with low back pain
find it difficult to lead a smooth, ordinary life due to the pain; social problems include
many medical costs and failure to participate in socially productive activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To manage low back pain, diverse methods are used. Physical therapy is a representative low
back pain management method. Various exercises, such as aerobics, yoga, and Pilates, as well
as traditional physical therapy methods, are utilized to decrease low back pain. Recently,
lumbar stabilization exercises have been frequently used as an exercise to ameliorate the
muscle strength of low back pain patients and to relieve their pain. Lumbar stabilization
exercises improve deep muscle strength and increase range of motion through enhanced muscle
strength, with positive results for low back pain patients; therefore, these exercises are
frequently applied in the clinical field<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although such lumbar stabilization exercises may be incorporated into training programs for
young people, elderly people need therapists or trainers with expert knowledge because the
difficulties and intensities of the exercises should be adjusted with precision. On the
other hand, t&#x02019;ai chi may be applied as a useful exercise for elderly people. T&#x02019;ai chi does
not demand great force in its motions but seeks improvements in balance through postural
stability, increased flexibility, and slow motions, enabling elderly people to perform the
exercises easily. It is not an activity involving instant great force, and therefore, it is
appropriate for elderly people. T&#x02019;ai chi is employed as an effective exercise for elderly
people for different purposes, such as to build strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular
endurance and to improve body composition<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In relation to self-help programs, t&#x02019;ai chi and aquatic training may be utilized as
effective exercise methods for patients with gonarthritis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, t&#x02019;ai chi is
helpful in terms of physical and mental health<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, previous studies have focused on patients with
osteoarthritis, which presents in middle-aged or older people or elderly stroke patients,
while research on young adults has been insufficient. Acute low back pain is a common
disease in young people. But most studies have been focused chronic low back pain. So we
chose subjects with acute low back pain here. Therefore, this experiment was conducted in
order to determine whether t&#x02019;ai chi might be used as an effective exercise program for young
female adults in their 20s with acute low back pain by comparing changes in muscle activity,
pain, and balance ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were females in their 20s with acute low back pain that lasted for three weeks
or shorter<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 30 subjects were divided
into two groups. One group conducted t&#x02019;ai chi, and the other group carried out stretching
for eight weeks. An orthopedist had diagnosed the subjects with acute low back pain, and
they voluntarily participated in this experiment. Those who had abnormalities other than low
back pain were excluded. A surface electromyography system (MP150, BIOPAC Systems, Inc.,
Goleta, CA, USA) was used to measure muscle activity, and Ag-Ag/Cl electrodes were employed.
The activity of the erector spinae muscle was measured, and the electrodes were attached
2&#x02005;cm from the L3 spinous process. In order to eliminate noises, a 60-Hz notch filter was
used. Data were processed by conducting band-pass filtering at 20 to 500&#x02005;Hz. To calculate
the value of maximal isometric contraction during a manual muscle test, %MVIC was used.
Marching in place was conducted for 10 s. EMG was performed during the sit to stand
maneuver, as this is the most frequently performed motion. Measurement of balance was
performed in a standing position. Excluding the first and last two seconds, the average
activity for six seconds was measured. Pain was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS),
and a Good Balance system was used to measure balance ability. The measurement elements for
balance ability were left and right side movement distance and forward and backward movement
distance. The shorter the movement distance, the better the ability to remain in a position
using balance. The subjects carried out t&#x02019;ai chi and stretching exercises three times per
week, one hour each time, for a total of eight weeks. Each of the sessions was composed of
warm-up exercises for 10&#x02005;min, primary exercises for 40&#x02005;min, and cool-down exercises for
10&#x02005;min. A series of motions including yamabunjong, bongrian, baekhakyangsi, suhuibipa,
nuseulyobo, jesusangse, and yeobongsapei were conducted in a flow mode for 20&#x02005;min. The
motions were carried out twice. For stretching, the subjects repetitively performed lower
limb, trunk, and upper limb exercises in a sequential manner. This was conducted after
approval of safety, all procedures, and ethics by the Research Ethics Committee of Kyungbook
University. The subjects agreed to participate in this study after explanation of its
methods and purpose. SPSS was used for statistical processing, and a paired t-test was
carried out to examine changes according to the intervention, and an independent t-test was
used to compare the two groups. The significance level was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In both groups, muscle activity and pain significantly decreased. However, regarding
balance, the left and right side movement distance significantly decreased in the t&#x02019;ai chi
group but did not statistically change in the stretching group. As measurement elements with
significant differences, the t&#x02019;ai chi group&#x02019;s muscle activity and pain decreased from
26.1&#x000b1;3.9%MVIC to 22.7&#x000b1;0.6%MVIC and from 3.6&#x000b1;0.7 to 2.1&#x000b1;0.6, respectively, and its left and
right side movement distance in relation to balance ability was reduced from 157.4&#x000b1;41.1&#x02005;mm
to 131.5&#x000b1;29.2&#x02005;mm (p&#x0003c;0.05). The stretching group&#x02019;s muscle activity and pain also decreased
from 27.3&#x000b1;3.6%MVIC to 25.7&#x000b1;3.4%MVIC and from 3.6&#x000b1;0.4 to 2.5&#x000b1;0.6, respectively (p&#x0003c;0.05).
However, with regard to the group&#x02019;s balance ability, its forward and backward movement
distance decreased from 181.9&#x000b1;52.8&#x02005;mm to 164.3&#x000b1;66.1&#x02005;mm, with no statistical significance. In
addition, the stretching group&#x02019;s left and right side movement distance and forward and
backward movement distance decreased from 162.7&#x000b1;51.8&#x02005;mm to 153.6&#x000b1;45.8&#x02005;mm and from
219.1&#x000b1;51.1&#x02005;mm to 206.4&#x000b1;69.1&#x02005;mm, respectively, with no statistical significance (p&#x0003e;0.05)

applied to female patients in their 20s with acute low back pain. In order to assess
changes, muscle activity, VAS, and balance elements were measured as variables. Muscle
activity decreased from 26.1&#x000b1;3.9%MVIC to 22.7&#x000b1;0.6%MVIC in the t&#x02019;ai chi group and from
27.3&#x000b1;3.6%MVIC to 25.7&#x000b1;3.4%MVIC in the stretching group, showing statistically significant
changes (p&#x0003c;0.05). It can be interpreted that the activity of the postural muscles
decreased because efficient postural maintenance was possible. This is similar to previous
research that experimented with changes in muscle activity according to whether the subjects
put on a waist belt. When the subjects did not wear a waist belt, their muscle activity was
190.0&#x000b1;31.7%RVC (reference voluntary contraction), but when they put on a waist belt, their
muscle activity decreased to 175.17&#x000b1;30.34%RVC, with the change being statistically
significant<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is because putting
on a waist belt heightened the stability and reduced the mobilization of the erector spinae
muscle used for postural maintenance, resulting in lowered muscle activity. When stability
was heightened, postural maintenance with the lowest mobilization of the muscles is
possible, and therefore, the present study obtained a result similar to the results of
previous research<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, in the balance elements of t&#x02019;ai chi, there were statistically significant
changes in the left and right side movement distance and the forward and backward movement
distance. Among them, the left and right side movement distance decreased from 157.4&#x000b1;41.1&#x02005;mm
to 131.5&#x000b1;29.2&#x02005;mm, which was statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05). Forward and backward
movement distance decreased from 181.9&#x000b1;52.8&#x02005;mm to 164.3&#x000b1;66.1&#x02005;mm, with the change not
statistically significant (p&#x0003e;0.05). The left and right side movement distance and forward
and backward movement distance of the control group, to which stretching was applied,
decreased from 162.7&#x000b1;51.8&#x02005;mm to 153.6&#x000b1;45.8&#x02005;mm and from 219.1&#x000b1;51.1&#x02005;mm to 206.4&#x000b1;69.1&#x02005;mm,
respectively, and the changes were not statistically significant. The smaller the left and
right side movement distance and the forward and backward movement distance are, the more
excellent the ability is to maintain balance within a small movement range. Although the
movement distances of both the t&#x02019;ai chi and stretching groups decreased, only the t&#x02019;ai chi
group&#x02019;s left and right side movement distance showed a statistically significant decrease,
signifying that the intervention with t&#x02019;ai chi improved balance ability.</p><p>It can be interpreted that decreased muscle activity means that even the use of a small
amount of muscle strength enables stable postural maintenance, and a reduction in distances
in balance elements signifies improvements in balance ability. In effect, low back pain will
decrease because such a decrease in balance elements enables improvements in balance ability
and postural maintenance with a smaller amount of force. This is shown in the VAS results of
the present study. Pain decreased from 3.6&#x000b1;0.7 to 2.1&#x000b1;0.6 in the t&#x02019;ai chi group and from
3.6&#x000b1;0.4 to 2.5&#x000b1;0.6 in the stretching group. Such changes were statistically significant in
the two groups. When the two groups were compared, the pain decrease of the t&#x02019;ai chi group
was greater than that of the stretching group. In particular, the decrease in muscle
activity was greater in the t&#x02019;ai chi group than in the stretching group; the subjects in the
former group were able to stably maintain their posture with a smaller amount of force and
saw a more greatly improved balance ability with reduced larger reduction in pain.
Stretching is often used as a good exercise to manage low back pain. In particular,
stretching is applied frequently in low back pain management programs for young adults.
According to the present study results, t&#x02019;ai chi was more efficient in enhancing balance
ability and managing pain; t&#x02019;ai chi will be useful as an effective low back pain management
program, and it can be employed as an effective exercise program for females in their 20s
with acute low back pain. This study was conducted in order to examine the effects of t&#x02019;ai
chi on female adults in their 20s with acute low back pain. The exercise effects of
stretching, which was performed in the control group, were compared with those of t&#x02019;ai chi.
For this comparison, muscle activity, pain, and balance ability were measured. Muscle
activity and pain decreased in both the t&#x02019;ai chi and stretching groups, but t&#x02019;ai chi was
found to be more effective. Balance ability was particularly improved in the t&#x02019;ai chi group.
Therefore, t&#x02019;ai chi is considered an effective exercise program for decreasing acute low
back pain in females in their 20s.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Stel</surname><given-names>VS</given-names></name><name><surname>Smit</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Pluijm</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Balance and mobility performance as treatable risk factors
