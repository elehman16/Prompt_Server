Previous studies have shown this practice may be associated with higher prevalence of postpartum problems. The current multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate outcomes of diet and lifestyle interventions in Chinese postpartum women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The current multicenter RCT will be conducted in three representative areas in China, Shandong province, Hubei province and Guangdong province, which locate in northern, central and southern parts of China, respectively. Women who attend routine pregnancy diagnosis in hospitals or maternal healthcare centers will be invited to take part in this study. At least 800 women who meet our eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention group (n &#x0003e; = 400) and the control group (n &#x0003e; = 400). A three-dimension comprehensive intervention strategy, which incorporates intervention measures simultaneously to individual postpartum woman, their family members and community environment, will be utilized to maximize the effectiveness of intervention. Regular visiting and follow-up will be done in both group; nutrition and health-related measurements will be assessed both before and after the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this current study is the first and largest multicenter RCT which focus on the effectiveness of diet and lifestyle intervention on reducing the incidence rate of postpartum diseases and improving health status in postpartum women. We hypothesize that the intervention will reduce the incidence rates of postpartum diseases and improve nutrition and health status due to a balanced diet and reasonable lifestyle in comparison with the control condition. If so, the results of our study will provide especially important evidence for changes in both the concept and action of traditional postpartum practice in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01039051.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The postpartum period, or puerperium, which starts about an hour after the delivery of the placenta and includes the following six weeks, covers a critical transitional time for a woman, her newborn and her family, on a physiological, emotional and social level. However, the postpartum period is often neglected by maternity care in both developing and developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, women's needs during this period have been all too often eclipsed by the attention given to pregnancy and birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The lack of postpartum care ignores the fact that the majority of maternal deaths and disabilities occur during the postpartum period and that early neonatal mortality remains high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>"Doing the month", or "sitting month", is a well-accepted and obeyed traditional practice among postpartum women and their families in China, which is also common in other Asian countries, such as Korea, Thailand, and Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. According to traditional customs, women who are "doing the month" are advised to lie in bed all the time with doors and windows closed, and consume plenty of eggs or meat, drink bowels of chicken soup, brown sugar water, and millet gruel every day, while avoid eating any raw and cold food (mainly refers to fruits, vegetables), because cold food were thought to be unfavorable for postpartum recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This practice seems to be believed more or less by almost all Chinese population worldwide, rather than only by local people in China mainland. Immigration studies showed that Chinese women who immigrated to Australia, Canada or United States still think that the traditional puerperium practice of "doing the month" is very important, and this belief is not subject to their level of education, acculturation level and the duration of immigration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>We have ever conducted a preliminary study in three regions of Hubei province in China to investigate prevalence of puerperium practice and their effect on postpartum women's health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We found that 18% of women never ate vegetables, 78.8% never ate fruit and 75.7% never drank milk during the puerperium while, in contrast, the consumption of eggs and brown sugar were as high as 365.0 g/d and 81.3 g/d in rural postpartum women, which is associated with postpartum problems including constipation, backaches, breast problems, oral diseases and anemia, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>However, as indicated in a Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], evidence is too limited at present to confirm the effect of diet and lifestyle modification on outcomes for the postpartum women and their offspring. Therefore, we initiate this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) with large-scale sample size to elucidate whether a diet and lifestyle intervention can improve the health status in Chinese postpartum women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This multicenter RCT is designed to assess the effectiveness of a diet and lifestyle intervention in postpartum women in China, including a short-term effect on reducing health problems during puerperium period and a long-term effect on improving health status in women and their offspring over a two-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>The current multicenter study will be conducted in three representative areas in China, Shandong province, Hubei province and Guangdong province, which locate in northern, central and southern parts of China, respectively.

The incidence rate of constipation in our previous study is 20.95% in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

A comparison between traditional practices for "doing the month" and expected diet and lifestyle that we advocated during the postpartum period are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. It is obvious that our guideline emphasizes the importance of increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits, which is regard as a diet taboo for postpartum women in traditional Chinese practice. In addition, it also emphasizes the importance of maintaining energy balance through reducing excessive energy from meat, eggs and brown sugar and increasing energy expenditure from appropriate physical activity, such as doing maternal keep-fit exercises.</p><p>In the past decades, social ecological models have been increasingly used to formulate intervention strategies in comprehensive consideration, because simple interventions are unlikely to work on their own and the development of effective interventions requires strategies that affect multiple settings simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, a panel of environmental factors that influence the knowledge, belief and practice of postpartum women (the core) has been identified. Microsystem, mainly referred to family members of the individual woman, is crucial immediate environmental factors that should be considered in priority. Exosystem, including surrounding people, such as peers, friends, colleagues, neighbors and care physicians, and sources of knowledge, such as book, magazines, TV show, radio and internet, does not usually directly interact, but that can still affect the individual woman. In addition, we have to consider macrosystem, including history, culture, laws, ethnics, social conditions and economic systems, to give a personalized guide to individual postpartum woman. Previous studies by us and other groups have suggested that main influence factors on the diet and lifestyle of a postpartum woman include the woman's knowledge about postpartum nutrition and health care, the woman or her husband's educational level and family income levels, and the traditional concept learned from her mother in-law (49.4%), mother (34.0%), books and magazines (16.5%), relatives (14.3), friends or colleagues (12.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Social Ecological Model showing potential factors that influence postpartum women's belief and practice</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-10-103-2"/></fig><p>Therefore, we have formulated a three-dimension comprehensive intervention strategy (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), which incorporates intervention measures simultaneously to individual postpartum woman, their family members and community environment to maximize the effectiveness of our multicenter trial. For individual postpartum woman, we will set antepartum participatory training courses, provide specially prepared brochures and supporting VCD, set up a specialized counseling hotline and give individual bedside guidance after birth. For their family members, we will invite every postpartum woman's husband and mother to take part in workshops or seminars, making them know some basic knowledge of postpartum care, and persuading them to promote adoption of the diet and lifestyle we advocated by the postpartum woman. For community environment, we will put up posters about basic knowledge of postpartum care in the community bulletin boards for general population educating and mobilize community leaders and heads from and maternal and child health centers for maximum support.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Summary of our three-dimension comprehensive intervention strategy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Dimensions</th><th align="center">Subjects</th><th align="left">Strategies and Measures</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">Postpartum woman</td><td align="left">- Participatory training for woman who expects to childbirth with 1 month<break/>- Providing specially prepared release of "Chinese women's postpartum reasonable diet and lifestyle program" (Universal Edition) and supporting VCD, to facilitate self-learning at home<break/>- Setting up a specialized counseling hotline to answer the questions from postpartum woman and their family members<break/>- Individual bedside guidance for postpartum woman, focusing on how to correctly adjust her diet and life style during postpartum period</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">Family members</td><td align="left">Inviting every postpartum woman's husband and mother to take part in workshops or seminars, making them know some basic knowledge of postpartum care, and persuading them to promote adoption of the diet and lifestyle we advocated by the postpartum woman</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">Community support</td><td align="left">- General population educating via putting up posters about basic knowledge of postpartum care in the community bulletin boards<break/>- Mobilizing community leaders and heads from and maternal and child health centers for maximum support</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>Major measurements before and after the intervention trial are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>.

Final analyses will be undertaken using generalized linear mixed models to investigate changes over time in the two groups in the major outcomes. These models allow for repeated measures and can be used for normally distributed, binomial, and ordinal data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 12.0 statistical software package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is generally accepted that a balanced diet comprising abundant intake of whole cereals, fruits, vegetables and a suitable amount of fish, meat, eggs and milk is essential for maintaining our health. However, postpartum women in China are traditionally advised to follow a special dietary and lifestyle pattern, which is quite different from the dietary and lifestyle patterns they maintain before and after postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Several studies have paid attention to explore the relationship of postpartum practice and consequent health problems in Chinese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; however, as we know, it is hard to draw a clear causation in cross-sectional studies.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first and largest multicenter RCT which focus on the effectiveness of diet and lifestyle intervention on reducing the incidence rate of postpartum diseases and improving health status in postpartum women. This evidence-based study is designed on the basis of data from our previous study in three regions in Hubei province of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], incorporating with the latest WHO recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The major limitation of this study is that the participants that we will recruit are mainly Chinese Han women, whereas the postpartum practices vary among different national minorities in China. Further research on different minority populations will be very interesting.</p><p>We hypothesize that the intervention will reduce the incidence rates of postpartum diseases and improve nutrition and health status due to a balanced diet and reasonable lifestyle in comparison with the control condition. If so, the results of our study will provide especially important evidence for changes in postpartum diet and lifestyle. The fantastic reform in both the concept and action of traditional postpartum practice in China will be expected.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>RCT: randomized controlled trial; WHO: world health organization</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WB and LL is responsible for developing the intervention protocol and drafting the manuscript.
