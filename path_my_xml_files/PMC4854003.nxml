The evidence base for how best to manage these patients is weak. Current clinical guidelines generally focus on single conditions, which may not reflect the needs of patients with multimorbidity. The aim of the 3D study is to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention to improve the management of patients with multimorbidity in general practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a pragmatic two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial. 32 general practices around Bristol, Greater Manchester and Glasgow will be randomised to receive either the &#x02018;3D intervention&#x02019; or usual care. 3D is a complex intervention including components affecting practice organisation, the conduct of patient reviews, integration with secondary care and measures to promote change in practice organisation. Changes include improving continuity of care and replacing reviews of each disease with patient-centred reviews with a focus on patients' quality of life, mental health and polypharmacy. We aim to recruit 1383 patients who have 3 or more chronic conditions. This provides 90% power at 5% significance level to detect an effect size of 0.27 SDs in the primary outcome, which is health-related quality of life at 15&#x02005;months using the EQ-5D-5L. Secondary outcome measures assess patient centredness, illness burden and treatment burden. The primary analysis will be a multilevel regression model adjusted for baseline, stratification/minimisation, clustering and important co-variables. Nested process evaluation will assess implementation, mechanisms of effectiveness and interaction of the intervention with local context. Economic analysis of cost-consequences and cost-effectiveness will be based on quality-adjusted life years.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has approval from South-West (Frenchay) National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee (14/SW/0011).

At least 16% of adult patients in primary care in the UK have multimorbidity and prevalence increases with age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These patients experience a high level of &#x02018;illness burden&#x02019; due to poor quality of life, high rates of depression (which often goes unrecognised) and reduced life expectancy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> They also experience &#x02018;treatment burden&#x02019; due to having to attend multiple specialist clinics and seeing many different professionals, which can be inconvenient for patients as well as inefficient for the health service.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> They may have to take multiple medications in complex regimes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This polypharmacy can be burdensome for patients, increases the likelihood of interactions and adverse effects (including those causing hospital admissions), and may reduce medication adherence.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>In qualitative studies, patients with multimorbidity describe a lack of holistic patient-centred care, and a concern that no single professional takes overall responsibility for their treatment and treats them as a whole person.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Current treatment guidelines and professional incentive schemes tend to be focused on individual diseases, which can lead clinicians to focus on disease-based metrics rather than on the problems that are of most concern to the individual with multimorbidity.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Many different sets of guidelines can be relevant to one patient with multimorbidity, and attempting to follow all of these guidelines may be excessively burdensome, inefficient and ineffective.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Multimorbidity represents a challenge to healthcare systems as well as to individual patients. Patients with multimorbidity have high rates of primary care consultations and hospital admissions and they account for a disproportionate amount of overall health service expenditure.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In the USA, it is estimated that 75% of the healthcare expenditure is spent on treating chronic conditions, while in Europe, the aggregated healthcare cost multiplies with each additional condition (mean cost estimate for three conditions=&#x020ac;1631 compared with &#x020ac;562 for zero conditions).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> From the healthcare professional's point of view, patients with multimorbidity can be challenging to manage.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Clinicians express frustration with the lack of time, fragmentation of the healthcare system and inadequate guidelines which limit the care they can offer these patients.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Complex medication management is also cited as a particular issue in multimorbidity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref></p><p>The majority of healthcare for people with chronic conditions is provided in primary care, and therefore this should be the main setting for approaches to improve the management of multimorbidity. A recent Cochrane review highlighted the paucity of research on interventions to improve the outcomes of patients with multimorbidity in primary care.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Ten studies were identified examining a range of complex interventions which demonstrated mixed effects. The most effective were organisational interventions focused on areas of concern for patients or where they have difficulties, such as functional ability and medication management. No studies included an economic analysis of cost-effectiveness, although a trend towards improved prescribing and medication adherence suggests the potential for cost-savings. The authors of the systematic review called for further pragmatic studies based in primary care settings, using clear definitions of participants and appropriate outcomes.</p><p>In summary, patients with multimorbidity experience problems of illness burden (poor quality of life, depression), treatment burden (multiple uncoordinated appointments, polypharmacy) and lack of person-centred care (low continuity, little attention paid to patients' priorities). This research is designed to test the hypothesis that a patient-centred intervention in general practice designed to address the needs and priorities of patients with multimorbidity will improve their health-related quality of life, reduce their burden of illness and treatment and improve their experience of care, while being more cost-effective than conventional service models. This will be examined using a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), with economic evaluation and mixed-methods process evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a multicentre pragmatic, two-arm, practice-level cluster RCT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011261F1">figure 1</xref>), with parallel mixed-methods process evaluation and economic analysis of cost-effectiveness.

Practices in this study will be selected from areas with a range of socioeconomic characteristics, particularly levels of deprivation.</p><p>In the UK, each patient is registered with one general practice, typically with between 2 and 10 general practitioners (GPs) and a smaller number of practice nurses. Patients receive almost all of their primary medical care from their general practice, which acts as gatekeeper to secondary care services. Patients with multimorbidity are called in for regular review of each of their medical conditions, often having separate reviews for each condition. Many reviews are conducted by nurses who use disease-specific computerised templates to collect relevant data according to clinical guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>General practices</title><p>To be eligible for inclusion practices need a minimum of three GP partners, a minimum list of 4500 registered patients and to use EMIS Web or EMIS PCS as their computer system.

These nationwide networks facilitate clinical research by identifying and recruiting general practices and providing resources to help practices do research. Local researchers will meet with key stakeholders at the practice (practice manager, GPs, practice nurses) in order to explain the study and its requirement of a commitment to organisational and procedural change. The practice manager or lead GP will sign a practice-level consent agreement.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Recruitment of patients</title><p>Each participating practice will be asked to search their practice database using a standard electronic search provided by the research team to identify potentially eligible patients who have three or more chronic conditions as defined by the inclusion criteria. In some practices, not all GPs will participate, so in practices which have a policy for patients to see the same GP, only those patients who usually see one of the participating GPs will be included. This is to minimise the potential distress of asking a patient to change their GP for the purpose of the study. If there are more than 150 eligible patients, a simple random sample of 150 of these patients will be selected. GPs will be asked to review the resulting list to screen out patients meeting the exclusion criteria.

Finally the specific operational mechanisms or active components of the intervention which will be used to implement each strategy are described in the third column.</p></sec><sec id="s2h3"><title>Components at practice level relating to organisation of care</title><p>The aim is to identify a group of patients with high levels of multimorbidity and on several QOF disease registers in order to prioritise them for a different form of care, recognising that they have more complex needs than most patients. Consenting patients with multimorbidity (as defined in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>) will be identified and &#x02018;flagged&#x02019; on practice computer systems. They will be allocated a named GP with responsibility for their care (and nurse if possible, particularly in larger practices where several nurses are involved in chronic disease management). These patients will be provided with a &#x02018;3D&#x02019; card in order to identify themselves with practice receptionists when booking appointments. The 3D card reminds the patient of their named responsible GP, and encourages them to ask for a longer appointment than usual when they think they need one. This recognises that these patients often need to discuss several problems at one appointment.</p><p>In most general practices in the UK, patients with one of the chronic conditions listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref> are invited for review of that condition on a regular basis, such as every 6 or 12&#x02005;months. At these reviews, the GP or nurse follow computerised disease management templates to collect relevant data about aspects of disease control and management. Patients with multimorbidity may be repeatedly called for separate reviews of each of their chronic conditions, often to see different health professionals, who use different disease management templates which include a large amount of duplication (eg, most templates include measurement of blood pressure and asking about smoking habits). Under the 3D approach, these separate disease-focused reviews will be replaced by a 3D review every 6&#x02005;months at which all problems will be reviewed at one time.</p></sec><sec id="s2h4"><title>Components relating to clinicians conduct of reviews</title><p>The 3D reviews are comprehensive and, although they include the important aspects of disease management included in single disease reviews, they have a different focus. The conduct of the reviews will be supported by a bespoke &#x02018;dynamic&#x02019; template which automatically personalises for individual patients to only include prompts relevant to the conditions that the patient is recorded as having in the electronic medical record. It eliminates the problem of duplication of information between different single disease templates and also provides a structure to encourage the clinicians to enact the 3D approach. The term &#x02018;3D&#x02019; acts as a mnemonic to encourage clinicians to focus on the following:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Dimensions of health: This includes first eliciting patients' concerns and priorities for improving their quality of life and function, before collecting data about disease metrics such as weight or blood pressure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Depression: The clinicians should screen for depression and seek to treat it if identified.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Drugs: In order to address problems of polypharmacy, a pharmacist will review the patient's medical records prior to the 3D review and make recommendations about low priority drugs that might be discontinued, or other ways of simplifying drug regimes, for example, using long-acting medications, so that all tablets can be taken in the morning. The pharmacist review is performed online through remote access to patients' electronic medical records by prior arrangement between the practice and pharmacist. As part of the 3D review, the GP will be trained to ask questions to detect problems with medication adherence and how to help the patient to address this.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Each six-monthly 3D review consists of two appointments. At the first appointment (lasting approximately 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;min), the practice nurse will collect information to complete the template and organise all relevant blood tests or other investigations. The nurse review includes collecting information about the patient's priorities for change and aspects of quality of life such as pain and function, and also includes screening for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9) questionnaire.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Following the nurse appointment, the patient will be given a document, known as the &#x02018;3D agenda&#x02019;, which summarises their assessment and details their top priorities for change. This will set the agenda for the second appointment, approximately 1&#x02005;week later, with the patient's usual GP. At this 20&#x02005;min appointment the GP will review all the information collected by the nurse and from the test results, undertake a thorough medication review with the help of the pharmacist's recommendations, seek to address the patient's priorities and problems identified in the assessment, and agree a written care plan for the patient to take away. This 3D Health Plan spells out the specific problems identified (which may be a combination of patients' priorities and problems identified by the nurse or doctor during the review), along with mutually agreed actions that patients and clinicians each have responsibility for. Providing patients with a 3D health plan as a printed summary of their 3D review and test results is intended to promote patient engagement.</p><p>Each general practice will be allocated a designated &#x02018;generalist physician&#x02019; (usually a geriatrician) in secondary care whom they can contact to discuss individuals with complex problems and (if possible) to help coordinate use of hospital investigations and appointments where patients are attending numerous different specialist clinics or having multiple hospital-based tests on different days.</p></sec><sec id="s2h5"><title>Components relating to supporting practices</title><p>In order to support the implementation of the intervention, the study team developed a training package of two half-day sessions for healthcare professionals. These sessions are facilitated by a clinician trainer and at least one local researcher, covering tasks and discussion topics including eliciting of patient concerns, exploring strategies to promote patient-centred care, ways to improve continuity of care, negotiating a patient health plan, improving medication adherence, the aims of the 3D reviews and use of the 3D review template. A substantial element of the training will be devoted to promoting attitudinal change among clinicians towards identifying and responding to patients' own priorities and problems with broader quality of life, as organisational change is unlikely to be effective unless clinicians &#x02018;buy into&#x02019; the underlying philosophy of the new approach.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Practice receptionists will also be offered training in promoting continuity of care and offering longer appointments to patients with multimorbidity.</p><p>A number of other strategies are being followed to promote implementation of the intervention within practices. In addition to the bespoke computerised 3D review template, we have also developed software to facilitate identification and monitoring of the participants. Financial reimbursement is provided to practices to cover the costs of practice staff training and setting up of the necessary patient recall systems. Modest financial incentives (&#x000a3;60 per patient) are also provided to practices based on the number of patients that complete both of their six-monthly 3D reviews within the 15-month follow-up period. Each practice will be asked to nominate a GP champion to help monitor and promote the intervention within the practice, and also to meet and share good ideas and experiences with other GP champions in local collaboratives. The practice champions will be provided with monthly feedback reports about their practice's progress in implementing the reviews. We will allow local adaptation of the intervention to reflect local context while ensuring the key elements of the conceptual framework (those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011261F2">figure 2</xref>) are maintained.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Control group</title><p>Patients in practices allocated to the control arm will continue to receive care as usual. In most practices, this will mean patients are recalled to different clinics to see different practice nurses to review each of their long-term conditions. The nurses will usually follow disease-specific computerised protocols for their management, and will mainly focus on collecting data related to QOF targets rather than quality of life or patients' priorities. The nature of &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019; may vary between practices and over time&#x02014;this will be explored in the process evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Participant withdrawal</title><p>Among intervention practices, if any participant later requests not to receive the 3D intervention, they will revert to the usual care provided for other patients in their practice. Unless a patient requests to withdraw from the trial they will continue to be followed up and will be analysed in the group to which the practice was allocated. If they wish to withdraw from the trial, then no further follow-up data will be requested but data already provided will be used.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s2k1"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome for patient and carers will be health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the EQ-5D-5L after 15&#x02005;months following patient recruitment.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The EQ-5D is a widely used self-reported generic measure of HRQoL which has been validated in many different patient populations including diabetes, cardiovascular problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, chronic pain and rheumatoid arthritis.

We will compare the extra cost of caring for patients in the intervention group with the difference in outcome as measured by the EQ-5D-5L and related quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Resource use data will be collected from patient self-reported postal questionnaires at baseline, 9 and 15&#x02005;months and GP practice records. The questionnaires will ask about the use of community and secondary care health services, social services, informal care, and personal costs (including travel, loss of earnings and dependent care costs). Patients indicating use of hospital services will be contacted by telephone to obtain more detail about the inpatient stay or accident and emergency visit. GP practice records will be used to obtain information about all available primary care contacts, including type of consultation and who was seen, tests and investigations, and prescribed medication.</p><p>Trial records will be used to estimate the cost of setting up the 3D service and training staff.

The primary outcome will be collected 9 and 15&#x02005;months after recruitment, with the primary outcome time point being at 15&#x02005;months. All but one of the secondary outcomes will be collected at 9&#x02005;months, as shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx2">box 2</xref>. All secondary outcomes, measures of the process of care and measures of resource utilisation will be collected 15&#x02005;months after recruitment. Practice randomisation occurs after patient recruitment, and it then takes approximately 3&#x02005;months to train practices to deliver the 3D intervention. Patients have their 3D reviews on a six-monthly cycle. Therefore, collecting outcome data 9 and 15&#x02005;months after patient recruitment allows for a 3-month lag time and ensures that most patients will be invited to have two 3D reviews before outcomes are measured.</p><p>The primary method of self-reported data collection will be via postal questionnaires; however, alternative completion methods including by telephone or via a home visit by a researcher masked to treatment allocation will be offered if necessary in order to maximise response rates.</p><p>Two reminders, the first by letter or email (approximately 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days after posting the questionnaire) and the second by phone (approximately 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days after the first reminder), will be made for participants who have not returned their questionnaire. Patients will be given &#x000a3;5 gift vouchers for completion of questionnaires.</p><p>No data about identifiable patients will leave the practice unless patients have provided consent. All data will be stored securely and confidentially at the University of Bristol in line with its data management policies.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Sample size</title><p>The study is designed to detect an effect size of 0.274 SDs in the primary outcome of the EQ-5D-5L. Data about the variability of the new five-level (5L) version of the EQ-5D is currently more limited than for the well-established three-level (3L) version. The SD of the EQ-5D-3L in the UK general population is 0.23, rising to 0.27 in the oldest respondents (aged over 75).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Hence, an effect size of 0.274 would equate to a detectable difference of (0.274&#x000d7;0.27)=0.074 on the EQ-5D-3L, previously deemed to be the minimum important difference.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Although there are less data about the variability in the 5L version of the EQ-5D than the 3L version, this latest version is likely to have greater sensitivity to change.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Based on data available from our previous studies,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> we estimated that 2.3% of adult patients would have multimorbidity as defined in this study. This equates to about 108 patients in an average-sized practice of 6000 patients. Recruiting 32 practices would therefore provide 3456 potentially eligible patients. Assuming 40% of patients agree to participate (n=1382), 80% are followed up to 12&#x02005;months, and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03 for clustering at the practice level (based on the WISE trial),<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> 32 practices will provide approximately 90% power, with a 5% &#x003b1; level to detect an effect size of 0.274 SDs in the EQ-5D-5L measure between the intervention and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Allocation</title><p>General practices will be the unit of allocation. Practices will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the intervention or continue care as usual (control group). Randomisation will be stratified by area (Bristol, Greater Manchester, Glasgow) and minimised by deprivation level and practice size. Within each area allocation will be performed in blocks of two, with both practices in a block randomised at the same time and released to the trial manager together to ensure allocation concealment and no selection bias. It was not deemed possible to increase or vary the block sizes given the small number of practices recruited to each area and the dynamic nature of recruitment. The trial manager will notify the local research team of the two allocations and they will then notify the practices and arrange training of the intervention practice. The allocation schedule will be computer-generated by the trial statistician, blind to details of the practices apart from those needed for stratification and minimisation.</p><p>Randomisation of a practice will take place after patients in that practice have been identified and invited to participate in order to avoid selection bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Blinding</title><p>Once participants have been recruited, it will not be possible to mask participants or healthcare professionals to the group allocation of their practice. It is also not feasible to blind all members of the study team actively involved in the execution of the study.

Analysis of outcomes will be performed by the trial statistician, also masked to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data will be analysed in accordance with CONSORT principles and its extension for cluster randomised trials. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise characteristics of practices and patients and compare baseline characteristics between groups. A full statistical analysis plan will be developed and agreed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) after completion of the pilot phase and prior to undertaking any analyses of the main trial.</p><p>All analyses of primary and secondary outcomes will be at the patient level and will account for clustering by practice using multilevel regression models. Analyses will be performed on an &#x02018;as allocated&#x02019; basis. Primary analysis comparing EQ-5D-5L between the intervention and control practices will employ a linear multilevel regression model adjusted for stratification/minimisation variables. Subsequent models will adjust for baseline EQ-5D-5L, any variables demonstrating imbalance at baseline and other important prognostic variables such as age, number of long-term conditions, deprivation and depression. Preplanned analyses of secondary outcomes will also employ linear or logistic (as appropriate) multilevel regression models.</p><p>Formal tests of interaction will be performed to consider the following potential effect modifiers: age, number of chronic conditions, index of deprivation, and presence or absence of depression alongside physical health problems. The trial is not specifically powered for such interaction tests; hence, interpretation will focus on the CIs and will be hypothesis-generating only. The potential impact of missing data will be examined through sensitivity analyses.</p><p>Anonymised data will be used in order to compare descriptive data for consenting versus non-consenting patients. We will explore the possibility of comparing QOF performance in patients with chronic conditions both with and without multimorbidity&#x02014;this is to assess for the potential unintended consequence that concentrating effort on patients with multimorbidity may have a positive or negative impact on the care of other patients.</p><p>No interim analyses are planned.</p></sec><sec id="s2r"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>Cost per patient will be estimated by applying unit costs to the resources used. In a cost-consequences analysis, we will relate the mean cost per participant in each group with changes in a range of outcomes; cost-effectiveness analysis from the NHS and PSS perspective will estimate the incremental cost per QALY gain where QALYs are estimated using the EQ-5D-5L. Uncertainty will be addressed in sensitivity analyses and by using bootstrapping to estimate the net monetary benefit and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.</p></sec><sec id="s2s"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Alongside the main analysis of quantitative outcomes from the trial, we are conducting a nested process evaluation. This mixed-methods study aims to better understand how and why the intervention was effective or ineffective and to identify contextually relevant strategies for successful implementation as well as practice difficulties in adoption, delivery and maintenance of the intervention.

Patients from intervention practices will still have full access to their GP and secondary care services in addition to their six-monthly 3D assessments. Any changes in medication prescribing will be performed by a GP in the context of normal clinical care.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Patient safety</title><p>We will monitor and report descriptively the numbers of serious adverse events in each arm which appeared to be related to the intervention or the trial, and also the number of deaths in each trial arm. Given that patients with multimorbidity may be heavy users of secondary care services, new medical diagnoses, hospital admissions and deaths are expected and will not be considered as potential serious adverse events unless anyone involved in the study (participants, general practice staff or research staff) notify the research team of any events that they consider may have been related to the intervention or the research process.

It builds on a considerable evidence base about the difficulties experienced by patients with multimorbidity and the health professionals who seek to care for them. Through the use of a patient-centred conceptual framework, it tests a range of strategies which should address these difficulties and improve outcomes that matter to patients. The study is highly pragmatic.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> It is based in a range of normal general practice settings and in the different health economies of England and Scotland, which will enhance generalisability. It includes patients with broad inclusion criteria and few exclusion criteria, and assesses a wide range of outcomes including those relating to health status, patient experience and resource utilisation. Implementation of the intervention is flexible to local context, but the extent to which the intervention adheres to the key-intended principles will be monitored.</p><p>The study is being conducted with considerable attention to principles of knowledge translation. If the intervention is effective, it will be possible to roll it out quickly to general practices across the UK, and the 3D approach is also likely to be applicable to the management of patients with multimorbidity in many other countries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Bristol Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) for hosting this research, in particular Emma Moody, Joanne Atkinson and Rebecca Robinson.
