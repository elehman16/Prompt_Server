The long-term management of gout requires reduction of serum urate levels and this is most often achieved with use of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol. Febuxostat is the first new xanthine oxidase inhibitor since allopurinol and was licensed for use in 2008. The European Medicines Agency requested a postlicensing cardiovascular safety study of febuxostat versus allopurinol, which has been named the Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Streamlined trial (FAST).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>FAST is a cardiovascular safety study using the prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint design. FAST is recruiting in the UK and Denmark. Recruited patients are aged over 60&#x02005;years, prescribed allopurinol for symptomatic hyperuricaemia and have at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. After an allopurinol lead-in phase where the dose of allopurinol is optimised to achieve European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) urate targets (serum urate &#x0003c;357&#x02005;&#x000b5;mol/L), patients are randomised to either continue optimal dose allopurinol or to use febuxostat. Patients are followed-up for an average of 3&#x02005;years. The primary endpoint is first occurrence of the Anti-Platelet Trialists&#x02019; Collaboration (APTC) cardiovascular endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Secondary endpoints are all cause mortality and hospitalisations for heart failure, unstable, new or worsening angina, coronary or cerebral revascularisation, transient ischaemic attack, non-fatal cardiac arrest, venous and peripheral arterial vascular thrombotic event and arrhythmia with no evidence of ischaemia. The primary analysis is a non-inferiority analysis with a non-inferiority upper limit for the HR for the primary outcome of 1.3.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>FAST (ISRCTN72443728) has ethical approval in the UK and Denmark, and results will be published in a peer reviewed journal.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration number</title><p>FAST is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register (EUDRACT No: 2011-001883-23) and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN No: ISRCTN72443728).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiovascular Safety</kwd><kwd>Clinical Trial</kwd><kwd>Allopurinol</kwd><kwd>Febuxostat</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Use of technology including an electronic case report form, web portal and record linkage to identify potential endpoints provides efficient data management.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The open-label design provides good external validity as the trial is conducted in the normal care setting.

Crystal deposition in soft tissues may also be seen as gouty tophi. Although serum urate levels correlate poorly with disease activity, hyperuricaemia is the most significant risk factor for the development of symptomatic gout. Hyperuricaemia is generally defined as urate above approximately 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;mol/L (6.8&#x02005;mg/dL), as this is the concentration at which uric acid becomes insoluble in plasma.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>It is well recognised that patients with gout have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with the general population, and urate levels are increasingly believed to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Theories as to the specific causal relationship between hyperuricaemia and cardiovascular disease/mortality vary; however, the correlation between the two is widely recognised. It is also not clear whether lowering urate levels would improve the cardiovascular event rate of patients with hyperuricaemia.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref></p><p>Management of gout was revolutionised in the 1960s with the introduction of allopurinol, the first xanthine oxidase inhibitor, which reliably reduced urate levels, gout flares and long-term complications of gout.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The current European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) guideline for the management of gout recommends that urate lowering therapy (ULT) is indicated in patients with recurrent acute flares, arthropathy, tophi or radiographic changes of gout. The therapeutic goal of ULT is to promote crystal dissolution and prevent crystal formation. This is achieved by maintaining the serum urate level (SUA) below the saturation point for monosodium urate, and the target level recommended is &#x0003c;357&#x02005;&#x000b5;mol/L (&#x0003c;6&#x02005;mg/dL).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Allopurinol is currently the first-line ULT in the UK and Europe. It is licensed in the dose range of 100&#x02013;900&#x02005;mg; however, patients with renal impairment are recommended to take the minimum effective dose required to achieve urate control.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In the UK, the majority of patients are prescribed between 100 and 300&#x02005;mg of allopurinol daily, and primary care surveys have shown that the EULAR guideline target for urate is achieved in less than 50% of patients with gout receiving 300&#x02005;mg of allopurinol.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Febuxostat is a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor which was licensed in 2008 for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate deposition has occurred. The febuxostat Phase III randomised controlled trials demonstrated that 80&#x02005;mg febuxostat was superior to allopurinol 300&#x02005;mg in achieving and maintaining the target urate level of &#x0003c;357&#x02005;&#x000b5;mol/L.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Febuxostat can also be prescribed to patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency without the need for dose adjustment, and therefore provides an important alternative in the treatment of hyperuricaemia in patients with gout with renal impairment.</p><p>In the Phase III and long-term clinical extension studies of febuxostat, there was a numerical increase in investigator-reported cardiovascular events with febuxostat when compared to allopurinol. However, no statistically significant differences were found, no causal relationship was established and 60% of the patients in these trials had &#x02265;2 risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The European Union Risk Management Plan for febuxostat (V.2.0; 19 February 2008) indicated that a postmarketing study to evaluate cardiovascular safety of febuxostat was to be conducted as part of the febuxostat pharmacovigilance plan. To fulfil this postlicensing obligation, a large safety study of febuxostat versus standard ULT with allopurinol for patients with symptomatic hyperuricaemia (gout) is being undertaken. The study is named the FAST.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Overall trial design</title><p>FAST is a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE) design trial to compare the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol.

Prophylaxis postrandomisation is offered for 6&#x02005;months.

Physicians assess the causality and expectedness of any event thought to be related to one of the study medications. An event is deemed serious if it results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or any other important medical event that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcomes (whether or not the event was related to study medication). Serious adverse events (SAEs) are reported by study personnel without delay and are also collected regularly where appropriate using record-linkage methods. SAEs are followed up until resolved or the patient has died. Events that are neither serious nor related to study medication are not required to be reported. Primary and secondary study endpoints and their associated symptoms or laboratory abnormalities are not reported as suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs).</p><p>If a reported SAE is a potential study endpoint, more detailed information is collected and an anonymised endpoint package is prepared.

Per-protocol analysis will exclude patients who discontinued trial therapy, deaths from non-cardiovascular causes and patients lost to follow-up.

This is advantageous for the patient and their primary care physician, and allows tracking of drug supply and drug return.</p><p>When completed, FAST will help to establish the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in a population with high cardiovascular risk.
