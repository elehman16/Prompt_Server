Unawareness of parenting skills required for autistic children (parenting) doubles their anxiety. Researchers have recently considered research on mobile education, especially mobile text messages. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of mobile parenting skills education on the anxiety of mothers with autistic children.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This is a clinical trial conducted on 64 mothers of children suffering from autism who had a medical file. The participants were recruited by convenient sampling in selected autism centers in Isfahan, Iran. Then, the participants were randomly assigned into two 32-subject groups of study and control. Spielberger Anxiety Inventory was adopted for the mothers. The book &#x0201c;Parenting skills for the mothers with autistic children&#x0201d; was distributed in the study and control group, and then, the study group underwent a structured mobile text messages education. Sixty text messages were sent daily to the participants in the study group for two months.

Consequently, a majority of care is done by the families. Autism is associated with stress and accountability among the patients&#x02019; parents. The parents taking care of an autistic child experience a higher level of stress, depression, and anxiety, compared to the parents of children with other mental growth and physical disabilities.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Khorram Abadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in a study on comparison of parenting stress in autistic children's mothers compared to those with healthy children reported that the stress was significantly higher in the first group compared to the second.</p><p>On the other hand, the parents of these children suffer from anxiety, acute concern, and confusion due to a lack of knowledge about the care required for these children.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Moreover, mothers experience more stress than the fathers.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A major part of the stress that these mothers experience is associated with their children's behavioral problems. Their lack of knowledge about required parenting skills can double their anxiety.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It is the parents&#x02019; rights to receive scientific and research oriented information about their children's disease and they deserve to receive such information.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although parents&#x02019; education is important, the parents cannot attend educational sessions due to their involvement in their children. On the other hand, due to their various working shifts, holding such sessions is difficult for the nurses. Various studies in the context of nursing showed that text message education may complete or even replace face to face education.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Mobile technology, especially text messaging, has been proven to be a hopping method in management of chronic diseases and promotion of various health-related behaviors.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Research shows that mobile is not only common but has been proved efficient in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>There are several studies on the effect of education through mobile in chronic diseases,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but no studies have been conducted on its effect on education of parents with autistic children. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of mobile parenting skills education on anxiety of the mothers with autistic children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><p>This was a clinical trial (IRCT2015080223454N1), with two-group (study, control), two-stage (pre-test&#x02013;post-test) design to investigate the effect of mobile parenting skills education on anxiety of the mothers with autistic children. Study population comprised the mothers of autistic children undergoing education in selected autism centers in Isfahan. The researcher referred to study environment after getting an introduction letter from Isfahan wellbeing organization and giving necessary explanations about the research goal to the authorities and attaining their agreement and cooperation, following which sampling was conducted.</p><p>The subjects were selected after obtaining their informed written consent by convenient sampling from all mothers with autistic children, referring to study environment and meeting the inclusion criteria. Spielberger questionnaire, containing demographic information, was filled, and then, the subjects were randomly assigned to either study or control group. The study was conducted on 64 mothers (<italic>n</italic> = 32, <italic>n</italic> = 32). Inclusion criteria were availability of a mobile, ability to read a text message, motivation to attend the study and ability to cooperate during the study, having a mobile with Persian texting service, lack of any acute or chronic physical known diseases during study, and attending other concurrent similar studies. Exclusion criteria were lack of cooperation with study at any stage due to any reason and the mothers facing severe stressful factors during the study.</p><p>Both groups were given a parenting skills book, specified for parents with autistic children. Mobile text reading method and necessary education were given to the study group. They were also asked to read not only the main text message (including parenting skills, specified for the parents with autistic children) but also the indicated pages of the book at the end of that message on that day. Meanwhile, they were asked only to read the determined pages of the book within the days they received neutral messages (including hopping and energetic texts for the mothers themselves). The mothers in the study group were also asked to have no communication with the control group concerning their text message program.</p><p>To diminish mothers&#x02019; sensitivity to the nature of autism and their concern, neutral messages (containing hopping and energetic texts for the mothers themselves) were also sent. Approximately 60 text messages (including 30 main and 30 neutral messages) were sent to the subjects in study group.</p><p>The messages were sequentially sent (one day the main text the other day the neutral text was sent). These text messages were interactive and the researcher followed up the progression of the intervention through phone calls (twice a week). To collect the data, the Spielberger questionnaire in addition to the demographic information (that was added to the questionnaire) was adopted. It contains 20 items on a five-point Likert's scale that measures subjects&#x02019; emotions. Scoring was from zero to four while the items measuring the anxiety were scored inversely so that the lowest and highest anxiety scores were 20 and 80, respectively.</p><p>In Iran, Mahram conducted a study to standardize Spielberger questionnaire and investigated the reliability index of the test in norm and criterion groups separately. The reliability for norm group (<italic>n</italic> = 600) was attained with Cronbach alpha of 0.90 whereas it was 0.94 in criterion group (<italic>n</italic> = 130). In addition, this study had concurrent criterion validity. For validity, with regard to criterion sample size (130 patients with anxiety, diagnosed by a psychiatrist), 130 subjects were randomly selected from norm group (with respect to gender and age groups of the criterion group members). The validity of the test was significant over 90%.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Its reliability was found to be 87% in various studies.

Clarke and Yarborough[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] conducted a study on the effect of mental health self-efficacy (MHSE) (for mobile-based and web-based education) on depression, anxiety, and minor to moderate stress, and showed that the participants had a significant progression in MHSE in the study group after intervention, compared to control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).
