It has been proposed that some women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) develop sensitization to <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and clinically improve in response to <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy. Here, we report a case series of 12 women diagnosed with chronic vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity subsequently treated with <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy and review potential systemic and localized host immune defense mechanisms involved in <italic>C. albicans</italic> overgrowth and sensitization. A retrospective review of vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity in women who were treated with <italic>C. albicans</italic> immunotherapy over the past eight years was conducted. Twelve women who qualified for a diagnosis of vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity were treated with <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy. Eleven of the 12 (92%) women reported clinical improvement after immunotherapy. The majority of these women were not sensitized to seasonal or perennial aeroallergens and clinically responded to lower concentrations of <italic>C. albicans</italic> allergen than what has been previously reported. In general, <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy was well tolerated.

However, the majority of women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) have no recognizable risk factors.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Topical antifungal agents are usually effective in treating this condition and relieving the uncomfortable associated symptoms. However, in 5% of these women, vulvovaginal candidiasis recurs after treatment is discontinued, resulting in debilitating symptoms and an impact on their personal relationships. RVVC, defined as four or more episodes over a 12-month period, pose a frustrating problem to gynecologists and other primary care providers, because no completely effective treatment, including systemic antifungal agents such as ketoconazole or fluconazole, has been found.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, the chronic use of older agents used to treat RVVC (<italic>i.e.</italic>, ketoconazole) was associated with significant side effects such as liver toxicity which has not been found with fluconazole.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> A previous six-month trial of weekly treatment with fluconazole reported a reduced rate of recurrence of symptomatic RVVC.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Treatment with this antifungal was generally well tolerated, and there was no evidence of liver toxicity or azole resistance in isolates of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> or other subspecies. However, this therapy was not effective at preventing recurrent episodes.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Although research has been conducted to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms involved for balancing resistance and tolerance for RVVC and various treatment modalities for this disorder have been investigated, no effective long term cure has been found that works for all women. Meech <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that both immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and/or cellular-mediated hypersensitivity mechanisms may be involved in these local infections.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> They emphasized the need to recognize the nature of the host response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> to understand and treat the various clinical presentations of these infections.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Witkin <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that some of these women have an abnormal macrophage response to <italic>C. albicans</italic>.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> They postulated that the macrophages of these women produce increased levels of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, which inhibits the lymphocyte proliferative response to <italic>Candida</italic> antigen.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Witkin <italic>et al.</italic> previously demonstrated that the vaginal secretions of many women with RVVC contain anti-<italic>Candida</italic> IgE antibodies and detectable levels of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This observation led to speculation that a vaginal hypersensitivity response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> may be associated with increased levels of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, which is capable of suppressing localized vaginal cell-mediated immune responses.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The loss of this localized vaginal defense mechanism can result in colonization by yeast leading to repetitive infections.</p><p>There have previously been anecdotal reports claiming success in desensitizing women with RVVC.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Rigg <italic>et al.</italic> evaluated recurrent allergic vulvovaginitis in 18 women who had a positive prick or intracutaneous skin test to <italic>C. albicans</italic>.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These women received conventional immunotherapy to <italic>C. albicans</italic> over one year.

To satisfy the diagnosis of RVVC, women were required to have at least four or more mycologically proven episodes in the past 12 months, consisting of itching, discharge, and burning/pain with or without sexual intercourse and without underlying diabetes or overgrowth due to antibiotics. Pregnant women or those with a humoral or cellular immunodeficiency disorder such as chronic mucocandidiasis were excluded. None of the women had a history of food, human seminal plasma, latex, or spermicide sensitivities. All women exhibited positive vaginal cultures for <italic>C. albicans</italic> or a comparable cross-reactive yeast infection (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Torulopsis glabrata</italic>). Because this was a retrospective study summarizing our experience treating women using a previously reported safe and effective therapy (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> immunotherapy), Institutional Review Board approval was not required.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Skin Testing</title><p>Preimmunotherapy evaluation included prick skin tests (PSTs) to routine seasonal and perennial aeroallergens and to <italic>C. albicans</italic> (Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC) in conjunction with positive histamine HCl (1 mg/mL) and negative saline controls. If the PST to <italic>C. albicans</italic> was negative, an intracutaneous test [1:1000 (weight per volume [w/v])] to <italic>C. albicans</italic> was then applied.

Once the maintenance dose was reached, injections were decreased in frequency up to every four weeks depending on clinical response. Therapy was continued beyond six months if patients demonstrated a clinical response.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Endpoints</title><p>Baseline total symptom scores were based on a nine-point scale for itching, vaginal discharge, and burning/pain.

Patients were instructed to keep a record of their localized vaginal symptoms and treatment requirements while receiving immunotherapy.

Eight of 12 women (67%) reported worsening of vaginal yeast infection symptoms while on antibiotics. <italic>Candida</italic> sensitization was demonstrated by immediate positive intracutaneous testing to <italic>C. albicans</italic> (Greer Laboratories) in all but one patient who had a positive prick puncture skin test (PST). All of the women experienced late phase cutaneous responses within four to eight hours after testing.

In fact, increasing the concentration of immunotherapy in some women actually worsened their vaginal candidiasis symptoms. Although the significance of these findings requires confirmation in a larger patient population, these clinical observations suggest that the immunologic cause of this disorder is more complex than an isolated IgE-mediated response to <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>The results of our experience treating women diagnosed with vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity differs from what has been previously reported by other investigators who found a strong correlation between atopy and RVVC.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In contrast, we found that not only were the majority of our subjects nonatopic, the women who exhibited the best response to therapy were also nonatopic. Also of note, previous immunotherapy protocols used high concentrations of <italic>C. albicans</italic> allergen extract (10,000 protein nitrogen units) to elicit a therapeutic response.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The maintenance concentration of <italic>C. albicans</italic> allergen extract required to reduce or alleviate clinical symptoms in our patient population was significantly lower.</p><p>Research in murine models may provide hypotheses for understanding the mechanisms for systemic and localized vaginal yeast infections. Interestingly entirely different conclusions have been reached depending on whether the innate or adaptive immune response was the focus of research. For example, Montagnoli <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> used mice deficient in key costimulatory molecules (Cluster of Differentiation [CD]28, B7-1, and B7-2) of the adaptive immune response to demonstrate important contributions of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells (T lymphocyte regulatory cells) and interleukin (IL)-10 producing dendritic cells in conferring resistance to <italic>Candida</italic> infection. By contrast, Netea <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> found that an impaired innate immune response engendered in Toll receptor-2 knockout mice resulted in decreased expression of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 and a 50% decrease in T regulatory (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD25<sup>+</sup>) cell populations in this model. The complete depletion of T regulatory cells led to the complete resistance to systemic candidiasis infection.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The ambiguous findings of these two studies might be explained by interactive regulatory pathways between the innate and adaptive immune systems for controlling systemic infections of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in a host. Yano <italic>et al.</italic> more recently concluded that cytokines and protective roles of T cells had a limited role in vaginal candidiasis.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These investigators have proposed that the polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrates characteristic of inflammation in RVVC is caused by an impaired or over aggressive innate immune response.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The role of immediate and/or delayed hypersensitivity has also been explored in murine vaginal candidiasis models. Romani <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> suggested that CBA/j mice strains, which predominantly exhibit a T lymphocyte helper cells type 1 and type 2 (Th1 and Th2) immune response, were less susceptible to developing vaginal candidiasis, whereas BALB/c mice strains, which predominantly produce increased amounts of the Th2 cytokine, IL-4, were more prone to recurrent yeast infections. This finding suggested that Th1 cell-mediated responses were important in conferring resistance against RVVC.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, Fidel <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> later reported that there were no differences in specific-systemic cell-mediated protective responses against RVVC between a variety of mouse strains systemically preinoculated with <italic>C. albicans</italic>. These findings suggested that systemic cell-mediated immunity was not the predominant host defense mechanism against <italic>Candida</italic> infection in the vaginal mucosa.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Taylor <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> found that the Th2 immunoregulatory cytokine, transforming growth factor &#x003b2;, was expressed to a much higher degree in na&#x000ef;ve mouse vaginal tissue than other Th1 and Th2 cytokines and was significantly further increased when these mice were experimentally infected with <italic>Candida</italic>. This finding suggested that the presence of increased Th2 cytokines such as transforming growth factor &#x003b2; may predispose to RVVC and subsequent vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity by overriding normally protective Th1 cell-mediated immune responses in the vagina.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Neves <italic>et al.</italic> previously investigated whether atopic women experiencing RVVC were at a greater risk for exhibiting a Th2 vaginal immune response.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> They enrolled 44 women between the ages 18&#x02013;50 years with a history of RVVC and 26 nonpregnant women without RVVC as a control group.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In addition to performing PSTs to common seasonal and perennial aeroallergens, <italic>in vitro</italic> peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation responses to both <italic>C. albicans</italic> antigen and mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin) in women with and without RVVC were also performed. The supernatants from these <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures were used to measure IL-5 levels.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Total and specific IgE to <italic>C. albicans</italic> was also measured for each subject. Although they found a strong association between clinical atopy and RVVC, there were no differences between the symptomatic and control women for <italic>Candida</italic>-specific IgE, total IgE, <italic>Candida</italic> induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation, or IL-5 cytokine levels, which would support a Th2 immune response in women with RVVC.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Ramirez De Knott <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> compared patch test results with <italic>C. albicans</italic> in women with idiopathic vulvodynia who are known to experience frequent bouts of RVVC and two control groups: 1) women with chronic nonatopic dermatitis and 2) women with atopic dermatitis. They found that women with idiopathic vulvodynia, who had experienced previous RVVC infections, were more likely to respond to <italic>C. albicans</italic> patch testing than either dermatitis control group.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Interestingly, they found that many of their subjects exhibited strong patch test responses at relatively low concentrations of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and had weaker or no response at higher concentrations.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This counterintuitive dose response may correspond to our finding that subjects responded better to <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy at relatively low concentrations of antigen. Also of note, patch test responses in their study differed between antigens, suggesting that relevant <italic>C. albicans</italic> epitopes may not be present in all commercial extracts.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The lack of a standardized commercial <italic>C. albicans</italic> extract could explain the variable response to treatment observed in our patient population if they were not receiving the specific <italic>C. albicans</italic> allergen(s) to which they were sensitized. However, the <italic>C. albicans</italic> allergen extract used to test and treat these women was previously very well characterized by the manufacturer.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The rationale for administering <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy in women with chronic vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity is supported by our previous experience of desensitizing women with localized vaginal seminal plasma hypersensitivity to their sexual partner's seminal plasma proteins and by mucosal vaccination studies conducted in murine models for RVVC.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> C&#x000e1;rdenas-Freytag <italic>et al.</italic> found that intranasal vaccination with a mucosal vaccine composed of heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> in an estrogen-dependent mouse model for RVVC resulted in a significant, albeit brief, protection against development of both a <italic>C. albicans</italic> delayed type hypersensitivity response and circulating <italic>C. albicans-</italic>specific antibodies.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, the levels of <italic>C. albicans</italic>-specific antibodies in the vaginal secretions of these protected mice were very low, and correlation between vaginal Th1 or Th2 cytokine responses was not observed.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These findings indicate that some additional form of immunoregulation occurred in the vaginal mucosa that prevented a more dominant Th1-localized cell-mediated or humoral immune response.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>The underlying mechanism(s) of chronic vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity and response to <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy is complex and incompletely understood. The preponderance of data suggests that both the innate and adaptive immune response are necessary to protect the host from systemic <italic>C. albicans</italic> overgrowth.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In addition, with the vaginal mucosa, a more delicate balance between Th1 and Th2 responses and other newly formed bioactive mediators (<italic>i.e.</italic>, prostaglandins) is likely preventing RVVC and subsequent hypersensitivity reactions from occurring.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It is plausible to speculate that circulating CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD25<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells and mucosal dendritic cells are playing an integral role in this process given our recent understanding of their importance in regulating the innate and adaptive immune responses associated with allergen sensitization.</p><p>A significant limitation of this study was that it was not designed as a longitudinal double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Furthermore, the majority of subjects did not undergo postimmunotherapy skin testing to determine whether there was a threshold change in their immediate skin test response or an attenuation of their late phase cutaneous reaction, although the two subjects that were tested demonstrated no change in skin test reactivity. In addition, it is not possible to provide uniform treatment recommendations for women presenting with RVVC, because the doses and duration of <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy were individualized and varied widely between patients in this small case series, It should be emphasized that <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy is only appropriate for women with RVVC that have documented sensitization to <italic>C. albicans</italic> or a cross-reacted species by skin testing or a serum-specific IgE immunoassay.</p><p>In summary, chronic vulvovaginal <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity is an underrecognized disorder by primary care physicians and therefore an undertreated disorder by allergists. Animal models have provided insight into potential mechanisms for RVVC and subsequent <italic>Candida</italic> hypersensitivity but do not always reflect what is happening in human beings. Therefore, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial is necessary to firmly establish the efficacy of treatment with <italic>Candida</italic> immunotherapy. This investigation should be designed to include mechanistic studies that would help us better understand the etiology of this disorder. The benefit of such a study would significantly increase the general medical community's awareness of the availability of a potential curative treatment for this common manifestation, which occurs in a subset of women with RVCC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare pertaining to this article</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This manuscript is dedicated in memory of W.
