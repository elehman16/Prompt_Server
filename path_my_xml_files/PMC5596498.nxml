Reder et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have shown that an interactive computer session in combination with practical CPR training was an instructive method for high school students. In another study, watching an instructional video before practical infant CPR training improved skill acquisition compared with a traditional training method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In October 2016, the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) started an online learning system, CoSy, in preparation for practical basic life support training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">A statement from the ERC, approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), recommends that all school children should undergo CPR training every year starting from the age of 12&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. If all students undergo practical CPR training in school, a large proportion of a nation&#x02019;s population would have basic skills within a few decades.

The present study evaluated an interactive web course, Help-Brain-Heart (HBH), teaching symptoms of stroke, symptoms of AMI and a healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A preparatory web course and information on stroke, AMI or healthy lifestyles factors are not included in traditional basic life support training. The aim was to investigate whether this web course given to 13-year-old students before CPR training could influence not only theoretical knowledge about stroke, AMI and lifestyle factors but also practical CPR skills and willingness to act in a cardiac arrest situation. CPR quality was assessed directly after training and at follow-up 6&#x000a0;months later. Our hypothesis was that basic knowledge of cardiovascular disease, through the web course, places CPR knowledge in context and increases acquisition of practical CPR skills.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and design</title><p id="Par17">Academic leaders of all 24 council schools in two Swedish municipalities (each with 140,000 inhabitants) received an invitation to participate in the study. In accordance with the school curriculum in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the intervention was applied in grade 7 (13-year-old students). Before the study, the students and their parents received a letter about the study. Participation by individual students was completely voluntary and was preceded by oral informed consent.</p><p id="Par18">All seventh grade students in each participating school were eligible to take part. Students were excluded if they declined participation, had a physical handicap that significantly limited their performance, or had development disabilities.</p><p id="Par19">A cluster randomised design was applied in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Based on a randomisation list generated by an independent statistician, classes were cluster randomised to CPR training only (control group) or to a web course before practical CPR training (intervention group). CPR training and data collection took place between December 2013 and October 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Practical CPR training applied to all groups</title><p id="Par20">Both the control group and the intervention group received the same practical CPR training. All the students had an individual training manikin, MiniAnne (Laerdal AS, Norway), during training. All training sessions were carried out in accordance with the current ERC guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. School teachers, who all were CPR instructors, acted as facilitators and were responsible for training the pupils in CPR. All teachers obtained individual oral and written information to ensure that they were up to date with the present CPR guidelines and training. Training was given to the entire class together. The CPR training was based on a mobile application (app) or a video on DVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The study design and the CPR training have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The web course, the DVD and the app were all produced by the Swedish CPR Council and based on ERC guidelines 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Web course: Help-brain-heart</title><p id="Par21">The HBH web course was developed and published online by the Swedish Resuscitation Council in 2013 and deals with the symptoms, causes and actions for stroke, AMI and cardiac arrest and includes information about lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise and diet) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The web course is led by an animated storyteller. The narrative is interspersed with videos, animations and ten interactive questions. The purpose of the interactive questions is to engage the students and force them to use decision-making skills. This web course lasts for 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min. If the students had access to a computer, the web course was conducted individually during a lesson, otherwise by the whole class together. Students in the intervention group undertook the web course within 7&#x000a0;days before the practical CPR training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment</title><p id="Par22">Directly after CPR training and at the 6-month follow-up, the students were given a practical CPR skill test and asked to complete a questionnaire. All tests were performed individually and carried out at the schools. As previously described, the Laerdal PC skill reporting system 2.4 linked to ResusciAnne (Laerdal NS, Norway) was used to measure the quantitative data for CPR performance, whereas &#x0201c;check responsiveness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;check respiration&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;alarm 112&#x0201d; were assessed by direct observation by the investigator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The test data were recorded directly into a modified version of the validated Cardiff test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], on a scoring sheet adapted to current resuscitation guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A total score was calculated for each student (12&#x02013;48 points). The indicators on the scoring sheet are described in detail in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par23">The ERC guidelines recommend a compression depth of 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The PC Skill Reporter System measures compression depth up to 60&#x000a0;mm. To avoid a situation where those who compressed &#x0003e;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;mm were given the highest score (6 points), the highest score was given for an average compression depth of 50&#x02013;59&#x000a0;mm. We chose to retain the 6-point scale, as in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], even though no one could receive the 3 points corresponding to a compression depth&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;mm (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">The duration of the practical test was 3&#x000a0;min. The optimal conduct was a maximum of 30&#x000a0;s to check responsiveness, check respiration and call for help, followed by 2.5&#x000a0;min of CPR. As an introduction to the practical test, the test leader described an OHCA situation and asked the student to act accordingly. Directly after the test, the student received individual constructive feedback from the test leader for 2&#x000a0;min. The test at 6&#x000a0;months was carried out in the same way and without prior notice. The test leader (AN) is a certified CPR instructor, experienced in the modified Cardiff test, who was blinded to the training method of the students.</p><p id="Par25">After the practical test, the students answered a fixed-response questionnaire with questions about background factors, self-reported confidence, willingness to act, and knowledge about stroke, AMI and lifestyle factors (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Most students responded to the survey online and each question had to be answered in order to proceed to the next. The survey took 6&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min to complete. The questionnaire resulted in a total score of 0&#x02013;7 points for stroke symptoms, 0&#x02013;9 points for AMI symptoms and 0&#x02013;6 points on lifestyle factors. A higher score meant better knowledge (correct answers). Questions about AMI were partly based on a previous survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Before the study, comprehension of the questions about self-efficacy and scenarios about willingness to act were tested and found satisfactory in a separate cohort of 175 students.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study outcome measures</title><p id="Par26">The primary endpoint was the total score for the modified Cardiff test at 6&#x000a0;months.

In the present study, the interactive web course did not increase the students&#x02019; acquisition of practical CPR skills. This is in accordance with Perkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] who also found that the use of preparatory e-learning simulation software by health care providers did not improve their CPR skills. Rehberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] compared classroom-based and computer-based CPR training and found that the performance of those in the computer group was not as effective in terms of quality of CPR. Means et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] reported that a meta-analysis of empirical studies on the effectiveness of online learning (not in combination with CPR training) showed varying results for different preparatory computer-based activities. According to a meta-analyses by Hattie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the average effect of web-based learning was small, although the variability was huge across studies. A contributing factor may be that web-based learning often ignores important educational foundations such as interaction and timely adapted feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is difficult to compare results from different e-learning studies because of differences in the design and content of courses; with some methods, the participants passively acquire knowledge by watching a movie, whereas other methods engage the participant and require actions to complete the programme. Previous studies have shown that hands-on training is important in terms of acquiring and developing good quality practical CPR skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Further research is needed to investigate the optimal use of web-based learning as a supplemental learning tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], because it increases the flexibility of learning in terms of location and time, is available to participants both before and after practical training and can be cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] if participants come well prepared to practical training. It is a format that can appeal to young people and can be used for rehearsal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. All these factors can be included in the evaluation of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">According to Bandura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and social cognitive theory, an individual&#x02019;s self-efficacy may affect a person&#x02019;s performance.

There were no significant differences between the groups regarding self-estimated knowledge about performing compressions and ventilation.

However, there was no significant difference between the groups regarding how the students stated they would act in an OHCA situation.</p><p id="Par38">The students who took the web course performed significantly better for the theoretical issues compared with the control group at both measurement points with regard to stroke (54% versus 38% of the total score directly after training), AMI (44% versus 28%) and lifestyle factors (90% versus 75%). The clinical importance of this difference is unclear. It is essential that the public is aware of the typical symptoms associated with AMI and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Early recognition of symptoms and an early call for help are essential to the outcome.

A contributing factor to the fact that both the intervention and the control groups showed more knowledge about stroke symptoms than AMI symptoms may be the Swedish National Stroke Campaign called AKUT (A for face dropping, K for arm/leg weakness, U for slurred speech, and T for time to call 112), which has been ongoing since autumn 2011.</p><p id="Par39">The students in the present study showed great interest in CPR training; most believed that it is important to learn CPR in schools (98% in both groups) and they felt more confident about taking action compared with before the training (intervention group, 82%; control group, 88%), which is similar to results from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The study was carried out in schools from all socio-economic areas and included 86% of eligible students, strengthening the generalisability of our findings.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par41">A few schools had limited access to computers or had technical problems with internet access for all students and the web course was then conducted with the entire class. As a result, there is a risk that some students did not actively participate in the online course and therefore did not learn as much as they would if they had done it by themselves and had independently answered all the questions on the web course. This reflects everyday life in school and how schools apply tuition. It is unclear if this could have attenuated differences between groups and, if so, the generalisability of the study results. It is also unclear if the students&#x02019; individual digital literacy affected their participation in the web course and the result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, the web course has a basic format with clear instructions.
