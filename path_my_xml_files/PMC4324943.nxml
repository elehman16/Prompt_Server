There are currently 5.4 million people in the United States[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 36 million people worldwide[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] who are living with dementia, which represents one in nine individuals age 65 years or older and one in three age 85 or older.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] By 2050, prevalence will be 11 to 16 million in the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 115 million worldwide.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Furthermore, the societal costs of caring for individuals with dementia were estimated to be more than $600 billion worldwide in 2010, which is roughly 1% of the global gross domestic product and exceeds the annual budgets of many individual countries.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In the U.S. alone, the costs of caring for individuals with dementia were estimated to be $159-$215 billion in 2010, with a projected increase to $379-$511 billion in 2040.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Currently available dementia medications are associated with small improvements in cognitive and physical function (standardized effect sizes, 0.11&#x02013;0.33) but have many adverse effects and do not stop or slow the disease course.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In addition, several new medications that initially appeared promising have recently failed in Phase III clinical trials.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Therefore, it is critically important to study alternative approaches that allow individuals with dementia to maintain physical function, cognitive function and quality of life to the greatest degree possible throughout the disease process.</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that &#x02018;conventional&#x02019; exercise programs such as walking, resistance training and seated exercises that focus on improving aerobic endurance, strength, balance and flexibility have beneficial effects on physical function in individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A recent meta-analysis identified 16 randomized, controlled trials of conventional exercise interventions in 937 individuals with dementia, finding evidence that exercise improves the ability to perform basic activities of daily living such as eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet and transferring from bed to chair.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, the effects of conventional exercise on other important outcomes such as cognitive function, mood, behaviors and quality of life were less consistent.</p><p>A handful of recent studies suggest that &#x02018;complementary/alternative&#x02019; forms of exercise such as tai chi, yoga and dance may be effective for improving these other outcomes. For example, studies have found that tai chi and yoga are associated with improvements in cognitive function and quality of life, as well as physical function, in older adults with and without cognitive impairment.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In addition, dance-based exercise programs are associated with reductions in problematic behaviors and greater enjoyment in individuals with dementia.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Taken together, these prior studies suggest that different types of exercise may offer different benefits, and that a program that combines different approaches may result in greater improvements across multiple domains. In addition, it may be important to incorporate recent evidence from physical and occupational therapy studies, which suggest that a personalized, goal-oriented approach can lead to better outcomes in other settings.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Finally, recent discoveries in neuroscience and experimental psychology have found that, although explicit memory (conscious learning of new information) is impaired in individuals with dementia, implicit memory (learning that occurs without conscious awareness) is relatively preserved.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] This is particularly true of implicit memory that involves perceptual or motor learning rather than conceptual learning,[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] including procedural memory (learning to perform procedures).</p><p>We hypothesized that an exercise program that focused on training procedural memory to build the strength and capacity to perform the movements that are most needed for daily function (e.g., transitioning safely from sitting to standing) would help individuals with dementia to maintain functional independence. In addition, we hypothesized that the benefits of the program would be enhanced by combining or integrating &#x02018;best elements&#x02019; from both conventional and complementary/alternative exercise approaches, particularly through greater in-the-moment body awareness and social connection.

Physical therapy has a participant-centered goal orientation (Guiding Principal [GP] 4) and exercises are repeated with variations (GP 1) and often involve progressive functional movements (GP 2). <underline>Occupational therapy</underline> is a health care profession that helps people to participate in the things they want and need to do through the therapeutic use of everyday activities (occupations).[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] It involves performing an individualized evaluation to determine a person&#x02019;s goals related to functional activities, developing a customized intervention that may include adaptation of the environment as well as specific activities to improve the person&#x02019;s ability to perform daily activities and reach the goals, and an outcomes evaluation to ensure that the goals are being met and to make changes to the intervention plan as needed, recognizing the functional and social/emotional needs of clients. Occupational therapy has a participant-centered goal orientation (GP 4) and may involve physical exercises that repeat with variations (GP 1) or target progressive functional movements (GP 2); in addition, occupational therapy interventions in people with dementia often utilize a slow pace and step-by-step instruction (GP 3) and emphasize social interaction (GP 6) and positive emotions (GP 7). <underline>Yoga</underline> is a movement practice from India that seeks to join the mind, body and spirit in a harmonious experience.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Yoga primarily includes physical postures, conscious breathing techniques, and meditation practice and sometimes incorporates visualization and the use of sounds or chanting. While hatha yoga is the form of yoga first popularized in the west, there are many forms of yoga, and our study integrated a form of yoga called Healing Yoga[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] that emphasizes nonjudgmental instruction, comfort while moving, and attention to breathing and body sensations. Yoga typically involves repetition of movements with variation (GP 1); a slow pace and step-by-step instruction (GP 3); a focus on body awareness, mindfulness and breathing (GP 6); and promotion of positive emotions (GP 7). <underline>Tai chi</underline> is a mind-body health practice that originated in China as an internal martial art.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] It involves performing slow, fluid movement sequences following established forms that are learned over time. Sometimes called &#x02018;moving meditation,&#x02019; tai chi practice emphasizes staying aligned, grounded and balanced while moving, with attention to mental and physical relaxation, promoted by deep, diaphragmatic breathing.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] Tai chi involves repetition of movements with variation (GP 1); a slow pace and step-by-step instruction (GP 3); training of body awareness, mindfulness and breathing (GP 5), and a focus on positive emotions (GP 7).

Group 1 participated in the PLI&#x000c9; program at least 2 days per week for 45 minutes from weeks 1 to 18 while Group 2 engaged in usual activities (Usual Care, UC), which included standard chair-based exercises. From weeks 19 to 36, the groups crossed over, and Group 1 returned to usual activities while Group 2 participated in the PLI&#x000c9; program at least 2 days per week for 45 minutes.

Caregivers in both groups were called on a biweekly basis to assess for adverse events throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Eligibility and Enrollment</title><p>Participants and caregivers were enrolled as dyads. Inclusion criteria for participants were: age &#x02265; 55 years, a diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia of any type or severity, adult day program attendance at least 2 days/week, recommended by adult day staff, English language fluency and caregiver consent. These criteria were designed to be as inclusive as possible to reflect the real world heterogeneity of adult day programs. Most clients at this center had mild to moderate Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease or vascular dementia. Exclusion criteria for participants were: lack of assent to study procedures. Inclusion criteria for caregivers were: current provision of care to primary participant and ability to answer questions about the primary participant&#x02019;s physical function, behaviors, quality of life and their own level of stress. Exclusion criteria for caregivers were: major neurologic or psychiatric condition, life expectancy &#x0003c; 1 year, evidence of cognitive impairment or inability to consent to study procedures.</p><p>Potential participant/caregiver dyads were first contacted by staff at the adult day program. Those who agreed were then contacted by research staff and invited to participate in the study. As the day program already included daily exercise and required all clients to receive medical clearance prior to joining, our study did not require additional medical clearance.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Setting</title><p>All intervention procedures took place at the adult day center or participant/caregiver homes. Outcome assessments for the participants were performed at the day center. Caregiver outcome assessments were performed at either the center or the caregiver&#x02019;s home, based on their preference. Assessments were timed so that they did not overlap with intervention classes to ensure adequate blinding of assessors.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>PLI&#x000c9; Intervention</title><p>The PLI&#x000c9; program followed the Guiding Principles shown in <xref rid="pone.0113367.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> regarding the manner in which the program was taught. Briefly, the guiding principles included repetition with variation; progressive, functional movements; slow-pace and step-by-step instruction; participant-centered goal orientation; body awareness, mindfulness, and breathing; social interaction and positive emotions. In addition, each class followed a basic class structure that included greetings (5 minutes), body awareness warm-up (5 minutes), seated exercises (15 minutes), sit-to-stand and standing exercises (15 minutes) and closing/appreciations (5 minutes) (see <xref rid="pone.0113367.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref> for additional details). The PLI&#x000c9; program was delivered for 45-minute sessions, 3 days/week throughout the study period. Exercise instructors had been previously certified in at least one body awareness-focused approach to exercise (e.g., Feldenkrais or Rosen method)[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and were trained to administer the PLI&#x000c9; program using a detailed manual that was developed for this pilot study. Adherence to the protocol was monitored through class visits by the principal investigator and co-investigators; review of daily class reports and logs of the specific exercises taught at each class; and weekly team meetings.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Usual Care (UC) Control</title><p>Participants in the UC group performed standard chair-based exercises in a separate room led by adult day center staff members for approximately 20 minutes followed by other group activities such as music and art appreciation. These exercises were designed to increase heart rate, strength and flexibility by engaging all major muscle groups, although heart rate was not routinely monitored. Key differences between PLI&#x000c9; versus UC exercises included: 1) sitting in a circle vs. sitting in rows facing instructor; 2) smaller group (up to 7 participants) vs. larger group (up to 30 participants); 3) repetition with variation vs. repetition with little variation; 4) progressive functional movement sequences vs. non-progressive movement; 5) slow pace vs. fast pace; 6) encouragement of social interaction between participants vs. encouragement of social interaction with instructor; 7) in-the-moment adaptation based on participants&#x02019; responses vs. routine delivery of class content; and 8) self-focus on mindful body awareness (interoception) vs. outward focus on copying the instructor&#x02019;s movement (exteroception). Interoceptive versus exteroceptive focus distinguishes sensory attention towards perceptions of sensations from inside one&#x02019;s own body, such as from movements and breathing,[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] from audio-visual attention towards a group leader. Center staff did not observe the PLI&#x000c9; classes taught by research staff.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Measures</title><p>All outcome measures were selected because they are standard in the field and have well-established validity and reliability. Assessments were performed at baseline, 18 weeks (cross-over) and 36 weeks in both participants and caregivers. As the goal of the study was to estimate effect sizes for a larger study, we did not pre-specify primary or secondary outcomes but rather measured a range of different domains using standard measures. Exercise &#x02018;dose&#x02019; was measured based on number of classes attended.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Participant Measures</title><p>
<bold>Physical Performance</bold>. Our primary measure of the physical effects of the program in participants was physical performance. This was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which was developed by the National Institute on Aging to provide an objective tool for evaluating lower extremity functioning in older adults. The test includes repeated chair stands, tandem balance testing and 8&#x02019; walking speed.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] A recent systematic review of instruments to measure physical performance in older adults concluded that the SPPB was one of the best tools available based on its reliability, validity and responsiveness.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Three additional items from the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) were added to assess flexibility (sit-and-reach, back scratch) and mobility (8-foot up-and-go).[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>
<bold>Cognitive Function</bold>. Cognitive function was assessed in participants with the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale&#x02014;Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog),[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] which is one of the most commonly used primary outcome measures in dementia drug treatment trials. It is an 80-point scale that includes direct assessment of learning (word list), naming (objects), following commands, constructional praxis (figure copying), ideational praxis (mailing a letter), orientation (person, time, place), recognition memory and remembering test instructions. Prior studies have found the ADAS-cog to be valid and reliable with Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha greater than 0.8 and test-retest reliability above 0.9.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p><p>
<bold>Quality of Life</bold>. Quality of life in participants was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (QOL-AD),[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] which is a brief, 13-item measure that asks parallel questions about the affected individual&#x02019;s quality of life from their perspective and the caregiver&#x02019;s perspective. Scores may range from 13&#x02013;52 points. Prior studies have found that the QOL-AD is a valid and reliable measure, with Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.84 for patient reports and 0.86 for caregiver reports and interrater reliability based on Cohen&#x02019;s kappa values &#x0003e;0.70.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Caregiver Measures</title><p>Caregiver measures included questionnaires about the participant&#x02019;s functional status, quality of life and dementia-related behaviors as well as their own level of distress with behaviors and overall burden.</p><p>
<bold>Participant Function</bold>. Participant&#x02019;s physical function was assessed with the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Cooperative Study&#x02014;Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] The ADCS-ADL is a 78-point scale that assesses functional ability in 23 daily activities based on informant report. It is a standard measure for assessment of functional status in dementia drug treatment trials, with 2-month test-retest reliability based on kappa values for individual items of 0.4&#x02013;0.75.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</p><p>
<bold>Participant Behavior</bold>. Participant's dementia-related behaviors were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), [<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] which is a 144-point informant-based questionnaire that assesses 12 behavioral domains common in dementia including frequency, severity and impact on caregiver distress. There are two summary scores: a frequency*severity total (NPI-FS) and caregiver distress total (NPI-CD). The NPI has good test-retest reliability (0.79&#x02013;0.86) and good internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, 0.87&#x02013;0.88).[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</p><p>
<bold>Participant Quality of Life</bold>. Participant's quality of life was assessed with the QOL-AD which, as noted above, asks similar questions of both the individual and the caregiver,[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and has established validity and reliability.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</p><p>
<bold>Caregiver Burden</bold>. Caregiver burden was assessed with the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), which is a 96-point scale that includes 24 items and 5 domains.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Caregivers are asked to rate how often each statement describes their feelings (never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, nearly always). The total score may range from 0 to 96 with higher scores reflecting greater feelings of burden. The CBI has good internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, 0.73&#x02013;0.86_ENREF_39).[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Other Measures</title><p>Demographic information (age, sex, race, education) was determined for both participants and caregivers based on caregiver report. Caregivers also were asked about the participant&#x02019;s diagnosis (Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, vascular dementia, other/unknown), the number of years they had been providing care, their relationship with the participant (spouse, child, other) and their marital status. The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS)[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was performed at baseline only to provide a measure of global cognitive function. The 3MS is similar to the original Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] but includes an expanded scoring system (range: 0 to 100 points) and some additional items.

Instead, the Principal Investigator assigned participants to groups based on their days of attendance at the day program (Group 1: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday; Group 2: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday) and to balance genders. Research assistants who collected outcome data were blinded to group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Characteristics of Group 1 and Group 2 were compared using <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. Means were calculated for all outcome measures at each of the three time points (baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks) by group (PLI&#x000c9; vs. UC). Our primary outcome was the &#x02018;between-group&#x02019; effect size from baseline to 18 weeks, which was defined as the change in Group 1 (PLI&#x000c9;) minus change in Group 2 (UC) divided by the pooled baseline standard deviation (SD). Signs were reversed for measures in which lower scores reflected better outcomes, so that positive values indicate greater improvement with PLI&#x000c9; and negative values reflect greater improvement with UC. Only those who completed assessments at both time points were included in calculations. An effect size of &#x02265; 0.25 SDs was defined as &#x02018;clinically meaningful&#x02019; based on prior studies of effect sizes for current dementia medications.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Although there are no well-accepted criteria for defining an effect size as clinically meaningful, an effect size &#x02265;0.20 is generally considered small, while an effect size &#x02265;0.50 would be considered medium and an effect size &#x02265;0.80 is considered large.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] To capitalize on the cross-over design, we also calculated &#x02018;within-group&#x02019; effect sizes for both groups, which were defined as change during PLI&#x000c9; minus change during UC divided by baseline SD. Thus, for Group 1 (PLI&#x000c9; first), the within-group effect size was calculated as change from baseline to 18 weeks minus change from 18 to 36 weeks divided by baseline SD, whereas for Group 2 (UC first), the within-group effect size was calculated as change from 18 to 36 weeks minus change from baseline to 18 weeks divided by baseline SD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec020"><title>Results</title><p>The flow of participants through the study is shown in <xref rid="pone.0113367.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.

One participant in Group 1 withdrew prior to the 18-week assessment due to general dissatisfaction with the adult day program, and one participant in Group 2 withdrew prior to the 36-week assessment due to placement in a residential facility. Group 1 participated in the PLI&#x000c9; program from 11/14/11 to 3/29/12 and then returned to usual activities, while Group 2 started with usual activities and then participated in PLI&#x000c9; from 4/2/12 to 8/23/12.

<xref rid="pone.0113367.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> provides within-group effect size estimates for both participant and caregiver measures for Group 1. One interpretation of the results is that there was evidence of greater improvement when participants were involved with PLI&#x000c9; (0 to 18 weeks) versus UC (19 to 36) for 9 of the 11 measures, including all of the measures that improved based on between-group effect size estimates as well as caregiver-reported frequency and severity of dementia-related behaviors (effect size, +0.59). An alternative interpretation is that the improvements observed with PLI&#x000c9; were maintained or continued to improve for several measures following cross-over to usual care. For example, physical performance scores improved 1 point from baseline to 18 weeks and an additional 0.33 points from 18 to 36 weeks, suggesting continued improvement. Similar trends were observed with cognitive function (additional 1.11 point improvement from 18 to 36 weeks) and 8 foot up &#x00026; go (additional 1.21 second improvement). Conversely, quality of life declined following return to usual care from the perspective of both participants (-4.0 points) and caregivers (-0.33 points) while increases were observed in the frequency and severity of participant behaviors (+2.00 points) and caregiver burden (+0.67 points).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0113367.t005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113367.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Within-Group Changes<xref rid="t005fn004" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref>and Effect Sizes in Participant and Caregiver Measures, Group 1.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0113367.t005g" xlink:href="pone.0113367.t005"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measure</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 to 18 week change (PLI&#x000c9;)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 to 36 week change (UC)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effect Size<xref rid="t005fn005" ref-type="table-fn">**</xref>

The same sequence of events was repeated in each class, providing a structure that became familiar over time and was designed to promote procedural learning. Therefore, even when participants did not recall having participated in the class before, their bodies appeared to remember which movements came next in the sequence. In addition, the specific movements of PLI&#x000c9; were selected for their relationship to important daily functional activities such as being able to stand safely from a seated position. These functional movements were broken down into their component elements and slowly increased in difficulty over the course of the program. Instructors also motivated participants by relating the movements to participant&#x02019;s individual interests and goals and by engaging participants in interactive group movement activities. This may have enabled participants to slowly build their capacity to perform more complex movements with ease over time and provided the movements with greater meaning.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</p><p>Other aspects of the program may have contributed to our findings of improved cognitive function and quality of life. During periods of rest, participants were encouraged to notice their breathing and how they felt, both physically and emotionally. This focus on mindful, in-the-moment body awareness may have had a calming effect on the mind, which could have resulted in greater attentional capacity and increases in cognitive function. In addition, the PLI&#x000c9; program explicitly focused on creating a warm, loving, non-judgmental environment, and some participants appeared to develop deeper social bonds with each other over the course of the program, which may have enhanced general feelings of well-being and quality of life.[<xref rid="pone.0113367.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</p><p>We also observed improvements in caregiver ratings of participants&#x02019; quality of life as well as their own levels of burden and distress. It is not clear whether these findings are related to the effects of exercises taught directly to the participants during the classes or the effects of the monthly home visits, when instructors demonstrated some of the exercises to caregivers and also provided caregiving advice based on their observations in the home environment.</p><p>Our pilot study has several important strengths. First, we compared PLI&#x000c9; with standard chair-based exercises, which are common in adult day settings. This provided greater context for the magnitude of improvement observed and enabled more accurate calculation of the sample size that would be required to perform a full-scale study. Second, we utilized a cross-over design, which enabled us to calculate both between-group and within-group effect sizes and to determine whether the effects seen with PLI&#x000c9; were maintained over an additional 18 weeks of follow-up. Third, we designed the study to methodologically mimic a drug study by including measures that are commonly used in dementia medication trials, which enabled comparison of the magnitude of our results to currently available dementia medications.</p><p>Several important limitations also should be considered. Most importantly, our sample size was not large enough to detect statistically significant effects of the intervention. However, our results provide data to calculate sample sizes for a larger trial. In addition, we were unable to randomize subjects to groups. However, the groups were comparable at baseline, and individuals who collected outcome data were blinded. Finally, we did not observe evidence of change in activities of daily living in either the PLI&#x000c9; or UC group. It is possible that a longer intervention would be required to document change in this domain.</p><p>In conclusion, out pilot study results suggest that PLI&#x000c9;&#x02014;a novel, integrative exercise program that incorporates elements of conventional and complementary or integrative exercise modalities&#x02014;may improve physical performance, cognitive function, and quality of life in individuals with mild to moderate dementia and may also reduce caregiver burden. Larger clinical trials of the PLI&#x000c9; program are warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113367.s001"><caption><title>S1 CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0113367.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113367.s002"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Overview of the Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLI&#x000c9;) program and basic class structure.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0113367.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113367.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Originally approved trial protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0113367.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the study participants and caregivers who participated in this study and to acknowledge the following individuals for their contributions: Wendy Santos-Modesitt, PhD, who provided assistance with study development and data collection; Jennifer Lee, GCFP, Feldenkrais practitioner, and Deborah Marks, MA, Rosen practitioner, who were exercise instructors; Genya Boyko, Ryan Uyeda, Kristina York, Phil Scherrens, Dr. Cristina Flores, Dr. David Werdegar, Dr. Maxine Silver and others at the Institute on Aging, who facilitated the study by providing space and access to study participants; and Dr. Rebecca Sudore, Dr. Michael Acree, and Dr. Karyn Skultety, who served on the Data Monitoring Committee.</p><p>We would also like to acknowledge the dementia and exercise instructors and researchers who consulted with us on program development: Garrett Chinn, Tai Chi instructor (Founder, Tai Chi Chuan Program, Older Adults Department, City College of San Francisco, CA); Osa Jackson, GCFP, PhD, PT, physical therapist and Feldenkrais practitioner (Director, Movement and Healing Center, Clarkston, MI); Joyce Ann, GCFP, occupational therapist and Feldenkrais practitioner (Director, Building Better Balance, Highland Park, IL); Kate Holcombe and Chase Bossart, yoga instructors (Healing Yoga Foundation, San Francisco, CA); Meg Chang, EdD, BC-DMT, LCAT, NCC, dance movement therapist (Core Faculty, Somatic Psychology Program, California Institute of Integral Studies, San Francisco, CA); Teresa Liu-Ambrose, PhD, PT, physical therapist (Associate Professor of Physical Therapy, University of British Columbia); Matthew Lee, PhD, exercise physiologist (Associate Professor of Kinesiology, San Francisco State University); Deborah Bowes, GCFP, DPT, Feldenkrais practitioner and physical therapist (Stanford Hospital, Palo Alto, CA, and Feldenkrais Center for Movement Education, San Francisco, CA) and Wendy Katzman, DPT, physical therapist (Associate Professor of Physical Therapy, University of California, San Francisco).</p><p>We thank Drew and Ellen Bradley for their generous support of the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, which enabled the development and pilot-testing of the Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLI&#x000c9;) program.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113367.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
