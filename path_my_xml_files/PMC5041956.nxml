A total of 103 patients with hepatic dome tumors were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups based on whether this model was used or not: Group A (using the model; n = 43) versus Group B (not using the model; n = 60).

Although ultrasound (US) is the simplest and most popular modality for puncture guidance, the tumor sometimes locates in the hepatic dome and it is usually insufficiently visualized by sonography, which has a limited sonic window due to the overlapped lung or ribs. For such tumors, computed tomographic (CT) suggests an effective alternative for guidance and percutaneous themal ablation can be well achieved [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>However, MW ablation for hepatic dome tumors is usually technically challenging because of the potential risks of collateral thermal damage to the diaphragm. Thermal injury to the diaphragm can leads to pain, diaphragmatic paralysis, even rupture, perforation or fistula formation [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To reduce the risk of thermal injury to diaphragm and get a more sufficient ablation zone, most of operators select a puncture route from the bottom up since MW energy is emitted retrograde from the antenna tip [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, CT does not allow for real-time surveillance of the puncture and a puncture route from the bottom up depends on the operator experience. Thus, we developed a mathematic model for puncture. A regular cylinder model, whose center of the top surface was also the center of tumor sphere, was established to quantify the appropriate puncture plane and route as a means to overcome the deficiencies that may be caused by lack of operator experience. So this study was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility and safety of this model for the quantification of CT-guided MW ablation in treating hepatic dome tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Puncture and ablation parameters</title><p>All the patients were percutaneously treated in 124 CT-guided MW ablation sessions.

The average time of ablation was less in Group A than Group B (8.8 minutes &#x000b1; 2.8 [range, 5-15 minutes] vs. 11.1 minutes &#x000b1; 4.2 [range, 5-20 minutes], <italic>P</italic> = 0.003).

These tumors are usually covered by the diaphragm and a small amount of normal liver tissues. As a result, there's a limited space available for MW antenna placement and it's difficult to enlarge the ablation zone using a puncture route in the axial plane. So in this study, each puncture route was designed from the bottom up to reduce the potential risks of diaphragmatic thermal damage because of retrograde emission of MW energy from the antenna tip [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. By using this model, a puncture route from the bottom up can be well quantified for antenna placement. Both the average number of times for successful puncture and the average time of ablation were reduced in the study group. The antennas are easier to be controlled since a relatively accurate puncture can be achieved by a quantified puncture route. Although there's no survival advantage by using this model, it has overcomed the limitation of puncture mainly by operator experience to some extent since CT can only provide an intermittent guidance.</p><p>We have also noticed some reports about US-guided thermal ablation with artificial fluid for hepatic dome tumors [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The artificial fluid is a good method to improve the sonic window and separate the adjacent diaphragm from the tumor. Nevertheless, this technique is relatively complicated and may not be suitable for junior operators. Also, the cold artificial fluid may lower the temperature of its surrounding, which could be an obstacle to a successful thermal ablation. On the contrary, CT facilitates detection of hepatic dome tumors without any infusion of artificial fluid and the diaphragm surrounding the tumor can be clearly displayed [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With this model, we also got satisfied outcomes in treating such challenging cases and the technique efficacy was similar to some prior reports [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although the technical success rate was higher for the study group, the primary and secondary technique efficacy between the two groups had no significant difference. It can be explained that the average ablation time of the control group was significantly longer than the study group.</p><p>In our study, right shoulder pain after ablation can be explained by the adhesion between coagulative necrotic tissues and adjacent diaphragm caused by ablation. It is regarded as a signal of thermal transmission exactly to the diaphragm or mild diaphragmatic thermal damage [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The incidence of right shoulder pain was significantly lower for the study group, suggesting less diaphragmatic thermal damage occurred with this model. We consider that it was associated with less of ablation time by the model. We also expected that thermal damage of the diaphragm would have been less likely with a power of 45 W for 5-10 minutes per application. This was according to the proposed guidelines for diameters based on different time and power variables, which recommended a power of 45 W for 10 minutes to achieve optimal diameters at the shortest time and lowest wattage [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Since a small amount of hepatic sub-capsular hematoma was found in both groups, we paid close attention to the affection by breathing during puncture to reduce the risk of lacerations of the liver capsule, which could cause massive bleeding [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. All the punctures were performed at the end of expiration in this study to reduce the effects of breathing. The occurrence of pneumothorax and a small sized pulmonary hematoma was due to the insertion of the antenna through the lung since the transpulmonary routes were planned in some of the patients. Even if these complications occurred, they would not cause serious problems for localization and ablation of the intrahepatic tumors. No major complications occurred, suggesting CT-guided MW ablation with this mathematic puncture model is a safe procedure.</p><p>For the application of this model, it is important to confirm whether the antenna crosses the marked center of tumor's maximal circle in the axial plane. This is to ensure the overlap of the ablation sphere's center and the tumor sphere's center, which could lead to more complete ablation of tumor according to our model. For some tumors with relatively irregular shapes, overlapping ablation based on the CT scan is needed when the necrotic zone does not completely cover the tumor only by increasing ablation time. Based on our experience, the puncture site is usually selected 2-3 intercostal spaces below the axial plane which has the tumor's maximal area. Although a lower puncture site theoretically leads to lower risks of diaphragmatic thermal damage, more than 3 intercostal spaces is not recommended due to the added puncture length and increased difficulty in successful puncture. A coronal plane is recommended as the described vertical plane for puncture in the cylinder model because of better controllability of antennas.</p><p>The described model was limited by the fact that the tumor and ablation zone were not always spherical. Thus, CT scan during the procedure and the comparison with established model were valuable. It is necessary to thoroughly understand the three-dimensional features of tumors before procedure. Our study also had limitations that the tumors enrolled were not larger than 3.6 cm and we only followed the patients up for a maximum of 36 months. Larger tumors and a longer follow-up are desired for future study.</p><p>In conclusion, we developed a feasible and safe mathematic model for CT-guided MW ablation in treating hepatic dome tumors, which might be an alternative mode to quantify puncture routes and ablate hepatic dome lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Ethics</title><p>This prospective study has been carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2000) of the World Medical Association.

The enrolled patients were randomly divided into 2 groups based on whether a preoperative mathematic puncture model was used or not before ablation: Group A (using the model; n = 43) versus Group B (not using the model; n = 60). Randomization was achieved by means of computer-generated random numbers. The mean size of the tumor was 1.8 cm &#x000b1; 0.8 (range, 0.5-3.6 cm) in the largest diameter.

The mathematic analysis was performed to determine how an antenna could cross the center of the tumor sphere from the bottom up for an efficient ablation. According to the assumption above, the center point of the tumor sphere's maximal circle in the axial plane was also the tumor sphere's center point. CT images (Siemens Brilliance Big Bore, Germany; 0.625 mm collimation beam at 200 mA and 120 kVp) with 2-5 mm section thickness were obtained in expiration for targeting tumor before MW ablation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The maximal area of the tumor in the axial plane was selected and a careful circular delineation was performed. This enabled determining and marking the center point of the tumor's maximal circle in axial plane, which was also the center point of the tumor sphere and cylinder's top surface. A puncture site, which located in the axial plane 2-3 intercostal spaces below the cylinder's top surface, was selected. Then a regular cylinder model whose center of the top surface was also the tumor sphere's center was established crossing the selected puncture site on its side surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Inside the cylinder, a vertical plane, which was vertical to the cylinder's top surface, was confirmed by the puncture site and the tumor sphere's center point. After selecting the projection of the puncture site on the cylinder's top surface, a right triangle in the vertical plane was confirmed by three points: the center of tumor sphere, the puncture site and its projection. The hypotenuse was the puncture route from the bottom up which was used to ablate hepatic dome tumors. The puncture length was the hypotenuse length plus ablation radius which consisted of the tumor radius plus at least a 0.5-cm tumor-free margin. The puncture angle between the seleted vertical plane and the coronal plane was directly achieved by CT measurement. The angle in the vertical plane was calculated by the two legs of the right triangle measured by CT.

A puncture site locats in the axial plane 2-3 intercostal spaces below the cylinder's top surface (point &#x0201c;B&#x0201d;). Then a regular cylinder model whose center of the top surface was point &#x0201c;O&#x0201d; was established crossing point &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; on its side surface.

Local control rate was defined as the proportion of patients who received complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Local tumor progression was diagnosed with the identification of untreated disease foci in tumors that were previously considered to be completely ablated. These tumors had to be considered completely ablated by the definition used for primary technique efficacy.

A total of 120 mL of nonionic contrast material (Ultravist 300 [iopromide, 300 mg I/mL], Schering, Berlin, Germany) was administered at a rate of 3 mL/sec with an automatic power injector. The scan images were acquired at pre-injection, 30, 70, and 180 sec after IV contrast material injection, which represented the non-enhanced, hepatic arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium phases, respectively. All scans were obtained by using a 0.625 mm collimation beam at 200 mA and 120 kVp.</p></sec><sec id="s4_6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The characteristics of the patients in the two groups were compared by independent <italic>t</italic> test and Pearson's <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test.
