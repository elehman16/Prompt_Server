A comprehensive radiotherapy trials quality assurance programme was launched with two main aims:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par2">To assist centres, where needed, to adapt their radiotherapy techniques in order to achieve protocol compliance and thereby enable their participation in the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par3">To support the trial&#x02019;s clinical outcomes by ensuring the consistent planning and delivery of radiotherapy across all participating centres.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par4">A detailed information package was provided and centres were required to complete a benchmark case in which the delineated target volumes and organs at risk, dose distribution and completion of a plan assessment form were assessed prior to recruiting patients into the trial. Upon recruiting, the quality assurance (QA) programme continued to monitor the outlining and planning of radiotherapy treatments. Completion of a questionnaire was requested in order to gather information about each centre&#x02019;s equipment and techniques relating to their trial participation and to assess the impact of the trial nationally on standard practice for radiotherapy of the oesophagus. During the trial, advice was available for individual planning issues, and was circulated amongst the SCOPE 1 community in response to common areas of concern using bulletins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">36 centres were supported through QA processes to enable their participation in SCOPE1. We discuss the issues which have arisen throughout this process and present details of the benchmark case solutions, centre questionnaires and on-trial protocol compliance. The range of submitted benchmark case GTV volumes was 29.8&#x02013;67.8cm<sup>3</sup>; and PTV volumes 221.9&#x02013;513.3&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>. For the dose distributions associated with these volumes, the percentage volume of the lungs receiving 20Gy (V20Gy) ranged from 20.4 to 33.5%. Similarly, heart V40Gy ranged from 16.1 to 33.0%. Incidence of incorrect outlining of OAR volumes increased from 50% of centres at benchmark case, to 64% on trial. Sixty-five percent of centres, who returned the trial questionnaire, stated that their standard practice had changed as a result of their participation in the SCOPE1 trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par6">The SCOPE 1 QA programme outcomes lend support to the trial&#x02019;s clinical conclusions. The range of patient planning outcomes for the benchmark case indicated, at the outset of the trial, the significant degree of variation present in UK oesophageal radiotherapy planning outcomes, despite the presence of a protocol. This supports the case for increasingly detailed definition of practice by means of consensus protocols, training and peer review. The incidence of minor inconsistencies of technique highlights the potential for improved QA systems and the need for sufficient resource for this to be addressed within future trials. As indicated in questionnaire responses, the QA exercise as a whole has contributed to greater consistency of oesophageal radiotherapy in the UK via the adoption into standard practice of elements of the protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par7">The SCOPE1 trial is an International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN47718479">ISRCTN47718479</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13014-017-0916-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SCOPE 1 clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Quality assurance</kwd><kwd>Oesophageal cancer</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy planning variation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A72569</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par24">Definitive chemo-radiotherapy (dCRT) has an increasingly recognised role in the primary management of oesophageal cancer. SCOPE 1 was the largest multicentre trial of dCRT in localised oesophageal cancer in the UK, recruiting 258 patients from 36 centres. The trial investigated the addition of Cetuximab to standard radiotherapy (RT) plus cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], yet the phase II primary endpoint of 24&#x000a0;week treatment failure-free rate was not met and the trial closed on the basis of futility. Toxicity rates were higher in the dCRT + Cetuximab arm. Importantly however, survival rate in the standard dCRT arm is to our knowledge superior to any previous published multi-centre study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More specifically, loco-regional recurrence was low in comparison to other studies and compromise in ability to give full RT dose associated with poor outcome, thereby suggesting the importance of RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It has been further proposed that the SCOPE QA programme was a crucial component to the successful outcomes seen in the cRT only arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The radiotherapy schedule was identical in both arms of the trial (50Gy in 25 fractions over 5&#x000a0;weeks). The minimum requirement was for a 3D&#x02013;conformal plan using contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) with a minimum slice thickness of 3&#x000a0;mm to achieve the dose volume criteria in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The GTV was to be outlined with contrast enhanced diagnostic CT and endoscopic ultrasound, PET-CT was optional. Generation of the PTV from the GTV was to be done in accordance with the protocol (described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).&#x000a0;Verification of isocentre position and external patient contour was a requirement that could be managed according to the participating centre&#x02019;s local protocols.</p><p id="Par26">In order to support a trial&#x02019;s clinical outcomes a Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance (RTQA) programme should provide evidence for adherence to the protocol thereby reducing the variation in RT planning and delivery to each recruited patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It requires good communication with participating centres, suitable infrastructure and software tools for analysis and sufficient man-power and expertise. Because of known variations in technique in oesophageal RT planning prior to SCOPE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the QA exercise aimed to ensure treatment delivery consistent with the SCOPE1 trial protocol [see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>] and evidence based best practice whilst assisting centres to adapt their RT techniques to enable their participation in the trial, and to provide ongoing support to RT centres throughout the UK.</p><p id="Par27">The RTQA programme was implemented by the National RTTQA (Cardiff group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] which includes physicists, clinicians and radiographers at Velindre Cancer Centre in collaboration with a trial management team at the Wales Cancer Trials Unit (WCTU) based at Cardiff University. The methodology and results of the QA programme are described in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of information for participating centres</title><p id="Par28">Early collaboration between lead clinicians and QA physicists during the protocol development provided a basis for effective QA later in the trial. Areas of development which took place at this stage are summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Detailed information concerning these topics were included as part of a pre-trial information package (CD-ROM) aimed at assisting centre&#x02019;s acceptance into the trial.

Firstly the GTV length (8&#x000a0;cm) approached the upper allowable limit of the SCOPE patient entry criteria (10&#x000a0;cm): it was expected that plan dose volume objectives might not be achieved for all cases, prompting dialogue and checking procedures for data reporting. Secondly the GTV was close to the spinal cord, requiring application of a discretionary modification to the posterior part of the CTV as described in the &#x02018;RT planning and delivery&#x02019; document.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outlining review</title><p id="Par32">Outlining review was performed in part by an experienced treatment planning dosimetrist (LW) who assessed the OARs, the superior and inferior target extents with respect to the reference standard, the applied margins and the suitability of water density structures applied to correct for IV contrast (if used).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>On-trial support &#x00026; commonly occurring on-trial planning issues</title><p id="Par58">Two common themes emerged from discussions with the QA team. Firstly there was uncertainty as to the acceptability of dose distributions achieved using &#x02018;type b&#x02019; algorithms. Initially advice was given on a case by case basis where, in the absence of specific requirements for PTV coverage and of detailed experience of every treatment planning system (a common issue for RTQA), deference was generally made to local knowledge and expertise. Following the publication by the QA team of the previously mentioned comparative study on this topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and the circulation of a bulletin giving definitive advice, queries of this nature were eliminated. The second area of interest concerned solutions for planning when the targets were in very close proximity to the spinal cord. In response, a bulletin was circulated which summarised best practice and presented an optimisation solution. Additionally IMRT solutions, where proposed by participating centres, were permitted and quality assurance of these techniques was achieved with the assistance of colleagues in the wider national QA group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par59">The pre-trial QA programme fulfilled a primary QA objective: it ensured that collaborating personnel in individual centres had read and understood the protocol and that centres had the necessary resources in place to deliver RT in accordance with the trial. The on-trial QA was to some extent limited by availability of resource at the QA centre. Our discussion herein focuses on areas which, with hindsight and more comprehensive resourcing may have been done differently to improve the completeness of QA data, or increase the efficiency of analysis in the context of this particular clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Benchmarking with pre-outlined cases</title><p id="Par60">Ability to advise centres on the optimality of their benchmark case solution can be limited owing to differences in treatment planning systems and compounded by variations in target delineation. This problem can be lessened by providing both a non-outlined benchmark case to test outlining accuracy and a pre-outlined benchmark case to test planning to standardised geometry. Dosimetric results for the latter can be more easily compared to an expected outcome. This methodology is noted by Ibbott et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and now used by the RTTQA group where warranted, according to a tiered system of RT complexity as described by Bekelman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Whilst differences due to planning system and algorithm would remain, it may not be unreasonable, given the extent of collaboration within national RTTQA at time of writing, to explore these variations prospectively for an RTQA programme. The use of a single benchmark case for both outlining and planning in SCOPE1 does however reveal the effect of differences in GTV outlining on the eventual dose distribution as presented above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Recommendations for future trials QA</title><p id="Par61">The pre-trial QA processes did not eliminate the recurrence of inconsistencies from protocol seen in benchmark cases, particularly in the outlining of OARs (where inconsistencies increased). This could be due to insufficient training and dissemination within centres of the outcomes and recommendations of the QA exercise and may point to the need for more rigorous processes at recruiting centres (an individual patient checklist, for example). More recent development in on-line real-time and timely retrospective outlining and plan review will also address this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The implications of these minor inconsistencies are unlikely to have any impact on the SCOPE 1 clinical conclusions in our opinion. Indeed, an upfront, risk assessed approach, to identify aspects of the treatment delivery chain which are likely to affect the ability to answer the trial question, such as is recommended by Ibbott et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] can be applied in order to rationalise the use of QA resource.</p><p id="Par62">The variation in GTV outlining of the benchmark case, quantified by Gwynne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] demonstrated the presence of a range of both methodology and precision applied for this treatment site. Within the SCOPE 1 QA process, each investigator was provided with comments from the CI: effectively they participated in an external audit of their GTV definition. Feedback such as this had not been commonly available elsewhere within clinical practice and was a first in oesophageal RT in the UK. However, improvements in the process were identified as follows: the SCOPE 1 reference standard was based on the interpretation two individuals (the CI and a radiologist). The need for a more robust reference standard became a point of discussion throughout the QA cycle as alternative legitimate clinical interpretations were observed in benchmark solutions. Variation in target delineation is a widely known and universal issue in RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the need for &#x02018;consensus guidelines&#x02019; with dissemination and training, is re-emphasised here. This approach is being widely incorporated into trials QA systems and RT more generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">In our comparison of outlined GTV length against that quoted on the PAF, discrepancies were seen, always in the same direction (PAF GTV longer than VODCA GTV). This could be attributed to the method of measurement used by centres: if the operator were to use a software measure tool placed along a sectional reconstruction of the CT series the value measured would always be equal to or longer than the length calculated based on the longitudinal coordinates of the extents of the GTV. This is because the organ may lie at a diagonal to the longitudinal. Furthermore, up to one slice thickness may be added if the operator interprets the length to be &#x02018;the number of slices outlined multiplied by the slice thickness.&#x02019; In this case the operator is assuming that each slice is representative of a volume of patient rather than a 2-dimensional level. In the absence of knowledge of exactly how each operator interpreted the value of GTV length requested on the PAF, this uncertainty remains. Future studies should therefore define how lengths, if needed, are to be calculated, or request the raw data (slice positions) in order to enable a calculation of the parameter.</p><p id="Par64">The return rate of the QA questionnaire was poor (53% of recruiting centres), despite encouragement from WCTU at various stages throughout the trial. It was intended to serve a dual purpose: firstly to check that elements of practice at each centre met trial criteria, and secondly to assess the impact of the trial on changes to standard practice. For the latter reason the questionnaire was not made a pre-requisite to centre recruitment. Rather, centres were given time to reflect on any changes that had been introduced into standard practice. The result of not mandating a response to the questionnaire prior to recruitment may have contributed to a loss of momentum of its return. With this hindsight, it would have been better not to combine the two aspects, instead to require a response before centres were given QA approval. Notwithstanding a disappointing return, the responses, as summarised earlier, indicate that quality and consistency of practice across the UK increased as a result of SCOPE1. In addition, outside of oesophageal RT, the description of heart delineation for SCOPE1 has been used, with permission, in subsequent trial protocols for the Fast-Forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and I-START [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Reflections on the PTV coverage target for type b algorithms and future use</title><p id="Par65">The investigative planning study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] provided a standard for PTV coverage. The benefit of this piece of work is demonstrated here as all of the type b deviations for PTV coverage according to the criteria suggested by the study, occurred prior to its outcome. This suggests that the guidance, once issued, provided greater clarity as to the acceptability of distributions, enabling planners to persist with the optimization process until at least the suggested minimum had been achieved. For future trials, if conducted with access to improved optimisation techniques, a higher standard of PTV coverage could be specified simply by adjustment of the multiplier (currently 0.4) within the formula.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par66">The benchmark case successfully identified and advised participating centres of the areas of their RT technique which were inconsistent with the SCOPE 1 protocol in advance of recruitment. On-trial QA revealed no more than a single major deviation (relating to cord PRV dose) for patients treated within SCOPE 1, thereby supporting the clinical conclusions. However, for recruited patients there did appear to be repetitions of minor inconsistencies of technique, revealed retrospectively, highlighting the need for sufficient QA systems and resource to ensure a continuous feedback process throughout the progress of an RT trial. The range of patient planning outcomes for the benchmark case is illustrative of the potential variation in oesophageal treatments at the outset of the trial, which are largely due to differences in interpretation of the GTV, despite the presence of a protocol. This supports the case for increasingly detailed definition of practice by means of consensus protocols, training and peer review. Further exercises in oesophageal RT QA may in the future be able to draw comparisons to this piece of work. The QA exercise as a whole has facilitated greater consistency of oesophageal RT in the UK via the widespread adoption into standard practice of many elements of the protocol, and has contributed, in part, to wider collaboration in UK Oesophageal radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
