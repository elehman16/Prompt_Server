Tube shunt surgery was more likely to maintain intraocular pressure (IOP) control and avoid persistent hypotony, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light perception vision than trabeculectomy with MMC during the first year of follow-up. Both surgical procedures had similar IOP reduction at 1 year, but less supplemental medical therapy was used following trabeculectomy. The incidence of postoperative complications was higher after trabeculectomy with MMC relative to tube shunt surgery, but serious complications associated with vision loss and/or reoperation developed with similar frequency after both of the procedures. There was no significant difference in the rate of vision loss following trabeculectomy with MMC and tube shunt surgery after 1 year of follow-up. Cataract progression was common, but occurred with similar frequency with both of the surgical procedures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Trabeculectomy</kwd><kwd>tube shunt</kwd><kwd>Tube Versus Trabeculectomy Study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recently, practice patterns in glaucoma surgery have undergone significant changes.

Patients with uncontrolled glaucoma who had previously undergone cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and/or failed trabeculectomy were randomized to receive a 350-mm<sup>2</sup> Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with MMC. The goal of this investigator initiated study is to provide information that will assist in surgical decision making in similar patient groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>The design and methods of the TVT Study were previously described in detail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref> The study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00306852). The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to treatment with a tube shunt or trabeculectomy with MMC. Patients in the tube group underwent placement of a 350-mm<sup>2</sup> Baerveldt glaucoma implant superotemporally with a complete restriction of flow at the time of implantation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>]. Patients in the trabeculectomy group had a superior trabeculectomy with a standard dosage of MMC of 0.4 mg/ml for 4 min [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>]. Follow-up visits were scheduled 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years postoperatively. Each examination included measurement of Snellen visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp biomicroscopy, Seidel testing, and ophthalmoscopy. Humphrey perimetry, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) VA, and quality of life using the National Eye Institute Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) were assessed at baseline and at the annual follow-up visits. A formal motility evaluation was performed in all patients at baseline and at the 1-year and 5-year follow-up visits and at any visit after 3 months in which the patient reported diplopia. The examining clinician provided a reason for loss of 2 or more lines of Snellen VA at follow-up visits after 3 months.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient eligibility criteria in the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy Study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Inclusion criteria</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age 18 to 85 years</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Inadequately controlled glaucoma with IOP &#x02265; 18 mm Hg and &#x02264; 40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Previous cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation, trabeculectomy, or both</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exclusion criteria</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unwilling or unable to give consent, unwilling to accept randomization, or unable to return for scheduled protocol visits</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pregnant or nursing women</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No light perception vision</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active iris neovascularization or active proliferative retinopathy</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Epithelial of fibrous downgrowth</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aphakia</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vitreous in the anterior chamber for which a vitrectomy is anticipated</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chronic or recurrent uveitis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe posterior blepharitis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unwilling to discontinue contact lens use after surgery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Previous cyclodestructive procedure, scleral buckling procedure, or silicone oil present</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conjunctival scarring precluding a trabeculectomy superiorly</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Need for glaucoma surgery combined with other ocular procedures (i.e. cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty, or retinal surgery) or anticipated need for additional ocular surgery</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Intraoperative photograph of tube shunt surgery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MEAJO-16-107-g001"/></fig><fig id="F0002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Intraoperative photograph of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MEAJO-16-107-g002"/></fig><p>Failure was prospectively defined as IOP &#x0003e; 21 mm Hg or not reduced by 20% below baseline on two consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months, IOP &#x02264; 5 mm Hg on two consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light perception vision.

During the first year of follow-up, patients who were treated with tube shunt surgery were more likely to maintain IOP control and avoid persistent hypotony, loss of light perception vision, or reoperation for glaucoma in comparison to those who underwent trabeculectomy with MMC. Both surgical procedures were associated with similar IOP reduction at 1 year, but there was less need for supplemental medical therapy after trabeculectomy. The incidence of postoperative complications was higher after trabeculectomy with MMC as compared with tube shunt surgery. However, serious complications associated with reoperation and/or vision loss occurred with similar frequency after both of the surgical procedures. After 1 year of follow-up, there was no significant difference in the rate of vision loss following trabeculectomy with MMC or tube shunt surgery. Cataract progression was common, but occurred with similar frequency with both surgical procedures.</p><p>The results of the TVT Study provide further evidence that the role of tube shunts in the surgical management of glaucoma should be expanded. Although these devices have historically been reserved for refractory glaucomas at high risk of failure with standard filtering surgery, this study enrolled eyes at lower risk for failure. The TVT Study does not demonstrate clear superiority of one glaucoma operation over the other. There are other factors that must be considered when selecting a surgical procedure, including the surgeon's skill and experience with both operations, the patient's willingness to undergo repeat glaucoma surgery, and the planned surgical approach if failure occurs. Because postoperative interventions and surgical complications were more common after trabeculectomy, tube shunt surgery may be the preferred surgical approach when follow-up is limited. Additional data will be forthcoming from the TVT Study, and it is needed to fully assess the risks and benefits of tube shunt surgery and trabeculectomy with MMC in managing medically uncontrolled glaucoma in similar patient groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study is supported by research grants from Pfizer, Inc., New York, New York USA; Advanced Medical Optics, Irvine, California USA;
