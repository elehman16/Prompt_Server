Yet whether CT is of any preventative health benefit to working age adults is controversial. Our objective was therefore to investigate the real-world efficacy of CT in the workplace, involving employees from across the working-age spectrum and addressing many of the design issues that have limited trials to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>135 white collar employees of a large Australian public sector organization were randomised to either 16 weeks (20 minutes three times per week) of online CT or an active control (AC) program of equal length and structure. Cognitive, wellbeing and productivity outcome measures were analysed across three timepoints: baseline, immediately after training and 6 months post-training. CT effects on cognitive outcomes were limited, even after planned subgroup analyses of cognitive capacity and age. Unexpectedly, we found that our AC condition, which comprised viewing short documentaries about the natural world, had more impact. Compared to the CT group, 6 months after the end of training, those in the AC group experienced a significant increase in their self-reported Quality of Life (Effect Size <italic>g</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.34 vs &#x02212;.15; TIME&#x000d7;GROUP <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.003), decrease in stress levels (<italic>g</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.22 vs &#x02212;.19; TIME x GROUP <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.03), and overall improvement in Psychological Wellbeing (<italic>g</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.32 vs &#x02212;.06; TIME&#x000d7;GROUP <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CT does not appear to positively impact cognition or wellbeing amongst white collar office workers; however, short time-out respite activities may have value in the promotion of psychological wellbeing. Given looming challenges to workplace productivity, further work-based interventional research targeting employee mental health is recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000604000 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx">http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>While this study was sponsored by The Brain Department Pty Ltd (Sydney, Australia) through their provision of the intervention, CB, the primary researcher, was independently supported by an Australian Postgraduate Award scholarship.

Advanced age is the single greatest risk factor for cognitive decline <xref rid="pone.0059982-Brayne1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, with each decade after 20 years of age associated with an 8% reduction in memory function <xref rid="pone.0059982-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 7% reduction in frontal-executive function and 8% reduction in attentional capacity <xref rid="pone.0059982-Wechsler2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition, the Australian Productivity Commission has found that of the six major health conditions, mental illness predicts the lowest likelihood of workforce participation <xref rid="pone.0059982-Laplagne1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Depression in particular is detrimental to job performance <xref rid="pone.0059982-Lerner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and has further negative effects on cognitive ability <xref rid="pone.0059982-Knegtering1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover, the interaction of advanced age and depression is particularly potent, increasing the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and rapid age-related cognitive decline <xref rid="pone.0059982-Hertzog1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Taken together, these population-level changes are already placing pressure on workforce productivity.</p><p>At the same time, neuroscientific studies of cognition and mental health are having an influence on organizational behaviour and human resource management <xref rid="pone.0059982-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Computerized cognitive training (CT), or &#x02018;brain training&#x02019;, has received much attention in the clinical environment, with evidence of improved symptoms in depression <xref rid="pone.0059982-Wolinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Elgamal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0059982-McGurk1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Lindenmayer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder <xref rid="pone.0059982-Klingberg1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, MCI and dementia <xref rid="pone.0059982-Sitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Valenzuela1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, long term benefits after the cessation of training have also been reported <xref rid="pone.0059982-Lindenmayer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Willis1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, efficacy of CT in healthy working age individuals is contested. Owen et al (2010) questioned the impact of CT on cognitive ability in healthy adults and the transfer of training to non-trained tasks <xref rid="pone.0059982-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, but this study has been criticised on a number of methodological grounds <xref rid="pone.0059982-Katsnelson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Zelinski1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. While CT has been reported to be vocationally effective, for example, targeted single domain CT improves motor control in surgeons <xref rid="pone.0059982-Schlickum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> as well as pilots&#x02019; flight performance through enhanced attentional control <xref rid="pone.0059982-Gopher1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, it remains untested in the workplace as a human resource intervention for the prevention or maintenance of cognitive capacity or mental health outcomes.</p><p>Our objective was therefore to investigate the real-world efficacy of CT in the workplace, involving employees from across the full working age spectrum and addressing many of the design issues that have limited CT studies to date <xref rid="pone.0059982-Gates1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We randomized participants to either 16 weeks of online CT or an online AC program of equal length and structure. Outcomes included various cognitive, wellbeing and productivity measures which were collected pre-training, immediately post-training and 6 months post-training. We also planned an <italic>a priori</italic> subgroup analysis based on a split of baseline subjects into low- and high- cognitive capacity. Our specific aims were to test whether computerized cognitive brain training would, i) increase cognitive abilities vital to effective and efficient workplace performance, ii) augment positive psychological measures of wellbeing and quality of life, and iii) improve objective measures of workplace productivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059982.s001">Checklist S1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059982.s002">Protocol S1</xref></bold>).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This research was approved by the University of New South Wales&#x02019; Human Research Ethics Committee.

During each 20 minute training session, subjects completed a number of exercises from across a range of these domains, and were gradually challenged by exercises of greater cognitive demand tailored to their abilities, facilitated by the program&#x02019;s in-built algorithms. The AC condition consisted of viewing a series of general interest videos about the natural environment (National Geographic) and answering related multiple choice questions delivered via an online survey. Both interventions ran for 16 weeks with 3 sessions per week (20 minutes per session) and were matched for duration, level of audio and visual stimulus and mode of delivery (online and directly to the participant&#x02019;s regular work computer).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Outcome measures were collected and analysed by an organizational psychologist who remained blind to the training status of participants.

In terms of wellbeing, significant positive changes were reported over the long term, however, this was observed in the AC rather than the CT intervention. It is possible that this alternative form of mental activity may have a place in the promotion of wellbeing amongst white collar workers, but will require further investigation. Productivity outcomes were difficult to interpret given the large amount of missing data due to inconsistent collection and reporting through the workplace&#x02019;s organizational systems. A more robust, externally administered and validated tool may be required for future studies intending to evaluate the productivity impact of workplace interventions.</p><p>Whilst the impact of CT on cognition may be dose-dependent <xref rid="pone.0059982-Lustig1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Jaeggi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, the &#x02018;dose&#x02019; has yet to be determined. So far, the literature suggests that at least four weeks of daily exercises are necessary to enhance cognition in any enduring way in non-aged populations, presuming that the training program is effective at the outset <xref rid="pone.0059982-Mahncke1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Lustig et al (2009) conducted an extensive review of studies investigating the effects of various interventions on the cognitive ageing process in healthy older adults <xref rid="pone.0059982-Lustig1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Training dose varied widely, ranging from just one session to 40 hours of training over eight weeks. A meta-analysis of studies of healthy adults suggested that persistent protective benefits required at least a two to three month training program <xref rid="pone.0059982-Valenzuela1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our study applied a realistic dose based on the literature (16 hours, 20 minutes three times a week) however it was spread over 16 weeks due to workplace restrictions. This &#x02018;dilution&#x02019; of training may be one reason for the limited effects we observed and so the effects of more concentrated and extended doses should be investigated. Other challenges and limitations worthy of note include measurement of cognitive change in a cognitively intact sample, recruitment and retention of participants over a longitudinal study and access to accurate and complete productivity data.</p><p>Quite unexpectedly, our AC, which involved viewing an extensive series of short National Geographic documentaries, appeared to have an enduring and positive impact on a number of wellbeing measures. The potential impact of simply taking &#x02018;time-out&#x02019; breaks during the work day has recently gained support. In fact, work day breaks have been shown to counter effects of fatigue and actually increase productivity <xref rid="pone.0059982-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The nature of any working-day break task also has important implications for the recovery process. Trougakos and Hideg (2009) distinguish between &#x02018;respites&#x02019; and &#x02018;chores&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0059982-Trougakos1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Respite activities are low effort or preferred by choice, which by their nature allow individuals to restore their personal resources for future work effectiveness. Chores are by contrast non-preferred activities that deplete the individual&#x02019;s personal resources. Our AC may have been perceived as a respite-type break due to the non-work related content and lack of associated performance pressure, a view supported by qualitative feedback from this group. Further research is required to replicate and understand the nature of this serendipitous finding.</p><p>Overall, this trial provides little support for the material benefit of CT to workers in roles of moderate cognitive complexity <xref rid="pone.0059982-Jaques1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. On the other hand, new and unexpected evidence was found for the idea that respite-type breaks during work hours can benefit workplace mental wellbeing. For employers, attempting to improve their employee&#x02019;s cognitive resources may provide limited returns, whereas attention to their mental health and wellbeing could potentially result in improved work performance <xref rid="pone.0059982-Knegtering1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059982-Hertzog1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.
