With an estimated incidence rate of 240 per 100000 person-years, it is a major public health problem in the US, and often results in early retirement and joint replacement.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>For treatment of OA, exercise and drugs are recommended. Acetaminophen, in doses of up to 4 g/day, is currently recommended for the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate pain from OA of the knee.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A systematic review of randomized controlled trials that conducted head-to-head comparisons between acetaminophen and NSAIDs showed better efficacy of and patient preference for NSAIDs, although side effects were greater.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Opioid therapy may be considered for patients with moderate or severe pain from OA, particularly if the pain is causing functional impairment or is reducing their quality of life.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, this must be individualized and carefully monitored.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Opioids are associated with a number of common adverse effects, including constipation, nausea or vomiting, pruritus, somnolence or cognitive impairment, dry mouth, tolerance or dependence, and urinary retention.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Opioids improve OA pain, and thereby, improve patients' quality of life. On the other hand, there is a possibility that opioids induce analgesia and suppress physiological pain from OA in patients, and as a result, induce progressive joint changes, such as Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy joint. However, to our knowledge, this adverse event has not been previously reported.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to investigate the possibility of progressive OA changes in patients using opioids during a relatively short period, compared with oral NSAIDs, in a prospective, randomized, active-controlled study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from each of the participants.</p><p>The patients who participated in this study were selected from outpatients who attended our hospital for knee or hip pain. Two hundred patients were selected from 210 knee or hip pain patients who matched the following criteria. All patients had knee or hip pain for more than one month. The major inclusion criterion was the observation of OA of the knee or hip joint on examination of an anterior-posterior X-ray image in the supine position. Patients who had a history of knee or hip surgery, infection, or rheumatoid arthritis were excluded from this study. The patients completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess socio-demographic factors and the duration of knee or hip symptoms.</p><sec><title>Pain scores</title><p>All patients completed a Visual Analogue Scale evaluation of pain on movement before randomization, and after 1, 4, and 12 weeks of randomized therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiographic evaluation</title><p>An anterior-posterior view X-ray examination was performed in all patients in the supine position before medication and 12 weeks after treatment. We used the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) severity classification system, which is a validated method of classifying individual joints into one of five grades, with 0 representing normal and 4 being the most severe radiographic disease.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Evaluation was blinded and performed by five observers. If at least three of the observers concurred, the grading score was used to define the KL grade.</p><p>We measured the distance between the surface of the medial condyle of the femur and the surface of the medial tibial plateau, as well as the distance between the surface of the lateral condyle of the femur and the surface of the lateral tibial plateau; we then averaged the measurements. We defined the average distance to the knee joint space in each knee OA patient. We measured the distance between the surface of the femoral head and the surface of the acetabular roof. We defined the distance to the hip joint space in each hip OA patient. If the distance showed more than a 50% decrease after treatment, we defined the patients as showing a progressive change in OA due to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and medication</title><p>Two hundred knee or hip OA patients were evaluated in the current randomized, prospective, parallel group, active-controlled study. The patients were randomized according to the minimization method for three groups.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We employed sex and age as stratification factors. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to the loxoprofen group, the tramadol/acetaminophen group, or the transdermal fentanyl group. The dose of loxoprofen sodium was 60 mg three times per day, or a total of 180 mg per day. The starting dose of tramadol/acetaminophen (tramadol 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg combination tablets) was 2 tablets per day. If this dose was not effective, it was increased to 8 tablets per day. The maximum dose was 8 tablets. The transdermal fentanyl starting dose was 12.5 &#x000b5;g/h. If this dose was not effective, it was increased sequentially to 25, 37.5, and 50 &#x000b5;g/h. The maximum dose was 50 &#x000b5;g/h. Study medications were administered for 12 weeks. Other drugs and injections into the knee or hip joints were not allowed in any patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare pain scales between the three groups; a one way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons for age, symptom duration, X-ray findings, and follow-up; and the Fisher's test for dichotomous/categorical variables. <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

This finding should be taken into consideration if we administer fentanyl to knee or hip OA patients.</p><p>The use of opioids for OA pain has been previously reported. In a randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled study, treatment with tapentadol or oxycodone was effective for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic OA-related knee and hip pain.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The efficacy and safety of low-dose 7-day buprenorphine patches and prolonged-release tramadol tablets in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe OA pain of the hip and/or knee were reported for a randomized controlled study.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The systematic review of randomized trials of long-term opioid management for OA pain illustrated fair evidence for tramadol in managing osteoarthritis pain.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the current study, there was a significant effect of tramadol/acetaminophen and transdermal fentanyl, compared with loxoprofen, for management of pain from knee and hip OA, and this finding was consistent with previous reports.</p><p>Concerning adverse events with opioid use, Kalso, et al.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported adverse events from use of opioids in treating chronic non-cancer pain, including OA. They analyzed available randomized, placebo-controlled trials using the Oxford Pain Relief Database, as well as Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Specific adverse events were reported in most studies. Constipation (41%), somnolence (29%), and nausea (32%) were most frequently reported with opioids, with vomiting (15%), dizziness (20%), and itching (15%) also reported significantly more frequently than with placebo.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, a progressive change in OA has not been reported.</p><p>Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is a devastating condition affecting most commonly the foot/ankle joint.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Several authors have reported the existence of sensory and autonomic nerve related pain in the joint.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Free nerve endings and corpuscular nerve endings are found in the knee joint capsule.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The neuronal occurrence of autonomic transmitters and autonomic innervation of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules have also been reported.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> If the nervous system does not work normally due to severe disease in Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy, the joint is characterized by progressive osteolysis, which can lead to multiple fractures, joint destruction, and joint dislocation, resulting in severe deformity due to non-perception of pain. Similarly, if OA patients do not feel pain while using strong analgesics, there may be a possibility that OA progressive changes could occur in these patients. In the current study, we showed the possibility that strong opioids induce a progressive change in OA among patients during a relatively short period, compared with oral NSAIDs or tramadol administration. Indeed, the average pain score after 12 weeks of treatment in 3 patients with progressive OA in the transdermal fentanyl group was significantly lower than that in the other patients in the transdermal fentanyl group.</p><p>There are some limitations to the current study. First, we included 65-70 patients in each group. This number may not be sufficient for an analysis. Second, there is a possibility that OA progression is the natural course of the disease. However, this study was a prospective, randomized study, and the OA progression occurred during 12 weeks of treatment. We believe this progression was induced by fentanyl. Third, this study was a randomized trial; however, the power analysis was not considered. In addition, the natural courses of knee and hip OA are different. Since we could not predict the effect of opioids for OA patients and the number of patients having progressive OA, we could not evaluate the sample size. Several authors have reported the natural course of knee and hip OA. After 8.1 years of follow-up in the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study, approximately 2% of women per year had developed incident radiographic disease and 1% per year had developed symptomatic knee OA.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A population-based study in the UK showed that 2.3% of subjects per year developed incident radiographic disease during 5.1 years of follow-up.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In a Japanese study, 2.0% of men and 3.7% of women per year developed incident radiographic disease during 3.3 years of follow-up.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These data suggested that the rate of incident radiographic disease is slightly higher in the Japanese population than in previous epidemiologic studies in the US and Europe. As well, progression over 8 years in a community-based sample of elderly women with radiographic findings of hip osteoarthritis was also evaluated.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> After a mean of 8.3 years of follow-up, nearly two-thirds of the women, and just over half of the hips had progressed radiographically.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A prospective, longitudinal two-year study in 463 study patients showed joint space width decreased from 2.2 mm at baseline to 1.7 mm after two years, and radiographic progression was seen in 32% of the patients.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These previous reports indicated that there is the possibility of a difference in progression of OA changes in knee- and hip-joint patients. Thus, there is a limitation because we evaluated hip and knee OA in the same study. Fourth, it is not clear whether the progressive OA was induced by the anesthetic effect of transdermal fentanyl or vice versa (the patients with progressive OA required a higher dose of transdermal fentanyl). We need further studies with a larger number of patients to clarify these points.</p><p>In conclusion, fentanyl may induce a progressive change in knee or hip OA during a relatively short period, compared with oral NSAIDs or tramadol administration. We should monitor for this event during the use of fentanyl to treat knee or hip OA patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</collab><source>National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.
