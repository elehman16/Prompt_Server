Since 1978, there have been 3 strains in the annual vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C2">2</xref>]: 2 influenza A strains, A/H3N2 and H1N1; and 1 influenza B strain. However, the emergence of 2 lineages of B virus, Yamagata and Victoria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C3">3</xref>], which may circulate simultaneously, has led to mismatch between the predominant B virus and the vaccine virus in at least 5 of 10 seasons from 2001 to 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C4">4</xref>]. Because the B virus lineages are antigenically distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C3">3</xref>], little or no cross-lineage protection is expected to occur, resulting in reduced vaccine protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C5">5</xref>].</p><p>The burden of illness associated with influenza B in children is substantial. Surveillance in the United States, for example, identified that during the 2010&#x02013;2011 season, 38% of all influenza-associated pediatric deaths were attributed to influenza B, with half of these children being previously healthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C6">6</xref>]. Influenza B may also preferentially affect children and young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C7">7</xref>], and has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in children than influenza A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C8">8</xref>] and with particular clinical syndromes, including myocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C10">10</xref>]. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines containing both B virus lineages are estimated to reduce illness, hospitalization, and death due to influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C11">11</xref>].</p><p>In this Phase III randomized study of children and adolescents 3 through 17 years of age, we assessed the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) containing influenza B strains from both lineages versus 2 inactivated trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) containing the same influenza A virus strains and a B strain from either the B/Victoria lineage or the B/Yamagata lineage. In a concurrent open-label study arm, the immunogenicity and safety of QIV was assessed in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized (1:1:1), controlled, double-blind comparison of QIV and TIV in 3- to 17-year-old children to determine safety and immunogenicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIT263F1">1</xref>).

The randomization sequence was generated using MATEX, a software program developed for use in SAS (Cary, NC) by GlaxoSmithKline (Rixensart, Belgium). Randomization was stratified equally between groups by age (3&#x02013;8 years and 9&#x02013;17 years). A minimization procedure accounted for previous receipt of influenza vaccine (&#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; status), country, and age subgroups (3&#x02013;4 years and 5&#x02013;8 years). Neither the parents/guardians, participants, or study staff were aware of treatment allocation for participants &#x02265;3 years of age. In the open-label study, parents/guardians and study staff were not blinded.</p><p>Prior to the first vaccination, a brief history-directed physical examination was performed and blood drawn. Children who were &#x02265;9 years of age or had prior receipt of &#x02265;2 doses of an influenza vaccine at least 1 month apart were considered &#x0201c;primed.&#x0201d; Primed children received one 0.5 mL dose of study vaccine on day 0 and had blood collected on day 28 (visit 2). Unprimed participants received a second 0.5 mL dose of vaccine on day 28, and had blood collected on day 56. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral region of the left thigh (age 6&#x02013;11 months) or deltoid region of the left arm (age &#x02265;12 months). Children were observed at the study site for 30 minutes after administration of study vaccine.</p><p>Parents/guardians were instructed on the use of a diary card for recording any solicited injection site or general adverse events (AEs) for 7 days, and any unsolicited AEs for 28 days, and to bring the diary to study visits. Parents/guardians of children &#x0003c;5 years of age were asked to contact study staff immediately if a seizure or fever &#x02265;39&#x000b0;C occurred within 2 days of vaccination. On day 180, parents/guardians were asked if changes in health or AEs had occurred since the last vaccination.</p><p>Participant flow is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIT263F1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>The primary confirmatory objective was to determine if QIV was noninferior to TIV-Vic and TIV-Yam for the shared vaccine strains in children 3&#x02013;17 years of age, at 28 days after completion of dosing (day 28 for primed children and day 56 for unprimed children). Immunogenic noninferiority was assessed between shared viral strains in terms of the geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and seroconversion rate (SCR) difference. A secondary confirmatory objective was to assess the immunogenic superiority of QIV versus TIV-Vic for the B/Yamagata strain and TIV-Yam for the B/Victoria strain (strains absent from the TIV) in children 3&#x02013;17 years of age at 28 days after dosing. Exploratory objectives were to describe GMT, SCR, seroprotection rate (SPR), and seroconversion factor (SCF) for all strains in each vaccine in children 3&#x02013;17 years and for QIV in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age.</p><p>Antibody titers against the vaccine strains were measured in serum samples by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay performed at GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines' laboratory in Laval, Canada, using standardized procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Reactogenicity</title><p>Reactogenicity analyses for participants &#x02264;5 years of age were the frequency of solicited injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling) and solicited general AEs (fever, irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, loss of appetite) in the 7 days following each vaccination.

For children &#x0003e;5 years, the same injection site reactions were collected, but the solicited general reactions were fever, headache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms; and joint pain, muscle aches, and shivering. Intensity scales were used for the description of each symptom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jit263/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 28 days.</p><p>Safety was further assessed by consideration of serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended adverse events (MAEs), and potentially immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs), which were recorded during the entire study period (to day 180). MAEs were defined as events for which the child was hospitalized, visited the emergency room, or had a visit with a physician for any complaint. All injection-site reactions were considered as vaccine-related events. The causality of all other AEs was assessed by investigators. All AEs were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample Size and Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample size for the randomized controlled trial (RCT) was 2175 evaluable children (725 per group) age 3&#x02013;17 years, to obtain an overall power of 90% to demonstrate the primary objectives of noninferiority of QIV to TIV-Yam and TIV-Vic for the alternate-lineage B strain. A target of 2700 children (900 per group) was set to account for an attrition rate of 20%.

In the QIV-only 6- to 35-month-old group, HI antibody titers fulfilled CBER criteria for immunogenicity for the strains contained in the QIV with the exception of SPR for the A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2) strain (74.5, 95% CI, 68.8, 79.9).

Among children age 6&#x02013;35 months in the QIV-only arm, 7 children (2.3%) reported a total of 10 SAEs. Four SAEs in 3 children were considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccines: 2 SAEs (angioedema and acute conjunctivitis), which resolved within 7 days, were reported for a 12-year-old boy given TIV-Yam. A 1-year-old girl had a generalized seizure on the day after QIV receipt, and a 2-year-old boy had a febrile seizure 18 days after QIV receipt; both recovered within 1 day.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this large multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in children 3&#x02013;17 years of age, the immunogenicity of a candidate QIV was noninferior to TIV for shared vaccine strains, and was superior to TIV with respect to the added B strains. Inclusion of a fourth strain in QIV did not interfere with immune responses to the other 3 strains, which met all CBER criteria. Immune responses to all strains contained in the 3 vaccines were robust, with the highest responses to the B Yamagata and A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) strains. In the superiority analysis, the ratio of the GMT of QIV to TIV for the B strains showed that QIV elicited an immune response 2.5- to 3.7-fold higher than that of TIV. Similarly, the seroconversion rates of QIV were 32 to 40 percentage points higher than TIV. In brief, the immune responses to each B component of the quadrivalent vaccine exceed the cross-reactive immune responses to the B component not contained in each trivalent vaccine. The superior QIV immunogenicity is expected to correspond with superior protection against influenza B relative to TIV in a season when there is lineage mismatch or cocirculation of 2 influenza B lineages.</p><p>These immunogenicity results suggest that the candidate QIV can improve protection against influenza B without compromising protection against influenza A. Because influenza B exacts a special toll on the young and particularly those with comorbidities (increasing their risk for complicated influenza), and mismatch of vaccine and circulating B strain has been frequent with TIVs, the option of a QIV for children is particularly relevant.</p><p>An open-label study arm of children 6&#x02013;35 months of age was included in this study. Vaccines for this age group were given at the same dosage as older children, 0.5 mL, which is considered the &#x0201c;full&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;adult&#x0201d; dose. Practice regarding dose for young children varies around the world, with some jurisdictions routinely using a &#x0201c;half dose&#x0201d; for children up to 35 months of age and a 0.5 mL dose for older children. Public health in Canada first recommended the 0.5 mL dose for the 2011&#x02013;2012 season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C14">14</xref>]; recent evidence supports that this dose results in moderate improvement in antibody response without increase in reactogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C16">16</xref>]. HI antibody responses in 6- to 35-month-olds were lower than in older children, but fulfilled CBER criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C13">13</xref>] except for the SPR for the A/H3N2 strain. Because no TIV comparator arm was included for the youngest age group, no conclusions about relative immunogenicity or reactogenicity differences can be made. Based on the results of this open-label study, a randomized controlled study of this population is underway (NCT01711736). We speculate that copresentation of antigens from 2 lineages of influenza B virus to young children might result in improved responses to both B lineage strains. Priming with 1 influenza B lineage has been shown to affect immunogenicity to subsequent doses of the other lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C18">18</xref>], without affecting humoral responses to influenza A antigens. In the open-label QIV-only arm, the candidate QIV elicited notably high SCRs of 94.6% and 93.8% for B/Victoria and B/Yamagata strains, respectively, in children 6&#x02013;35 months old. Because there was no comparator arm for this component of the study, no conclusions can be made, but this possibility warrants further investigation.</p><p>Quadrivalent influenza vaccine contains 60 &#x000b5;g of HA antigen, and it is therefore plausible that reactogenicity could be higher than with a vaccine containing 45 &#x000b5;g of HA antigen. Injection site pain was modestly more common with QIV than TIV controls in 3- to 17-year-old recipients after the first dose (65.4% in QIV recipients, 54.6% in TIV-Vic recipients, and 55.7% in the TIV-Yam group), although redness and swelling were not. Pain was also the most common injection site symptom in 6- to 35-month-olds, but less frequent than in older participants. The overall percentage of participants presenting with at least 1 AE during the 7 days following their vaccination ranged from 69.0% to 77.3% in the 3&#x02013;17 year age group, and was 74.8% in the 6&#x02013;35 month age group. Other than an increase in injection site pain, the AE profile of the candidate QIV was similar to that of the TIV controls.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. The intermediate outcome of immunogenicity was assessed; therefore, clinical protection cannot be predicted with accuracy. As well, the 6- to 35-month-old group had no TIV comparator, and their outcomes cannot be compared to older children. Finally, we do not know the duration of antibody responses to the 4 strains, as immunogenicity was only assessed to 28 days after final vaccination.</p><p>In summary, the evolution of influenza B viruses has led to 2 cocirculating, antigenically distinct B lineages, and immune responses to one confers limited or no cross-lineage protection. A live attenuated QIV has received regulatory approval for use in persons 2&#x02013;49 years of age in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C19">19</xref>] as has an injected QIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C20">20</xref>], and the World Health Organization made its first recommendations for constituents of QIVs for the southern hemisphere for the coming season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT263C21">21</xref>]. The inactivated QIV assessed in this study can potentially provide protection against both B lineages, as well as to the 2 influenza A strains, and thus reduce influenza morbidity in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jit263/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).
