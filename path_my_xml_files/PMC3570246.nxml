A total of 160 patients with <italic>Hp</italic>-infected duodenal ulcers were randomly allocated into two groups. Patients in the treatment group (n=80) were administered a 20-mg dose of omeprazole twice daily for 1 week and then the treatment and control groups (n=80) received therapy for <italic>Hp</italic> infection and duodenal ulcers. We observed the ulcer healing stage, the content of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA in gastric juice and the <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rate before and after proton pump inhibitor therapy in the two groups. Results revealed that the <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rate in the treatment group was 93% compared with 81% in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.05). The ulcer healing rate in the treatment group was 93%, compared with 70% in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). A positive linear correlation was observed between gastric pH and the content of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA in gastric juice (P&#x0003c;0.05). Increasing gastric pH prior to anti-<italic>Hp</italic> therapy may be beneficial to the eradication of <italic>Hp</italic> and for promoting the healing of duodenal ulcers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication</kwd><kwd>duodenal ulcer</kwd><kwd>gastric juice pH</kwd><kwd>omeprazole</kwd><kwd>clarithromycin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection with <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>Hp</italic>) is a substantial public health problem that affects 20&#x02013;50% of the population in industrialized nations and up to 80% of the population in less developed countries (<xref rid="b1-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

It is widely recognized that the eradication of <italic>Hp</italic> accelerates duodenal ulcer healing and prevents ulcer relapse. However, recent studies (<xref rid="b6-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) have indicated that increasing antibiotic resistance may be responsible for the current low <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rate by classical clarithromycin-based triple therapy.</p><p>Alternative approaches have attempted to increase the <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rate, including bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, non-bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, sequential therapy and levofloxacin-containing regimens (<xref rid="b7-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, by changing the administration strategy of antibiotics to initially improve the environment in which they exert their effects, we may be able to enhance their <italic>Hp</italic> eradication efficacy.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that overproduction of gastric acid is important in the development of ulcer disease.

Patients in the treatment group were initially administered a 20-mg dose of omeprazole enteric-coated capsules twice daily.

For the following 1 week, a 0.5-g dose of clarithromycin disperse tablets twice daily and a 0.1-g dose of furazolidone twice daily were added. Omeprazole enteric-coated capsules were continued for a further 2 weeks. Two weeks after the course of treatment had ended, <sup>14</sup>C-urea breath tests, gastroscopy and staining microscopy were carried out again and gastric juice pH and content of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA were reexamined. The treatment course differed for the control group; a 20-mg dose of omeprazole enteric-coated capsules twice daily, a 0.5-g dose of clarithromycin disperse tablets twice daily and a 0.1-g dose of furazolidone twice daily were administrated for the first week. Antibiotics were subsequently stopped, while omeprazole continued for a further 3 weeks.

The presence of <italic>Hp</italic> leads to a sequence of pathophysiological events, including mucosal inflammation, impairment of the mucus-bicarbonate barrier, superficial epithelial cell damage, elevated serum gastrin levels with defective feedback control, a possible increase in parietal cell mass and gastric metaplasia in the duodenal cap. It has been well established that <italic>Hp</italic> is a critical contributor to the development of duodenal ulcers and that eradication of <italic>Hp</italic> accelerates duodenal ulcer healing and prevents ulcer relapse. Since the 1940s, it has been recognized that pH levels in the duodenal bulbs of patients with ulcer disease was lower than those without ulcers and that antacids or antisecretory therapy, which reduced the duodenal acid load, accelerated ulcer healing. Gradually, increasing numbers of studies started to explore the association between pH and <italic>Hp</italic> and this led to the conclusion that the duodenal acid load may be a critical factor in explaining the ability of <italic>Hp</italic> to colonize the duodenal bulb, via the precipitation of glycineconjugated bile salts. Furthermore, the combination of an elevated duodenal acid level and <italic>Hp</italic> infection is suggested to be a critical event in the pathogenesis of <italic>Hp</italic>-infected duodenal ulcers. It has also been reported that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clarithromycin against <italic>Hp</italic> is an order of magnitude lower when pH is high (<xref rid="b13-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Therefore, among the numerous factors which are known to affect <italic>Hp</italic> eradication, gastric pH, which affects the activity of <italic>Hp</italic> and anti-<italic>Hp</italic> drugs, is one of the most crucial. Thus eliminating <italic>Hp</italic> in an environment with a suitable gastric pH may enhance <italic>Hp</italic> eradication, whilst also improving the healing quality of mucosa (<xref rid="b4-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b14-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the treatment group was provided with acid-suppressing drugs for the first week, followed by anti-<italic>Hp</italic> therapy the week after. The control group received no treatment in the first week and the acid suppression and anti-<italic>Hp</italic> therapy were administered in the second week. Subsequently, the two groups were administered PPIs until the end of the therapy course. The main difference between the two groups was that gastric pH in the treatment group was changed by administering acid-suppressing therapy, thus the gastric juice pH levels were significantly higher than that of the control group before <italic>Hp</italic> eradication (P&#x0003c;0.05; <xref rid="t2-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>). This study observed the healing stage, the content of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA in gastric juice and the <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rate in <italic>Hp</italic>-infected duodenal ulcers, after clarithromycin-based triple therapy in environments with different gastric pH levels.</p><p><italic>Hp</italic> colonizes the microaerophilic environment in the protective layer of mucosal secretions, which are adjacent to the epithelium of the human stomach, particularly in the antrum. Numerous studies have shown that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to provoke a systemic and local immune response. Anti-whole <italic>Hp</italic> component specific IgA antibodies exist in the gastric juice, gastric tissue and saliva. Due to their ability to prevent the entrance of external foreign antigenic molecules, secretory IgA antibodies have generally been considered an immune barrier. However, secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies have numerous functions, including the intracellular and serosal neutralization of antigens, activation of non-inflammatory pathways and homeostatic control of endogenous microbiota (<xref rid="b15-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, studies have suggested that there is an association between the antibody titer of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA and the intensity of inflammation and degree of <italic>Hp</italic> colonization in different parts of the stomach (<xref rid="b16-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This study has shown that <italic>Hp</italic>-specific IgA is correlated with gastric pH (<xref rid="f1-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). As indicated in <xref rid="t2-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="table">Tables II</xref> and <xref rid="t3-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="table">III</xref> and <xref rid="f1-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, higher gastric pH levels correspond with an increased content of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA in gastric juice and vice versa. It is known that the optimum pH value of pepsin is 1.9, thus when the gastric pH is increased, its activity decreases and therefore the decomposition of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA by pepsin is reduced. This leads to the increased content and enhanced immunocompetence of IgA, which causes an improvement in <italic>Hp</italic> eradication, as depicted in <xref rid="t4-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="table">Table IV</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="t3-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>, the content of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA in gastric juice after <italic>Hp</italic> eradication was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). This may be explained by the higher <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rate in the treatment group and the short half-life of IgA. Additionally, the extent of the decrease in IgA content in the treatment group was larger than in the control group, which may reflect the difference in <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rate between the two groups.</p><p>Due to variation between <italic>Hp</italic> strains, their increasing resistance to antibiotics and numerous host and environmental factors, the eradiation of <italic>Hp</italic> is decreasing year by year (<xref rid="b17-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). <italic>Hp</italic> colonizes the gastric epithelial surface and/or deeper into the mucus layer, where the median pH is 1.4. Due to the reduced activity of antibiotics in low pH levels and their decreased ability to penetrate the mucus layer, <italic>Hp</italic> elimination is unsuccessful. A reduction in pH negatively affects the activity of antibiotics, as demonstrated by a study which revealed a marked increase in the MIC of clarithromycin for clarithromycin-susceptible strains when pH was reduced; at pH 6.5, the MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> increased two- and eight-fold, respectively; at pH 5.9, eight- and 16-fold increases, respectively, were observed (<xref rid="b13-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Therefore, the negative effect of low gastric pH levels on the activity of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> drugs may be one of the most significant factors in the failure of <italic>Hp</italic> eradication. In the present study, we used the commonly administered clarithromycin-based triple therapy, which is a combination of omeprazole, clarithromycin and furazolidone. As has been illustrated in <xref rid="t4-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="table">Tables IV</xref> and <xref rid="t5-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="table">V</xref>, the <italic>Hp</italic> eradication rates and S2 stage achievement rates in the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The initial basic therapy with omeprazole in the treatment group relieved symptoms which were causing discomfort in patients, thus increasing their compliance for further treatment. More critically, it increased gastric pH, which had a positive effect on the efficacy of the antibiotics. Numerous studies have demonstrated that low pH conditions in gastric juice results in the rapid decomposition and decreased antibacterial efficacy of clarithromycin. Scholars have also investigated the impact of pH on the decomposition rate of clarithromycin, by calculating the decomposition rate constants of clarithromycin molecules in solutions and in human gastric juice. Such studies have demonstrated that the decomposition of clarithromycin in solutions and gastric juice proceeded in a pseudo-first order manner and the respective half-lives of clarithromycin were 0.1 and 1.3 h when the pH levels of the solutions were 1.0 and 2.0. Clarithromycin scarcely decomposed when the pH was above 5.0 (<xref rid="b19-etm-05-03-0912" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It has been suggested that the prolonged elevation of intragastric pH may increase the concentration of acid-labile antibiotics in gastric juice, prolong their effectiveness and improve the environment to allow the defense mechanisms of the host to exert their optimal effect. Thus the elevation of gastric pH may be a critical factor in <italic>Hp</italic> elimination and ulcer healing. <italic>Hp</italic> is also susceptible to furazolidone, which has a similar reaction to a change in gastric pH. In addition, PPIs have the direct ability to improve the content of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> IgA and partly eliminate <italic>Hp</italic>, which contributes to <italic>Hp</italic> eradication and ulcer healing. In summary, this synergistic effect may be due to the direct effect of omeprazole on the organism, the protection of antibiotics from acid suppression or a reinforcement in host defense mechanisms which accompany acid degradation.</p><p>Studies have revealed that the gastric pH levels of patients with duodenal ulcers were too low to allow the anti-<italic>Hp</italic> drugs to optimally exert their effects. Therefore, administering acid-suppressing therapy ahead of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> treatment may improve the gastric pH and compliance of patients, whilst also elevating the content of <italic>Hp-</italic>specific IgA and enhancing the sustainability, activity and efficacy of anti-<italic>Hp</italic> drugs, which is beneficial to the eradication of <italic>Hp</italic> and the healing of duodenal ulcers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the members of the Central Laboratory of the 1st Hospital of Hebei Medical University.
