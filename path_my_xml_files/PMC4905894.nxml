of research on whether knowledge of performance or knowledge of result as augmented
feedback is more effective. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness
of knowledge of result and knowledge of performance in the learning of a skilled motor
activity by healthy young adults. [Subjects and Methods] A total of thirty healthy young
adult males and females without any neurological or musculoskeletal impairment, between
the age of 18&#x02013;30 years were the subjects of the study. They were randomly allocated to 2
groups: group 1 was given knowledge of result as feedback, and knowledge of performance
was given as feedback to group 2. Both the groups practiced the task of throwing a soft
spongy ball for 6 days per week for 4 weeks, with 40 trials each day. The outcome measure
used was the distance of the throw. [Results] The results were analyzed using the t-test.
The mean distances thrown by both the groups showed highly significant improvements and
throwing distance of group 2 showed better improvement than that of group 1. [Conclusion]
Both types of augmented feedback were effective at improving skilled motor activity, but
the knowledge of performance group showed better improvement than the knowledge of result
group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Motor skills</kwd><kwd>Knowledge of performance</kwd><kwd>Knowledge of result</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In human beings, little or no instinctive behavior is inherited. We have a few unlearned
reactions (mainly eye blink, knee jerk reflexes, etc.) that serve as signs of normality to
the neurologist, but they are not important in understanding human nature. People vary
greatly in these inherited capacities, but at the end it is learning that makes the
individual distinctive<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Learning can be
defined as any relatively permanent change in behavior, or a person&#x02019;s ability to perform a
skill, that must be inferred from a relatively permanent improvement in performance which
occurs as a result of practice or experience<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Learning has also been defined as a process in which various habits, attitudes and knowledge
necessary to meet the demands of life in general, are acquired by an individual<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. While learning is described as the process
of acquiring knowledge about the world, motor learning is explained as a set of processes
associated with experience or practice which can lead to permanent changes in the ability to
perform a skilled action<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor learning
involves more than motor processes, since it involves learning new strategies for sensing as
well as moving. Thus, motor learning emerges from a complex perception, cognition, and
action process similar to motor control<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to study motor learning, many variables are considered important determinants.
Even though motor skills need to be utilized effectively in a number of situations, and
especially in rehabilitation and competitive sports events, there are no studies in the
literature that have compared different modes of intervention for improving the motor
learning of individuals<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The use of
feedback, transfer of training, modeling and demonstration, pre-practice instructions,
contextual variety and part to whole task practice are among the research areas related to
skill acquisitions that are practiced<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Apart from practice itself, feedback to the performer is one of the most critical parts of
the learning<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvement in performance
occurs when people have the opportunity to try out movements and are given feedback about
the outcome of movements so that they can then rectify or modify their performance to
improve the outcome<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Feedback is a general term that describes information people receive about their
performance of a motor skill during or after the performance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Feedback is very important when it comes to motor learning. Some
form of feedback is essential for learning to take place<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. When people perform a motor skill, they have access to two general
types of performance related information (i.e. feedback) which will predict the outcome of
performance. One is the task intrinsic feedback, the sensory perceptual information that is
a natural part of performing a skill. Each of the sensory systems can provide this type of
feedback<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The second general type of
feedback is augmented feedback. Augmented means adding to, or enhancing something, and in
this case it involves adding to or improving task intrinsic feedback. The task intrinsic
feedback can be augmented in various ways; however, augmented feedback mainly improves the
task intrinsic feedback in two distinct ways. In some situations, augmented feedback
improves the task intrinsic feedback, which an individual&#x02019;s sensory system can readily
detect on its own. In other situations augmented feedback provides information to an
individual when it cannot be detected by the individual&#x02019;s sensory system<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the process of skill learning,
augmented feedback plays two major roles: the first is to facilitate goal achievement of the
skill, and the second is to motivate the learner to continue striving towards a goal<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are two types of augmented feedback and they are known as
knowledge of performance and knowledge of results<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Knowledge of results (KR) can be described as the information
related to the performance outcome, whereas knowledge of performance (KP) is related to
specific movement component characteristics<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Knowledge of result is knowledge about achieving the goal of the performance or externally
presented information about the outcome of performing a skill. In some situations, KR
describes something about the performance outcome. Sometimes, KR does not describe the
performance outcome, but simply tells the performer whether he or she has achieved the goal
of the performance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. KR is beneficial
for skill learning for at least four reasons: (a) learners often use KR to confirm their own
assessment of the task intrinsic feedback, even though it may be redundant with task
intrinsic feedback; (b) learners may need KR because they cannot determine the outcome of
performing a skill on the basis of the available task intrinsic feedback; (c) learners often
use KR to motivate themselves to continue practicing; and (d) in certain situations, in
order to establish a discovery learning practice environment, the practitioner may want to
provide only KR. In these situations, as the primary means of learning is to perform a
skill, learners are encouraged to engage in a trial and error method of skill
performance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Knowledge of performance is the second category of augmented feedback. It is information
about the movement characteristics that lead to the performance outcome. KP can be given
verbally and there are various non-verbal means of providing KP: for example, a videotape
replay is a popular method of showing a person what he or she did while performing a
skill<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. KP can be especially beneficial when: (a) skills must be performed
according to specified movement characteristics, such as in gymnastics, stunts, or
springboard dives; (b) a specific movement component of skills that requires complex
coordination must be improved or corrected; (c) the goal of the action is a kinematic,
kinetic, or specific muscle activity; or (d) KR is redundant in the task intrinsic
feedback<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Feedback can improve the motor learning of healthy subjects. Careful planning of
scheduling, content and attention oriented focus induced by feedback can improve the
effectiveness of training considerably<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Even though motor tasks can be learned without extrinsic feedback, comparisons of KP and KR
with no feedback show there is improved retention with feedback<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the available evidences do not provide clear-cut
evidence about the relative effectiveness of KR and KP<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, studies are needed to determine which is more effective at
improving motor learning. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to understand and
compare the effectiveness of KR and KP for healthy young adults learning a skilled motor
activity with the non-dominant upper limb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This quasi experimental study recruited thirty healthy young adult male and female
subjects, aged between 18 to 25&#x02005;years, who were attending a physical therapy school. The
study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Committee of King Abdulaziz
University. The subjects were explained about the experimental procedures, outcome measures,
and formal written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The exclusion
criteria were: deformity either congenital or acquired, pain in the non-dominant upper
extremity, trauma of the upper extremity, severe cardiovascular deficit, or neurological
deficit. The 30 subjects were randomly allocated to group 1 or group 2 by a lottery method.
The task which was given to both the groups was to throw a soft spongy ball as far as
possible with the non-dominant arm. The pre-test measure was the mean distance the subjects
of each group could throw the soft spongy ball in five trials, without practice.</p><p>In group 1 (KR), all the subjects practiced throwing the soft spongy ball 40 times a day.
Each subject rested for 40 seconds after every 10 trials. After every 10 trials the subjects
were given knowledge of result as feedback, in the form of the longest distance thrown by
them in the 10 trials. The practice sessions were performed for four weeks with six sessions
per week.</p><p>In group 2 (KP), the subjects were given the same practice task as group 1; however, after
10 trials they were given feedback in the form of knowledge of performance, i.e. verbal cues
and videotape replays of their own performance. The practice sessions were performed for
four weeks with six sessions per week. The post-test throwing distance was measured at the
end of the four weeks as the average of 5 trials performed by the subjects of both the
groups.</p><p>The data were statistically analyzed using the statistical package, SPSS for Windows
version 19.0. Statistical significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c;0.05. The data of
the throwing distance of both the groups were analyzed using the paired t-test. The mean,
standard deviation and the standard error were calculated for the throwing distance of both
the groups, and the inter-group comparison was done using the unpaired t-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In group 1, the pre-test mean of throwing distance was 35.30 &#x000b1; 9.22 feet, and the post-test

form of knowledge of result and knowledge of performance in the learning of a skilled motor
activity by healthy young adults. The ball throwing distance of the non-dominant arm was
used as the outcome measure, and practice sessions were conducted 6 days a week for 4 weeks.
Group 1 received knowledge of result as feedback whereas group 2 received knowledge of
performance as feedback.</p><p>In order to enhance motor learning, feedback can be used in any form, especially in the
form of augmented feedback<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The result of this study shows that, KR as feedback for
improving the motor learning is effective for young adults. This finding is supported by
Carolee Winstein et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> who stated that
knowledge of results is capable of affecting both temporary and relatively permanent (i.e.
learning) changes in performance, especially in motor learning. Sidaway B et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that even though all their study
groups improved with practice, the immediate KR group performed better than the other
groups. John Liu &#x00026; Craig A. Wrisberg<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> also concluded that KR is an effective method of feedback for
improving the motor skills of the subjects. Masters et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that objective and marginally perceptible knowledge of
results was an effective mode of feedback for the subjects they tested for improved
performance. Even though KR has been developed in the field of experimental psychology, this
motor learning theory is now practiced in various fields of physical therapy. However the
within&#x02013;group comparison of the KP group also showed there was a significant improvement at
the end of the program. This finding could be in agreement with the study results of Zubiaur
M et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, who stated that knowledge of
performance tends to be an effective mode of intervention for learning.</p><p>The intergroup comparison showed there was a very highly significant difference in the
distance thrown between the KR and the KP groups. The reason for this significant
improvement in KP could be that the knowledge of performance of repetitive movements results
in better motor outcomes. According to Cirstea C M et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, if an appropriate feedback is given (ie, KP), even severely
impaired patients may show improvement in motor function. Other reasons for better
performance in the KP group were suggested by Leonard F. Koziol and Deborah Ely Buddin<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> who concluded that while factual
information is consciously recalled in explicit or declarative memory, in procedural
learning, memories and acquisitions are demonstrated through task performance. The fact that
acquisition can occur very quickly in declarative learning, even with a single exposure to
an event, but usually requires repetition of an activity in procedural learning and
associated learning, is demonstrated through improved task performance. Hence, when the
knowledge of performance was given as a feedback, it served the right purpose. Tzetzis et
al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that, for learning a
physical skill, goal setting and feedback are among the most important factors. However,
they suggested that, feedback does not improve performance when feedback is separated from
goals. Intuitively, this makes sense as in any kind of coaching instruction there is
typically some sort of goal involved, because the nature of feedback has to refer to a goal
even if it is implicit. Even the use of observation can lead to improvement in the cognitive
representations of the movement through recall and recognition. Therefore, adding a feedback
can enhance the effectiveness of performance in all individuals<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the study also suggest the effective use of these feedbacks for enhancing
motor learning and thereby performance, especially that of athletes. Feedback could be
effectively used in various disciplines to improve recovery and performance following injury
and in particular during the rehabilitation period. The common factor in both KP and KR is
that both sources of information are provided externally<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Augmented feedback was found to be useful for improving the
performance of athletes as well as the process of motor learning<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. It could also be used in sports injury prevention,
rehabilitation and training<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. According
to Gabriele Wulf et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, feedback can affect learners&#x02019; performance, motivation,
and learning. This may have an energizing or reinforcing effect that facilitates motor
learning. For successfully performing physical activities in daily life, motor skill
learning is an essential component. In neuroscience, understanding the mechanisms of motor
learning in the human nervous system remains an interesting scientific issue. It is
important to increase the effectiveness of motor skill learning in the fields of sports
science and neurological rehabilitation. Accordingly, we expect these findings will help the
development of effective and efficient approaches for the facilitation of motor
learning<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, only a simple ball- throwing task was analyzed and that is one of the
limitations of this study. It could be the reason for low improvement difference between the
groups, and a more complex task might have provided a more definitive result. Moreover, the
retention of the learned movement was not investigated. A larger scale study with follow up
is recommended which may clarify the problem in a better way. Future studies should focus on
conducting studies using patient populations with multiple outcome measures and more complex
tasks to better elucidate improvements in performance. In conclusion, the result of this
study shows that both the groups showed improvements in the ball-throwing distance of the
non dominant upper extremity of healthy young adults, and the group which received KP as a
feedback showed greater improvement in the skilled motor activity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Morgan CT: A brief introduction
