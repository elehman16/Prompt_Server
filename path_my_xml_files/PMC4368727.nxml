A cluster randomized controlled trial took place in Guantanamo city, east Cuba. Twelve neighborhoods (about 500 households each) were selected among the ones with the highest <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation levels in the previous two years, and were randomly allocated to the intervention and control arms. Long lasting ITC (PermaNet) were distributed in the intervention clusters in March 2009. Routine control activities were continued in the whole study area. In both study arms, we monitored monthly pre- and post-intervention House Index (HI, number of houses with at least 1 container with <italic>Aedes</italic> immature stages/100 houses inspected), during 12 and 18 months respectively. We evaluated the effect of ITC deployment on HI by fitting a generalized linear regression model with a negative binomial link function to these data.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Principal Findings</title><p>At distribution, the ITC coverage (% of households using &#x02265;1 ITC) reached 98.4%, with a median of 3 ITC distributed/household.

The local <italic>Aedes</italic> species was susceptible to deltamethrin (mosquito mortality rate of 99.7%) and the residual deltamethrin activity in the ITC was within acceptable levels (mosquito mortality rate of 73.1%) after one year of curtain use. Over the 18 month observation period after ITC distribution, the adjusted HI rate ratio, intervention versus control clusters, was 1.15 (95% CI 0.57 to 2.34).

The agents, four dengue viruses, are primarily transmitted by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and, to a lesser extent, by <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. There is no specific antiviral treatment. Immunization has become technically feasible, but in a phase IIb trial the leading vaccine candidate had an effectiveness of between 80 and 90% in preventing DENV3 and DENV4 cases, and just a partial and no effect on reducing DENV1 and DENV2 cases respectively [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Even when a vaccine becomes available, attaining adequate coverage in endemic regions will take many years [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the meanwhile, vector control remains the only venue for dengue prevention and in the future it will continue to play a crucial role in complementing immunization efforts.</p><p>Currently, for dengue prevention and outbreak mitigation many endemic countries rely on pesticide-based vector control actions that are reactive to the detection of a clinical case or to an epidemic alert. However, the effectiveness of both these strategies is doubtful: the former, applied days after an infection occurs, is directed towards case-houses, which are probably not the major site of transmission [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; the latter is often launched after the peak of epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, pursuing year-round proactive prevention, combining environmental management, larviciding and adulticiding, is costly (up to 24 USD/inhabitant/year) [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and is difficult to sustain and generally not feasible due to the lack of human and financial resources allocated to the routine <italic>Aedes</italic> control programmes [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>A few novel, user-friendly vector control tools such as spinosad [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], lethal ovitraps [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and insecticide treated materials [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have become available over the past decade. Their wider effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is under evaluation. To date, there is evidence that ITC can reduce <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation levels by up to 50%, depending on attained coverage and housing structure [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, these results were obtained in settings with moderate to high vector infestation.</p><p>In Cuba an intensive routine <italic>Aedes</italic> control programme (ACP) has been set up in response to two major dengue epidemics (1977 and 1981) [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The ACP covers all of Cuba and implements a combination of vector control actions, which are intensified when the risk of dengue transmission increases. As a result, <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation levels are substantially lower than in other affected Latin-American countries. Nevertheless, outbreaks do occur, be it sporadically [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. With the aim to prevent these outbreaks, the national control programme is looking for an additional control method that could bring vector densities further down. Insecticide treated curtains (ITC), which showed some promising results in other countries [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], were chosen to be explored in a methodologically sound study in order to provide evidence for policy makers.</p><p>We report here on a cluster randomized controlled trial that evaluated the incremental effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ITC deployment in eastern Cuba, a setting with comprehensive routine <italic>Aedes</italic> control and already low <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Study site</title><p>The ITC trial was conducted in Guantanamo, a city of 244,000 inhabitants that has an average temperature of 32&#x000b0;C and an average rainfall of 610 mm/year, concentrated in two short wet seasons (April-July and September-October). The average monthly municipal House Index (HI; number of houses with at least one water holding container with <italic>Aedes</italic> immature stages per 100 houses inspected) is low. The HI has oscillated between 0.06 and 0.8% throughout 2003&#x02013;2007. Still, Guantanamo was affected by dengue outbreaks in 1981 [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], 2001 [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There has been no evidence of the presence of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> in the urban area (D Montada, personal communication, 2013).</p><p>Although transmission only occurs sporadically, the inhabitants&#x02019; knowledge on dengue and preventive measures is high [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and they are sensitized to the problem. Infestation with <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is patchy and linked to deficient water supply and suboptimal environmental management. Less than one third of houses (all closed structures, hardly no apartments, very few shops) have permanent water supply and storing water in ground level containers, which are often badly covered and/or in bad condition, is a common practice [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The routine ACP, which was intensified during the entire study period in view of a dengue outbreak threat in the eastern part of Cuba, comprises monthly inspection of all premises, temephos application in all useful peri- and intra-domestic water holding containers, elimination of potential household breeding sites with the active participation of the population, complemented with indoor and spatial fogging with cypermethrin every 7&#x02013;22 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>In January 2009, 12 circumscriptions (the most decentralised geopolitical unit, comprising about 500 houses) were selected in the urban area of Guantanamo amongst the ones with the highest infestation level in the previous two years. circumscriptions with a common boundary with an earlier selected one were not eligible for study inclusion, as some spill-over effect of the purported intervention could be hypothesized [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The original study protocol contemplated a latin square design with intensified community participation and ITC deployment as interventions, but during set up community participation was reinforced in the whole municipality of Guantanamo. Therefore, eventually, we randomly allocated the selected circumscriptions to 6 control and 6 intervention clusters, by drawing numbers from a bag. In the control clusters routine ACP activities, as described above, were carried out throughout the study period. In the intervention clusters, the latter were combined with the ITC deployment. The sample size, following Hayes and Bennett [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], permitted to detect a 75% reduction in the HI, with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05, assuming a between-cluster HI variation coefficient of 0.4.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Intervention</title><p>During the month of March 2009, the ACP distributed ITC in all public premises and to households (HH) that had agreed to use them in the 6 intervention clusters. One week before distribution, discussions were held with the inhabitants, which generally perceived that the bedroom and living area were the spaces in the house with most mosquito nuisance and preferred curtains to be hanged there in windows, door openings or on the wall. At that occasion, we also handed out information leaflets and one family member received detailed person-to-person instructions on the use and maintenance of the ITC. The number of curtains distributed (with a maximum of 3) depended on the number of rooms in the house. The ITC were made from PermaNet polyester netting (Vestergaard-Frandsen, Switzerland) treated with a long-lasting formulation of deltamethrin (55mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and coated with a protectant (no details disclosed by the manufacturer) to prevent degradation of the insecticide when exposed to UV light. The manufacturer&#x02019;s website stated&#x02014;at the time of the trial&#x02014;that this material did not require re-treatment and that its insecticidal effect was expected to last for up to 2 years or 6 &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; washes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/permanet-curtain-e-brochure.pdf">http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/permanet-curtain-e-brochure.pdf</ext-link>, accessed 22/05/2008).

Three months after distribution (June 2009), we visited a systematic random sample of 549 HH, observed use of the ITC and explored, with a structured questionnaire, the related perceptions. Continued use of curtains was ascertained during the December 2010 HH visits by routine ACP workers. The number of targeted structures (wall, doors and windows) were not recorded, as these&#x02014;being structures with very different surfaces&#x02014;together with the number of ITC distributed would not provide information on the percentage of surface covered.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>
<italic>Aedes</italic> deltamethrin susceptibility</title><p>Larvae detected in water holding containers in November 2010 routine ACP visits were reared to adults in the entomological laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine &#x0201c;Pedro Kour&#x000ed;&#x0201d; in Havana. Female mosquitoes, 3 to 5 days old and non-blood fed, were screened for deltamethrin susceptibility using the standard WHO tube bioassay protocol [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The <italic>Aedes</italic> Rockefeller strain, a susceptible laboratory strain of Caribbean origin, was used as reference. The bioassays (repeated 4 times) were done with 5 replicates of 25 female mosquitoes per bioassay: 4 replicates exposed to insecticide treated paper and one control replicate exposed to non-treated paper. We calculated the proportion of local <italic>Aedes</italic> strain mosquitoes that died at 24h out of the total number exposed. Tests with more than 20% control mortality, if any, were discarded and repeated. When control mortality ranged between 5% and 20%, the mortality was corrected using Abbot&#x02019;s formula [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Deltamethrin persistency in the ITC</title><p>One year after distribution, we tested deltamethrin persistency and bioavailability in 13 ITC: 2 stored/unpacked new ones and 11 used ones (4 never washed, 7 washed at least once). Tube bioassays were twice carried out at 25 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C and 75 &#x000b1; 10% relative humidity, using ten tubes per curtain following the standard WHO procedure [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Five to six female mosquitoes were introduced into each tube, which remained vertical throughout the bioassay, and exposed to the ITC sample for 3 minutes. We calculated the average mosquito mortality per curtain and within curtain groups (new, used/unwashed, used/washed). Assays on two untreated curtains served as control and if control mosquito mortality was above 5%, the results were discarded and the assays repeated.</p><p>The national pesticide analytical laboratory (Instituto de investigaciones de Sanidad vegetal, Havana) determined the deltamethrin concentration in five ITC using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), following standardized procedures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cipac.org/document/prepublished_methods/CIPAC_333_extension_DM%20in%20PE%20netting_090526.pdf">http://www.cipac.org/document/prepublished_methods/CIPAC_333_extension_DM%20in%20PE%20netting_090526.pdf</ext-link>). Five ITC were purposively selected&#x02014;one new and 4 used ones having <italic>Aedes</italic> mortality results in the tube assay of &#x0003e; 95% (1), between 60&#x02013;70% (2) and &#x0003c; 10% (1)-, and tested. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between bioassay <italic>Aedes</italic> mortality rates and HPLC results of the selected 5 ITC.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Entomological impact</title><p>The routine ACP conducts once a month entomological surveys in all dwellings of the municipality. Its records combine the observations of the vector control workers, who inspect 100% of the houses, and of quality control inspectors, who re-visit a systematic sample of 33% of the houses. In the month of distribution, and the month before and after distribution, quality control inspectors re-visited 100% of the houses in the intervention and control clusters. For all immature stages found, species was identified. We extracted from the routine ACP records, for Guantanamo municipality as a whole and for each study cluster, information on the number of houses inspected monthly, the number of positive containers and the number of houses with at least one container positive for immature <italic>Aedes</italic> stages in the period April 2008&#x02014;September 2010 (i.e. 12 months before and 18 months after ITC distribution).</p><p>
<italic>Aedes</italic> infestation levels were the primary trial outcome. We calculated House Indices (HI) and Breteau Indices (BI) per study cluster per month. We analysed the intervention effect over the 12 and 18 month period starting from April 2009, the month of the first house inspection cycle after ITC distribution. For descriptive purposes, we graphed the average monthly HI per trimester (with 95% CI) for each study trial arm and for the municipality of Guantanamo. To evaluate the effect of the intervention, we constructed generalized linear random effect regression models with a negative binomial link function. We evaluated the period effect (pre- and post-intervention) and the trial arm effect (intervention or control clusters) on the monthly study cluster level HI and BI. This model takes into account the nature of the data (repeated measurements in each cluster) and allows for the assessment of a possible interaction between period and trial arm effect, which captures the effect of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Cost evaluation</title><p>We collected the costs of the routine ACP activities and of ITC implementation in 2009, taking the point of view of the routine ACP. Data on resource utilization and expenditures were extracted from bookkeeping records and activity registers of the routine ACP and from the expenditure accounts of the ITC deployment study.

Dengue is not endemic in Cuba, but occurs in small, localized outbreaks years apart [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and we could not evaluate the effectiveness of ITC deployment on disease transmission. Instead, we used <italic>Aedes</italic> immature stage infestation levels, also because monitoring adult <italic>Aedes</italic> populations has low reproducibility [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is, however, a relative weakness that our study relies on entomological data collected through the routine surveillance system. Apart from limited overall non-differential underreporting [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we cannot exclude that the vector control workers&#x02014;keen to appraise the effect&#x02014;may have somehow intensified the search for breeding sites in the intervention and control clusters. On the other hand, we obtained, monthly repeated measurements, which are seldom collected but permit adjusting for small scale temporal variability in the analysis.</p><p>The insecticide persistence in the ITC is in line with earlier reports [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, curtain uptake and use were high and sustained, in contrast to more modest coverages and rapid declines in previous effectiveness trials in Venezuela and Thailand [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We hypothesized that engaging the community increases the acceptance of a control tool [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and enhances sustainability [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. One week before ITC distribution, all households received a visit to discuss the intervention and to negotiate where and how to hang the curtains. Each HH also received an information leaflet where the use, advantages and side effects of ITC were made explicit. At the same time, sustained high coverage might also be explained by the perception in more than half of the users that curtains reduce the mosquito nuisance, by the awareness of an increasing threat of local dengue transmission and by the monthly routine house inspections of the vector control workers.</p><p>Our main findings also contrast with these studies that demonstrated 50% and 68% reductions of entomological indices when 50% and 70% of HH use an ITC, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the context of the present trial is different. Firstly, the vector infestation levels are lower in Guantanamo than in the areas where the tools were previously tested [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and than in most dengue endemic regions. For that matter, Guantanamo represent the most challenging scenario for layered intervention impact.</p><p>Three ITC per HH, a likewise average coverage as in other ITC-trials [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119373.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], also might just not be sufficient to impact on vector densities because of a too low probability of mosquito insecticide contact. Secondly, the effect of introducing an additional control tool will depend on the interventions already in place. In Guantanamo, such &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; actions were already intensively combined in the routine control programme and we evaluated the additional effect of ITC implemented on top of the existing activities. The effectiveness of concomitant interventions directed at adult vector stages and implemented in a prospective and controlled way has not been studied yet in dengue control and hardly in vector borne diseases in general. For malaria however, no significant benefit was observed when adding indoor residual spraying to insecticide treated material (bed net) deployment, two malaria control methods that are effective when used in separation [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119373.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Little or no effect of ITC on dengue vectors has been observed in 3 other studies, conducted in other settings with fewer and far less intensive routine activities, with other hypotheses offered as explanation. In Southern Thailand, an open housing structure was seen as the main reason [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Venezuela and Mexico [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], a &#x02018;spill-over&#x02019; effect from the ITC intervention clusters to the adjacent control clusters was presumed. In Guatemala, additional actions targeting the main breeding sites in the intervention arm only, confounded the results 31]. Neither of these can explain our findings, as the housing structure in Guantanamo is closed, the intervention and control clusters were separated by at least one house block and the routine ACP applied the same control measures, with universal coverage, in the intervention and control clusters.</p><p>The non-annualized cost of 7.6 US$ per household covered of ITC implementation in our study (3.8 US$ when annualized) is comparable to 6.9 US$ estimated in a similar study in Venezuela [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but the prices of the cost items were somewhat different. A study in Guatemala [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] estimated the costs of distributing ITC and a few insecticide treated drum covers, combined with treating the most productive container types with temephos, at 5.3 US$ per HH. The cost of ITC itself was not included in this estimate, nor reported. However, curtains are expensive and made up, in Guantanamo, 74.3% (5.6 US$) of the total cost per HH of the intervention. At any rate, the incremental expenditure is high, even in relative terms for an already intensive control programme. Also, in settings, where the investment per household by the routine vector control programme is still rather modest, as in most dengue endemic countries, ITC implementation is not a plausible, financially attractive option from programme managers perspective and probably also not an efficient one [<xref rid="pone.0119373.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In view of the lack of marginal effectiveness, ITC deployment on top of an intensive vector control programme is obviously not cost-effective.</p><p>Studies like the present one undoubtedly support selecting cost-effective strategies in dengue control programmes and facilitate policy making at the local level. However, the question remains how to further reduce <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation and dengue transmission at global level. Future research will have to address the effectiveness of new tools for adulticiding, including ITC, in an array of contrasting environments. Most importantly empirical studies should sort out where&#x02014;context&#x02014;and when&#x02014;timing&#x02014;and how&#x02014;targeted at high risk areas or with a blanket approach&#x02014;existing and new dengue control tools can be most efficiently combined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119373.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119373.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119373.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119373.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the health sector staff involved in the dengue prevention and control activities, the people of Guantanamo who participated in the study, and Kristien Janssens and Yoandra Abad who cleaned and prepared the databases.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0119373.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
