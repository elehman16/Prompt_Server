In addition, this inhibitory action can induce mild osmotic diuresis and increase urinary excretion of glucose with modest caloric elimination leading to weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and in combination with metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), sulfonylurea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), or insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), but not yet with a thiazolidinedione.</p><p>Some patients with type 2 diabetes use pioglitazone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which lowers glucose by altering gene transcription enhancing insulin sensitivity. However, safety concerns of fluid retention, weight gain, congestive heart failure, bone fractures, and, more recently, concerns about bladder cancer has limited its use as second line therapy when metformin is not tolerated or as triple oral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The safety hypothesis for a trial combining pioglitazone with dapagliflozin would not be anticipated to worsen the pioglitazone-related side effects and, because dapagliflozin causes glucosuria, which drives diuresis and caloric loss, it may mitigate the concerns of weight gain and fluid retention/edema. This is the first clinical study to examine additive effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor administered in combination with pioglitazone.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week study with a subsequent 24-week extension enrolled male and female patients with type 2 diabetes between 29 July 2008 and 4 July 2009. The study took place at 105 sites in Argentina, Canada, India, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Taiwan, and United States and was completed on 15 June 2010. Institutional review boards or independent ethics committees approved this protocol, and each patient provided written informed consent.</p><p>Patients &#x02265;18 years old having fasting C-peptide &#x02265;1.0 ng/mL and BMI &#x02264;45.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> entered group A or B. Group A patients had received &#x02265;12 weeks of pioglitazone 30 or 45 mg/day and had HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7.0 and &#x02264;10.5%. Group B patients were drug naive for the previous 10 weeks with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8.0 and &#x02264;11.0% or had received pioglitazone 15 mg/day or any dose of rosiglitazone with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8.0 and &#x02264;11.0% or had received &#x02265;8 weeks of metformin &#x02264;1700 mg/day or sulfonylurea less than or equal to half the maximal dose with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7.0 and &#x02264;11.0%. Group B patients could not be on &#x0003e;1 oral antidiabetic medication, and patients on more than half the maximum dose of sulfonylurea or metformin were excluded. Group B patients underwent a 10-week dose-optimization period in which their initial therapy was discontinued, and pioglitazone 30 mg/day was started and increased to 45 mg/day if possible. Group B patients were discontinued if their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was &#x0003e;270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) after 3 weeks or after 6 weeks with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0 or &#x0003e;11.0%.

Randomized patients received double-blind dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg or placebo every day (oral administration) with open-label pioglitazone 30 or 45 mg/day, stratified by pre-enrollment diabetes treatment group A and B. To ensure adequate representation from group A, randomization was set to recruit at least one-third of the patients from this group.</p><p>The primary objective compared the change at 24 weeks from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with each dose of dapagliflozin plus pioglitazone versus placebo plus pioglitazone. Secondary objectives included change from baseline in FPG, postprandial glucose (PPG) measured by 120-min postchallenge response to an oral glucose tolerance test, and total body weight.</p><p>If FPG was &#x0003e;270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) (week 4&#x02013;8), &#x0003e;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) (week 8&#x02013;12), or &#x0003e;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) (week 12&#x02013;24), then patients were eligible to receive open-label rescue medication (metformin or sulfonylurea). Patients completing the first 24 weeks of the study were eligible for an additional 24 weeks. During weeks 24 to 48, if HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x0003e;8.0 (week 25&#x02013;36) or &#x0003e;7.5% (week 36&#x02013;47), patients were eligible to receive open-label rescue medication. Data obtained after rescue were excluded from the efficacy analysis but included in safety analysis.</p><p>Adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and vital signs were assessed for the safety and tolerability of treatment.

Signs, symptoms, and events suggestive of urinary tract infection (UTI) and genital infection were solicited at every visit. Preferred term lists included a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms of UTIs and genital infections in addition to specific diagnoses. Seated blood pressure was determined after 5 min of rest followed by the orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Average blood pressure was determined from three replicate measurements taken at least 1 min apart in each position (seated, supine, and standing).</p><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses at week 24 (last observation carried forward) including changes from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, PPG, and body weight were performed using ANCOVA with treatment group as an effect and baseline value and strata based on pre-enrollment antidiabetic therapy as covariates in the model. Secondary end points were tested for significance sequentially.</p><p>At week 48, analyses of change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, PPG, and body weight were performed using longitudinal repeated-measures analysis over time including the fixed categorical effects of strata based on pre-enrollment antidiabetic therapy, treatment, week, and treatment-by-week interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement and baseline measurement-by-week interaction.

Dapagliflozin acts in the kidney by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and is not only capable of reducing FPG but also reabsorption of higher glucose load postprandially as shown in this study. These beneficial effects of dapagliflozin on hyperglycemia were maintained for almost 1 year and were consistent with sustained pharmacodynamic activity on glycosuria.</p><p>The glucosuria induced by SGLT-2 inhibition might be suspected to lead to hypoglycemia, UTIs, and genital infections. However, hypoglycemia events were rare in this study. No clear relationship to dapagliflozin was observed for events suggestive of UTIs, although one patient withdrew from the trial due to recurring UTIs. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), events suggestive of genital infections were higher in patients on dapagliflozin than on placebo. None of these genital infections were serious, and all responded to antimicrobial treatment.</p><p>Urinary excretion of glucose also leads to caloric loss and the addition of dapagliflozin to pioglitazone can potentially mitigate weight gain due to pioglitazone. The differences between placebo and dapagliflozin-treated groups in weight were mainly driven by continuous weight gain in the placebo group, reflecting probably that pioglitazone was initiated or optimized during the prerandomization period, whereas no meaningful changes from baseline occurred in dapagliflozin groups. Dapagliflozin, acting as a mild diuretic, may also mitigate the fluid retaining effects of pioglitazone as evidenced by fewer reports of edema.</p><p>Some studies suggest that pioglitazone may modestly lower blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), a beneficial effect for patients with diabetes. When dapagliflozin was used as monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or in combination therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), there was also some suggestive mild lowering of blood pressure. In this study, addition of dapagliflozin to pioglitazone was associated with a modest further decrease in blood pressure beyond the effect of pioglitazone alone in the absence of any ill effects such as hypotensive events or measured orthostatic hypotension. Thus, along with effects on weight, dapagliflozin may add to the blood pressure benefit of pioglitazone.</p><p>Congestive heart failure, bladder cancer, or bone fractures, known side effects of long-term use of pioglitazone, were rare events; too rare at this stage to infer any effect on the risk of these events with the addition of dapagliflozin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Two fractures did occur in the dapagliflozin 5-mg group, but all patients received pioglitazone, and thiazolidinediones are known to increase the risk of fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Dapagliflozin added on to pioglitazone resulted in sustained glycemic benefits in both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. As a possible mild diuretic and consistent glucouretic, dapagliflozin mitigated the weight gain and fluid retention due to pioglitazone. Even though more genital infections occurred with dapagliflozin than placebo, dapagliflozin added on to pioglitazone was effective and well-tolerated. The direct removal of glucose by dapagliflozin complements the insulin-sensitizing action of pioglitazone, providing a potential combination that balances well the benefits and risks of therapy for some patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
