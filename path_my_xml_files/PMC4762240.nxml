To improve nutritional support in hospitals, standardised routine nutritional screening is essential. The Graz Malnutrition Screening (GMS) tool was developed for the purpose of malnutrition risk screening in a large hospital setting involving different departments. It was the aim of the present study to validate the GMS against Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) and Mini Nutritional Assessment-short form (MNA-sf) in a randomised blinded manner. A total of 404 randomly selected patients admitted to the internal, surgical and orthopaedic wards of the University Hospital Graz were screened in a blinded manner by different raters. Concurrent validity was determined by comparing the GMS with the NRS and in older patients (70+ years) with the MNA-sf additionally. According to GMS, 31&#x000b7;9 or 28&#x000b7;5 % of the admitted patients were categorised as at &#x02018;risk of malnutrition&#x02019; (depending on the rater). According to the reference standard of NRS, 24&#x000b7;5 % of the patients suffered from malnutrition. Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic> values of 0&#x000b7;78 compared with the NRS and 0&#x000b7;84 compared with the MNA showed strong positive correlations.

<sup>)</sup>. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) defines malnutrition as a state of nutrition in which a deficiency or excess (or imbalance) of energy, protein and other nutrients causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/body form (body shape, size and composition) and function, as well as clinical outcome<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The American Society on Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) broadens the approach. According to the ASPEN guideline, malnutrition is defined as &#x02018;an acute, sub-acute or chronic state of nutrition, in which varying degrees of over-nutrition or under-nutrition with or without inflammatory activity have led to a change in body composition and diminished function&#x02019;<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The goal of nutritional screening is to identify any specific nutrition risk(s). Indeed, the above-mentioned definitions are consistent with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organisation&#x02019;s interpretation of a &#x02018;screen&#x02019; as an instrument used to determine whether additional information (from an assessment) is required to warrant an intervention<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. An International Consensus Guideline Committee has proposed an approach to diagnosing malnutrition in adults based on aetiology, thus integrating the present understanding of inflammatory responses to disease and trauma<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. However, guidelines cannot account for every variation in circumstances. Hospitals therefore must always exercise professional judgement and look for applications feasible for their needs, based on internationally agreed core components within the definition of malnutrition. One of the major challenges in hospital-care settings is insufficient knowledge and low commitment among nurses and physicians regarding the topic of malnutrition, which results in an insufficient focus on nutritional aspects of care<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Medical University of Graz (MUG) comprises forty clinical and non-clinical institutions. It is closely associated with the General Hospital Graz, which is among the largest hospitals in Europe and is a top-quality institution offering all fields of human medicine. The University Hospital Graz currently accommodates all medical disciplines within seventy organisational units and 1578 acute-care beds. Approximately 385 000 patients are being treated in the clinics annually. As for the specialty of internal medicine, approximately 70 % of the patients admitted to the wards are older than 65 years. In admitted patients older than 75 years, the sex ratio of female:male is approximately 2:1 with a further increasing tendency towards women with increasing age.</p><p>It became essential to establish a malnutrition risk screening tool that addresses internationally recommended quality standards, is easy to handle in daily routine practice and that is highly sensitive in detection of individual malnutrition risk independent of sex, age or diagnosis at admission. Since 1997, a multi-disciplinary nutrition team, comprised of dietitians, medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses and staff from the local hospital management, stepped forward to implement a risk screening tool into the locally established hospital information technology (IT) platform (MEDOCS&#x02122;) to improve compliance of healthcare professionals towards malnutrition risk screening on a routine basis. This screening instrument was primarily based on the tool of subjective global assessment (SGA), which initially had been dedicated and validated for surgical patients<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. However, to address special needs of a big university hospital, the screening tool had to be adapted according to patients&#x02019; characteristics in the local setting. In terms of novelty, this malnutrition risk screening tool is based on electronic documentation and may be connected to any hospital IT platform. The Graz Malnutrition Screening (GMS) also has other advantages compared with currently available malnutrition risk screening tools. It has high user-friendliness and involves dietitians in an automated manner if malnutrition risk is detected in a patient who had been screened by the staff on the wards. GMS therefore assures the multi-professional approach and quality control. Using the GMS, we implemented effective governance via the establishment of a multi-disciplinary nutrition steering committee at each facility with representation from medical, food services, nursing, dietetic, pharmacy and speech pathology staff.</p><p>It was the aim of the current study to validate the GMS in a blinded randomised controlled trial against the gold standard of malnutrition risk screening in hospitals recommended by ESPEN, the Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) tool<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. It seems noteworthy that aged patients account for a large number of admissions at our university hospital. On the basis of recently developed knowledge regarding age as an independent risk factor for malnutrition and given local hospital challenges of acute medical care, it was decided that age &#x0003e;65 years is handled as an &#x02018;independent risk factor&#x02019; in the screening tool accounting for 1 point on the scoring scale. The risk screening tool is designed so that a score of 3 or more signifies &#x02018;risk of malnutrition&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). All data collected during screening are stored within the electronic medical patient record. In the case of a positive screening, the patient record is forwarded to the dietitian. In accordance with legal regulation and local standard operating procedures, the dietitian is then integrated into the individual care process. If diagnosis of malnutrition is confirmed by consecutive assessments, the diagnosis &#x02018;malnutrition&#x02019; (International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10, code: E46) is automatically transferred to the patient&#x02019;s electronic record.<fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Graz Malnutrition Screening (GMS) risk translated into English language. Items 1&#x02013;3 are obtained from nursing staff. Item 4, which includes rating of disease, is completed by physicians. A total score of more than 3 points indicates &#x02018;risk of malnutrition&#x02019;. Information is gathered in the hospital software. In terms of positive screening, information is transferred to dietitians and assessment is performed and clinical nutritional intervention is started whenever indicated.

Only patients able to provide informed consent were eligible for recruitment. Potential candidates for study participation were approached by the study team in a compliance talk and were also additionally provided written information. Patients confirmed their participation by signing an informed consent document. In the case where patients could not be met by the team &#x02013; for example, due to procedures taken or length of stay &#x02013; the electronic randomising programme provided substitute patients within the same age range.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="general"><title>Data collection</title><p>For measuring height to the nearest 0&#x000b7;5 cm, a stadiometer (Seca 206 Bodymeter&#x02122;; SECA GmbH &#x00026; Co.) fixed to the wall was used. Weight was measured to the nearest 0&#x000b7;1 kg using ward- or clinic-based medical, calibrated scales. The percentage of weight loss in the last 3 months and nutritional intake were documented from the patient&#x02019;s history routinely. Acute and chronic diseases were scored and documented by physicians at the ward. To determine inter-rater reliability of the GMS, patients were screened by two dietitians in a blinded and independent manner. Within 4-h, both raters visited the same patient and conducted the GMS. For measuring concurrent validity of the GMS, the NRS was used as a gold standard.

<sup>)</sup>, thirty-three million people are at risk of under-nutrition in Europe. Furthermore, a quarter of patients in hospitals are at risk of under-nutrition or are already malnourished<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. Under-nutrition has negative effects on treatment outcomes by increasing morbidity and mortality<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>37</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Nutritional care starts with systematic screening to identify &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; patients and nutritional assessment and intervention planning to ensure that adequate nutritional support is provided at the right time. This approach is also reflected in a recently launched publication by the Action Group A3 of the European Partnership on Active and Healthy Aging of the European Commission<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>38</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The nutritional impairment identified by screening should therefore be relevant to objectives and outcomes individually determined, and interventions may vary according to individual assessment and care planning &#x02013; for example, age or type of illness. In hospitals, special focus has to be given to acute and chronic illnesses, anthropometry, nutritional habits and history as well as individual therapeutic goals<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>39</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The usefulness of malnutrition risk screening tools can be evaluated by a number of criteria. First, efficacy of a screening tool is of major importance. A hospital-based malnutrition risk screening tool should incorporate basic structural elements recommended by international scientific societies. ESPEN recommends four different variables to be included in a hospital nutrition screening tool<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>40</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>: anthropometric parameters, recent weight loss, individual food intake and its history and disease process and nutritional needs. The GMS tool addresses all the items recommended within the ESPEN Guideline for use in hospitals. Furthermore, the GMS was developed according to long-standing experience and local needs. Its novelty stems from the fact that it is very user-friendly and that it can be incorporated into any hospital IT platform, and therefore electronic patient record. It involves dietitians in an automated manner if malnutrition risk is detected in a patient screened by the staff on the wards. GMS therefore assures the multi-professional approach and quality control.</p><p>To address the screening tool&#x02019;s statistical efficacy in terms of validity and sensitivity, 404 age-matched patients admitted to the internal medicine, orthopaedic or general surgery ward of the Graz University Hospital were screened in a blinded, randomised manner using the GMS, the NRS and the MNA-sf, respectively. Referring to the validation data of the screening tools used in terms of &#x02018;gold standards&#x02019;, one can state that the GMS tool is at least as sensitive in detecting an individual&#x02019;s risk of malnutrition in patients admitted to an internal, surgical or orthopaedic ward. The results of this study indicate a high validity of GMS compared with malnutrition screening tools recommended for hospital use (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic> values of 0&#x000b7;78 according to the NRS and even higher, 0&#x000b7;84 compared with the MNA-sf).</p><p>In patients older than 70 years, the detection rate for risk of malnutrition using the GMS was quite comparable with results obtained using the NRS. This provides evidence for good criterion-related validity. Furthermore, accuracy of the GMS and NRS was 0&#x000b7;88, whereas accuracy value of the GMS and MNA-sf was 0&#x000b7;85. This indicates that there is a very high agreement between the GMS and these pre-existing validated nutritional screening tools. These findings are quite promising as several groups showed a rather fair agreement between MNA-sf and other screening tools such as the SGA in different cohorts<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>40</sup>
</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Modification of SGA to distinct patient profiles in a large university hospital, specifically introducing &#x02018;age&#x02019; as an independent risk factor, seems to raise the sensitivity of the GMS tool. Originally, the GMS had been designed for a general screening of all patients admitted to various hospital departments and wards. The sensitivity of the GMS tool seems to be comparable with the NRS, independent of patient age. According to data in our study, MNA-sf seemed to &#x02018;overestimate&#x02019; risk of malnutrition when compared with NRS and GMS (independent of ward of admission and diseases). Young <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>43</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> argue in their publication that MNA-sf was designed to identify patients requiring further assessment with the MNA-long version, and highlighted the rather &#x02018;poor performance&#x02019; of MNA-sf compared with SGA, pointing towards the different objectives of the MNA-sf and the SGA in that publication. This argument may also count for the comparison of the MNA-sf with the GMS in older patients in our study. However, differences in sensitivity between test systems did not reach the level of significance, at least in our study. Issues arising from this repetitive data from MNA-sf clearly include the question of feasibility of MNA-sf for the acute-care setting. Positive test scores for malnutrition risk screening highlight the need for further assessment of patients detected at risk. Although the MNA-sf was accurate, it identified a larger number of at-risk patients, as also reported by Raslan <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>44</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, and therefore should be chosen only where healthcare services have sufficient resources to provide nutritional assessment and intervention programmes for all patients detected to be &#x02018;at risk for malnutrition&#x02019;. Similar arguments were also made by other authors<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>42</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Hospital management and clinicians should consider use of screening tools that are simple to implement and handle and tailor the screening and nutritional care process according to structures and resources available. Considered from these points of view, the GMS is a valid and easy-to-handle malnutrition risk screening tool, which may also be implemented in hospital IT systems.</p><p>Another factor influencing the efficacy of a screening test system is the reliability of the screening tool. In our study, we observed nearly &#x02018;perfect&#x02019; results regarding equivalence and reliability of the GMS when compared with NRS and MNA-sf. Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> values for the single items of the GMS ranged from 0&#x000b7;6 to 1&#x000b7;0, whereas the value of the total GMS scale was 0&#x000b7;82, which may be considered a highly sufficient reliability indicator for the test. Some items of the GMS scale showed higher inter-rater agreement values than others. Three items including BMI, severity of disease and age reached agreement of 1&#x000b7;0. These items are very &#x02018;objective&#x02019; items, which vary only marginally or not at all as in the present sample. The measures of weight and height were performed in close time schedules between two raters. Data concerning changes in nutritional intake through loss of appetite, problems with chewing or swallowing or nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea were collected through interviewing patients. These subjective questions resulted in lower <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> values from 0&#x000b7;60 to 0&#x000b7;63, which still reflects high agreement between the two raters. The blinded and randomised design of our study, including the activities of the various dietitians who carried out the interviews with the patients in the cohort of the GMS, underscores the effectiveness in terms of validity and reliability of the GMS as a malnutrition risk screening tool for daily practice in a large university hospital.</p><p>When introducing new tools into clinical practice, one also considers factors influencing effectiveness of test systems. It has been demonstrated long ago that awareness regarding malnutrition among hospital staff is rather low<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>44</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Up until now, these attitudes have not changed significantly. One reason for low acceptance of screening tools by professionals is lack of time. Nutritional screening is often seen as a time-consuming procedure with few consequences in a busy hospital. As effects of nutritional interventions are often not assessable during short periods of admission to acute care, NRS may be easily neglected. On the basis of the experience gained from several studies<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>45</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>46</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, there seems to be a scarcity of nutritional knowledge among hospital staff and a lack of dietitians who are routinely present at the wards. It is therefore essential to develop a malnutrition risk screening tool with high accuracy in the prediction of individual malnutrition risk that is also easy to handle, and may therefore be accepted by most of the hospital staff. It must be easy to integrate into locally pre-defined work flows of the various hospital departments and must link dietitians into the patient-care process to optimise translation of information between different medical and healthcare professions working in the hospital setting. The GMS addresses all these requirements and is today well accepted by hospital staff as can be seen by the high professional fulfilment of the staff in routine day-to-day patient record keeping.</p><p>Using the current test setting, we could show prevalence for the risk of malnutrition in patients admitted to our university hospital, which is comparable with recent publications. An overall prevalence rate of about 30 % according to the GMS and 25 % according to the NRS goes along with previous clinical studies on prevalence of malnutrition in hospital inpatients. Higher prevalence rates in internal wards are also described in a range of publications as well as the fact that prevalence of malnutrition increases with age<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In our sample, malnutrition risk prevalence according to GMS was highest in age-group three (70+ years) with 41&#x02013;45 % at risk compared with 26&#x02013;29 % in age group two (45&#x02013;70 years) and 19&#x02013;22 % in age-group one (18&#x02013;44 years). These data underline the importance of hospital risk screening tools for addressing malnutrition and the need to close inter-professional &#x02018;gaps&#x02019; in the treatment plan and options in the acute-care setting. As a malnutrition screening tool refers only to the detection of &#x02018;risk of malnutrition&#x02019; in patients admitted to the hospital, there is a great need for subsequent assessment and treatment. The use of risk screening alone does not necessarily result in improved outcomes unless there is a care pathway for malnourished patients or patients being at risk of malnutrition<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>47</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. For this reason, the Nutrition Team of the University Hospital Graz developed an associated clinical pathway to standardise nutritional care in malnourished patients. In this concept, electronic data of patients screened positive for risk of malnutrition are transferred to a dietitian through the computer system. The set-up and implementation system chosen for risk screening strongly influence acceptance by healthcare professionals. Nowadays, nurses and doctors are accustomed to documenting their work electronically. A screening tool that is efficiently implemented into the hospital IT platform, and therefore individual care plan, will raise the acceptance of hospital staff as compared with the pencil and paper format<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It is therefore reasonable to expect that GMS will increase awareness of medical staff towards the challenge of malnutrition in hospitalised patients. Further studies will provide proof on that concept.</p><p>In conclusion, the GMS tool proves to be a valid and reliable instrument to detect risk of malnutrition in adult inpatients in acute-care hospitals. The GMS is easy to handle and provides reliable individual and overall results. GMS may be embedded in the hospital IT platform, and therefore provides short clinical pathways between different professions involved in the care process.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the local hospital management, in person of Sigrid Strasser-Fuchs MD and the dietitians who actively contributed to data collection during their routine work at the wards.
