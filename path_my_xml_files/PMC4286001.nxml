This single-centre, single-dose, randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of a single oral dose of ponatinib (45-mg tablet) under fasting conditions and following consumption of high- and low-fat meals by healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the six possible treatment sequences, each evaluating three ponatinib 45-mg treatments: administered under fasting conditions; administered after a high-fat meal; or administered after a standardized low-fat meal. The high-fat meal derived approximately 50% of its total caloric content from fat, with approximately 150, 250 and 500&#x02013;600 calories derived from protein, carbohydrates and fat, respectively (total of approximately 900&#x02013;1000 calories). The standardized low-fat meal derived no more than 20% of total caloric content from fat, with approximately 56, 428 and 63 calories derived from protein, carbohydrates and fat, respectively (total of approximately 547 calories). During each of the three treatment periods, blood samples were collected predose and at 13 time points over the 96-h post-dose interval. Plasma concentrations of ponatinib were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Mixed-model analyses of variance (<sc>anova</sc>) were performed on natural log-transformed PK parameters <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Geometric mean maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) values for the fasted, low-fat and high-fat regimens were 54&#x000b7;7, 51&#x000b7;6 and 51&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively. Geometric mean area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>) values for the fasted, low-fat and high-fat regimens were 1273, 1244 and 1392&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively. All limits of the 90% CIs of the estimated geometric mean ratios for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and all AUC comparisons fell within the 80%&#x02013;125% margins.

Soon after the advent of the BCR-ABL TKI imatinib, it became evident that Philadelphia chromosome&#x02013;positive cells could evolve to evade inhibition. Mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL that impede effective inhibitor binding are the primary mechanisms of resistance to currently available agents including imatinib (Novartis, East Hanover, NJ, USA), nilotinib (Novartis), dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA) and bosutinib (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA). In particular, the T315I gatekeeper mutant &#x02013; the most commonly observed point mutation in clinical practice &#x02013; confers universal resistance to these agents.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> At present, the only TKI that is effective in patients with the T315I mutation is ponatinib (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA).<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Ponatinib is a novel, synthetic, orally active, potent pan&#x02013;BCR-ABL inhibitor and multi-targeted TKI that was discovered using a computational and structure-based drug design approach.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Ponatinib was specifically designed to inhibit native BCR-ABL and mutant forms that can arise during treatment with other TKIs and cause resistance, including the T315I gatekeeper mutant. Based on results of phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in patients with CML and Philadelphia chromosome&#x02013;positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph<sup>+</sup> ALL),<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> ponatinib 45&#x000a0;mg once daily received accelerated approval in the United States for the treatment of patients with CML and Ph+ ALL who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have diverse characteristics regarding absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. In the phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, patients were instructed to take an oral dose of ponatinib with water approximately 2&#x000a0;h after a light meal and to not eat or drink anything other than water for 2&#x000a0;h after taking ponatinib. In the absence of data supporting a lack of food effect during the early clinical development of ponatinib, it was decided to dose patients under fasting conditions to ensure that food did not have an impact on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the drug. However, the impact of co-administration with food requires more detailed evaluation. This study was conducted to evaluate the PK of the tablet formulation of ponatinib after consumption of high- and low-fat meals in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Subject selection and study design</title><p>This was a single-centre, single-dose, randomized, open-label, three-period, six-sequence crossover study conducted in healthy subjects in accordance with Food and Drug Administration guidelines for the assessment of food effects. The study was designed to enrol 24 male or female (of non-childbearing potential) subjects to ensure completion of at least 21 subjects. Subjects were included if they were between 18 and 55&#x000a0;years of age and in good health, as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) results and laboratory tests conducted at screening. Each subject was required to have a body mass index (BMI) of 18&#x000b7;0&#x02013;33&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a minimum weight of 50&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;kg at screening. Subjects were required to abstain from using prescription, investigational, over-the-counter or recreational drugs during the study until after the final follow-up visit. Subjects with a history or presence of clinically significant illnesses; surgical or medical conditions that could have interfered with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug; an acute disease state; or who reported use of over-the-counter drugs within 72&#x000a0;h before the first study drug administration or investigational or prescription drugs within 30&#x000a0;days of the first study drug administration were excluded. Also excluded were subjects with self-reported drug or alcohol abuse within 1&#x000a0;year of first drug administration; positive breath alcohol test at screening or at admission to any treatment period; clinically important drug allergies; positive serological findings for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV antibodies; or who had recently donated or lost a clinically significant amount of blood.</p><p>All subjects provided signed informed consent. The protocol, the subject information and consent form, and other relevant study documentation were approved by Institutional Review Board Services Ontario prior to initiation of the study. The study was performed in accordance with the requirements of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki in its revised edition, the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for current Good Clinical Practice and the demands of national drug and data protection laws and other applicable regulatory requirements.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment administration</title><p>Ponatinib is a film-coated tablet with an immediate-release formulation. The effects of food on the PK of ponatinib were tested under three conditions: (A) a single dose of ponatinib 45&#x000a0;mg, administered under fasting conditions; (B) a single dose of ponatinib 45&#x000a0;mg, administered after completion of the Food and Drug Administration&#x02013;recommended high-fat meal; and (C) a single dose of ponatinib 45&#x000a0;mg, administered after completion of a standardized low-fat meal. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the six possible treatment sequences. In the fasted condition, subjects were administered the study drug with approximately 240&#x000a0;mL of water. No food was allowed for at least 10&#x000a0;h predose and at least 4&#x000a0;h post-dose; water was allowed as desired except for 1&#x000a0;h before and after drug administration. In the fed condition, subjects started the test meal 30&#x000a0;min before administration of the study drug. No additional food was allowed for at least 4&#x000a0;h post-dose; water was allowed as desired except for 1&#x000a0;h before and after drug administration. The high-fat meal derived 50% of its total caloric content from fat, with approximately 150, 250 and 500&#x02013;600 calories derived from protein, carbohydrates and fat, respectively (total of approximately 900&#x02013;1000 calories). The high-fat meal consisted of 240&#x000a0;mL of whole milk, two slices of toasted white bread, 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;6&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;g of butter (6&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;g for each toast and 6&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;g to fry two eggs), two fried eggs (scrambled), two hash browns (two ounces each) and two strips of bacon. The standardized low-fat meal derived no more than 20% of total caloric content of the meal from fat, with approximately 56, 428 and 63 calories derived from protein, carbohydrates and fat, respectively (total of approximately 547 calories). The low-fat meal consisted of 175&#x000a0;g of fat-free vanilla yogurt, one medium banana (18&#x02013;20&#x000a0;cm), 125&#x000a0;mL of apple juice, one teaspoon of margarine, 15&#x000a0;mL of honey and two slices of toasted whole-wheat bread.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample collection and assessments</title><p>During each of the three treatment periods, 4-mL blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at 0&#x000b7;5, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96&#x000a0;h. Blood samples were collected by venepuncture or optional indwelling catheter into K2&#x02013;ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes and processed according to the clinical research site's study-specific procedures. All samples were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma ponatinib analyses</title><p>Concentrations of ponatinib were determined in plasma by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Calibration standards (nine samples, covering the range 0&#x000b7;5&#x02013;250&#x000a0;ng/mL) and quality control (QC) standards (four samples, covering the range 0&#x000b7;5&#x02013;200&#x000a0;ng/mL) were prepared by spiking ponatinib solutions of known concentrations into blank human plasma. Aliquots (0&#x000b7;15&#x000a0;mL) of study plasma samples, calibrations standards, QC standards and control blanks were transferred to individual wells of a 96-well block. A 0&#x000b7;05-mL solution containing deuterated internal standards (IS, D<sub>3</sub>-ponatinib) was added to the plasma samples, followed by addition of 0&#x000b7;4&#x000a0;mL of 10&#x000a0;m<sc>m</sc> ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7&#x000b7;0. The samples were mixed thoroughly and centrifuged. The supernatants (0&#x000b7;6&#x000a0;mL) were passed through a preconditioned solid-phase extraction tube (Isolute, 100&#x000a0;mg; Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). The tubes were washed with methanol, and the analytes were eluted into another 96-well block using 0&#x000b7;4&#x000a0;mL of 98/2 methanol/formic acid solution. The eluates were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted with 0&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;mL of a reconstitution solution (50&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;50 methanol/1000&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;10 water/1&#x000a0;<sc>m</sc> ammonium bicarbonate, pH 10). The final extracts were analysed by a validated LC/MS/MS method. Data were collected in positive-ion mode. Calculated correlations are based on peak area ratios of the analyte to its respective internal standard. The smoothing width was 3. The peak area for each analyte transition was divided by the peak area for the corresponding IS transition. The calibration curve for ponatinib was fit using a linear regression, weighted 1/<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup>. Intra- and interassay precision (% coefficient of variation [CV]) was &#x02264;9&#x000b7;4% for ponatinib; the intra- and interassay accuracy (% relative error [RE]) was &#x02212;10&#x000b7;4% to +10&#x000b7;5%. The lower limit of detection for ponatinib was 0&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;ng/mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of a high-fat meal compared with fasting on the relative bioavailability and PK of a single oral dose of ponatinib in healthy subjects. Secondary objectives included assessment of the effect of a low-fat meal compared with the fasting state on the relative bioavailability and PK of a single oral dose of ponatinib and to obtain additional safety and tolerability data of ponatinib in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters assessed included maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>); area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0-<italic>t</italic></sub>); area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>); time to maximum concentration (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>); terminal elimination half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>); terminal phase rate constant (&#x003bb;<sub><italic>Z</italic></sub>); apparent total body clearance after oral administration (CL/F); and apparent distribution volume in the terminal elimination phase (V/F). Non-compartmental PK analyses were carried out to derive the PK parameters for ponatinib for all regimens using actual sampling times. Model 200 for extravascular administration from the WinNonlin library was applied.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methodology</title><p>Mixed-model analyses of variance (<sc>anova</sc>) were performed on natural log-transformed (Ln-transformed) PK parameters AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>0-<italic>t</italic></sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. The <sc>anova</sc> model included sequence, treatment and period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Sequence was tested using subject nested within sequence as the error term, at a 10% level of significance; all other main effects were tested using the residual error (error mean square). Each <sc>anova</sc> included calculation of least squares mean (LSM), the difference between treatment LSM and the standard error associated with the difference. These were done using the SAS&#x000ae; Mixed procedure (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Ratios of LSM were calculated using the exponential of the difference between treatment LSM from the analyses on the Ln-transformed AUC<sub>0-<italic>t</italic></sub>, AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. The comparison between (A) fasted and (B) high-fat conditions was considered as the primary analysis. The comparison between (A) fasted and (C) low-fat conditions was considered as a secondary analysis. Absence of food effect was to be concluded if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimated mean ratios of ponatinib AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>0-<italic>t</italic></sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for test (fed condition) to reference (fasted condition) were contained within the equivalence limits of 80%&#x02013;125% for the primary comparisons. For each <sc>anova</sc>, only paired data sets were used; for each PK parameter, the subjects' data comprised a reliable value for the fasted regimen and one or both fed regimens. Differences between ponatinib <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> obtained for the fasted regimen and those for the fed regimens were evaluated by non-parametric testing of non-transformed data (Wilcoxon signed rank).</p><p>With the 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of fed versus fasted within the limits of 80%&#x02013;125%, and the true fed/fasted GMR within 95%&#x02013;105%, 21 subjects were required to have an 80% probability (power) of showing that the fed and fasted subject conditions would be population bioequivalent. This assumes that the within-subject variability of ponatinib PK would be approximately half that of the across-subject variability, corresponding to a correlation between time points of 0&#x000b7;875.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> If the true geometric mean ratio between fed and fasted is 1&#x000b7;00 (no food effect), then a study that enrolled 21 subjects would have a power of 97%. The false-positive rate (i.e. finding fed and fasted equivalent when they are not) would be &#x0003c;0&#x000b7;001. Twenty-four subjects were enrolled to ensure that at least 21 subjects completed all three periods of the study.</p><p>The number and percentage of subjects with specific adverse events (AEs) were tabulated by treatment at onset using MedDRA System Organ Classes and preferred terms and by maximum relationship and severity. Descriptive statistics and change from baseline (predose vital signs, laboratory values and ECG) were calculated for each parameter at each scheduled time point.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 24 subjects were randomized to treatment; of these, all but one subject completed all three treatments of the study. This subject was withdrawn from the study prior to period 3 because of elevated triacylglycerol lipase levels on the day before study drug administration; the levels subsequently returned to normal. One additional subject was excluded from the evaluable PK set because the subject's ponatinib plasma concentrations were all below the lower limit of quantification after administration of ponatinib during the high-fat regimen, suggesting that despite a visual mouth and hand check, the subject had not taken the dose as per protocol.</p><p>Demographics of all patients and the patients included in the PK set are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.
