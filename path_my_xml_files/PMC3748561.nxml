The population studied included 80 male and female CRF patients who had a file in dialysis center of Panje Azar Hospital in Gorgan, Iran, referring to the center for dialysis. The sample size was calculated as 80 subjects based on the article of Tsay and Hung with a power of 80% and <italic>P</italic> value of 5%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Convenient random sampling was utilized to select the subjects. After obtaining consent from the selected subjects, they were randomly divided into two groups of study (<italic>n</italic> = 40) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 40). The data were collected by a three-section questionnaire: 1) Personal characteristics and the data about the disease (age, sex, education level, marital status, occupation, and the time of undergoing dialysis); 2) Empowerment Scale (ES); and 3) the Strategies Used by People to Promote Health (SUPPH).</p><p>The questionnaire of empowerment was designed in English by Michigan Diabetes Research and Education centre in 2000.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In the present study, the brief form of diabetes empowerment questionnaire (an 8-item tool) was used.</p><p>In the study of Tsay and Hung,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] this tool was used for the patients undergoing hemodialysis, after some lexical changes and confirmation of validity and reliability were made. To calculate validity based on the standard method, the questionnaire was first translated to Persian and then back translated to English.</p><p>The respondents, based on the answer related to their condition, chose a number from 1 to 5 (absolutely disagree = 1 to agree = 5). The second questionnaire (SUPPH) is a 29-item five-option tool.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>This questionnaire was also translated to Persian and back translated to English, and finally its level of consistency was calculated. Validity of the questionnaires was confirmed after translation by 10 academic members.</p><p>Reliability of the questionnaires was tested through random distribution of the questionnaires to 20 patients undergoing hemodialysis, who were different from the study and control groups.</p><p>Internal correlation of empowerment and SUPPH questionnaires were r = 0.86 and r = 0.93, respectively. Educational intervention included empowerment program in which Anderson and Funnell five-study process was used (problem precise search, emotions expression, detecting long-term goals, designing a program to achieve the goals, and evaluation).</p><p>The patients were divided into educational groups, and educational sessions were held for them twice a week for 1 month. The sessions tried to provide the patients with more opportunities to learn through their struggles about the disease, its related emotions, and efficient strategies. The filled questionnaires were picked up once before the intervention and once 6 weeks after that. The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics through SPSS (version 17).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>The subjects comprised 80 patients undergoing hemodialysis.

About 53.8% were illiterates or had primary school education, and 31.3% used to undergo hemodialysis for over 36 months.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. As indicated in the table, the mean scores of empowerment level of these patients in CRF are low in both groups (M = 53.21). Mean score of self-care self-efficacy was M = 53.21, which is low. Pearson correlation test was used to investigate the association between empowerment level and self-care self-efficacy. This test showed that there was a direct significant association between empowerment level and self-care self-efficacy of the patients studied before intervention (r = 0.54, <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001) so that patients&#x02019; self-care increased by increase of empowerment level. The <italic>t</italic>-test was used to investigate the effect of intervention on empowerment level. Comparison of differences in total scores in both groups revealed that the increase of empowerment level scores in the study group was significantly different compared to the control.

The <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the mean scores of self-care self-efficacy in each group (study group showed a higher mean after intervention).

This difference can be as a result of the effect of empowerment program on the subjects, which concords with the results of Tsay and Hung's study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Anderson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] studied a group of diabetic patients who attended empowerment educational sessions and attained better power to cope with socio-psychological concerns accompanied with diabetes.</p><p>It should be noticed that the level of empowerment in the present study was lower before intervention compared to other studies from other countries. For instance, in the study of Tsay and Hung, the level of empowerment was reported to be moderate, but in the present study, this level was lower. Superficial and inadequate education can be the reason for this issue, which can be absolutely promoted through new methods such as empowerment.</p><p>In the present study, the patients who underwent empowerment program experienced higher level of self-care self-efficacy, which is consistent with study of Tsay and Hung.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] As a tight association was observed between self-care self-efficacy and the level of empowerment, it can be concluded that the empowered patients were more confident about their abilities in self-care. Aujoulat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] argue that self-management and self-efficacy are among the empowerment process outcomes which are related to the disease and treatment. Lev and Owen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] also reason that the patients who are more assured about administration of self-care behavior are more interested to follow that.</p><p>The results of this study showed that the level of empowerment and self-care self-efficacy was increased after conducting empowerment program. It can be concluded that nurses should consider that patients&#x02019; education based on empowerment program is a modern educational method in which the patients can exchange their experiences in addition to having active participation in learning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENT</sc></title><p>This article was an extract from MSc thesis submitted in the Kerman University of Medical Science.
