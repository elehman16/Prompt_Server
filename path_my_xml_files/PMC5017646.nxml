Functional foods enriched with plant sterols and plant stanols, as part of a healthy diet, have therefore been advocated in the management of mild hypercholesterolemia [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Except for LDL-C, more recent studies have also suggested that plant sterols and plant stanols lower serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Prospective and case-control studies have identified high fasting serum TG concentrations as an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are routinely measured to assess CVD risk [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, most people are in a non-fasting state for most part of the day and non-fasting serum TG concentrations are an emerging marker contributing to CVD risk due to the postprandial atherogenicity of TG-rich (remnant) lipoprotein particles [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, independent of other risk markers, non-fasting TG concentrations estimated CVD risk more precisely than fasting TG concentrations did [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Besides non-fasting TG concentrations, remnant cholesterol (cholesterol present in TG-rich particles during the fasting and non-fasting state) may be an important CVD risk marker [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], illustrating the importance of including postprandial lipoprotein metabolism to assess CVD risk. Therefore, evaluation of the effects of plant sterol and plant stanol consumption on postprandial lipid metabolism is warranted. So far, only three studies have addressed postprandial lipid and lipoprotein responses after plant stanol ester intake [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and 1 study assessed TG lowering after plant sterol esters [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Demonty et al. assessed postprandial TG concentrations 4 hours after plant sterol consumption and found lower TG concentrations after a combined intake of fish-oil and plant sterols than after an intake of fish oil alone, suggesting a contribution of plant sterols to the TG-lowering effect of fish oil [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The postprandial plant stanol studies have their limitations with respect to assessing postprandial responses, but they do suggest that chronic or acute consumption of plant stanol esters does not affect postprandial lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. This is remarkable, since it is generally acknowledged that fasting lipoprotein concentrations are affected by plant stanol and sterol ester consumption through inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The mechanism underlying the reduction in fasting serum TGs is not known, but was suggested to be due to a reduced intestinal fatty acid absorption, at least in mice [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This illustrates that there is a need for a more detailed knowledge regarding postprandial effects of plant sterol and stanol ester consumption on human lipoprotein metabolism. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine the 8-hour postprandial response after consuming plant sterol or plant stanol ester enriched margarines as part of a shake. Since the appearance of dietary cholesterol in the circulation is delayed [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we decided to provide a second mixed meal after 4 hours. This postprandial meal test was performed after completing a 4-week intervention period during which subjects consumed plant sterol or plant stanol ester enriched margarine on a daily basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Subjects</title><p>The protocol and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160396.s001">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160396.s003">S1 Protocol</xref>). Details of the study have been described previously, when the effects of the intervention on fasting lipoprotein and oxyphytosterol concentrations were reported [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, subjects were recruited in Maastricht and met the following criteria: 18&#x02013;70 years of age; body mass index (BMI) between 20&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; no active cardiovascular disease or severe medical period during the past 5 years that might interfere with the study and no use of lipid-lowering medication or a medically prescribed diet. In addition, serum total cholesterol concentrations were &#x0003c;7.8 mmol/L; serum TG concentrations &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L and plasma glucose concentrations &#x0003c;6.1 mmol/L, as determined during two screening visits. All participants gave their written informed consent before entering the study. The medical ethical committee of the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ (MUMC+) had approved the protocol and the trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01559428.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Diet and design</title><p>The complete 20 weeks intervention study was a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial, which consisted of three intervention periods of 4 weeks, separated by washout periods of 4 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They were allocated to the intervention periods in a randomized order, based upon a computer-generated table with random numbers. Subjects replaced their own spread with the test margarine of which 20 gram had to be consumed on a daily basis, divided over at least 2 intakes. The margarines provided no, or 3.0 gram of plant sterols or stanols per day. At the end of each of the three intervention periods a postprandial test was carried out. Subjects were asked not to perform any strenuous exercise, not to consume alcohol, and to refrain from high-fat foods on the day prior to the postprandial test days. Subjects arrived at the university by public transport or by car after a 12-hour overnight fast. An intravenous cannula was placed in an antecubital vein and a fasting blood sample was collected (T = 0 min). Subjects were then asked to consume the test meal within 10 minutes. The test meal was provided as a shake and contained no, or 3.0 gram of plant sterols or stanols provided as their fatty acid esters, similar to the intervention of the preceding 4-week intervention period. The plant sterol ester mixtures contained sitosterol ester (43%), campesterol ester (25%) and stigmasterol ester (20%). Plant stanol mixtures were obtained by saturation, resulting in sitostanol ester (76%) and campestanol ester (22%). This breakfast shake contained 250 mg cholesterol and in addition 100.000 IU oil-soluble vitamin A (retinyl palmitate). Subsequent blood samples were drawn after 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480 minutes. Following the blood sample after 240 minutes (approximately around lunch time), subjects received a second meal, which consisted again of a shake. This lunch shake contained no cholesterol, no plant sterols or stanols and no vitamin A. This second meal was provided to assess a more physiological response to a mixed meal enriched with plant sterols or plant stanols, since the appearance of dietary cholesterol (and most likely also the appearance of plant sterols and stanols) in the circulation is delayed [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The composition of the two shakes was similar for all subjects, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160396.t001">Table 1</xref>. The shakes provided all three macronutrients to induce a postprandial response that represent the postprandial response of a meal consumed in daily life as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

If the assumption for sphericity was violated, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. Baseline characteristics between age categories were statistically evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for normally distributed data or by a Kruskal-Wallis test for not normally distributed data. Differences in fasting concentrations, iAUC and maximal changes between the test meals were evaluated by repeated-measures ANOVA with diet as within subject factor for normally distributed data or by Friedman&#x02019;s test for not normally distributed data. We also evaluated whether the observed postprandial changes were dependent on gender, body mass index (BMI) or age. There were no gender or BMI effects present. However, the interaction term diet*age was significant for TG iAUC (total and 2<sup>nd</sup> meal responses), for glucose iAUC (total response), but not for apoB48 iAUC. This indicated that dietary effects were influenced by age and diet effects were therefore further evaluated per age category. Age categories were based on the age range (18&#x02013;69 years) equally divided over 3 categories (category I: 18-35y (n = 17), category II: 36-52y (n = 11) and category III: 53-69y (n = 14)). Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine linear relationships between parameters. Results were considered to be statistically significant if <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 for Mac Os X and adjusted by Bonferroni&#x02019;s correction for multiple comparisons or by post-hoc analysis for Friedman&#x02019;s test when appropriate (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><p>A flow diagram of subjects throughout the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160396.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

Postprandial plasma retinyl palmitate concentrations (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160396.g004">Fig 4</xref>, panel A) were determined in 13 subjects and the curve closely resembled the serum TG curve, showing a first meal peak between 3&#x02013;4 hours and a second meal peak one hour after consuming the lunch shake. Due to the smaller sample size (n = 13 instead of n = 42), no statistical analyses in age subgroups were performed on the retinyl palmitate data. Postprandial TG curves were comparable in the subgroup of 13 subjects compared with the entire group of 42 subjects. Changes in postprandial TG concentrations always consist of a combined effect of changes in chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle numbers and composition. To visualize the postprandial lipid response of the first 4 hours, we plotted the retinyl palmitate/apoB48 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160396.g004">Fig 4</xref>, panel B). This ratio provides information about the amount of TG derived from the diet as compared to the number of chylomicron particles in the circulation.

This is however an interesting effect of plant sterol and stanol esters that warrants further study since both fasting and postprandial TG concentrations are positively associated with CVD risk [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, so far only three studies so far have addressed the postprandial effects of foods enriched with plant stanol esters on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and one study evaluated the effect of plant sterol esters on postprandial TG concentrations. Demonty et al. showed that plant sterol ester consumption contributed to the postprandial TG-lowering effect of fish-oil but it was not possible to draw conclusions regarding an independent effect of plant sterol esters. [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Relas et al. performed two postprandial mixed meal studies enriched with plant stanol esters: a 24-hour study with 3.0g of plant stanol esters after a 2-week intervention period and an acute study with 1.0g of plant stanol esters [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In both studies, the addition of plant stanol esters to a high-fat breakfast did not affect postprandial cholesterol and TG concentrations in serum or in lipoprotein fractions. Gylling et al. provided a low-fat breakfast containing 4.5g of plant stanol esters after a 10-week intervention period (daily intake 8.8g of plant stanol esters) [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, changes in serum TG and apoB48 concentrations were not determined in that study. The different postprandial study designs complicates the comparison to our study, especially because we found that plant stanol esters affect the second meal TG and apoB48 response by using a sequential meal protocol with regular blood sampling. We demonstrated that iAUCs for TG and apoB48 responses were similar after the first meal, while these responses were increased after consumption of the second meal in the plant stanol period. This effect was stronger with increasing age and more evident compared to the sterol period than to the control period. These increased postprandial responses might have resulted from an increased production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) or from a decreased clearance of these particles. We can only speculate which of these processes have been affected by plant stanol consumption. A recent study in mice showed reduced TG concentrations after plant sterol and stanol feeding and attributed this reduction to a decreased hepatic VLDL secretion [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which could indicate that our increased TG response is probably not explained by a change in VLDL production. On the other hand, there are indications that a second meal response predominantly addresses effects on TG clearance [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which might suggest that postprandial TG and chylomicron particle clearance are less efficient after plant stanol consumption. After plant stanol consumption, plasma plant sterol concentrations decrease [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which may offer an explanation for a potential change in TG clearance. LPL activity plays a crucial role in TG clearance and since LPL activity is difficult to measure, we analyzed postprandial apoCII and apoCIII concentrations. Even though measuring apoCII and apoCIII in different lipoprotein sub fractions would have provided additional information over their measurement in total serum, both are modulators of LPL activity and give some insights into TG clearance [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We demonstrated that the 2<sup>nd</sup> meal response of apoCIII/CII ratio was increased after plant stanol consumption compared with the control meal in age category III, which suggests a reduction of LPL activity [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and thus a delayed clearance of TRL. This observation is in line with the observed increased TG and apoB48 postprandial responses in this age category and might indicate that TRL clearance is impaired due to a reduced LPL activity after plant stanol consumption in older subjects. Another explanation for the second meal effect after plant stanol ester consumption might be found in changed oxyphytosterol concentrations (oxidized plant sterols). We have already reported that plant stanol consumption reduced fasting oxyphytosterol concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Oxysterols (oxidized cholesterol) are natural ligands of LXR, which in turn induce LPL expression. There are some suggestions that oxyphytosterols activate LXR [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which could lead to an induction of LPL expression. If so, a positive effect of oxyphytosterols on LPL activity might be lost after plant stanol consumption, which could have resulted in decreased TG clearance.</p><p>The increase in TG concentrations after consumption of a second meal seems to contradict recent findings of reduced fasting TGs concentrations after plant stanol consumption [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, reductions in fasting TG concentrations were only observed in subjects with elevated fasting TG concentrations and there is no data describing the effect of plant sterol and plant stanol consumption on postprandial responses in these populations. In the present study in apparently healthy, slightly hypercholesterolemic, normotriglyceridemic subjects, no effects of plant sterol and stanol esters on fasting TGs were found&#x02013;in all age categories&#x02013;[<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while postprandial TG and apoB48 responses were increased in the plant stanol ester group. For now, it remains speculative whether the same observation on postprandial TGs would have been found in a population with elevated fasting TGs. It should however be noted that the observed plant stanol effect after consumption of a second meal was only present in older subjects, which may form a relatively large part of the target population for the consumption of plant sterol and plant stanol enriched products i.e. subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>This study also addresses the difference in conclusions that could be made after single meal consumption or after including a second meal. Our results highlight the metabolic consequences of sequential meal consumption in general. Retinyl palmitate was added to the first breakfast meal. After absorption, retinyl palmitate associates with chylomicrons and their remnants until taken up&#x02014;without being re-secreted&#x02014;by the liver, providing information regarding the lipid content of chylomicrons [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160396.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, apoB48 concentrations provide information regarding the number of chylomicron particles [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Even though retinyl palmitate has several drawbacks, i.e. mainly accurate in early postprandial period (0-9h) [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it provides clear evidence for a second meal effect. Retinyl palmitate peak peaked one hour after consumption of the lunch shake (while no retinyl palmitate was present in the lunch shake), which indicates that this second meal induced chylomicron appearance contains fat from the previous breakfast shake. This illustrates the importance of choosing the appropriate study design to address a certain research question, especially when investigating nutritional effects on postprandial lipid responses. In addition, we calculated ratios of retinyl palmitate (a marker for dietary TG) concentrations to apoB48 concentrations and proposed that TG-enrichment of chylomicrons continues to increase up to 4 hours without a concomitant increase in apoB48 concentrations after the first hour. This suggests that more TG-rich chylomicrons are produced, which agrees with earlier findings suggesting that dietary lipid transport following a meal is mainly through increased chylomicron particle size and less to an increase in particle numbers, i.e. an increase in lipid content per chylomicron [<xref rid="pone.0160396.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates an age-dependent increase in the postprandial TG and apoB48 response after plant stanol ester consumption as part of a mixed meal, compared to a control meal and to a meal enriched in plant sterol esters. Further research is warranted to confirm and extend these results. Also, the mechanism by which plant sterols and plant stanols possibly exert different effects on postprandial lipemic responses needs to be investigated, and if these effects have health consequences. In addition, our findings highlight the importance of studying second meal responses, as it provides more detailed information on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0160396.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0160396.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0160396.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Serum apoCII and CIII median differences and apoCIII/II ratio differences after consumption of a mixed meal containing no, or 3.0 gram of plant sterols or plant stanols.</title><p>(A) serum apoCII concentration differences in age category I: 18&#x02013;35 years; (B) age category II: 36&#x02013;52 years; (C) age category III: 53&#x02013;69 years.
