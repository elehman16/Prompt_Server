At the end of this period, those patients whose MSDBP was &#x02265;95 mmHg and &#x0003c;110 mmHg were equally randomized to combination therapy with benazepril 40 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg [amlodipine/benazepril 5/40 mg] per day for 4 weeks and then were force-titrated to amlodipine/benazepril 10/40 mg/day for an additional 4 weeks.

At the end of 4 weeks, those patients whose MSDBP was &#x02265;95 mmHg and &#x0003c;110 mmHg were equally randomized into three groups. Group 1 was randomized to amlodipine/benazepril 10/20 mg/day for 2 weeks and then force-titrated to amlodipine/benazepril 10/40 mg/day for an additional 6 weeks. Group 2 was randomized to amlodipine/benazepril 10/20 mg/day for 8 weeks, and group 3 continued on amlodipine 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. Patients with severe hypertension (MSDBP &#x02265;115 mmHg and mean seated systolic blood pressure [MSSBP] &#x02265;180 mmHg) were excluded from participation in the studies.

This table lists the baseline data by treatment group for both Black and White patients. The efficacy and safety of treatment regimens was performed by intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. In this analysis, all patients who took at least one dose of randomized study medication and had a baseline and at least one post-randomization efficacy measurement were included. Changes in BP from baseline to endpoint were analyzed using two-way analysis of covariance models, with treatment and center as factors and baseline measurements as a covariate. Treatment-by-center interaction was also investigated. Within-treatment comparisons were analyzed using one-sample t-tests. All treatment comparisons were made at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. The proportion of patients in each treatment group achieving a successful reduction in diastolic BP was compared using a logistic regression model with treatment and center as co-factors and the dichotomous response as the dependent variable.</p><fig id="Tab1"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic characteristics at the end of monotherapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40268_2012_12020057_Tab1" id="MO2"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Continued monotherapy with benazepril 40 mg/day after randomization to double-blind therapy reduced MSDBP from baseline by 7.1 mmHg in White patients (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) and by 4.77 mmHg in Black patients (p &#x0003c; 0.0002), and reduced MSSBP by 6.00 mmHg in White patients (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) and by 1.85 mmHg in Black patients (p-value not significant). The difference in MSDBP was not significant between Black and White patients, but the difference in MSSBP was significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Continued monotherapy with amlodipine 10 mg/day decreased MSDBP from baseline by 9.2 mmHg in White patients and by 8.9 mmHg in Black patients (p &#x0003c; 0.001), and reduced MSSBP by 5.8 mmHg in White patients and by 9.4 mmHg in Black patients (p &#x0003c; 0.001 for both). There was no difference in the reductions of MSDBP and MSSBP between the two groups.

In a meta-analysis of one million hypertensive patients, it was demonstrated that there was a linear relationship between the rise in systolic and diastolic BP from 115/75 mmHg to 185/115 mmHg and the incidence of cardiovascular complications and strokes for all ages.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] This analysis also showed that for each 20 mmHg increase in systolic BP and each 10 mmHg in diastolic BP, the risk of cardiovascular diseases and strokes doubles. Therefore, aggressive treatment of hypertension, with goals of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg for uncomplicated hypertension and &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus, renal disease, or CHD, is recommended by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7), the European Society of Hypertension, the European Society of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Recently, more aggressive goals for BP reduction to &#x0003c;135/85 mmHg have been recommended by the International Society of Hypertension in Blacks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] However, it is possible that future guidelines might relax these strict BP control recommendations because of conflicting evidence regarding their benefit.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p><p>To accomplish these goals, it is often necessary to use multiple drug therapies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] ACE inhibitors and ARBs are drugs with proven cardioprotective, renoprotective, and cerebroprotective properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] However, certain populations, like African-Americans, are resistant to drugs that block the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system [RAAS], like ACE inhibitors and ARBs given as monotherapy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] because these drugs exert their major antihypertensive effects through the blockade of RAAS, and Black patients are usually low-renin and volume-dependent hypertensive subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]</p><p>Several clinical trials have shown that the combination of ACE inhibitors with CCBs increases their hypotensive potency[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] because of a synergistic effect of inhibition of RAAS and a direct arterial dilatory effect, which is independent of RAAS inhibition. Most of the previous publications have used lower-dose ACE inhibitor&#x02013;CCB combinations and did not specifically focus on the antihypertensive effects of these drug combinations on Black hypertensive patients compared with their White counterparts.</p><p>In this report, we present our findings on low-dose amlodipine/benazepril 10/20 mg/day and high-dose amlodipine/benazepril 10/40 mg/day combination regimens for the treatment of Black and White hypertensive patients. Our results showed that the low-dose amlodipine/benazepril combination resulted in significantly greater BP reductions and higher BP control and responder rates in White compared with Black hypertensive patients. In contrast, the high-dose amlodipine/benazepril combination eliminated this racial difference and resulted in similar reductions in BP control and responder rates.

This hemodynamic imbalance is ameliorated with the addition of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which cause both arteriolar and venous dilation, enabling the venous system to absorb the excess tissue fluid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]</p><p>In our studies, the incidence of pedal edema tended to be higher with amlodipine monotherapy (9.2%) and improved with the addition of high-dose benazepril (4.5%).
