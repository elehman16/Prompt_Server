However, only a very small number receive psychotherapeutic treatment. Internet-based cognitive&#x02013;behavioural writing therapy (IB-CBWT) has proven to be an effective treatment option for PTSD. It seems to fit the specific needs of this cohort and to overcome treatment barriers. Aim of the REPAIR trial is to examine the efficacy, safety and applicability of IB-CBWT for PTSD in patients and their spouses after intensive care for sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Participants will be assigned randomly either to a treatment or a wait-list (WL) control group. The treatment group receives IB-CBWT for PTSD, actively involving the partners of the participants. IB-CBWT will be guided by a therapist and comprises two written assignments per week over a 5&#x02005;week period. After completing the assignments, the participants obtain individual responses from the therapist. Participants of the WL control group will receive treatment after a waiting period of 5&#x02005;weeks. The primary outcome is PTSD symptom severity in self-rated PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fifth Edition at the end of treatment and waiting time, respectively. Secondary outcomes are remission of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and somatisation measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, marital satisfaction measured by the Relationship Assessment Scale, health-related quality of life measured by the EQ-5D-5L, and the feasibility of IB-CBWT for this cohort (ie, dropout rate). Statistical analysis will be performed according to the intent-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study is conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and has been approved by the ethics committee of the Friedrich-Schiller University Jena, Germany.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fifth Edition (DSM-5)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> explicitly defined the diagnostic criteria of a traumatic event as an exposure to actual death or serious injury experienced in person or which has occurred to a close family member. Family members, particularly spouses, who care for the critically ill patient during the time of intensive care, are therefore a vulnerable cohort.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> In a recent study, up to 69% of the patients, who had survived sepsis and 62% of the spouses of sepsis survivors suffered from clinically relevant PTSD symptoms.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It has been further shown that both physical and mental health of patients and their spouses are interrelated. More specifically, results of a dyadic analysis indicated that the mental quality of life of a person (patient or spouse) is negatively impacted by post-traumatic stress symptoms of the respective partner. Furthermore, it has been shown that PTSD symptoms of the patient who survived sepsis are a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms of the respective spouse.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Based on these results, it has been concluded that couples react as a dyadic system with interdependent emotional responses to critical illness. Thus, the inclusion of spouses in the treatment of mental long-term consequences of critical illness appears to be inevitable.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, patients suffering from PTSD after critical illness are often untreated or undertreated hereof. Accordingly, Mehlhorn <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> suggest in their review of interventions for the postintensive care syndrome, that &#x0201c;postintensive care patients may benefit from interventions like trauma-focused cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy [&#x02026;] but often they do not have access to those interventions&#x0201d;. (p. 1268)</p><p>With regard to the treatment of PTSD, several evidence-based interventions exist. There is striking evidence for the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy with large effect sizes (standardised mean difference=1.62; 95% CI (1.21 to 2.03) in a meta-analysis of 28 studies) compared against wait-list (WL) control.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Nevertheless, only a minority of individuals suffering from PTSD seeks psychological treatment due to different barriers (eg, fear of stigmatisation, embarrassment, lack of availability of specialised therapists). In recent years, internet-based interventions based on CBT techniques have overcome these face-to-face treatment barriers by treating mobility-impaired patients, being independent in space and time as well as easily accessible and due to visual anonymity being low-threshold.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> The internet-based approach is usually based on a manualised, therapist-assisted treatment which is operationalised via written assignments. In general, treatment as well as the diagnostic screenings (before and after the treatment) are conducted without any face-to-face contact in a secure web portal.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Meta-analytic evidence has proven the efficacy of internet-based cognitive&#x02013;behavioural writing therapy (IB-CBWT) to be large (Hedges&#x02032; g=0.95; 95% CI (0.46 to 1.43); 8 studies) in PTSD symptom reduction compared to WL control.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Up to now, IB-CBWT has not been considered as a treatment approach for PTSD after critical illness and intensive care. Moreover, therapeutic approaches for PTSD that include spouses in addition to the patients are very scarce.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objectives</title><p>Primary aims of the REPAIR trial are to investigate the efficacy, safety and applicability of IB-CBWT for post-traumatic stress after intensive care for sepsis in patients and their spouses compared to a WL control group and to assess maintenance of possible treatment gains at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months post-treatment. Second, the study aims at examining dyadic concordance in treatment effects, that is, indirect effects of the treatment in the respective spouse of the participant of the treatment. Third, the influence of dyadic coping on the treatment effects will be explored.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>REPAIR is a randomised-controlled, parallel group, superiority trial. The current study will be conducted at the Jena University Hospital, recruiting participants from German speaking countries (eg, Germany, Austria and Switzerland) at least 1&#x02005;month after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Participants will be contacted via telephone for initial screening and via internet for delivering the treatment and conducting assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>We will include adult (18+ years) patients after intensive care (&#x0003e;5&#x02005;days) for sepsis<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and their spouses (married or cohabited) who are fluent in written German. A patient&#x02013;spouse dyad will be included if at least one of them (patient or spouse or both) scores above the PCL-5 cut-off (score &#x02265;33)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> for a presumptive PTSD diagnosis. PTSD should be based on a trauma, which is associated with the critical illness and/or ICU stay. Patients will be excluded, if they do not have a spouse. According to the German clinical guideline on the treatment of PTSD<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> acute psychosis and suicidal ideation will be criteria for exclusion. Furthermore, the use of neuroleptics, or an ongoing psychotherapeutic treatment elsewhere will be reasons for exclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Since the treatment is delivered internet-based, German speaking patients/spouses could participate from all over the world. For recruitment, we follow a multipartite strategy. First, all persons, that is, patients or spouses, who request free of charge advice from the German Sepsis Aid's National Helpline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sepsis-hilfe.org">http://www.sepsis-hilfe.org</ext-link>) or had requested advice in the past 2&#x02005;years (altogether about 600 requests), will be contacted and informed about the study. Second, patients of the Mid-German Sepsis Cohort (MSC; trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register, no. DRKS00010050) who are positively screened for PTSD at one of the MSC study assessments will be informed about the study. The MSC aims at following-up about 1000 patients after sepsis per year, of whom we expect about 20% to have PCL scores &#x02265;33 points at least at one follow-up assessment. Third, participants will be recruited via advertisements in health journals and distribution of information brochures in hospitals and rehabilitation centres. In a first telephone contact, participants will be screened for eligibility by using the Life Event Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC 5)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Written informed consent will be obtained by the patients and their spouses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014363F1">figure 1</xref>). One signed version of the informed consent will be sent back to the study centre. After that, an appointment for a second telephone interview will be terminated. In this second telephone contact, patients and their spouses will complete the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> conducted by a trained psychologist.

Partners without clinically relevant PTSD symptoms will also receive access to an individual web portal where they complete the assessments and write the supportive letter. They further receive psychoeducational information about mental health problems after traumatic events (ie, explanation of PTSD symptoms and treatment options).</p><p>At the beginning of each writing assignment, participants propose individual timetables as to when they plan to write. After completion of each assignment, therapists provide individual feedback and further writing instructions within one workday. Important aspects of this feedback are acknowledgement of the participant's courage to disclose and describe their traumatic experiences, reinforcement of the participant's work on the essays, positive feedback and motivation and frequent summaries and encouragement of participants to voice their questions and doubts. Study participants will complete writing assignments through a secure web portal, ensuring that all correspondence is confidential and encrypted. Communication between participants and their therapist will occur asynchronously.</p><p>Every participant (patient and spouse) will receive access to a private, secure user account within the web portal. During treatment, all communication will be conducted within this account. Additionally, the therapist accounts are located in the web portal being secure and only accessible for the therapists.

Dropout rates in IB-CBWT are encouragingly low; in a previous study with older adults (65+ years, comparable in age to the population of the proposed study), 89% of the participants completed every step of treatment.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, additional dropouts in a sample of sepsis survivors may be due to medical reasons, that is, health impairment or sudden death. Thus, we decided to increase the power by assuming a dropout rate of 30%, so that altogether 98 dyads have to be randomised to either IB-CBWT or WL control group.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Methods against bias</title><p>Selection bias will be minimised by random and concealed central allocation of the patient&#x02013;spouse dyads to treatment and control group using a centralised randomisation by the Center for Clinical Studies of the Jena University Hospital. However, performance bias might not be ruled out because blinding of patients/spouses could not be realised due to intervention characteristics. Similarly, therapists cannot be fully blinded to group assignment since participants receiving treatment the first weeks of recruitment must have been automatically allocated to the treatment group. Treatments will be carefully manualised and predefined in terms of the content and number of sessions. To assure treatment fidelity, verbatim scripts of the correspondence between participants and therapists will be reviewed. Treatment fidelity checks will be performed based on a random selection of 30% of treatment sessions. Data will be analysed using an ITT approach. To ensure data quality, diagnoses will be made on the basis of a validated clinical interview conducted by a clinically experienced and trained psychologist. Questionnaires that will be used in the proposed study have been proven to be psychometrically sound instruments. To reduce the risk of sampling bias and to assure external validity, we will use a multipartite recruitment strategy and apply less restrictive eligibility criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary end point of the efficacy assessment (PCL-5 change score at the end of the treatment, t1, ie, &#x0223c;6&#x02005;weeks after randomisation; relative to the randomisation t0) will be compared between both groups (ie, experimental group and WL control group). The null hypothesis &#x003bc;<sub>EXP</sub>=&#x003bc;<sub>WL</sub>, which implies that the PCL-5 change scores are identical in expectation, will be tested against the (two-sided) alternative hypothesis that there will be a difference between the groups (&#x003bc;<sub>EXP</sub> &#x02260; &#x003bc;<sub>WL</sub>). The confirmatory analysis will be performed in the ITT population. These hypotheses will be tested using a general linear model for the primary outcome and the group factor adjusted for PCL-5 at baseline (t0) with generalised estimating equations component to address the possible intradyad clustering. The null hypothesis will be rejected when the two-sided p value for the group variable is equal to or less than the two-sided significance level &#x003b1;=0.05. The average mean difference in the PCL-5 change scores at t1 is assumed to be clinically relevant when the mean PCL-5 score is more than 10 points lower for the experimental group than for the WL control group.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>We will address missing values by replacing all missing change scores with the worst change observed.

All additional analyses and the analyses of secondary end points will be carried out exploratively, that is, without adjustment for multiplicity. We will use adequate standard descriptive and inferential statistical techniques that are described in detail in the SAP. For the third explorative objective&#x02014;dyadic interference in mental health&#x02014;we will use a longitudinal Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model.

The current study also involves the spouse of the affected patient since critical illness has consequences not only for the patient itself, but also for his/her spouse who shares concerns, sorrows and problems.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that the intervention effects will be compared against a WL control group which might overestimate the efficacy of the treatment to a certain degree.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This will be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. Moreover, evidence-based treatment approaches of in post-ICU patients are rare.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This argues against an active control condition. Alternatively, psychological treatment placebo faces the problem that the development of such a control condition in PTSD trials &#x02018;is very difficult, if not impossible&#x02019;.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Moreover, performance bias will possibly influence the effects since participants cannot be blinded because they are aware of their group allocation. Additionally, therapists will not be blinded to group assignment. However, manualisation of the treatment and treatment fidelity checks will counter the risk of bias.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy, safety and applicability of an IB-CBWT after sepsis in patients and their spouses. Given the sparse number of existing treatment approaches for this group of patients IB-CBWT might be a valuable addition in the treatment of PTSD after sepsis. The results of this study will hopefully improve healthcare after sepsis for patients and their spouses. Given the efficacy, safety and applicability of this approach, the treatment could be easily transferred to other languages and thereby disseminated internationally.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Ulrike Redlich and Monique Vogel from the German Sepsis Aid for their support in recruitment.
