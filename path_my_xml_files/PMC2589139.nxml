<p>Antibiotics, commonly amoxycillin, tetracycline, metronidazole and clarithromycin, are presently used in combination with anti-ulcer agents such as omeprazole, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, and sucralfate to treat <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection in patients with peptic ulcer, and compelling evidence has accumulated that eradication of the organism prevents duodenal ulcer relapse. The latest combination (MACH I) involved omeprazole, amoxycillin or metronidazole, and clarithromycin and claimed 90-96 percent success in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication. While the eradication rates of the bacteria are usually between 60-80 percent, the healing rates of duodenal ulcer using these regimens have been remarkably high, often over 90 percent, even with regimens that do not contain proton-pump inhibitors. Antibiotics alone, such as furazolidone and metronidazole, have been reported to heal peptic ulcer with various successes. In a recent double-blind placebo-controlled study, we showed that antibiotics alone, in the form of metronidazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin, effectively healed 92.5 percent of patients with duodenal ulcer, and that the healing was largely accountable by clearance of <italic>H. pylori.</italic> Thus, the present day evidence indicates that both healing and prevention of relapse of peptic ulcer can be achieved by treatment of <italic>H. pylori.</italic> Metronidazole resistance is emerging rapidly, especially in Asia, and is likely to affect eradication success. At this point in time, the best regimen for peptic ulcer associated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> includes the use of a proton-pump inhibitor plus two antibiotics for one to two weeks.</p>
