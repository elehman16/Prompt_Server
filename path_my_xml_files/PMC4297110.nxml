When left untreated, homeostasis of the whole joint may become affected, leading to further degeneration and joint dysfunction, and often osteoarthritis in later life. Early surgical intervention may prevent or delay this. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), the first cell-based approach in orthopedic surgery is a procedure whereby the patients&#x02019; chondrocytes are isolated from a small cartilage biopsy taken during arthroscopy and, after expansion of the cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, are re-implanted into the membrane-sealed chondral defect during a second surgery.

Prospective animal studies would thus be beneficiary. However, studies on cartilage repair in load-bearing animal models have been disappointing, likely because of specific anatomic and structural issues and the difficulty to impose appropriate immobilization procedures to protect delicate initial repair processes.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="bibr22-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr23-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr24-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In particular, Driesang and Hunziker<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> have shown that tissue flaps in goat ACI procedures fail to survive the unrestricted load-bearing joint movements, even after a period of postoperative immobilization.

Simultaneously, we wanted to provide preclinical data on the biological consequences of surgical ACI options. Hereto, a comparison was made between two traditional ACI procedures (periosteal flap and Chondro-Gide membrane, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) and the aforementioned cell-seeding method (whereby the membrane was either sutured or glued into a chondral defect) for their capacity to mediate cartilage repair in a goat model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-1947603512457564"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section7-1947603512457564"><title>Chondrocyte Isolation and In Vitro Expansion</title><p>All cartilage biopsies were obtained from a non-weight-bearing area of the medial trochlear ridge of the right goat stifle joint.

All goats were physically examined before the first surgery and body condition, muscle atrophy, stifle joint appearance, and lameness were scored at different time points. The goats were randomly assigned to the different treatment groups using the randomization function in Microsoft Excel. All surgical interventions were performed under general anesthesia whereby sedation was achieved using xylazine, followed by the induction of general anesthesia by a combination of ketamine and midazolam. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and oxygen. Surgery, pain management, preventive antimicrobial treatment, postoperative and wound care was performed according to standard veterinary protocols. Articular cartilage biopsies were obtained via a small medial parapatellar arthrotomy at the right stifle joint. In a second surgery, 20 to 22 days post-biopsy, the <italic>in vitro</italic> expanded autologous chondrocytes were implanted into an acute chondral defect of 6 mm diameter (&#x02205;) in the cranial part of the medial condyle of the left stifle joint. Care was taken to remove all native cartilage down to, but not including, the calcified layer. In goats, defects that extent into the subchondral bone have been shown to gradually deteriorate, resulting in increasingly large cavities and eventually collapse of the subchondral bone.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>The ACI procedures were performed via a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. For the ACI procedure with the periosteal flap (ACI-P), an incision was first made on the craniomedial side of the proximal tibia of the left knee where an 8 mm &#x02205; periosteal flap was harvested. This was then sutured over the defect with the cambium layer facing the bottom of the defect. For the ACI procedure with a Chondro-Gide collagen membrane (ACI-C), a 6 mm &#x02205; piece was punched out from a dry Chondro-Gide membrane. The membrane was then wetted in saline solution (0.9% NaCl) resulting in a slight expansion. The membrane was secured over the defect with stitches, the porous side of the membrane facing the bottom of the defect. For both &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; ACI techniques, one stitch was left open at the highest point of the defect. Water-tightness was checked by injecting saline through the open suture. The saline solution was then withdrawn after which 10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> were injected underneath the defect sealant. The last suture was closed and fibrin glue (Tissucol) used to additionally seal the borders of the cover. For cell seeding procedures, a 5 mm &#x02205; dry Chondro-Gide piece was punched out. The porous side of membrane was then seeded with 10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the cells were allowed to adhere to the membrane for 10 minutes. The seeded membrane was then implanted with the porous surface facing the subchondral bone plate. For the sutured membrane-seeded (ACI-CS) procedure, the membrane was fixed into position by 4 resorbable sutures in the adjacent cartilage after which Tissucol was used as an additional sealing of the edge. For the membrane-seeded procedure with fibrin glue (ACI-CS-Fibrin), the membrane was glued into the defect by applying a drop of Tissucol on the exposed tidemark after which the seeded membrane was inserted and slight pressure was applied.</p></sec><sec id="section10-1947603512457564"><title>Rehabilitation</title><p>The treated stifle joint was gradually loaded over a period of 3 weeks postsurgery. During the first postoperative week, the stifle joint was fully immobilized with a sling. From the third postoperative day on, the sling was removed once a day for 5 minutes and the knee was bent several times while prohibiting load bearing. These manipulations were done to avoid ingrowth of synovial membrane in the defect site, which might happen because of close apposition between the synovial membrane and the defect as a consequence of the continuous knee flexion in the sling. This was followed by a limited but gradual increase in load bearing during the next 2 weeks: The sling was removed 1 hour per day during the second week, and 2 hours per day in the third week. After this immobilization period, the sling was permanently removed. To avoid unwanted peak loading, the mobility and possibility to jump or to stand on hind limbs was restricted until the end of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="section11-1947603512457564"><title>Sacrifice and Histological Analysis</title><p>An implantation time of 10 weeks in the goat was chosen to monitor the early consequences of the different ACI techniques on the formation of neocartilage and on its integration into the native tissue. We believe that the experimental period of 10 weeks in the goat is a relevant indicator for long-term outcome since there is no scientific evidence to expect durable cartilage repair when short-term follow-up measures appear poor. After sacrifice by intravenous injection of T61 (Intervet), samples from the knees were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 48 hours, decalcified, and paraffin embedded. Five-micrometer thick histological sections in the plane perpendicular to the cartilage surface were taken from at least seven levels throughout the defect. The first level started at the beginning of the defect including the borders of the defect and the last level reached the opposite border of the defect. Each section gives a tangential overview of the surrounding native cartilage, the defect and the subchondral bone. Histochemical staining with hematoxylin&#x02013;eosin, safranin O, and toluidine blue was done according to standard protocols. The quality of the neo-tissue formation was graded using a modified O&#x02019;Driscoll (MOD) score.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Scoring was done at different levels, ensuring a representative picture through the entire articular cartilage defect.

Cell injections in mice were performed on the same day and using the same cell harvest as the cell implantation in the goat. All goat chondrocytes demonstrated an excellent and comparable capacity to form hyaline-like cartilage in the nude mouse. This was evident from ectopic cartilaginous tissue with lacunae around the cells, a strong safranin O staining and an absence of vascular invasion in the implant. All averaged semiquantitative ECFA scores (maximum score = 3) were greater than 2 with an averaged overall score of 2.8 in the ACI-P, 2.9 for the ACI-C group, 2.9 for the ACI-CS group, and 2.6 for the ACI-CS-Fibrin group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1947603512457564"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).

Well-filled defects were macroscopically observed to contain cartilage-like tissue or a mix between fibrous and amorphous tissue. Poorly filled or empty defects were usually partially covered by native cartilage from the defect rim that had bent centrally (cartilage flow). Native cartilage in the rest of the joint was also macroscopically inspected for features of degeneration and synovium was assessed for signs of inflammation. No obvious differences between the different experimental conditions were apparent. In most cases, native cartilage near the defect appeared fibrillated with occasional small cracks. Further away from the defect, the cartilage usually appeared unaffected. Synovitis was absent in the majority of the animals.</p><fig id="fig2-1947603512457564" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Macroscopic appearance of freshly opened joints after 10 weeks implantation <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Excellent filling with neo-tissue containing sulfated glycosaminoglycans was generally associated with good lateral and basal integration. The latter was associated with tidemark resorption and subchondral bone remodeling, sometimes resulting in cartilaginous tissue penetrating the subchondral bone, without however causing cracks or bone cysts. Samples with no or limited filling with fibrous tissue presented themselves with an intact tidemark. Occasionally, a damaged calcified layer and subchondral bone was seen in unfilled defects, resulting in bone cracks and bone cysts under the defect.

The MOD scoring of the treatment groups ACI-P (average MOD score 15.6 &#x000b1; 3.6) and ACI-C (average MOD score 16.4 &#x000b1; 3.7) appeared statistically indiscernible (<italic>P</italic> = 0.939).

Since direct comparison in a clinical setting is currently lacking, we performed an evaluation of different surgical ACI procedures in an optimized goat model.</p><p>Reviewing the literature on the goat model in cartilage repair reveals diversity in locations, size and depth of the defects. Here, a partial thickness, 6-mm diameter defect was made in the medial femoral condyle and cartilage was removed down to, but not penetrating, the calcified layer. A comparable method is used by others in goats and no repair was reported in empty chondral defects of 6-mm diameter.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Our own historical data (not shown) have confirmed a 6-mm diameter defect to be critical size when left empty. The primary aim of this study was a relative comparison between the various surgical options. Therefore, and because comparison with untreated controls would require the inclusion of a control groups for each study arm (empty defect controls, Chondro-Gide without cells, periost without cells, fibrin glue alone, and combinations thereof), untreated controls were considered to be beyond the scope of this study. The incidence of graft failure, subchondral bone damage or cysts was limited and ingrowth of the synovial membrane in the defect site prevented by an intensive immobilization and rehabilitation procedure. However using this model and rehab protocol, graft failure, likely because of delamination of tissue flaps, still occurred in all experimental groups but was explicitly present in the ACI-CS-fibrin surgical technique.</p><p>The cartilage repair tissue formed by the expanded autologous goat chondrocytes appeared very similar with respect to the degree of filling, basal and lateral integration and extracellular matrix composition, irrespective of whether the cells had been implanted underneath a periosteal flap, underneath a Chondro-Gide membrane or membrane-seeded and sutured into the defect. These findings not only justify the use of the Chondro-Gide membrane in ACI procedures to replace the periosteal flap but also support its use as a matrix for the cell-seeding membrane procedure as reported by Steinwachs.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> When Tissucol was used to maintain the cell-seeded membrane in the defect bed, cartilage repair was significantly inferior to traditional ACI. No tidemark resorption or subchondral bone remodeling was apparent that would be indicative of an initiated basal integration of the&#x02014;limited amount of&#x02014;neotissue. By means of the ECFA that measures the intrinsic capacity to form cartilage, it was verified that this difference was not because of a nonrandom distribution of the quality of goat chondrocytes over the four treatment groups.</p><p>Despite the noteworthy differences in human and goat condyle tissue proportions, articular cartilage thickness, and the extent of rehabilitation that can be imposed on such animals, the significantly impaired performance of the ACI-CS-Fibrin group thus calls for care when employing only fibrin glue to fix implants in chondral defects. From this experimental setup, however, we cannot conclude whether this could be due to a premature loss of the cell-seeded implant because of the failure of the adhesive in the wet and mechanically challenging goat joint environment<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> or to the intrinsic properties of the fibrin clot, which may act as a barrier between the implanted cells and the tidemark, thereby interfering with basal integration.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> A cartilage implant without reasonable integration into the underlying tissue is doomed to fail sooner or later. Interestingly, the ACI-CS fixed with sutures, though statistically indiscernible, tended to perform poorer than the traditional ACI methods. Perhaps denser suturing during the ACI-CS technique in combination with the sealing of the defect rim with fibrin, could create, much alike the standard ACI procedure, a closed bioactive chamber. This could result in an increased local concentration of beneficial cartilaginous cytokines and at the same time excluding from the defect bed proteolytic enzymes and blood components that may disturb the cartilage repair.</p><p>For the clinical application of the ACI-CS method, we are therefore strongly in favor of meticulously adhering to the consensus procedure on the ACI-CS technique as it was recently published,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1947603512457564" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> in particular where it states that the spacing and number of sutures should be such that it provides the necessary mechanical stability to ensure direct contact between the cell-seeded membrane surface and the subchondral bone and use a fibrin sealant only to seal the cartilage rim.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="457564_Supplementary_Figure_1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e593" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Acknowledgments and Funding:</bold> We thank all members and former members of the R&#x00026;D team of Tigenix N.V. and Dr W.
