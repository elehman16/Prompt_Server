A primary way to improve oocyte quality is to optimize the COH protocol. It was demonstrated that the viable embryo rate per oocyte retrieved in the Utrogestan and hMG protocol, a novel regimen based on frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET), is statistically higher than that in the short protocol. Thus, a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the endocrine characteristics and clinical outcomes in PCOS patients subjected to the Utrogestan and hMG protocol compared with those subjected to the short protocol.</p><p>One hundred twenty three PCOS patients enrolled in the study group and were simultaneously administered Utrogestan and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) from cycle day 3 until the trigger day. When the dominant follicles matured, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) 0.1&#x0200a;mg was used as the trigger. A short protocol was applied in the control group including 77 PCOS women. Viable embryos were cryopreserved for later transfer in both groups. The primary outcome was the viable embryo rate per oocyte retrieved. The secondary outcomes included the number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and clinical pregnancy outcomes from FET cycles.</p><p>The pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) level was suppressed in most patients; however, the LH level in 13 women, whose basic LH level was more than 10&#x0200a;IU/L, surpassed 10&#x0200a;IU/L on menstruation cycle day (MC)<sub>9&#x02013;11</sub> and decreased subsequently. No significant between-group differences were observed in the number of oocytes retrieved (13.27&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;7.46 vs 13.1&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;7.98), number of viable embryos (5.57&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;3.27 vs 5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.79), mature oocyte rate (90.14&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;11.81% vs 93.02&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;8.95%), and cleavage rate (97.69&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.22% vs 95.89&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;9.57%).

Follicular monitoring started at MC<sub>9&#x02013;11</sub> and was performed every 2 to 4 days; meanwhile, serum FSH, LH, E2, and progesterone concentrations were measured. The final stage of oocyte maturation was triggered using triptorelin 0.1&#x0200a;mg (Decapeptyl; Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Germany). A short protocol was used for the control group. Patients were administered 0.1&#x0200a;mg of triptorelin daily beginning on MC<sub>2</sub> and 150 to 225&#x0200a;IU of hMG daily beginning on MC<sub>3</sub>. The initiating dose of hMG administration was based on the same criteria as for the study group. After 6 to 7 days, ultrasound examination and serum hormone level tests were performed and the dose of hMG was adjusted according to follicle development. When dominant follicles reached 18&#x0200a;mm in diameter, HCG (Lizhu Pharmaceutical Trading Co., Zhuhai, China) 3000&#x0200a;IU was injected for the final stage of oocyte maturation. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval was conducted 34 to 36&#x0200a;h after the trigger. All of the follicles with diameters greater than 10&#x0200a;mm were retrieved. The fertilization of the aspirated oocytes was performed by either IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), depending on the semen parameters. According to the number and regularity of blastomeres and degree of embryonic fragmentation, good-quality embryos (including grade 1 and grade 2, 8-cell embryos) were frozen by vitrification on the third day following oocyte retrieval, and non-top-quality embryos were placed in extended culture, of which good-morphological grade blastocysts were frozen on day 5 or day 6.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2.2</label><title>Endometrium preparation and FET</title><p>In this study, the method of endometrium preparation was similar in both groups. Specifically, letrozole and, if necessary, hMG was employed to stimulate monofollicular growth. Letrozole 5&#x0200a;mg was administered from cycle day 3 to 7, and then follicle growth was monitored beginning on day 10. At times, the treatment included a low dose of hMG (75&#x0200a;IU/day) to stimulate follicular and endometrial lining growth. The administration of 5000&#x0200a;IU of hCG and timing of FET were performed as described elsewhere.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> The transfer of day 3 embryos or blastocysts was scheduled based on the embryo and endometrium synchronization.

Oral ethinyl estradiol (EE; Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical) 75&#x0200a;mg/day was administered from day 3 to attain the criteria of endometrial thickness &#x02265;8&#x0200a;mm and a triple line pattern on ultrasound scans. At that time, the patients were given 0.4&#x0200a;g of progestin (Laboratoires Besins-Iscovesco) intravaginally daily, and embryo transfer was performed 3 days later under abdominal ultrasound guidance. Oral estradiol and progestin were continued until 10 weeks of gestation when pregnant.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the viable embryo rate per oocyte retrieved. The secondary measures included the number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and clinical pregnancy outcomes from frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles. The viable embryo rate per oocyte was defined as the number of viable embryos divided by the number of oocytes retrieved. Clinical pregnancy was defined as the presence of a gestational sac with fetal heart activity during ultrasound examination 7 weeks after FET. The implantation rate was defined as the number of gestational sacs divided by the number of embryos transferred.

Additional research should be performed to determine the impact of altered LH levels on oocytes and embryo quality and whether 10&#x0200a;IU/L is a valuable cut-off level for predicting premature LH surge in PCOS patients undergoing the Utrogestan and hMG protocol.</p><p>The reason why the LH level failed to decrease timely after taking the same dose of Utrogestan orally can be elucidated from the following aspects. First and foremost, a clear dose&#x02013;time effect has been demonstrated about the delivery of Utrogestan. A dose of 300&#x0200a;mg/d for 10 days could initiate bleeding in patients with secondary amenorrhea, while 25 days were needed for a dose of 100&#x0200a;mg/d.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The lower progesterone level after taking the same dose of Utrogestan, as well as the high basic LH level that was more than 10&#x0200a;IU/L, may be one of the causes of the delayed onset time of Utrogestan in these women. In the future, we perhaps could prolong the interval between the application of Utrogestan and hMG in terms of the concentration of LH. In addition, there were certain mutations in LH, the LH receptor (LHR) or LH-regulated genes in some PCOS women that may change the biological activity of LH, leading to higher immunoactive LH levels needed to maintain normal follicle development.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup></p><p>The fertilization rate, viable embryo rate per oocyte retrieved, biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and implantation rate in the study group were higher than those in the control group. And there was statistic significance in the P level between the two groups since the delivery of Utrogestan, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Thus, one explanation is that the addition of Utrogestan benefited PCOS patients via altering the progesterone deficiency state. It was ascertained that the conversion of progesterone to androstenedione accelerated in theca cells of PCOS ovaries, leading to progesterone scarcity in PCOS women.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Progesterone deficiency was prone to facilitate LH secretion in PCOS patients, as reported by Fiad et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> resulting in various disturbances. Additionally, progesterone played a crucial role, both directly and indirectly, in oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryo development, and the effect was dependent on the progesterone concentration, as described in some previous articles.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Thereby, the Utrogestan and hMG protocol is promising in the treatment of PCOS women, and the optimal dose of Utrogestan remains to be determined to warrant follicle development in an appropriate intrafollicular steroidogenic milieu.</p><p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious complication of ovarian stimulation that affects 1% to 14% of all IVF cycles.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> The incidence of moderate or severe OHSS (%) in the Utrogestan group (1.63%) was lower than that in the short-protocol group (2.6%), with no significant difference. Various prevention strategies applied in our clinic contributed to the low incidence of OHSS both in Utrogestan group and the short-protocol group, including the application of low-dose hCG in the late-follicular phase,<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> vaginal delivery of the dopamine agonist cabergoline,<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> trigger with low-dose hCG,<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> and &#x0201c;freeze-all" strategy.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup></p><p>A major limitation of our study is the retrospective design of this study. Additionally, the number of participants enrolled was insufficient; thus, the number of women with LH &#x0003e;10&#x0200a;IU/L on MC9&#x02013;11 was limited, decreasing the power of this study. On the other hand, the exact number of antral follicles was not provided as 20+ or PCO was used to record the number of antral follicles in PCOS patients in our clinic, one detail, which reduced accuracy. Finally, patients with short protocol did not need to take the hormone determination every time they come to the hospital in our clinic, because the physician was so familiar with it as a routine regimen. Thus, the hormone data of the short protocol was obtained only in part of the population enrolled.</p><p>To conclude, this study shows that PCOS women using the Utrogestan and hMG protocol undergoing IVF/ICSI treatments could obtain competent oocytes/embryos and optimal pregnancy outcomes in FET cycles. Many problems concerning this novel regimen in PCOS women remain to be explored such as the proper delivery time and dose of Utrogestan, and practicality and individualization of this new protocol. Therefore, more trials should be implemented using large samples. Moreover, basic studies are indispensable to seek the alterations in extra- and intra-ovarian factors in PCOS patients using the Utrogestan and hMG protocol and to help understand the action mechanism of Utrogestan, as well as to optimize this novel protocol in individuals.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: COH = controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, FET = frozen-thawed embryo transfer, GnRH-a = gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, hCG = human chorionic gonadotropin, hMG = human menopausal gonadotropin, HRT = hormone replacement treatment, ICS = intracytoplasmic sperm injection, IVF = in vitro fertilization, LH = luteinizing hormone, MC = menstruation cycle day, OHSS = ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, PCOS = polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><source>Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group.
