In this paper, we describe the TQT study conducted with FF/VI administered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI). This study was conducted to determine whether FF/VI 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (representing the highest strength assessed in phase&#x02009;III studies in asthma and COPD) and a fourfold multiple of this, FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, both administered once daily for 7 days, were associated with a clinically significant effect on QTc. Supportive data from the TQT study conducted with single-dose inhaled FF administered via the Diskus&#x02122;/Accuhaler&#x02122; inhaler (GlaxoSmithKline) are also presented. This FF TQT study was performed to support the development of both the intranasal formulation and inhaled formulation FF products and is included here to help to ascertain whether any effects seen with FF/VI were to be attributed to either the FF or VI components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol TQT study</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighty-five healthy nonsmokers (i.e. not smoked within 6 months; pack history &#x02264; 10 years) aged 18&#x02013;65 years, with a body mass index within the range 18.5&#x02013;29&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x02265; 85% of predicted values <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and no history of or no current significant abnormalities in relationship to ECG (PR interval &#x0003e; 210 ms; ventricular rate, &#x0003c;40&#x02009;beats&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; mean QTcF (Fridericia's correction) &#x02265; 450 ms; Q waves &#x02265; 30 ms; QRS &#x0003c; 60 ms and &#x02265; 120 ms), vital signs or clinical laboratory assessments at baseline were included.

The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the independent ethics committee of the participating centre prior to the start of the study. The study comprised a screening period (up to 28 days), four repeat-dose treatment periods (7 days each to ensure that FF and VI were at steady state) separated by at least 7 days washout, and a follow-up visit conducted within 14 days of the last dose. Subjects were randomized (1:1:1:1) to one of four treatment sequences, receiving the following treatments in random order: FF/VI (200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, therapeutic strength as one inhalation of 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g and one placebo inhalation); FF/VI (800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, supratherapeutic strength as two inhalations of 400/50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g); matching placebo (two placebo inhalations); or moxifloxacin tablet (400&#x02009;mg, therapeutic dose). Note that FF/VI was administered as 200/25 and 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g and represented emitted doses from the DPI of 184/22 and 736/88&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, respectively. Moxifloxacin (Avelox&#x000ae;; Bayer) <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> was included as the positive control to determine assay sensitivity <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For the inhaled treatment arms, FF/VI or matching placebo [both from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)] were administered once daily in the morning for 7 days under double-blind conditions via DPI. The DPI was a dual-strip dry powder inhaler that contained FF in one strip and VI in the second strip for the FF/VI products, or placebo in both strips. On day 7, a nonmatching placebo tablet (for moxifloxacin; GlaxoSmithKline) was administered in single-blind conditions. During the moxifloxacin treatment period, subjects received double-blind inhaled placebo on days 1&#x02013;7 (inclusive) and a single-blind moxifloxacin tablet on day 7. Dosing was supervised on treatment days 1 and 7 and was unsupervised on days 2&#x02013;6 (see online Supporting information). The central randomization schedule was generated by GSK Discovery Biometrics using validated internal software. The investigator or designee received the medication assignment information and randomized the subjects using sequential randomization numbers assigned in chronological order; the randomization and treatment period numbers were printed on the labels for the product. Subjects abstained from taking prescription or nonprescription drugs (except paracetamol, &#x02264;2&#x02009;g day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) from 7 days (or five half-lives) prior to screening through to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments of ECG and evaluation of QTc</title><p>At screening, 24&#x02009;h Holter ECG recordings were taken to exclude underlying cardiac arrhythmias. At all other time points, 12-lead continuous ECG digital monitoring (Mortara H12plus, 1000&#x02009;Hz Holter monitor) was performed before any other study assessments scheduled at the same nominal time point. To account for intrinsic variability, triplicate measurements were taken at all time points, with the mean QTc value taken from five separate beats analysed on each ECG; QTc for an individual beat was calculated from the preceding RR interval. ECG measurements were taken over 12&#x02009;h on day &#x02212;1 (treatment period 1 only), predose only (day 1) and on day 7 predose, 5, 10 and 30&#x02009;min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24&#x02009;h postdose. Subjects were in a semi-supine position (having rested for 30&#x02009;min) for the first reading up to and including the 4&#x02009;h time point, then supine or semi-supine for the remaining time points. On ECG assessment days, dosing was conducted in the fasted state and subjects continued fasting after dosing for 1&#x02009;h (day 1) and 4&#x02009;h (day 7). Critical ECG data were not collected immediately after meals or during sleep; meals were administered immediately after scheduled ECG collection time points; water (at room temperature) was allowed except for 1&#x02009;h either side of dosing.</p><p>The ECG readings were transmitted electronically to an independent, blinded central cardiologist for digital calliper measurement of conduction intervals (Quintiles, India). A lack of clinically significant effect was defined in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E14 guidelines as the upper 90% confidence interval (CI) limits for mean time-matched QTc differences from placebo being &#x0003c;10 ms <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19]</xref>.</p><p>The QT intervals were corrected using Fridericia's (QTcF), Bazett's (QTcB) and individual correction factors (QTci) <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">[23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27]</xref>. The QTci was calculated using all baseline data from day &#x02212;1, day 1 (predose) and all placebo (i.e. nontreatment) data. A linear regression model (QT = &#x003b1; + &#x003b2; &#x000d7; RR) was fitted for each subject, and the slopes (&#x003b2;) for the regression models were estimated. Individual QT values were subsequently corrected using the formula: QTci = QT + &#x003b2;(1 &#x02212; RR), where &#x003b2; is the estimate of the correction factor obtained from the first step from the respective model <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. As QTcB does not correct very well when heart rates are changing, QTcB was not analysed further.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic assessments</title><p>Blood samples (6&#x02009;ml) were taken on day 7 of each treatment period predose, then at 5, 10 and 30&#x02009;min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24&#x02009;h postdose to quantify steady-state concentrations of FF and VI during ECG assessment and investigate any relationship between plasma concentration and QTc values for VI and FF. Samples taken after administration of moxifloxacin were to be analysed only if an unexpected or unusual QTc response was recorded. Analysis of plasma samples was performed using validated methods based on solid-phase extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry. Lower limits of quantification were 10&#x02009;pg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FF and VI; the higher limit of quantification was 1000&#x02009;pg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FF and 10&#x02009;000&#x02009;pg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for VI. Quality controls prepared at three different concentrations analysed with each batch of samples met the acceptance criteria of no more than one-third of the quality control results deviating from the nominal concentration by &#x0003e;15%, with at least one quality control result acceptable at each concentration. Standard noncompartmental methods using WinNonlin (version 5.2) were used to derive pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters including maximum observed concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), time to maximum concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24&#x02009;h post-dose (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Adverse events (AEs), vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), 12-lead ECG, spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and clinical laboratory assessments (clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis) were monitored at intervals during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was performed using simulated data based upon the comparison of FF/VI 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g with placebo in terms of the change from baseline in the QTcF interval using an integrated analysis of previous studies with VI (see online Supporting information and Supporting information,Table S1); FF is not associated with QT effects; therefore, sample size calculations were based on VI only.</p><p>In order to rule out an effect size of &#x02265;10 ms with overall 90% power at the one-sided 5% significance level, assuming a true treatment difference of 3&#x02009;ms, between-subject SD of 15&#x02009;ms, within-subject SD of 10&#x02009;ms, and a within-subject correlation between values from any two time points of 0.55, 66 evaluable subjects were required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The &#x02018;per protocol&#x02019; population was the primary population of interest for the analysis of the primary end-point data, defined as subjects having received at least six doses of study medication out of seven, including day 7, for each of the four treatment periods; the PK population was defined as subjects in the &#x02018;all subjects&#x02019; population (defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication) for whom a PK sample was obtained and analysed; this was used for all PK analyses.</p><p>The primary end-point was change from baseline in QTcF interval at each of the time points on study day 7 for FF/VI 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g compared with time-matched placebo.

Subject and period baseline were also included as continuous covariates, and the interaction term for period baseline by time was also fitted.

As FF systemic exposure increased with dose, so did VI exposure. In the FF study, FF administered alone at high dose was shown to have no effect on QTcF or heart rate. Inclusion of data from this study in the scatter plots showed there to be no relationship between FF concentration and either QTcF or heart rate effect.

The inhaled treatments were administered via Diskus&#x02122;/Accuhaler&#x02122; inhaler. Results for the lactose placebo with COA were not significantly different from the lactose-alone treatment and are not presented in this paper because COA is not an excipient in either the FF or the FF/VI formulation.

This indicates that the &#x02018;positive&#x02019; effect on the QT interval observed with FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, according to the ICH guidelines, was dependent on the QTc correction factor applied rather than indicating a clinically significant effect of FF/VI on the QTc interval, <italic>per se</italic>

The corrected QT (QTc) interval represents the QT value that would be noted in the same ECG at a heart rate of 60 beats&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Many QT correction methods are available, and selection of the most appropriate QT interval correction factor is a topic of considerable controversy and debate <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">[25</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34]</xref>. Correction using either Bazett's formula (QTcB =QT/(R&#x02013;R)<sup>1/2</sup>) or Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT/(R&#x02013;R)<sup>1/3</sup>) is well established but assumes a fixed exponential QT:RR relationship that is applicable to all subjects <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">[23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35]</xref>. However, QT/RR relationships have substantial intersubject variability with high intrasubject stability, and the hypothesis that a single mathematical formula can describe a &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; relationship that is applicable to all subjects is incorrect <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">[25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26]</xref>. Ideally, individualized correction formulae (QTci) based on drug-free data collected over a range of heart rates from each subject should be used to assess drug-related QT prolongation <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. For confidence in the estimation of QTci, the number of drug-free ECGs obtained and used should be as large as possible; at least 20&#x02013;50 per subject <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Drugs with inherent heart rate effects are much more challenging to study in TQT studies; there is limited experience with such compounds and there is no firm guidance on which correction factor to select <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. When feasible, crossover designs including negative controls (i.e. placebo) are preferable for TQT studies because they allow determination of individual QT/RR relationships for each subject and the calculation of QTci <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the present study, increases in heart rate were anticipated at the supratherapeutic FF/VI strength of 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g and consequently, individually corrected QT (QTci) interval data were also collected. The number of drug-free ECGs obtained (72) exceeded the minimum recommended <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. At 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, FF/VI did increase mean maximal heart rate, with the greatest difference compared with FF/VI 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of approximately 9 beats&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> seen 10&#x02009;min postdose. Despite this difference in heart rate, time-matched QTci values were comparable between FF/VI 800/100 and 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, suggesting that QTci represented a more suitable QT correction factor than QTcF for the data in this study. Furthermore, this would appear to be supported by the moxifloxacin data, where there was no effect on heart rate and the effects on QTcF and QTci were comparable. These data suggest that the increases in QTcF seen at the FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g strength were a consequence of inadequate QT correction at the heart rates seen rather than an effect on the QT interval, <italic>per se</italic>. The lack of effect of FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g on QTci according to the ICH E14 guidelines, despite the increases in heart rate, indicates that FF/VI was not associated with QTc prolongation at the dose administered <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19]</xref>. A lack of effect of FF/VI on the QTc interval was also supported by the categorical analysis of postdose changes in QTcF, where increases of &#x02265;30&#x02013;60&#x02009;ms were observed in only three individuals (4%) after FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g.</p><p>The increases in heart rate recorded in this study following administration of FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g were greater than those previously reported with VI 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in healthy subjects, subjects with asthma or subjects with COPD <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, more subjects reported AEs of palpitations following administration of FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (15%) compared with FF/VI 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (1%). Given that a single supratherapeutic FF dose of 4000&#x02009;&#x003bc;g did not affect heart rate, these effects of FF/VI were attributed to VI. Thorough QT studies are typically conducted in healthy subjects unless the drug under evaluation is unsuitable for administration in this population <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19]</xref>. &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-Agonists have a class-related potential for cardiovascular effects <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17]</xref>, while cardiovascular disease is a known co-morbidity in subjects with COPD and is a leading cause of mortality in this population <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Consequently, the potential cardiovascular effects of VI are of particular clinical interest. Vilanterol at doses up to 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g has been generally well tolerated in healthy subjects (repeat dosing) and in subjects with COPD or asthma (single doses), with a low overall incidence of AEs compared with placebo, and few AEs potentially indicative of LABA-class effects (such as tremor, muscle twitching and palpitations). In addition, these VI doses were not associated with clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, 12-lead ECG, Holter ECG, blood glucose or potassium <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. No QTc effects were seen at VI doses up to 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g and, while some QTc effects were seen at 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in healthy subjects and in subjects with asthma, no significant QTc effects were seen in subjects with COPD <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These data were in agreement with those of the 28 day dose-ranging (phase II) VI studies (VI 3&#x02013;50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) in subjects with asthma <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and in subjects with COPD <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, in which no significant QTc effects were seen, and only minor effects on heart rate were recorded (mean increases of 2 beats&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or less). In these studies, the incidence of AEs potentially indicative of an LABA-class effect were &#x0003c;3% in any treatment group, indicating that VI is well tolerated in subjects with COPD or asthma at doses up to 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">[8</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10]</xref>. Likewise, in large-scale (phase III) 6 month studies in subjects with COPD <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">[38</xref>,<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39]</xref> or in 12 month studies in subjects with asthma <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, VI 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g administered as FF/VI or VI alone (COPD only) was also not associated with clinically significant cardiovascular effects, including effects on the QTc interval. The reasons for the more marked effects on heart rate seen in healthy subjects in the present study are not known. Systemic VI exposure (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) is greater in healthy subjects than in subjects with either asthma or COPD <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, which may account for the lack of effect of VI on heart rate in these patient groups. Consequently, the heart rate effects seen in this study in healthy subjects, particularly at the FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g dose, are not considered to be representative of effects observed with VI 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in clinical use.</p><p>No formal PK-PD modelling was performed with FF owing to the apparent absence of a relationship between FF and QTcF or heart rate following graphical evaluation of FF exposure (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and these parameters. The later <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> observed at the higher dose of FF (800&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) was attributed to the known absorption-rate-limited pharmacokinetics of inhaled FF <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The differences in <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> between FF (800&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) in the main study and FF (4000&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) in the supportive FF TQT study were not unexpected given the different formulations and inhalers used in the two studies. The PK-PD modelling demonstrated that VI exposure (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) was related to increases in both heart rate and QTcF. However, the slopes for the relationships were extremely shallow. Based on the VI <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> value for FF/VI 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g for healthy subjects in this study (115&#x02009;pg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), these would represent an increase in mean maximum heart rate of approximately 2 beats&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and an increase in mean maximal QTcF of approximately &#x0003c;1&#x02009;ms. Lesser effects would be anticipated in subjects with asthma or COPD based on the lower VI systemic exposure previously described.</p><p>A potential limitation of this study is that it did not include a direct comparison with another established long-acting &#x003b2;-adrenoceptor agonist, such as salmeterol or formoterol. These compounds were developed prior to establishment of the requirements for a TQT study <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19]</xref> and so comparable data to the present study are not available. Although class-related QT prolongation is described for &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, the studies reported typically used Bazett's correction, which overestimates QTc when heart rate increases, and consequently, a systematic bias may have implicated these drugs in cardiac prolongation <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. More recently, a lack of effect on QTcF has been reported with the LABA indacaterol using a parallel-group study design <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, although the highest dose examined (600&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) represented only a twofold multiple of the highest approved dose in the EU <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Another potential limitation of this study is that FF and VI were only administered in combination, and the QTc effects of the separate components were not studied. However, in the supporting study, high single-dose FF (4000&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) did not produce QTc prolongation, which is in agreement with the fact that corticosteroids are not associated with this effect <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. There was no relationship observed between the QTcF interval and FF exposure over a wide range of exposures, including those considerably above the therapeutic range. Co-administration of FF with VI does not significantly affect VI pharmacokinetics <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Consequently, the effects of FF/VI on the QTc interval are considered to be attributable to the VI component and indicative of the QTc effects of VI administered alone at the same doses.</p><p>Single-dose moxifloxacin (400&#x02009;mg) was included as a positive control in the present study in accordance with guidelines <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19]</xref>. The magnitude, time course and duration of the increase QTcF was comparable to that reported in a meta-analysis of several TQT studies <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and clearly demonstrated assay sensitivity according to the established criteria <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Thorough QT studies should ensure that dose&#x02013;response and concentration&#x02013;response relationships for QTc prolongation are fully characterized, including exploration of concentrations higher than those anticipated in therapeutic use <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19]</xref>. Fluticasone furoate and VI are both extensively metabolized <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">[46</xref>,<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47]</xref>, and high systemic exposure could occur at therapeutic doses in conditions of metabolic impairment. In the present study, a high FF/VI strength (800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) was selected, which represented a fourfold multiple of the proposed highest therapeutic strength (200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) and produced systemic VI exposure that is likely to be considerably above that seen in subjects with asthma or COPD, particularly as VI exposure (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) is lower in these patient groups than in healthy subjects <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Systemic exposure to FF and VI following administration of FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g was also greater than would be anticipated following administration of the highest therapeutic strength of FF/VI (200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) in conditions of metabolic impairment in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, or in healthy subjects administered the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">[48</xref>,<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49]</xref>. These data provide reassurance that a lack of effect of FF/VI on the QTc interval would be anticipated in clinical use.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that FF/VI at a therapeutic strength of 200/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g does not have a significant effect on the QTc interval as measured by either QTcF or QTci. Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, at a fourfold multiple of this strength (800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g), was associated with transient heart rate changes and produced a small, predictable and transient effect on QTcF during the first hour after dosing. However, there was no significant effect of FF/VI 800/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g on QTci, indicating that the effects observed at this strength were dependent on the QT correction method applied rather than the effect on the QTc interval, <italic>per se</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>These studies were funded by GlaxoSmithKline: study number FFR101888 (trial conducted prior to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrial.gov">http://ClinicalTrial.gov</ext-link> registration requirements) and study number HZA102936 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT01209026).
