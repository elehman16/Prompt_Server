Non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the posterior temporo-parietal cortex has been suggested to enhance this process. However, previous studies employed standard tDCS set-ups that induce diffuse current flow in the brain, preventing the attribution of stimulation effects to the target region. This study employed high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) that allowed the current flow to be constrained to the temporo-parietal cortex, to clarify its role in novel word learning. In a sham-controlled, double-blind, between-subjects design, 50 healthy adults learned associations between legal non-words and unfamiliar object pictures. Participants were stratified by baseline learning ability on a short version of the learning paradigm and pairwise randomized to active (20&#x02009;mins; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) or sham (40&#x02009;seconds; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) HD-tDCS. Accuracy was comparable during the baseline and experimental phases in both HD-tDCS conditions. However, active HD-tDCS resulted in faster retrieval of correct word-picture pairs. Our findings corroborate the critical role of the temporo-parietal cortex in novel word learning, which has implications for current theories of language acquisition.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Forming associations between words and their referents is an essential component of language acquisition across the lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Enhancing the effectiveness of this process would not only benefit the growing number of people required to learn a second language due to increasing transnational mobility worldwide, but also those who show impairments in this process due to developmental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> or acquired disorders such as post-stroke aphasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Recent studies have suggested that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which uses a weak electrical current to modulate excitability of targeted brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, can improve language functions like verbal fluency, picture naming, grammatical decisions and word list learning in health and disease (for reviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). However, to date, few studies have investigated potential beneficial effects of tDCS on novel word learning, which serves as an experimental proxy for verbal associative learning ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Such paradigms require participants to establish new associations between objects (either familiar or unfamiliar) and novel word forms (i.e., legal non-words), a process that is supported by a widespread network of brain regions including the medial temporal lobe and fronto-temporal and parietal cortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Except for studies that investigated action word learning and stimulated the primary motor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, all previous tDCS studies employing novel word learning paradigms in healthy young and older individuals targeted the posterior temporo-parietal cortex (CP5 of the EEG 10&#x02013;20 system)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This region was chosen here as well because of its importance in word-form processing and phonological working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Despite differences regarding the experimental paradigms (e.g., explicit vs. implicit learning, real vs. abstract vs. blurred objects), mode of retrieval (e.g., spontaneous naming vs. receptive matching tasks) or stimulation parameters (e.g., intensity, duration, timing of tDCS), excitatory &#x0201c;anodal&#x0201d; tDCS of this region in the left hemisphere improved learning success for novel picture-word association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. One recent study though, reported improvement only in healthy elderly but not young participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Importantly, all previous studies employed the so-called &#x0201c;conventional tDCS set-up&#x0201d; where the current was projected between two electrodes attached over the target region (anode: left CP5) and the right fronto-polar cortex (reference electrode). Such set-ups do not allow for the attribution of stimulation effects to the target region, because the current may affect regions in between the two electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, including parts of the domain general &#x0201c;multi-demand cortex&#x0201d;, which has been shown to be important for novel word learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, except for one study that used a larger fronto-polar reference electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which renders stimulation of this region inefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, the use of a small reference electrode in the remaining studies may have resulted in inhibition of the right prefrontal cortex. Therefore, the locus of the stimulation effect in all previous studies remains unclear.</p><p id="Par5">To this end, the present study investigated for the first time whether focal current delivery by &#x0201c;high-definition&#x0201d; (HD) tDCS to the temporo-parietal cortex can improve novel word learning. We employed an established set-up that uses two concentric rubber electrodes (i.e., a small centre electrode attached over CP5 and a surrounding ring electrode that constrains the current flow to the target region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>). This set-up has recently been shown to result in regionally specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> or task specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> behavioral modulation in other cognitive domains (i.e., inhibitory control, social cognition). Because the set-up is also compatible with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, the secondary goal of this study was to design a paradigm that can easily be implemented in an fMRI environment, to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying potential beneficial HD-tDCS effects in future studies. Our working hypothesis was that excitatory HD-tDCS of the temporo-parietal cortex would improve novel word learning compared to placebo HD-tDCS of the same region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study overview</title><p id="Par6">The study employed a double-blind, sham tDCS controlled, between-subjects design and was conducted at the Centre for Clinical Research of the University of Queensland, Australia.

Stimulation of this region with conventional tDCS improved both implicit and explicit new word learning in healthy young individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The current was ramped up immediately prior to the first training block over 10&#x02009;seconds to 1&#x02009;mA during both stimulation conditions. Afterwards, it remained constant for 20&#x02009;min (anodal tDCS) or 40&#x02009;seconds (sham tDCS) before ramping down (over 10&#x02009;sec). This protocol has been shown to induce effective blinding of participants in the sham tDCS group by inducing a similar physical sensation as active stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Investigator blinding was achieved by the &#x0201c;study mode&#x0201d; of the DC stimulator (i.e., a predefined code triggered active or sham tDCS).

No group differences were found regarding potential mood changes after the end of the stimulation and blinding was equally effective in both groups. Therefore, our positive results cannot be explained by these variables. We will discuss these results in more detail below.</p><p id="Par23">Only a handful of studies had previously explored potential tDCS effects on novel word learning using conventional tDCS montages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. While the experimental procedures and exact stimulation parameters varied substantially, all studies reported beneficial effects of left temporo-parietal cortex stimulation on novel word learning. Of note, Fiori <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> replicated beneficial effects in a group of elderly participants using exactly the same design as in a previous study of the same group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, but failed to show positive stimulation effects in younger adults. However, the relatively simple task that was used in this study (learning of associations between 20 picture and non-word pairings) may have prevented further gains by tDCS and the young group performed close to ceiling levels. Similarly, only studies that involved challenging tasks (e.g., by using large stimulus sets, implicit learning paradigms, serial recall or translation tasks) reported increased accuracy rates due to tDCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, while easier tasks involving fewer stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or easier forced choice decisions between stimuli like the present study mainly resulted in reduced latency of correct responses. Therefore, our results are consistent with previous studies and provide strong evidence that temporo-parietal cortex tDCS can enhance novel word learning in healthy individuals.</p><p id="Par24">However, all previous studies of novel word learning employed conventional tDCS montages, which prevents attributing positive stimulation effects to the target region due to current spread to regions located in between the active and reference electrodes. Moreover, previous studies that combined conventional tDCS with functional brain imaging demonstrated not only local changes in activity at the stimulation site, but also activity modulations in remote regions and networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is likely that functionally connected fronto-temporal language regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> or domain general regions supporting attention and executive control that are important during early stages of vocabulary acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, were affected by tDCS. In addition, the use of small reference electrodes can result in inhibition of the right prefrontal cortex. This may have contributed to improved learning ability, particularly in studies that recruited elderly participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, because hyperactivity of the right prefrontal cortex has been linked to impaired language processing in advanced age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">In contrast, the HD-tDCS set-up that was used in the present study allows for more focal current delivery, as suggested by recent computer simulations of tDCS effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and also a recent functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>). Therefore, the positive effects of HD-tDCS in the present study are unlikely explained by current spread to distant brain regions and our group has recently demonstrated region- and task-specific stimulation effects using the same set-up that was used in the present study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Importantly, temporo-parietal HD-tDCS does not result in current spread to primary or pre-motor cortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. While this makes it unlikely that our results were mediated by facilitation of motor responses, it would have been beneficial to include a control task that assesses potential effects of temporo-parietal HD-tDCS on motor speed.</p><p id="Par26">It also needs to be acknowledged that our study was not designed to test the regional specificity of the stimulation effects. Regionally specific effects of HD-tDCS have recently been demonstrated by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, HD-tDCS of both the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improved conflict adaptation during a visual flanker task. In contrast, HD-tDCS of two control sites (i.e., left and right primary motor cortex) affected neither (a) latency for responses with the hand contralateral to the respective stimulation sites nor (b) conflict adaptation. However, only one of the previous studies that employed conventional temporo-parietal tDCS on novel word learning employed a control site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This study demonstrated more pronounced learning during temporo-parietal stimulation compared to both sham and active right-sided temporo-occipital tDCS, but did not address the specific neural processes that were affected by the stimulation. However, the neurocognitive processes underlying novel word learning have been investigated in numerous behavioral and imaging studies (for review see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>). These studies have suggested that the left temporo-parietal cortex is part of a larger &#x0201c;dorsal-audio-motor interface&#x0201d; implicated with the acquisition of new vocabulary by generating sensory representations of novel phonological forms and by a rehearsal process in phonological working memory. For example, there is evidence from functional imaging that the temporo-parietal cortex is activated during phonological encoding and more pronounced activity in this region during subsequent retrieval is positively correlated with memory performance for novel word forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In line with these findings, Takashima <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> have demonstrated that the temporo-parietal cortex is involved in establishing long-term holistic representations of novel words. A recent tDCS study further highlighted the importance of this region in establishing novel word forms in long-term memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These authors were able to demonstrate that conventional tDCS of the left temporo-parietal cortex enhanced phonological stability of newly learned whole word forms indicated by reduced phoneme migrations during a serial word recall task.</p><p id="Par27">While these studies provided evidence for a specific role of the temporo-parietal cortex in establishing novel word forms, it is important to note, that both conventional tDCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and also more targeted stimulation of circumscribed brain regions by transcranial magnetic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> have been shown to affect functionally connected brain regions in imaging studies. Therefore, similar non-localized effects are to be expected for more focal tDCS protocols and future studies are necessary to establish the exact neural locus underlying improved novel word learning due to HD-tDCS. While the design of the present study was not developed to establish the contribution of specific sub processes contributing to enhanced novel word learning, the short block duration with interspersed recognition trial blocks allows portability of the paradigm into an MRI environment. Moreover, our group has recently demonstrated that the HD-tDCS montage used in the present study is safe for use during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This will allow future studies to determine the neural mechanisms underlying effective behavioral modulation by HD-tDCS.</p><p id="Par28">In sum, our results demonstrate that HD-tDCS of the temporo-parietal cortex can enhance access to newly learned words in healthy young individuals. Future studies that combine functional imaging with this novel approach will contribute to establishing the exact locus of (HD-) tDCS action in the human brain.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
