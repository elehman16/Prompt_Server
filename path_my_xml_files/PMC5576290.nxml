Preschool age seems to be decisive for the development of motor skills and probably the most promising time-window in relation to preventive strategies based on improved motor skills. This research program has four overall aims: (1) investigation of the effect of a structured program aimed at improving motor skills in 3&#x02013;6-year-old children on current and future motor skills, health, cognition, and wellbeing; (2) establish reference data on motor skills in 3&#x02013;6-year-olds; (3) description of early development of musculoskeletal problems; and (4) establishment of a population-based cohort of 3&#x02013;6-year-olds.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Over a four-year period, all preschools in a Danish municipality, Svendborg, will implement a new program aimed at optimizing children&#x02019;s motor skills. By introducing the program into a subset of the preschools at onset and comparing these children to another subset (control) that will not receive the intervention the first three years, it is possible to document a potential effect of the intervention. At the same time, a cohort will be established including all children attending preschools in the municipality with extensive baseline data collection: gross and fine motor skills; movement patterns; musculoskeletal complaints; physical activity; anthropometry; general wellbeing; cognitive abilities; language status; medical history; demographic background; and more.</p><p id="Par3">The children are aged 3&#x02013;6 years at baseline. A total of 1461 children have been invited into the cohort, 368 to the intervention arm and 359 to the control arm. Follow-up time for the trial is 2.5&#x000a0;years. The cohort is planned to run at least until the children leave school at age 15&#x02013;16 years. Longer follow-up will depend on future funding.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">If the results of the trial are positive, the intervention can be implemented in other similar settings with reasonable ease and at a relatively low initial cost. This is due to the extensive end-user involvement, the broad population base, and the pragmatic nature of the intervention. The cohort will provide important information about the influence of early motor skills on children&#x02019;s development across many domains and the potential interactions between these domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ISRCTN registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN23701994">ISRCTN23701994</ext-link>.

Several projects have been implemented both by municipalities and by larger sports organizations. For example, Sport Confederation Denmark has developed a program to improve motor skills in preschool children in cooperation with the YMCA and this is currently being offered to more than 40,000 children across Denmark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rendoghop.info/">http://www.rendoghop.info/</ext-link>). Therefore, it seems timely to initiate scientific investigations into the effectiveness and potential benefits of such programs.</p><p id="Par18">Good motor skills are considered important for children&#x02019;s physical, social, and psychological development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and may even be the foundation for an active lifestyle, since several studies have shown a positive association between good motor skills and higher levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consequently, there is evidence of many health benefits to be gained from an improvement in motor skills. For instance, it has been demonstrated that good motor skills positively influence cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as sports participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], all suggesting that early competency in motor skills may have important health implications. Furthermore, there are indications of relationships with language development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and general wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, most of the existing studies of motor performance are either cross-sectional, and therefore do not provide evidence of a potential causal relationship, or they include only short-term follow-up. Thus, there is a real need for more longitudinal studies on the importance of motor skills with long-term follow-up, including both physical and psychological outcomes.</p><p id="Par19">There are indications that the level of motor skills remains stable over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and motor development deficits observed in early childhood are still apparent in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, toddler and preschool age appears to be a particularly important period for the development of motor skills. Early childhood is also the age where practicing fundamental movement skills is necessary to create a foundation for more complex movement activities of daily living, recreation, and sports in later childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Denmark, 92% of all 3&#x02013;5-year-old children spend a high proportion of their waking hours at preschool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consequently, this arena provides an ideal opportunity for all children, despite socioeconomic background, to develop and improve their motor skills.</p><p id="Par20">The Municipality of Svendborg has previously conducted the CHAMPS-DK study (The Svendborg Project) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in cooperation with the University of Southern Denmark, which was a field experiment investigating the effect of more physical education in primary schools. This project was concluded in 2014 and, among other findings, demonstrated that more physical education in school improved bone development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], reduced cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], reduced the prevalence of overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and improved physical fitness in those with a low baseline level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As a result, more physical education lessons have been added to the schedule of all schools within the Municipality. The Municipality is comparable to the rest of Denmark in terms of age distribution, gender, and income, but with a slightly higher unemployment rate (5.3% vs. 4.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; therefore, the results will be transferable to the rest of the country.</p><p id="Par21">Understanding the importance, but also the challenge, of early prevention, the Municipality is now ready to continue the evidence-based improvement of children&#x02019;s lives and has initiated an intervention in its preschools aimed at improving motor skills in children. Once more, the Municipality is focused on increasing the evidence base through scientific investigation and has proposed a partnership where the Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics (DSSCB) at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) develop and manage the scientific design and evaluation of the project &#x02013; creating the unique research opportunities outlined in this protocol.</p><p id="Par22">The effectiveness of the intervention will be investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) focused on improvement in motor skills as well as several secondary effects. Importantly, the extensive testing of these children at an early age will form the basis of a cohort with potential for long-term follow-up, which will enable investigations into the long-term development of motor skills, musculoskeletal disorders, physical activity, language, cognitive abilities, and social skills as well as the interrelations between these domains. In addition, the predictive ability of early markers for child development and health within these domains can be assessed. Thus, in addition to assessing the effectiveness of the intervention developed for this project, we will provide an evidence base for future strategies for optimizing children&#x02019;s health, wellbeing, and cognitive and language development. Research plans for each of these individual domains are described in separate work packages (WPs) in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par23">The four overall aims of this research program are to: (1) establish a population-based cohort of 3&#x02013;6-year-olds with a focus on the relationship between motor skills, health, cognition, and wellbeing; (2) establish population-based reference data on motor skills in 3&#x02013;6-year-olds; (3) describe early development of musculoskeletal problems; and (4) investigate whether a structured program aimed at improving motor skills in 3&#x02013;6-year-old children will improve current and future motor skills, health, cognition, and wellbeing</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par24">Since this study includes both a cohort study and a RCT nested within that cohort, the method section is divided into two sections for clarity.

In August 2016, this involved 1461 children attending 32 preschools. In Denmark, children start preschool when they turn three years of age and leave preschool in July of the calendar year they turn six years, i.e. the sample were born in 2011, 2012, or 2013. All parents received written information about the project and were invited to information meetings at local schools or preschools during the spring of 2016. Written consent forms were submitted to the children&#x02019;s respective preschools before September, 2016. Following the initial inclusion, there is running inclusion into the study. By December 19, 2016, the parents of 865 children (59%) had agreed to participate in the study</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par46">All children attending the municipal preschools were eligible, pending parental consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data collection methods</title><p id="Par47">Trained research staff will collect data from physical testing during test sessions.

This was done by a statistician at the SDU.</p><p id="Par73">The randomization resulted in eight preschools, including a total of 368 children, in the intervention group and nine preschools, including a total of 359 children, in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par74">We are not aware of any previous studies using the same test in the same age groups and therefore a power calculation for the RCT was performed using data from related studies. The standard deviations of the change in motor skills was based on a study of Danish overweight children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which used the same motor assessment as in this study (Movement Assessment Battery for Children), and the clustering effect was estimated based on a previous study in Danish preschools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Based on the recommendations by In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the effect size was expressed as standard deviations units, since exact prior knowledge is not available. He states: &#x0201c;When prior knowledge for the calculation of the standardized effect size is not sufficient, a commonly applied effect size is 0.25&#x02013;0.50, which was initially suggested by Cohen and which is still important&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Hence, we intended to recruit a sample large enough to detect a reduction in the standard deviation score of 0.30 with a power of 80% at a significance level of 5%. Correlation within preschools and hence the loss of efficiency because of clustering was taken into account by adjusting for intraclass correlation (ICC) in the primary sampling units (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015). This correlation was based on our previous, but unpublished, experience in a similar setting of preschools in Denmark. This power calculation resulted in a required number of 468 participants. Such a calculation should be considered with caution since the underlying estimates of variance and cluster effects are not directly transferable. However, the population size seems sensible in comparison to other trials investigating motor activities in preschools. Piek et al. included almost the same, 501 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], whereas Roth et al. investigated the effect of a physical activity intervention in preschools in a somewhat larger sample of 709 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
