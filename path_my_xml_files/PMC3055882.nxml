potent immunomodulator. The aim of this study was to investigate the
possible effect of atorvastatin on the decline of residual beta cell
function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>The randomised placebo-controlled Diabetes and Atorvastatin (DIATOR) Trial
included 89 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and islet
autoantibodies (mean age 30 years, 40&#x00025; females), in 12 centres in
Germany. Patients received placebo or 80 mg/d atorvastatin for 18 months. As
primary outcome stimulated serum C-peptide levels were determined 90 min
after a standardized liquid mixed meal. An intent-to-treat analysis was
performed. Fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels were not significantly
different between groups at 18 months. However, median fasting serum
C-peptide levels dropped from baseline to 12 and 18 months in the placebo
group (from 0. 34 to 0.23 and 0.20 nmol/l, p&#x0003c;0.001) versus a
nonsignificant decline in the atorvastatin group (from 0.34 to 0.27 and 0.30
nmol/l, ns). Median stimulated C-peptide concentrations declined between
baseline and 12 months (placebo from 0.89 to 0.71 nmol/l, atorvastatin from
0.88 to 0.73 nmol/l, p&#x0003c;0.01 each) followed by a major loss by month 18 in
the placebo group (to 0.48 nmol/l, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.047) but not
in the atorvastatin group (to 0.71 nmol/l, ns). Median levels of total
cholesterol and C-reactive protein decreased in the atorvastatin group only
(p&#x0003c;0.001 and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). Metabolic control was
similar between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Atorvastatin treatment did not significantly preserve beta cell function
although there may have been a slower decline of beta-cell function which
merits further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00974740">NCT00974740</ext-link>

the decline of residual beta cell function <xref rid="pone.0017554-The1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Recent trials which reported a
delay in disease progression include autologous stem cell therapy, treatment with
immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies or vaccination with disease-associated
autoantigens (see ref.2). The latter approach did not cause recognizable
treatment-related adverse effects. Statins have been considered as immunomodulary
agents because of their ability to suppress the expression of adhesion molecules and
MHC class II molecules as well as of inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive
protein <xref rid="pone.0017554-Blank1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017554-Bonnet1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The inhibition
of T-cell activation involves the blockade of the interaction between T-lymphocytes
and antigen presenting cells by binding to an adhesion molecule involved in this
process, LFA-1 <xref rid="pone.0017554-WeitzSchmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Soluble forms of ICAM-1 &#x02013; the natural receptor of
LFA-1- were found to be decreased in recent onset type 1 diabetic patients <xref rid="pone.0017554-Lampeter1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and to inhibit
type 1 diabetes specific autoantigen T-cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0017554-Roep1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, administration of
recombinant forms of soluble ICAM-1 was effective in inhibiting insulitis and
diabetes-development in NOD mice <xref rid="pone.0017554-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Atorvastatin showed beneficial effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0017554-McCarey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and in
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis <xref rid="pone.0017554-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Another trial reported an
increase of disease activity for the combination of atorvastatin with
interferon-&#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0017554-Birnbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> whereas one subsequent trial did not find such an adverse
effect <xref rid="pone.0017554-Rudick1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A
third trial reported better outcomes for the combination of atorvastatin with
interferon-&#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0017554-Lanzillo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The possible beneficial effect of statin therapy on the beta cell destructive process

type 1 diabetes screened were identified as eligible. Despite an extension of the
recruitment period and of the number of participating centers the goal of 160
patients was not reached. The decision to stop screening was made by the Study
Committee based on the low recruitment rate of the last 12 months, while still being
blinded for patient allocation to treatment groups. After randomization two patients
in the placebo group were excluded because of not having met the inclusion criteria
of at least one islet autoantibody, leaving 87 patients for the intent-to-treat
analysis. In total, 78&#x00025; of patients completed the visit at 12 months and

mean values increased and were no more different from baseline at 18 months

groups were not significant at either 12 or 18 months. Mean daily insulin dose
increased in the atorvastatin group from 0.32 IU/kg at baseline to 0.48 IU/kg at
18 months, and in the placebo group from 0.33 to 0.44 IU/kg (both p&#x0003c;0.001).
The rise in insulin dose was more rapid in the atorvastatin group, resulting in
a higher dose at 12 months compared to the placebo group,

1&#x02013;1.7 years in 3 cases: 1 case of myalgia and myopathia (atorvastatin), 1
of arthralgia (placebo) and 1 of increased CPK serum levels (atorvastatin).
Medication was temporarily discontinued in 7 cases because of symptoms lasting
between 1 and 28 days (atorvastatin: Helicobacter infection, bilious colic in
patient with gallstone predisposition, swollen lids with headache, back pain
after moving into a new domicile, respiratory infection with fever; placebo:
muscle pain, blood in stool) Permanent discontinuation of atorvastatin occurred
in three persons, after temporary treatment halt because of intestinal cramps,
because of mildly elevated hepatic enzyme levels or because of neurological
symptoms. In the atorvastatin group, 18 patients (39.1&#x00025;) reported 64
adverse events vs. 15 patients (34.9&#x00025;) with 31 adverse events in the
placebo group. In the atorvastatin group 9 of the 64 adverse events in 7
patients were rated as &#x0201c;possibly&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;probably&#x0201d; related
to medication, vs. 4 of the 28 adverse events in 4 placebo patients (difference
not significant). Five events in 4 patients of the atorvastatin group and 3
events in 3 patients of the placebo group were classified as severe adverse
events; none was classified as &#x0201c;possibly&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;probably&#x0201d;
related to medication. All patients recovered or were stabilized. CPK levels
were elevated in 16 patients of the atorvastatin and in 6 patients of the
placebo group. However, in most cases these elevations were of mild character
(maximum 405 U/l in the atorvastatin vs. 321 U/l in the placebo group) and
critical serum levels of &#x0003e;10 times of the upper normal range (i.e. &#x0003e;2000
U/l) were never observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The trial did not find a significant effect of atorvastatin treatment with regard to
the primary endpoint, i.e. the comparison of stimulated C-peptide concentrations
between groups at 18 months. Also, the two groups did not differ significantly with
regard to fasting C-peptide levels. In both cases, median C-peptide concentrations
were around 50&#x00025; higher in the atorvastatin than the placebo group at 18
months, but this difference failed to be significant because of an unexpectedly
large range or standard deviation of C-peptide concentrations measured, in both
groups. In this regard, a major limitation of the trial is that the actual number of
patients recruited was lower than foreseen in the study protocol (total 89 vs.
160).</p><p>As secondary analysis we compared median C-peptide concentrations over the study
period within a group. There was a significant deterioration of residual beta cell
function in the placebo group but not the atorvastatin group. In the placebo group,
median fasting C-peptide concentrations decreased from baseline by 32&#x00025; at 12
months and by 41&#x00025; at 18 months (p&#x0003c;0.001), whereas there was no significant
change in the atorvastatin group. Median stimulated C-peptide concentrations
decreased mildly in both groups by 12 months (by 20&#x00025; in the placebo group and
by 17&#x00025; in the atorvastatin group, p&#x0003c;0.01 each). At 18 months median
C-peptide concentrations had further decreased (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.046),
total decrease by 46&#x00025; of baseline, whereas there was no further deterioration
in the atorvastatin group, total decrease by 19&#x00025;.</p><p>These differences were not reflected by lower insulin doses in the atorvastatin
group. Rather, there was a more rapid increase of insulin dosing leading to
significantly higher insulin doses at 12 months although not at 18 months. Some
types of statins have been reported to increase or decrease insulin resistance but a
consistent effect was not noted for atorvastatin in a recent meta-analysis <xref rid="pone.0017554-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Partial
preservation of residual beta cell function is considered as clinically relevant
goal also in the absence of lower insulin requirements, because of a lower risk of
complications <xref rid="pone.0017554-Kolb1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,
<xref rid="pone.0017554-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Since beta cell function is affected by the concentration of glucose at the start of
the test, the study protocol requested that no mixed meal test should be performed
if fasting blood glucose was outside 4&#x02013;11 mmol/l. However, even in this
concentration range, ambient glucose may affect the outcome of beta cell function
tests, as suggest by the recent international workshop comparing the liquid mixed
meal with the glucagon assay <xref rid="pone.0017554-Greenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. There was an inverse relationship between fasting blood
glucose and subsequent peak C-peptide concentrations following the liquid mixed
meal. This means that the higher HbA1c levels (and consequently higher mean fasting
blood glucose levels) in the atorvastatin group at 12 and 18 months probably has led
to a lower C-peptide response, and hence has downsized the difference between the
two groups. Unfortunately, there is no algorithm or formula for adjusting C-peptide
responses for ambient glucose.</p><p>As expected, regular intake of atorvastatin caused a decrease of total and
LDL-cholesterol levels in serum, a decrease of triglyceride levels and a small
increase of HDL-cholesterol levels. Median concentrations of CRP were low at
baseline, but were further lowered by statin treatment. All of these effects are
consequences of inhibiting the synthesis of mevalonate from acetyl coenzyme A by
hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. This is a rate limiting step in
cholesterol synthesis, and the mevalonate pathway gives rise to a number of
compounds such as farnesyl or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate which can modify several
transcription factors controlling cell growth, endothelial activity and immune gene
expression <xref rid="pone.0017554-Blank1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,
<xref rid="pone.0017554-Kwak1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0017554-Montecucco1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The
amelioration of the lipid status by atorvastatin treatment may be considered
advantageous, independent of the slowed loss of beta cell function. The decrease in
systemic CRP levels may indicate a dampening of inflammatory processes, although our
analysis of circulating concentrations of 14 different immune mediators, including
soluble adhesion molecules, cytokines, a cytokine antagonist and chemokines did not
reveal statin-treatment associated changes. This argues against a major effect on
systemic immune reactivity but does not exclude that statin treatment affects
islet-antigen specific cellular immunity, e.g. through an increase of regulatory
T-cell functions in pancreatic islets or draining lymph nodes. Indeed, statin
blockade of the mevalonate pathway has been observed to promote the generation of
Foxp3 positive regulatory T-cells in mice and a shift from autoaggressive Th1 to
more benign Th2 immunity <xref rid="pone.0017554-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0017554-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Atorvastatin-induced Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor 2
expression may be a critical event for these effects <xref rid="pone.0017554-Bu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Besides the immunomodulatory
properties atorvastatin may also target pancreatic islets. A recent study in
streptozotocin treated rat pups reported an increase in the number of small islets
following atorvastatin treatment, suggestive of neogenesis. Since angiogenesis
preceded the increase in beta cell mass, target of atorvastatin may be the
endothelium <xref rid="pone.0017554-Marchand1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Atorvastatin was generally well tolerated. Dose reductions or temporary
discontinuation of treatment were reported in 8 cases, in three cases treatment was
permanently discontinued. Elevation of CPK levels were observed more often in the
atorvastatin than in the placebo group (35 vs 14&#x00025;) but did not reach critical
levels of &#x0003e;2000 U/l.</p><p>In summary, we report that treatment with atorvastatin over 18 months was safe and
well tolerated in adult patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. At 18 months,
the atorvastatin group did not exhibit significantly higher fasting or stimulated
C-peptide concentrations than the placebo group. Secondary analyses of the course of
C-peptide secretion within groups found some preservation of fasting and stimulated
serum C-peptide concentrations in the atorvastatin but not the placebo group. A
comparison with results from the ongoing trial of atorvastatin in children and
adolescents with type 1 diabetes (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number
NCT00529191) will help to judge the potential of this treatment modality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and

patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes were screened for eligibility. In
accordance with current guidelines this new treatment modality was first tried
in adult patients. Inclusion criteria were insulin requiring diabetes for two
weeks to 3 months, tested positive for at least one islet autoantibody (to
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65, to insulinoma-associated antigen (IA)-2 or
islet cell antibodies (ICA)), age 18&#x02013;39 years. Female patients were to use
contraceptive methods. Major exclusion criteria were concomitant other diseases,
use of anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering or antidiabetic drugs
other than insulin, a serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level &#x0003e;5 times the
upper limit of normal, a serum LDL-cholesterol level &#x0003e;150 mg/dl or any other
conditions considered relevant by the investigator. All patients were of
Caucasian ethnicity.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Procedure</title><p>The study was a Phase I trial conducted as randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, outpatient, parallel group study. Patients were assigned to
treatment with either atorvastatin or placebo for a period of 18 months in a
one-to-one manner using a computer-generated randomization list, with
stratification for participating centers. The starting atorvastatin dose was 40
mg/d or a matching number of placebo tablets. After 4 weeks, the dose was
increased to 80 mg/d or matching placebo. Counts of unused tablets were
performed and did not indicate a lack of compliance, defined by &#x0003e;20&#x00025;
of tablets returned on two consecutive visits. During the study, the
investigators were advised to reduce the dose to 40 mg/d in case of side-effects
(e.g. myalgia). Insulin treatment was continued throughout the study with a
recommended treatment goal of HbA1c below 6.5&#x00025; from 3 months on.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Follow-up and Outcome Measures</title><p>Patients attended visits at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, without food intake for
the preceding 10 hours. Primary outcome was stimulated C-peptide secretion,
assessed as serum C-peptide concentrations after a standardised liquid mixed
meal (Boost HP&#x000ae; (Mead Johnson, Evansville, IN, USA), 6 ml per kg body weight
with a maximum of 360 ml) which was performed at months 0, 12 and 18. Patients
had to refrain from alcohol intake and unaccustomed strenuous physical activity
for 48 hours prior to the test. In the morning, a capillary blood glucose
measurement was done and the test was performed if fasting blood glucose was
&#x02265;4 mmol/l and &#x02264;11.1 mmol/l. The test was performed in the morning between
7 and 10 a.m. The patient should not have taken any short-acting insulin at
least 6 hours prior to the test. A first blood sample was drawn five minutes, a
second one immediately before the liquid meal was taken in (mean value as formal
&#x0201c;time zero&#x0201d;). The test meal had to be ingested within 5 minutes.
Another blood sample was drawn after 90 min, following the guideline of the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial <xref rid="pone.0017554-The2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A recent international
workshop found a good correlation between measuring C-peptide levels at this
single time point versus determining the area under the curve <xref rid="pone.0017554-Greenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Primary
outcome measure was stimulated serum C-peptide levels at 12 or 18 months. Serum
glucose, C-peptide (immunoenzymatic assay, Biosource/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany), lipid and immune parameters were analyzed in a central laboratory.</p><p>C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were determined by an immunonephelometric
assay <xref rid="pone.0017554-Herder1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>,
all other immune mediators were measured by double-antibody ELISA (sICAM-1,
E-selectin, IL-6, IL-1ra, IFN&#x003b3;, eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-4, MIP-1&#x003b2;, MDC,
TARC) or bead-based multiplex technology (IL-18, MCP-1, IL-8) <xref rid="pone.0017554-Herder2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. GAD65 and
IA-2 antibodies were determined by radioligand binding assay (CentAK anti-GAD65,
CentAK anti-IA-2, Medipan, Berlin, Germany). ICA was determined by
immunofluorescent staining on human AB- positive pancreatic sections as
described <xref rid="pone.0017554-HanifiMoghaddam1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The immune laboratory participated in
Standardization Workshops DASP 2009 of the International Diabetes Society with
following results: GAD antibody sensitivity 0.72; specificity 0.91; IA-2
antibody sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.96.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Based on data on C-peptide levels from patient files of the German Diabetes
Center it was calculated that for the primary endpoint 80 patients per group
would allow to recognize a 20&#x00025; difference between study groups in median
stimulated serum C-peptide levels at 18 months with a type 1 error of
&#x0003c;1&#x00025;, power 95&#x00025;. For the actual number of patients recruited,
the p-value was &#x0003c;0.05, power 80&#x00025;. All patients who received at least
one dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. The
statistical evaluation (intent-to-treat analysis) was performed by using
validated software (SAS Version 9.2). Tests for normal distribution were
performed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Values with (log-)normal distribution are given
as mean/SD, comparisons between groups were made with unpaired t-test or ANOVA,
or by paired t-test within groups; F-test was used to check whether or not
variances were equal and appropriate tests were used: pooled variance test if
variances were equal, Satterthwaite test if variances were unequal. Comparisons
between groups included all patients, for comparisons within a group only those
patients could be included where baseline and later data were available. Values
without normal distribution are given as median and interquartile range
(compared between groups with Mann-Whitney u-test, within groups with Wilcoxon
signed rank test) Dichotomous/categorical variables are given as proportions
(Fisher's exact or Chi-square test). Missing data were not substituted.
Exploratory analyses were performed for patient subgroups below or above median
age, BMI, stimulated or fasting C-peptide at baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0017554.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0017554.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0017554.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0017554.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Scherbaum for support and all patients, physicians, study nurses and
