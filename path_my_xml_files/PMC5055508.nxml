Medication studies are especially important for drugs with narrow therapeutic index, specific indication, high costs as well as for drugs with widespread use. Intravenous pantoprazole always ranked among the top 5 costly drugs in Amir-al-Momenin Hospital. Considering the fact that widespread and inappropriate use of this drug is considered as a concern in hospitals all over the world rather than being a regional problem, we decided to establish a guideline for intravenous (IV) pantoprazole in our hospital and evaluated the pattern of its administration both before and after establishing the guideline.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is an experimental study (clinical trial) performed at the Amir-al-Momenin Hospital, on 400 randomly selected patients receiving IV pantoprazole (bolus or infusion) during a 6-month period (3&#x000a0;months before and 3&#x000a0;months after establishing guideline). We used predesigned data collection forms to collect related information. We used SPSS Ver. 18 for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results showed that the established guideline could significantly reduce the rate (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.00) and cost (301,289,000 Rials or 8608 USD in 3&#x000a0;months study period after establishing guideline) of IV pantoprazole administration, but failed to rectify indications and dosage of its administration at the same rate. Stress ulcer prophylaxis was the most frequent approved indication for IV pantoprazole administration in our study population. We also observed that the rate of commitment to the guideline decreased by the time passed from its establishment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We concluded that although establishing guideline was successful in reducing the overall rate of IV pantoprazole administration and its related costs, different contributing factors halted its effect on correcting the prescribed dosage and indications, especially as the time gaps from guideline establishment. This fact magnifies the importance of continuous educations of prescribers about the importance of evidence based practice and need for and implementing a powerful executive supervisory in our hospital.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>IV pantoprazole</kwd><kwd>Drug use evaluation</kwd><kwd>Guideline</kwd><kwd>Audit</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Zabol university of medical sciences</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Drug use evaluation (DUE) studies are systematic methods of obtaining information to identify drug related problems, ranging from doctors&#x02019; orders to nurses&#x02019; administration, with the aim of optimization of drug use patterns especially in hospitals. DUEs are important contributors of rational drug use (Chomsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). Based on World Health Organization (WHO) definition &#x0201c;Drug use evaluation (DUE) is a system of ongoing, systematic, criteria-based evaluation of drug use that will help ensure that medicines are used appropriately (at the individual patient level)&#x0201d; (Hepler and Strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1990</xref>). These types of studies are especially important for drugs with narrow therapeutic index, specific indications, or for expensive or widely administered drugs (Moore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>).</p><p>Pantoprazole is a proton pomp inhibitor (PPIs) with both oral and intravenous (IV) dosage forms. Results of different studies showed that despite more rapid onset of action in IV pantoprazole, both dosage forms (oral and intravenous) can reduce gastric acid secretion to the same extent (O <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). The decision to select an appropriate dosage form depends on several factors; such as patient&#x02019;s ability to take oral medication, patient&#x02019;s hemodynamic status as well as intestinal permeability and absorptive capacity (Pang and Graham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). These factors often should be considered especially in critically ill patients when pantoprazole is indicated for either treating an acid secreting disorder or prophylaxis of stress related mucosal injury (Pang and Graham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>).</p><p>Intravenous pantoprazole was first marketed in Canada in 1999, since then it has been used for treatment of different pathological conditions in which rapid reduction of gastric acid is required (Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>).</p><p>Currently it is the only IV proton-pump inhibitor commercially available in North America as well as our country, so it is not surprising that this drug is widely used in hospitals. Inappropriate and unsupervised use of IV pantoprazole can lead to unwanted consequences such as increased treatment cost, adverse effects related to injection and increasing the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections (CDI) (Pang and Graham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>).</p><p>As IV pantoprazole always ranked among the 5 top high costs drugs in our hospital, also, considering the significant difference between the price of IV pantoprazole with other therapeutic options (capsules of pantoprazole, parenteral ranitidine) as well as potential complications associated with unsupervised administration of parenteral formulations and its indirect cost, we established a guideline and evaluated the pattern of its administration in our hospital, both before and after guideline establishment. Our aim was to optimize drug administration, decrease our therapeutic cost and measure the effectiveness of guideline establishment as a potential solution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>After being approved by ethics committee of Zabol University of Medical Sciences, about 400 patients receiving IV pantoprazole (bolus or infusion) during a 6-month period, both before (as control group) and after (as intervention group) establishing a medical guideline for administration of IV pantoprazole, were randomly selected (from total of 1150 patients who were prescribed IV pantoprazole in this period). This guideline was prepared by our pharmacy department and took the approval on January 2015 by the hospital Drug and Therapeutic (D&#x00026;T) Committee to be implemented. The guideline was mailed to all physicians who work in our hospital with an official cover letter signed by the hospital manager about the necessity of commitment to the approved guideline. An educational class was also conducted by the pharmacy department for doctors and nurses, separately.</p><p>Patients were randomly selected from the inpatient pharmacy computer database at the Amir-al-Momenin Hospital (affiliated to Zabol University of Medical Sciences).

The costs of IV pantoprazole therapy in 3&#x000a0;months period before guideline establishment was 646166000 Rials (18462 USD) compared to 344877000 Rials (9853 USD) in the post intervention period, with a potential cost savings of 301289000 Rials (8608 USD).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study indicated that although establishment of administration guideline for this drug, could significantly reduce the overall frequency of IV pantoprazole administration and its total costs, but could not correct indications and dosage of prescribed IV pantoprazole effectively. Comparison of our results with other similar trials, for example those conducted in Canada (Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>), showed that the rate of inappropriate administration of this drug did not significantly decrease after guideline establishment in our study as well as Canadian study. However our achievement rate in decreasing administration of pantoprazole through guideline establishment was even lower comparing with Canadian study (appropriate IV pantoprazole administration rate of 29&#x000a0;% in Canada after guideline establishment compare to about 11&#x000a0;% in our study). It justifies further investigation about the potential causes of this failure in our hospital.</p><p>As we discussed before, intravenous pantoprazole was widely used with disapproved indications in our hospital like what has been reported from other parts of the world, which unexplained abdominal pain was the most prevalent mentioned indication in patient&#x02019;s charts of this group of patients. Unfortunately, the exact cause of abdominal pain was not thoroughly investigated in the majority of patients. Besides, doctors commonly preferred parenteral formulation over oral dosage form maybe due to the unrealistic fear of under&#x02013;treatment with oral formulation of this drug or even H2 blockers. These two facts lead to overuse of intravenous pantoprazole administration and its overall costs (Lai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>).</p><p>Prevention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients taking Clopidogrel and/or ASA was the second most prevalent unapproved indication for prescribing intravenous pantoprazole in our study population. American heart association and American College of Cardiology in 2007 suggested gastric acid suppression for the prevention of GI bleeding in patients taking antiplatelet therapy,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> but since PPIS have the potential to inhibit cyp2c19isoenzymes, they may interact with Clopidogrel effects. This fact makes H2 antagonist first choice for this indication (Skledar and Culley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, all patients admitted with diagnoses of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) initially received IV pantoprazole recommended by the guideline. But similar to some other studies, before the guideline establishment, doctors ignored to discontinue intravenous pantoprazole in whom endoscopic findings were not indicative of bleeding (Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>; Cornish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>; Jutabha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>; Wilkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). This contributes to increase the rate of inappropriate use of this drug. This audit revealed that upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) was performed in only 50&#x000a0;% of patients with suspected UGIB post intervention (vs 42.9 pre intervention). The data obtained reported from many Canadian centers, similarly revealed that in patients admitted with diagnoses of UGIB, IV pantoprazole is often commenced before the results of endoscopy is available, and continued regardless of endoscopic findings (Leape et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>). Also another study performed in Colombia, showed that 57&#x000a0;% of patients presenting UGIB received IV pantoprazole before the result of endoscopy is available (Tsoi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). These findings are contrary to some other studies which showed uses of IV pantoprazole were based on the result of UGIE (Alsultan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>).</p><p>Evaluation of the outcome of the patients was not one of our goals in our study; hence, we did not observe any gastrointestinal complication such as bleeding during the study period. However, we indicated in our study that most of our patients were prescribed pantoprazole without scientific indication.</p><p>Admittedly, in this study we unfortunately observed that as time passes from guideline establishment, the rate of its effectiveness decreases continuously. We believe that the lack of continuous supervisory interventions by our pharmacy department, for example because of the shortage of trained active pharmacist in the hospital is an important contributor.</p><p>Finally, we believe that the major limitation of this study was that we merely relied on the medical records of patients. Consequently, any limitation in documenting process of patient&#x02019;s charts could interfere with our final results. Another limitation was that we focused on IV pantoprazole instead of pantoprazole. Other studies are recommended to evaluate pantoprazole usage in the educational hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that although guideline establishment is an effective tool for rational drug use in hospitals, it does not necessarily guarantee appropriate drug administration. The promotion of prescriber knowledge about evidence-based medicine and update national and international guidelines on drug administration through continuous educational programs as well as implementing powerful executive constitutions in hospitals, are other important contributing factors that can influence the rate of guideline achievement.</p><p> At the end, some suggestions based on our experience in our hospital, for increasing compliance to the guideline there are two ways. First, in our hospital, the cost of the inappropriate prescription of the expensive drugs was charged on the prescribers for a while. It was effective in decreasing the costs. It could be continued until the complete establishment of the guideline. Second, we designed a form for expensive drugs such as pantoprazole in which the physicians should sign by mentioning the indication for the prescription of drug. It was effective in improving the appropriate prescription of the drugs (it is under study). This might be effective and should be evaluated in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APT</term><def><p>antiplatelet therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>acetyl salicylic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASHP</term><def><p>American Society of Health System Pharmacists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDI</term><def><p>clostridium difficile infections</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DUE</term><def><p>drug use evaluation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D&#x00026;T</term><def><p>drug and therapeutic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EE</term><def><p>erosive esophagitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GERD</term><def><p>gastroesophageal reflux disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GI</term><def><p>gastrointestinal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INR</term><def><p>International Normalized Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p>intravenous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPO</term><def><p>nothing by mouth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPI</term><def><p>proton pump inhibitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTT</term><def><p>partial thromboplastin time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PZ</term><def><p>pantoprazole</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PUD</term><def><p>peptic ulcer disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBP</term><def><p>spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUP</term><def><p>stress ulcer prophylaxis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>statistical package for social sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UGIB</term><def><p>upper gastrointestinal bleeding</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UGIE</term><def><p>upper gastrointestinal endoscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USA</term><def><p>United States of America</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Antiplatelet therapy (APT) has been found to reduce the risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis following acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention.
