Patients are also frequently disturbed by recession owing to sensitivity and esthetics. Gingival recession is the exposure of the root surface by an apical shift in the position of the gingival.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The term &#x0201c;marginal tissue recession&#x0201d; was proposed by Maynard and Wilson in 1979[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to indicate the exposure of root surface caused by apical migration of the soft tissue margin. The term was widely accepted because the soft tissue margin may not always be composed of the gingiva; it may even be formed only by the alveolar mucosa in some instances.</p><p>The etiology of marginal tissue recession may be high frenal pull, thin alveolar bone, abrasive and traumatic tooth brushing habits, improper restorations, gingival inflammation, dental calculus, tooth malposition, and self-mutilation or orthodontic tooth movement through a thin buccal osseous plate.</p><p>For many years, the presence of an adequate zone of the gingiva was considered to be critical for the maintenance of gingival health and for the prevention of progressive loss of connective tissue attachment. It is generally acknowledeged that an inadequate zone of gingiva would facilitate subgingival plaque formation as well as the apical spread of plaque-associated gingival lesions. The conclusion drawn from various studies is that a minimum of 2 mm keratinized gingiva is required to ensure the gingival health.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>If untreated, the gingival recession may progress and can compromise the prognosis of the affected tooth. Furthermore, root surface exposure may result in dentinal hypersensitivity, pain, difficult oral hygiene, root caries, abrasion, and periodontal attachment loss. Important functional points in the treatment of mucogingival problems are to stop the progressive recession process, to facilitate plaque control in the affected area, and creation of adequate vestibular depth in areas where there is a deficiency.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Modalities of root coverage (RC) procedures include laterally sliding flap, double papilla flap, coronally advanced flap, epithelialized gingival graft, a subepitheial connective tissue graft, and guided tissue regeneration-based RC procedures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The double lateral sliding bridge flap (DLSBF) technique was originally proposed by Marggraf in 1985[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to cover gingival recession, and to extend the gingiva in a one-step procedure. This technique utilizes a combination of a coronally advanced flap and the modified Edlan and Mejchar technique.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The advantages of this technique are that it doesn&#x02019;t require a second surgical site as free soft tissue grafting procedures and a separate frenectomy procedure.</p><p>The use of polypeptide growth factors (PGF) in the periodontal regeneration has recently attracted the attention of periodontal researchers. PGFs are molecules identified in the periodontal tissues that have been implicated in the growth and differentiation of cells from the periodontal tissues. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), which is a second generation platelet concentrate, was introduced by Choukroun <italic>et al</italic>. in 2000.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It offers the surgeon an access to growth factors with a simple and available technology. These growth factors, which are autologous, nontoxic and nonimmunogenic, enhance, and accelerate the tissue regeneration pathways.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] PRF also provides the clinician a membrane with growth factors, platelets, leukocytes, and stem cells.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The presence of growth factors embedded in the fibrin-mesh may initiate the periodontal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of PRF in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions and in increasing the width of keratinized gingiva.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee.

Several procedures have been proposed to cover gingival recessions.</p><p>In the original Edlan and Mejchar technique, which was developed to deepen the vestibule and not to cover gingival recessions, there was alveolar bone exposure. But in this modification there is no alveolar bone exposure. This could explain the uncomplicated and rapid healing in most cases. Also, in this technique, a CRF could be used for RC even in the presence of an attached gingiva width of &#x0003c;3 mm done by Marggraf.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The other advantages of this technique are that by releasing the periosteal fibers, the frenal pull also can be relieved. There is no necessity for a separate frenectomy procedure.</p><p>Currently, PRF has been successfully tested in a number of procedures including maxillofacial surgery, periodontal surgery, and implantology by Sharma and Pradeep[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] PRF has many advantages over platelet-rich plasma (PRP). It eliminates the redundant process of adding anticoagulant as well as the need to neutralize it. The addition of bovine-derived thrombin to promote conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in PRP is also eliminated. The elimination of these steps considerably reduces biochemical handling of blood as well as risks associated with the use of bovine-derived thrombin. The conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin takes place slowly with small quantities of physiologically available thrombin present in the blood sample itself. Thus, a physiologic architecture that is very favorable to the healing process is obtained due to this slow polymerization process.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>S&#x000e1;nchez <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have elaborated on the potential risks associated with the use of PRP. The preparation of PRP involves the isolation of PRP after that gel formation is accelerated using calcium chloride and bovine thrombin. It has been discovered that the use of bovine thrombin may be associated with the development of antibodies to the factors V, XI, and thrombin resulting in the risk of life-threatening coagulopathies. Bovine thrombin preparations have been shown to contain factor V, which could result in the stimulation of the immune system when challenged with a foreign protein. Other methods for safer preparation of PRP include the utilization of recombinant human thrombin, autologous thrombin or perhaps extra-purified thrombin.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In both the groups, complete RC as defined by Miller in 1987 was achieved in 80% of cases.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Miller defined complete RC in clinical terms as location of soft tissue margin at the CEJ, presence of clinical attachment to the root, a sulcus depth of 2 mm or less and absence of bleeding on probing.</p><p>The results of our study show that bridge flap technique can be used to cover multiple recessions as seen in both the study and control groups. Even in the presence of a narrow width of attached gingiva, a high level of RC was achieved in both the groups. This was in accordance with the studies done by Marggraf[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Romanos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In both the study and control groups, there was a significant increase in the width of attached gingiva. Scientific data obtained from well-controlled clinical and experimental studies have unequivocally demonstrated that the apico-coronal width of the gingiva and the presence of an attached portion of gingiva are not of decisive importance for the maintenance of gingival health and height of the periodontal tissues as concluded by Freedman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Consequently, the presence of a narrow zone of gingiva per se cannot justify surgical intervention. Although increasing the band of attached gingiva is not the main aim of the study, this was also achieved as a secondary outcome in the due course of the treatment in both the groups. The gain of keratinized gingiva obtained in this study was similar to the results of the study done by Mooney and Silva[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in which RC was attempted with CRF alone and another study by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in which RC was attempted with CRF-PRP.</p><p>The results from the study group of our study are in accordance with the studies by Wiltfang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Corso <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who have confirmed the successful use of PRF membranes in the management of both single and multiple gingival recession defects.</p><p>In a similar study Eren and Atilla,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] accepted that the PRF method is practical and simple to perform. Additionally, they found PRF to be superior to subepithelial connective tissue graft since it eliminates the requirement of a donor site. Conversely, Aroca <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found inferior RC upon the addition of an autologous PRF clot to a modified coronally advanced flap (MCAF) (study group) when compared with MCAF alone (control group) for the treatment of multiple gingival recessions.</p><p>In our study, in both the study and control groups, neither the quantity of gingival recession, nor the quality of the supporting tissues affected the success of this technique. This observation is supported by two human studies that showed that the absence of a narrow band of keratinized gingiva did not interfere with gingivectomy/flap surgery results. In both the groups, the DLSBF technique resulted in the development of keratinized epithelium of the transposed alveolar mucosa. The possible sources of induction of keratinization of the underlying tissues according to the study done by Bokan[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] would be the remnants of the attached gingiva left on the flap margin after the paramarginal incision, the retained de-epithelialized gingival tissue and the periodontal ligament. Also, some of the technical aspects described during the bridge flap procedure were key to its success. The initial semilunar incision was at least 2 GR + 2 mm apical to the gingival recession and this provided a wide flap Romanos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Furthermore, with the bridge flap technique, the incidence of the recurrent recession is reduced considerably by the simultaneous extension of the vestibule, as the mucosal flap cannot be influenced by tension from an apical direction.</p><p>No statistically significant differences were noted between the study and control groups, with respect to all the clinical parameters suggesting that both procedures are comparable to treat Miller's Class I and II recession defects. The application of PRF showed no additional benefit to enhance outcomes achieved by DLSBF alone. This may be partly due to the favorable results obtained in groups, small sample size and defects (Miller's Class I and II) known to experience predictable RC. The results are comparable to the meta-analysis done by Fabbro <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] who concluded that there was no significant benefit of platelet concentrates for the treatment of gingival recession.</p><p>The lack of benefit of PRF in the test site of the present study does not rule out the interest of PRF in mucogingival surgery for denuded root surfaces. Surgical variables that may affect the final result are PRF consistency, relationship with a CEJ positioning, and platelet concentration as said by Marx <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study indicates that bridge flap is a predictable approach to treat Miller's Class I and II gingival recession. The additional application of PRF failed to improve RC after DLSBF in Miller's Class I and II defects. Therefore, future clinical and histologic studies with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and more challenging recession defects are recommended to further explore this hypothesis.</p><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carranza</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Takei</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Klokkevold</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Carranza</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal plastic and esthetic surgery</article-title><source>Clinical Periodontology</source><year>2006</year><edition>10th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Missouri</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Saunders Publishers</publisher-name><fpage>1005</fpage><lpage>29</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maynard</surname><given-names>JG</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physiologic dimensions of the periodontium significant to the restorative dentist</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1979</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>170</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">286038</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bowers</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A study of the width of attached gingiva</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1963</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>201</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ainamo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>L&#x000f6;e</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anatomical characteristics of gingiva.
