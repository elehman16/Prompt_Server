In critically ill adults, withholding parenteral nutrition (PN) during the first week in ICU improved outcome, as compared with early supplementation of insufficient enteral nutrition (EN) with PN. We hypothesized that withholding PN in children early during critical illness reduces the incidence of new infections and accelerates recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Pediatric Early versus Late Parenteral Nutrition in Intensive Care Unit (PEPaNIC) study is an investigator-initiated, international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in three tertiary referral pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in three countries on two continents. This study compares early versus late initiation of PN when EN fails to reach preset caloric targets in critically ill children. In the early-PN (control, standard of care) group, PN comprising glucose, lipids and amino acids is administered within the first days to reach the caloric target. In the late-PN (intervention) group, PN completing EN is only initiated beyond PICU-day 7, when EN fails. For both study groups, an early EN protocol is applied and micronutrients are administered intravenously. The primary assessor-blinded outcome measures are the incidence of new infections during PICU-stay and the duration of intensive care dependency. The sample size (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,440, 720 per arm) was determined in order to detect a 5% absolute reduction in PICU infections, with at least 80% 1-tailed power (70% 2-tailed) and an alpha error rate of 5%. Based on the actual incidence of new PICU infections in the control group, the required sample size was confirmed at the time of an <italic>a priori-</italic> planned interim-analysis focusing on the incidence of new infections in the control group only.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Clinical evidence in favor of early administration of PN in critically ill children is currently lacking, despite potential benefit but also known side effects.

It is widely accepted that in healthy children, nutrition not only serves to maintain body tissues but also allows growth, which is considered of particular importance during infancy and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In hospitalized children, especially in the young, the current European and American guidelines for nutrition recommend early parenteral nutrition (PN) to prevent/correct malnutrition and to sustain appropriate growth when enteral nutrient (EN) supply is insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Observational studies suggest that about a quarter of children, most notably infants, admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) develop a pronounced caloric deficit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The stores of energy, fat and protein in children are limited, leaving children to rely on muscle mass to provide necessary substrates for metabolism. The energy deficit observed with acute critical illness in children has been associated with adverse outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Based hereon, it is current practice in PICUs to start PN in the acute phase of critical illness to supplement insufficient EN with the intention to avoid underfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, overfeeding may also be harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is difficult to administer the correct amount of nutrition, avoiding overfeeding as well as underfeeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Varying nutritional guidelines and clinical practices</title><p>It is currently advised to assess energy expenditure considered to reflect energy requirements, through the use of indirect calorimetry during the course of critical illness and to use this technique for determining individualized targets to guide nutritional therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, a European survey conducted in 2004 showed that only 17% of the PICUs use this technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the technique itself has not been well standardized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the most critically ill, major caveats are present, such as respiratory support with more than 40% oxygen and the use of uncuffed tubes resulting in unpredictable measures. The use of standard equations to predict energy expenditure and/or requirements also carries the risk of overfeeding and underfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Experts worldwide agree that there are insufficient data to make evidence-based recommendations for the optimal target of caloric intake in critically ill children and for the optimal time after onset of critical illness by which this target should be reached. The lack of widely accepted caloric targets for critically ill children results in nutritional strategies that vary substantially across centers. The current European and American guidelines for nutrition in hospitalized children recommend PN to prevent or correct malnutrition and to sustain appropriate growth when EN supply is insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Most guidelines advise doing this early so that the recommended daily allowances for children are reached on day 2 or 3 after PICU admission. These recommendations are based on evidence from cohort studies without a control group, case series or expert opinion (Grade D level).</p><p>The ongoing controversy on optimal amount, composition and timing of administration of PN in critically ill children may in fact conceal the fact that there is no hard evidence for any use of PN in critically ill children. Supported by the results of a Cochrane systematic review, Joffe <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that randomized trials investigating the role of intravenous nutritional support during the first week of critical illness in children should be performed and should include a control arm in which no nutritional support is administered or hypocaloric goals (below basal metabolic rate) for nutritional support are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale of the study and study hypothesis</title><p>A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) in critically ill adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed that the early provision of PN worsened rather than improved outcomes as compared with withholding PN and thus tolerating a substantial caloric deficit up to 1 week in ICU. Also, other studies did not show clinical benefit of early PN in adult ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hitherto, no well-designed RCT has been performed in critically ill children. The aim of the PEPaNIC trial (the acronym stands for Pediatric version of the effect of Early Parenteral Nutrition to complete insufficient enteral nutrition in ICU patients) is to investigate whether a strategy of withholding PN during the first 7 days in the PICU (late PN) provides clinical benefit over the current practice of early PN in critically ill children. We hypothesize that withholding PN for 1 week in the PICU reduces new infections and shortens the duration of PICU-stay.</p><p>This hypothesis is currently being tested in a multicenter superiority RCT performed in three large, tertiary referral PICUs (University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Stollery Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada). The centers were invited to participate based on a self-declared routine use of early PN in the PICU. It was anticipated that this routine use of early PN differs among centers. This was considered to be an asset as it contributes to the external validity of the PEPaNIC trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study protocol and (deferred) informed consent forms were approved by the institutional ethical review boards in Leuven, Belgium (ML8052 Amend-ID0005), Rotterdam, The Netherlands (NL38772.000.12) and Edmonton, AB, Canada (Pro00038098).

For all patients, severity of illness scores are calculated such as the PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction PELOD score and, for cardiac surgery patients, the Risk-Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery or RACHS score. The Pediatric RISk of Mortality (PRISM) score cannot be used for this study as the nutritional management is expected to affect the highest blood glucose concentration during the first 24 hours. In addition, co-morbidities prior to admission are noted. These comprise, among others, the presence of a genetic syndrome, gestational age at birth, presence/history of cancer, diabetes mellitus, kidney failure and infection upon admission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomized treatment allocation</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomization procedure</title><p>Randomization to early PN or late PN in a 1:1 ratio, is performed centrally (KU Leuven, Belgium) by use of a dedicated computerized system, accessible in all centers around the clock, 7 days a week. The computer algorithm allocates every consecutive, eligible patient per center to one of the two treatment arms in a blinded fashion by use of permuted blocks per diagnostic stratum to create parallel groups. The block size is unknown to bedside physicians, nurses and members of the research team. Patients are stratified per study site according to age groups (&#x0003c;1 year and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 year) and the following primary diagnostic categories on admission:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>I.</label><p>Medical-PICU admissions (infectious or non-infectious): (a) neurological (b) other.</p></list-item><list-item><label>II.</label><p>Surgical-PICU admissions (elective or emergency) according to referral discipline (a) cardiac surgery (b) other.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Treatment allocation and blinding</title><p>Concealed allocation to the randomized treatment was realized by use of the computerized randomization system described above. It was considered not feasible to blind treating physicians and patients for the allocated treatment during the time window of the randomized intervention. After discharge to the normal ward, all treating physicians are unaware of the randomized treatment allocation. All outcome assessors and investigators not directly involved in the patients care, such as statisticians, infectious disease specialists and laboratory personnel, are fully blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Common strategy for early EN in both study arms</title><p>The initiation and increase of EN, and the use of gastroprokinetics are prescribed in the standing orders for EN in each center. Both groups receive micronutrients (trace elements, minerals and vitamins) intravenously from day 2 onwards until the amount of EN given reaches 80% of the caloric target.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Randomized interventions</title><p>Patients randomized to the early-PN strategy (standard of care or control group) receive this type of nutrition according to current management in each of the participating centers, which were recruited based on a routine use of early PN. For patients randomized to the late-PN group (intervention group), all PN is withheld during the first week in the PICU. The international setting of the trial brings some variation in the control group (see study rationale and hypothesis), while the intervention group is strictly standardized (&#x02018;no PN during the first week in PICU&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Standard of care or control group: early-PN</title><p><italic>In the Leuven</italic> (<italic>BE</italic>) <italic>PICU</italic>, patients randomized to the early-PN group receive a mixture of glucose 30% and Vaminolact&#x000ae; (Fresenius, Uppsala, Sweden) in equal amounts upon admission to PICU, comprising 150 mg/ml glucose and 4.7 mg/ml nitrogen. For patients who require fluid restriction, total fluid intake is 50 ml/m<sup>2</sup>/h on days 1 and 2 (the day after admission and further referred to as day 2), and 60 ml/m<sup>2</sup>/h on day 3. Patients not requiring fluid restriction receive 100 ml/kg/day for the first 10 kg bodyweight, 50 ml/kg for the next 10 kg, and 20 ml/kg for the bodyweight over 20 kg, to be reached within 3 days. For all patients on intravenous (IV) nutrition, and within the fluid limitation described above, lipids (SMOFlipid&#x000ae; (20 g/100 ml), Fresenius, Uppsala, Sweden) are added from the second morning after admission, initially at a dose of 1.5 g/kg/day, increasing to a maximum of 3 g/kg/day, depending on the age. On the third morning after admission, pharmacy-prepared PN preparations are prescribed, unless adequate enteral nutritional intake is expected. PN preparations contain a mixture of glucose 50% and SMOFlipid&#x000ae; covering respectively 60 to 70% and 40 to 30% of calculated energy target and a 1.5 to 2.5 g/kg protein intake, according to age, by Vaminolact&#x000ae;. If the body weight is above 5 kg, Vaminolact&#x000ae; is replaced by Vamin 18&#x000ae; (Fresenius, Uppsala, Sweden). Any enterally-delivered energy is taken into account twice daily to reduce the energy delivered by PN. When EN covers 80% of optimal calculated caloric needs, PN is stopped. When the patient starts to take oral nutrition, the PN and/or EN is reduced and eventually stopped. Whenever enteral or oral intake falls below 50% of calculated caloric needs, the PN is restarted.</p><p><italic>In the Rotterdam</italic> (<italic>NL</italic>) <italic>PICU</italic>, patients randomized to the &#x02018;early-PN&#x02019; group receive a continuous glucose infusion upon admission to PICU (&#x0003c;30 kg; 4 to 6 mg/kg/min, &#x0003e; 30 kg; 2 to 4 mg/kg/min). From day 2 onwards the glucose intake is increased for all children on IV nutrition to 8.3 mg/kg/min (5 to 10 kg), 6.9 mg/kg/min (10 to 30 kg) or 4 mg/kg/min (&#x0003e;30 kg). Primene&#x000ae; (Baxter, Kobaltweg 49, 3542 CE Utrecht) (5.5 to 5.7 mg/ml nitrogen) is added from day 2 onward at 25 ml/kg/day (&#x0003c;10 kg) or 20 ml/kg/day (10 to 30 kg). From day 2 onwards, Intralipid&#x000ae; (Baxter, Kobaltweg 49, 3542 CE Utrecht) is added initially at a dose of 10 ml/kg/day (&#x0003c;10 kg) or 7.5 ml/kg/day (10 to 30 kg), increasing to 20 or 15 ml/kg/day respectively. For patients who require fluid restriction, intake is adjusted accordingly. Children&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;30 kg on IV nutrition receive from day 2 onwards Olimel N5 (Baxter, 5.2 mg/ml nitrogen, 115 mg/ml glucose) when central lines are in place or Olimel N4 (Baxter, 4.0 mg/ml nitrogen, 75 mg/ml glucose) when only peripheral lines are in place; the dose is 48 ml/kg/day. Any enterally-delivered energy is assessed twice daily and the energy delivered by PN is reduced accordingly. Energy goals for enteral nutrition are based on the body weight-based Schofield equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (first day of admission) and on the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA, Dutch Health Council) for the subsequent length of stay (Dietary Reference Intake: energy, protein and digestible carbohydrates, 2001, Health Council of the Netherlands: The Hague). Energy goals and composition of parenteral nutrition are based on the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When EN covers 80% of calculated caloric needs, PN is stopped. When the patient starts with oral nutrition, PN and/or EN is reduced and eventually stopped. Whenever enteral or oral intake falls below 50% of calculated caloric needs, PN is restarted.</p><p><italic>In the Edmonton</italic> (<italic>CA</italic>) <italic>PICU,</italic> the patient&#x02019;s energy expenditure is assessed upon admission by a registered dietitian when possible. Nutritional support is initiated as soon as possible, with the goal to match energy expenditure (measured or estimated resting energy expenditure of the child). The urgency of initiation of nutrition support is dependent on nutritional risk prior to admission, disease state and age. If indirect calorimetry cannot be done, 65% of basal metabolic rate is used Food and Agriculture Organization-World Health Organization (FAO-WHO) to determine caloric requirement. This number is adjusted daily by the dietitian based on the acute phase response and clinical picture of the child. If nutritional requirements cannot be met enterally, PN is added to achieve caloric target. On admission to PICU, patients receive a glucose infusion of approximately 3 to 4 mg/kg/minute taking into account the total fluid prescribed by medical staff. At that time EN is initiated when possible. On the morning of day 2, if the patient is not already on full enteral feeding, 20% IV lipids are initiated at 0.5 g/kg/day. On the morning of day 3, if the patient is not already on full enteral feeding, lipid infusion is increased to 1 g/kg/day and a solution of amino acids and concentrated glucose is added. The caloric goal is Basal Metabolic Rate when the patient is intubated and Total Energy Expenditure when the patient has been extubated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Intervention group: late-PN</title><p>In the 3 centers, patients randomized to the late-PN group receive a mixture of glucose 5% and NaCl 0.9% at, respectively, 60% and 40% of the total flow rate that is required to obtain optimal hydration, as prescribed by the attending physician, taking into account the volume of EN that is being delivered. No other forms of PN (lipid or protein infusions) are administered. When the amount of EN that is administered still covers less than 80% of the calculated targets after 1 week in the PICU, supplemental PN is initiated on day 8 according to the current PN protocols in each center.</p><p>The medical and nursing staff of the PICU were all informed and trained extensively during regular meetings before the start of the trial and were familiarized with the protocol. In order to optimize protocol compliance, the protocol was programmed in the patient data management system (PDMS).

Based on this actual incidence of new PICU infections in the control group, the hypothesized absolute risk reduction of 5% and an alpha error rate of 5%, the sample size of 1,440 patients (720 patients in each arm) was found sufficiently large to yield a statistical power of 77% 2-sided and of 85% 1-sided.

Thousands of children are annually exposed to this non-evidence-based treatment, which is assumed to result in faster recovery (benefit). This large international RCT will help PICU physicians to obtain more insight into the possibility of the omission of PN during the first week of critical illness. A significant difference in the safety and/or efficacy endpoints will provide important evidence for optimizing clinical patient care. Also a neutral result will provide important insight, as this would mean that clinicians can safely withhold PN in all comparable patients during the first week of ICU stay, which would have an impact on healthcare spending in the PICU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study was initiated as planned on 18 June 2012.
