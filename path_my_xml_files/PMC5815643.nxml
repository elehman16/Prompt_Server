This was expected, given the lack of cross-resistance between temsavir and other classes of antiretrovirals in vitro,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and reported activity against a range of NRTI, NNRTI, PI, and integrase inhibitor&#x02013;resistant isolates (Bristol-Myers Squibb, unpublished data).<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Substitutions at positions S375, M434, M426, and M475 in HIV-1 gp120 have been associated with reduced viral susceptibility to temsavir.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> These positions map in and around the modeled gp120 binding site for temsavir, adjacent to the region for CD4 binding.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Interestingly, although BL substitutions at positions S375, M434, M426, and M475 were present in viral samples obtained from 75/179 evaluable subjects in this study, no correlation was found between these substitutions and the number of subjects who qualified for resistance testing. This suggests that despite the high variability in susceptibility to temsavir in this population (FC-IC<sub>50</sub> range of 3.8-fold increase with S375S/N to &#x0003e;30,000-fold increase with M434I), virologic failure was not dependent on BL IC<sub>50</sub> as long as subjects retained some susceptibility to temsavir. These findings are similar to those in the phase 2a study (AI438001), where although the M426L substitution was linked to nonresponse (decline in HIV-1 RNA of &#x0003c;1.0 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) after 8 days of fostemsavir monotherapy, 2 subjects who had virus with this BL substitution still achieved a decline of &#x0003e;1.0 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> suggesting that these substitutions may not fully predict antiviral response.</p><p>Through week 48, a similar proportion of fostemsavir-treated (33%) and ATV/r-treated (27.5%) subjects met resistance-testing criteria. Emergent changes in viral drug susceptibility were more frequent in the fostemsavir arms: 4/37 evaluable subjects had emergent RAL resistance and 13/29 evaluable subjects had virus with a &#x0003e;3-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL. By contrast, no emergent resistance to study drugs was observed in the ATV/r arm. This may be due in part to the higher genetic barrier to resistance for ATV/r, a boosted PI, which may confer better backbone protection, and the relatively lower barrier to resistance for RAL, where a single mutation (such as N155H, Q148R, and Y143R) can result in a &#x0003e;10-fold reduction in viral susceptibility.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Previous participation in the 7-day fostemsavir monotherapy substudy did not influence the likelihood of subjects who met criteria for resistance testing, suggesting that fostemsavir monotherapy did not compromise its subsequent use as part of cART.</p><p>Among the 13 subjects who had virus with a &#x0003e;3-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL, a wide variation in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL was observed (3.8 to &#x0003e;30,000-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub>). This is in line with in vitro data, which showed a considerable range in susceptibility of viral isolates to temsavir (&#x0003e;6 log<sub>10</sub> variation), despite the majority having a temsavir half-maximal effective concentration of &#x0003c;10 nM.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The reasons for this variability are not known, but may be linked to the considerable diversity found in HIV-1 gp120.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Seven of 11 evaluable subjects with a &#x0003e;3-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> had emergent substitutions in HIV-1 gp120 at positions 375, 426, and 434. Treatment-emergent substitutions in this study were not observed at amino acid position 475, or at positions 116 or 204. Substitutions at positions 116 or 204 have only been observed thus far during in vitro selection experiments. Overall, viruses with emergent gp120 substitutions tended to have larger increases in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL compared with those who had virus with no changes at positions 375, 426, 434, and 475. M426L was the most common emergent substitution, and substitutions at positions S375 and M434 were also observed, including a novel M434K substitution that resulted in a large decline in susceptibility to temsavir in vitro. S375 and M426 lie in the modeled binding site for temsavir and substitutions at these positions may reduce binding of temsavir to gp120.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> M434 lies distal to the temsavir binding site, but is involved in bridging sheet packing and may shift gp120 away from an effective temsavir binding conformation.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Among 13 subjects who had virus with a &#x0003e;3-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL, 5 subsequently achieved viral resuppression on the same regimen. Trends suggested that viral resuppression may have been related to a smaller corrected FC in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL, absence of gp120 substitutions at positions S375, M426, and M434, and absence of emergent RAL resistance. However, 2/5 subjects achieved viral resuppression despite the presence of a gp120 M426L or S375S/N substitution, and 1 subject despite a 547-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub>. Similar results were observed in the proof-of-concept study, where 2 subjects who had virus with an M426L substitution at BL, including 1 subject with a very high BL temsavir IC<sub>50</sub> (&#x0223c;5300 nM) still achieved a decline in HIV-1 RNA of &#x0003e;1 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL after 8 days of monotherapy.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Therefore, subjects may still respond to therapy despite BL or emergent gp120 substitutions. Because their effect seems to be context dependent, it is possible that any associated increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> may only be relevant if it takes the overall temsavir IC<sub>50</sub> value over a certain threshold.</p><p>The &#x0003e;3-fold cutoff for analysis of emergent changes in viral susceptibility to temsavir used in this study was a technical cutoff, based on the limits for assay variability. At present, there is no clinical cutoff for changes in viral susceptibility to temsavir and, in this study, 5 subjects with a 4&#x02013;547-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL still achieved viral resuppression after virologic failure. Furthermore, the 100-nM BL temsavir IC<sub>50</sub> required for entry in this study was based on the results from the phase 2a study, and within the confines of this limit, no difference in response was seen after 24 or 48 weeks of cART with RAL and TDF when subjects were stratified by temsavir IC<sub>50</sub> category.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Further analysis will be required to determine an appropriate clinical cutoff for fostemsavir because the technical cutoff &#x0003e;3 does not seem to correlate with clinical response in this study.</p><p>This study had some limitations. The BL genotypic resistance profile for the study population was more in line with first-line or second-line virologic failure; so, the activity of fostemsavir in treatment-experienced populations with a range of different BL genotypic resistance profiles remains to be confirmed. In addition, the study was restricted to participants with a BL temsavir IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003c;100 nM. Because no clinical cutoff is currently available, the impact of higher BL temsavir IC<sub>50</sub> values on antiviral activity and changes in viral susceptibility requires further evaluation. Amino acids could not be determined for all gp120 positions, mainly due to insertions and deletions in HIV-1 gp120; so, changes at the 4 key positions could not be determined for all samples. However, there was no increase in the proportion of sequence failures in the virologic failure samples compared with BL sequences. Finally, not all subjects who were successfully tested using the PhenoSense GT assay had a successful Integrase assay result.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that response rates remained similar across the fostemsavir and ATV/r arms through weeks 24 and 48, regardless of NRTI, NNRTI, and PI RAM at BL. Emergent changes in viral susceptibility occurred more frequently in the fostemsavir arms compared with the ATV/r arm; however, of the 13/200 fostemsavir-treated subjects who had virus with a &#x0003e;3-fold increase in temsavir FC-IC<sub>50</sub> from BL, 5 achieved resuppression to &#x0003c;50 copies/mL during the study, regardless of S375S/N and M426L substitutions. The impact of changes in temsavir IC<sub>50</sub> and emergent substitutions in HIV-1 gp120 will require more evaluation, and thus, an appropriate clinical cutoff requires further study. Because the greatest unmet medical need lies with patients who have few remaining treatment options, fostemsavir is being evaluated in a phase 3 trial in heavily treatment-experienced subjects who have limited options; this phase 3 trial does not include a cutoff for BL temsavir IC<sub>50</sub>. A retrospective analysis of the effect of BL susceptibility to temsavir will be conducted to potentially elucidate an appropriate clinical cutoff.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="qai-77-299-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e874" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the AI438011 participants and their families, and the AI438011 investigators: JD Altclas, G Amaya-Tapia, JF Andrade-Villanueva, V Arama, AI Arango-Duque, K Arast&#x000e9;h, J Arribas, R Bardinas-Rodriguez, CM Benites-Villafane, J Bogner, C Brinson, PE Cahn, WM Casapia-Morales, LI Cassetti, B Clotet, E DeJesus, IG Diaconescu, JI Echevarr&#x000ed;a, R Elion, J Ernst, J Feinberg, J Fourie, J Galindez, JM Gatell, ER Granados-Reyes, S Hassler, C Hicks, D Johnson, R Kaplan, J Lalezari, JR Lama-Valdivia, AM La Rosa Rodriguez, GH Latiff, MY Leon, SH Lupo, F Marquez-Diaz, MD Martins, M Mckellar, FC Mendo-Urbina, Y Pinedo-Ramirez, LJ Prisacariu, J Rockstroh, S Rugina, MR Salazar-Castro, AR Scribner, J G Sierra-Madero, LM Sloan, A Stoehr, OA Sussmann-Pena, P Tebas, M Thompson, SC Trevi&#x000f1;o-P&#x000e9;rez, OA Tsybakova, EE Voronin, AA Yakovlev, and NG Zakharova.
