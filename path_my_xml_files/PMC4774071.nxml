It is an acute inflammatory reaction of the skin around diaper<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> that may be caused by frequent and prolonged contact of the skin with the urine, stool and moisture, and exacerbated by <italic>Candida</italic> infection and abrasion<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. This may be characterized with erythema, flaking, papules and lesions in the areas such as buttocks, thighs, scrotum and mons pubis<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>The routine treatments for DD include changing the diaper and washing the genital area frequently, applying petrolatum or zinc oxide, and corticosteroids. A topical antifungal agent may also be used if fungal infections occurred<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Calendula may also be effective in non-complicated cases<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Bentonite is a kind of mineral which is in the form of aluminum phyllosilicate and is also called as mineral or formal soap in pharmacy industries. It can absorb several folds of water as its own volume, and makes a jellified, plastic and viscous form. This material is used as moisturizer, skin protector and water absorbent<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In a previous study Bentonite was found to be effective in the treatment of chronic hand dermatitis<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Bentonite has no side effects and of low cost and has not been systematically evaluated for the treatment of DD. The present study was thus performed to compare the effects of Bentonite and Calendula for the treatment of infantile DD.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>This double blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken during February and May 2013 on 100 infants referred to the outpatient paediatric clinics of Imam Khomeini hospital and a healthcare centre in Khomein city, Iran. Sample size was calculated based on a previous study in which the per cent of severe DD was 33.3 and it decreased to 6.3 after using Calendula in intervention group<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The sample size calculated was 50 each in the experimental and control groups with a power of 0.8 and the type I error probability of 0.05.</p><p>Infants in the age range of 1 to 24 months, and having mild to moderate DD were included in the study. Also, those not having infantile eczema, diarrhoea, and urinary tract infection, fungus dermatitis (based on the physician's diagnosis), and not using corticosteroids for present lesions were also selected. Exclusion criteria were not following the researchers recommendations and exacerbation of the lesions and developing diarrhoea during the study.</p><p>Before the study, a grading system was developed for grading the lesions. Panahi <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> categorized the DD into four categories of mild, moderate, severe and extreme. We clubbed the categories of moderate and severe and modified this grading system into three categories of mild (erythema with or without satellite papules, with maceration and chafing), moderate (erythema with papulopustules and maceration) and severe (erythema with erosions or ulceration). Only mild and moderate cases were included in the study.</p><p><italic>Data collection</italic>: The study process was explained to the parents and their written informed consent was obtained for participation in the study. A skin test was performed on the infant's arm to ensure not having allergic reaction. To do this, one fingertip of Bentonite and Calendula was applied on the internal surface of the infant's arm (1&#x000d7;1 cm) and observed for redness or any other allergic reactions after 20 min. Random numbers 1-100 were generated and entered in the data sheet. We randomly assigned 100 participants into the two conditions (a or b). Each condition was representative of one group with 50 participants. The numbers in each group were sorted and passed to the doctor and he prescribed the medication with code &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; for one group and medication with code &#x0201c;b&#x0201d; to the second group. A consort flow diagram of this study presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure</label><caption><p>Flow diagram showing the study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMR-142-742-g001"/></fig><p>To produce Bentonite 50 per cent, the mineral was squashed and turned into powder, sterilized in an oven, mixed with water (50 g Bentonite was mixed with 50 ml of distilled water) and poured in sterile cans and prepared in the form of Bentonite 50 per cent cream in 30 g cans by a pharmacist. To produce Calendula, two 15 g creams of Calendula 1.5 per cent (produced by Dineh Company, Iran) were poured in the similar 30 g sterile cans. Calendula and Bentonit were prepared in cans with similar shape and weight and then all cans were coded as &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;b&#x0201d; by the pharmacist.</p><p>To gather the data, a checklist was prepared and its content validity was assessed by 10 faculty members in Kashan and Arak Universities of Medical Sciences. The reliability of the checklist was assessed through inter-observers reliability with a rate of agreement of 0.93. The checklist included the characteristics of the infants (age, gender, weight), and mother (education level, age, job), type of feeding (breastfeeding, formula milk, cow's milk or combined) history of DD and drugs used in the previous episodes of the disease. Also there was a question for recording the frequency of changing diaper in a day and a question for grading the severity of DD. A Table was made for recording the effects of treatment including onset of recovery in the first six hour (yes, no), and improvement in the first, second and third day (yes/no), and time of the complete recovery (hours after the start of treatment). For judgment on the level of improvement, digital photographs were recorded of the affected areas of each infant at the first visit and the third day after receiving the treatment.</p><p>Checklists were completed for each infant and then the physician (who was unaware of the cans cods) prescribed one of the two creams. All mothers were trained to apply the cream on the affected area four times a day after changing the diaper.</p><p>The process of applying the cream was done under supervision for the first time and the effect of treatment was followed up three times a day by phone. Also, every other day (up to 3 times), the infants were visited and assessed by the physician and additional cream was given to the parents if needed. The effect of treatment (improvement or non-improvement) was documented based on the physician's decision.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Research Council and the Human Research Ethics Committee of Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: The data were analyzed through SPSS software, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Independent sample T test was used to compare quantitative variables (<italic>i.e</italic>. age, weight), and chi square, risk ratio, and Fisher's exact test were used to compare qualitative variables between the two groups such as improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of infants was 7.35&#x000b1;6.28 months in Bentonite group and 6.45&#x000b1;5.53 months in Calendula group.

Our study showed that Bentonite was not only more effective than Calendula on the improvement of DD, but it also accelerated the speed of improvement. No side effects were observed in the two groups. However, the study sample in the present study was small, and it is recommended to conduct similar studies with a larger sample. Also, the present study was conducted on the samples with mild to moderate DD, so it is recommended to conduct multicenter studies on severe DD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors acknowledge the parents of children who consented to participate in this study.
