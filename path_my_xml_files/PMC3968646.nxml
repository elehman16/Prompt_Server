The primary outcome measure was the total success rate of insertion.

Patients excluded were those with body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, laryngeal or oesophageal varices, risk of aspiration or difficult face mask ventilation either referred or suspected (Langeron's criteria &#x02265;2),[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Mallampati score as modified by Samsoon and Young &#x0003e;2,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in order to exclude a confounding factor according to previous findings,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and those scheduled for surgical procedures with planned time duration of &#x0003e;1 h. In addition, during the pre-operative visit, the following difficult airway parameters were also collected: Mouth opening (cm) and the thyromental distance (cm).</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups, digital technique or suction catheter were used for PLMA insertion in DT and SC group, respectively. The randomisation was done based on the year in which the patients were born: Odd or even.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] All patients were given aspiration prophylaxis with ranitidine 50 mg intravenous (iv) and metoclopramide 10 mg (iv) 1 h before surgery and were pre-medicated with midazolam 0.02 mg/kg iv 15 min before anaesthesia. Following the patients&#x02019; head positioning on a standard pillow (about 7 cm in height) and 3 min of pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with propofol infusion at a target concentration of 6 &#x003bc;g/ml (Alaris Medical System Diprifusor<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> incorporating TM target controlled infusion pump; CA, USA) and remifentanil infusion at 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/min iv. Face mask ventilation was performed until the following conditions were reached to enable insertion of PLMA<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> (North America Inc. San Diego CA, USA): Loss of corneal reflex, apnoea and no response to jaw thrust. The manufacturer's weight-based recommendations were used for size selection. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol target concentration (3-5 &#x003bc;g/ml) and remifentanil at variable infusion rate (0.05-0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min) so as to maintain Bispectral Index (BIS) around 40 (BIS<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Aspect Medical System, Inc. Natick, MA) and haemodynamic parameters by 20% of baseline. No other iv or inhalational anaesthetic were administered. Patients underwent volume controlled ventilation using a total gas (oxygen 50% and air) flow of 5 L/min, with a tidal volume set at 8 ml/kg and a respiratory rate adjusted to maintain an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between 35 and 40 mmHg. The Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Avance<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Anaesthesia System (GE Health-care Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was used.</p><p>The untrained physicians involved in this study were trainee anaesthesiologists (<italic>n</italic> = 30) who had performed less than 20 PLMA insertions in the setting of operating theatre after previous training on a manikin. Two attempts were allowed before PLMA insertion by the trainees was considered a failure and airway was managed by an expert anaesthesiologist who was present throughout the procedure. It was planned that the expert anaesthesiologist inserted the PLMA using SC technique, in case of failure by the trainees and classic LMA, in the event of further failure; he was also ready to change airway management strategy for orotracheal intubation, if necessary. The ease of PLMA insertion was classified as &#x02018;easy&#x02019; if the first attempt was successful, &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; in cases with success on the second attempt and &#x02018;failure&#x02019; in cases where both attempts had failed.</p><p>Criteria for unsuccessful insertion included: (1) Failed passage into pharynx; (2) misplacement as detected by air leaks from oropharynx (listening over mouth)/stomach (auscultation over epigastrium)/drain tube (placing lubricant over proximal orifice of the drain tube) with a peak airway pressure below 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; (3) in effective ventilation (absence of square wave capnography or EtCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;45 mmHg during mechanical ventilation). The reasons for failed insertion were documented. Time between picking up the PLMA ready for insertion and successful placement with the establishment of an effective airway was recorded. DT-technique was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using the index finger to press the PLMA mask into the mouth and advance it around the palatopharyngeal curve. The SC guided technique was carried out following previous indications[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and involved the following steps: (1) A 16 Fr - 5.33 mm SC (Pennine Healthcare, UK) was lubrificated with water-based gel (K-Y Jelly, Johnson and Johnson, Pinewood, UK) and (2) was inserted into the orogastric tube channel of the PLMA with its tip protruding beyond the cuff of PLMA; finally, (3) after opening the mouth, the handle of PLMA was pushed while introducing the SC tip into the oropharynx blindly. Once the PLMA was inserted into the pharynx, the intra-cuff pressure was set at 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O using a digital manometer (Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlone, Ireland). After removal of the SC, airway leak pressure (ALP) was measured by recording the circuit pressure at which gas was first heard to escape around the LMA leaving a fresh gas flow at 3 L/min with the circuit pop-off valve completely closed.</p><p>After surgery (18-24 h), patients were asked about airway morbidity (including sore throat, dysphagia and dysphonia). An un-blinded observer collected the intraoperative data and a blinded observer collected the post-operative data. Patients were unaware of insertion technique used.</p><p>Any episode of hypoxia as defined by a SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;93% or other adverse events were registered.</p><p>The number of patients included in the study was based on a previous study[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and on a <italic>priori</italic> power analysis assuming alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.90. A minimum of 119 patients per each group was required to detect an increase of 15% in success rate of insertion for the SC group compared to control group. The investigators planned to recruit 254 patients, including the numbers of drop out.</p><p>Chi-square test with Yates&#x02019; correction, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test or Student's <italic>t</italic>-test were carried-out, as appropriate.

These results mirror those of a previous study, which reported an enhanced success rate when SC-technique was used by expert physicians.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] 
</p><p>As for our secondary outcomes, insertion time was similar for the two techniques indicating that both are likewise affected by lack of experience; furthermore, no difference was found with regard to airway morbidity between the two techniques confirming the safety of SC-technique even among untrained physicians.</p><p>Our results match those of the unique study that had been performed with the aim of comparing DT with SC-technique[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] among untrained physicians. Furthermore, Nagata <italic>et al</italic>. found that PLMA insertion by SC-technique was significantly more successful at the first attempt than the standard DT with a success rate of 100% versus 73%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, some differences arise from a comparison between the two studies. In their study, Nagata <italic>et al</italic>. involved physicians who had performed less than 100 insertions[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] while our inexperienced users had a lower level of training (&#x0003c;20 PLMA insertions). This may be the reason why the mean PLMA insertion times in Nagata's study were shorter for both SC-technique and DT-technique compared to those of our study (13 vs. 39 s and 25 vs. 32 s, respectively).</p><p>Brimacombe <italic>et al</italic>. advised on superiority of the gum elastic bougie-guided technique when compared to DT-technique and its rescue ability to replace the introducer tool technique in case of DT-technique failure.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The gum elastic bougie may improve the insertion success rate of PLMA as it is sufficiently rigid to eliminate the impaction at the back of the mouth with easier transition into the oesophagus. However, this technique requires laryngoscope guidance due to the stiffness of the device. This approach may be more traumatic for the oesophagus, especially in case of occult varices or mucosal lesions. In our opinion, the use of a SC seems a good compromise between the need to reinforce the cuff of PLMA and a safe use.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In this regard, we found that failed passage into pharynx was more frequent with the DT-technique revealing the previously described difficulties related to this approach. On the other hand, we found that the main cause of failure with SC-technique was the malposition. Since SC makes the distal cuff stiffer and less likely to fold over, it is reasonable that the SC-guided technique may be useful in directing the distal cuff around the oropharyngeal inlet and towards the oesophagus. However, the SC might not be sufficiently stiff to guide the distal cuff around the oropharynx in case of difficult airway.</p><p>Regarding as limitations, it has to be remembered that, in this study, the observer who collected intraoperative data was un-blinded leading to a potential source of bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, our study is in line with the previous investigations about this issue and demonstrates that the SC-technique is more efficient than DT-technique when both were performed by inexperienced physicians. This technique is able to make the success rate of insertion by untrained personnel close to that of expert users with DT; thus, it could be recommended for training.</p><p>Since the majority of the studies, as ours, enrolled only patients with easy airways, further studies are needed to establish the usefulness of SC in difficult airways seeing that PLMA may be regarded as a rescue device.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
