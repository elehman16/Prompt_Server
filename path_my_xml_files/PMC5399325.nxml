Without prophylactic medications, more than 90% patients undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and approximately 30% to 90% of patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) will experience CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most important influencing factor for CINV is the chemotherapy regimen. The severity and incidence of CINV are usually determined by chemotherapeutic agent, dosage, combinations with other treatment approaches, and patient characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patient-related variables that influence the risk of CINV include age (persons younger than 50&#x000a0;years old tend to experience more CINV), sex (females have a high risk of CINV), history of low prior chronic alcohol intake, history of previous chemotherapy-induced emesis, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>CINV decreases patients&#x02019; quality of life (QOL) and impacts their physical activities and social functioning. Uncontrolled CINV may result in dehydration as well. These disadvantages may lead to deferring or canceling treatment. Thus, patients will miss the best time for treatment and face limited therapeutic effect. Uncontrolled CINV may increase unnecessary healthcare costs, aggravate burden on medical and nursing resources, and prolong hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The introduction and development of antiemetic drugs have significantly improved the ability of clinicians to control CINV. The mainstays of antiemetic therapy include serotonin (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonists (RAs) and neurokinin 1 (NK-1) RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These agents block receptors for serotonin and substance P, which are two key neurotransmitters that participate in the physiopathological changes of vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Palonosetron, a second-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA, has demonstrated benefits in controlling both acute and delayed CINV (78.1% and 65.6%, respectively) associated with HEC or MEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The agents including NK-1 RA and palonosetron perform better in the delayed phase than do other 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RAs, which suggests that different mechanisms may be involved between acute and delayed CINV. Although the availability of effective management strategies has been recognized, it is not easy to translate them to practical application, owing to financial issues, provider-related barriers, and patient-related factors (e.g., adherence and underreporting of CINV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Caution should be taken when the drug is used during chemotherapy treatment because of the risks for headache, fatigue, and constipation, which are liable to add to the suffering of patients with advanced cancer.</p><p>Researchers and patients are seeking additional methods of controlling CINV, such as nondrug therapies. Acupuncture, as a typical treatment modality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been applied for diseases for over 2000&#x000a0;years. A growing interest in TCM can be noted in that researchers from many countries have conducted clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture in managing CINV. Several studies have drawn encouraging conclusions on the efficacy of acupuncture in CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Rithirangsriroj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that acupuncture was effective in preventing delayed CINV and promoting QOL. With fewer adverse effects, it may be used as an alternative treatment option for CINV. Shen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] conducted a three-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled study and showed that in patients with breast cancer receiving high-dose chemotherapy, adjunct electroacupuncture was more effective in controlling emesis than minimal needling or antiemetic pharmacotherapy alone, although the observed effect had limited duration. Therefore, acupuncture could be considered as a supplementary treatment for patients experiencing CINV.</p><p>On the basis of a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], acupuncture could be an appropriate adjunctive treatment for CINV; however, additional studies are needed because among 11 studies of the efficacy of acupuncture for CINV, only 1 study had a low risk of bias (ROB). Therefore, we plan to perform a multicenter randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of CINV in patients with advanced cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled prospective clinical trial aimed at estimating the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on CINV by comparing a verum acupuncture group with a sham acupuncture group.

To minimize treatment bias, all the acupuncturists who participate in this trial are specialists in acupuncture. They have more than 3&#x000a0;years of experience in acupuncture treatment and have obtained acupuncture licenses (Chinese medicine practitioner license), which are provided by the Ministry of Health of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China. Before performing this trial, all acupuncturists will receive special training regarding the purpose and content of the trial, treatment strategies, and quality control. We have followed the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 statement, which defines standard protocol items for clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (<italic>see</italic> Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

The schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments is provided in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Participants in both groups will receive verum or sham acupuncture sessions twice on the first day of chemotherapy and once each on the next consecutive 4&#x000a0;days. Each acupuncture session takes approximately 30&#x000a0;minutes. The number of the needles used will be ten in each session for both groups. Sterile needles for single use (Ande, Guizhou, China) will be used in this study. Twenty-five-gauge (0.25&#x000a0;mm in diameter), 40-mm-long needles are used for both groups at the limbs and abdomen. Needles in the intervention group will be inserted 10&#x02013;35&#x000a0;mm in depth and manually manipulated by rotation methods to produce a characteristic sensation known as De Qi, in which a feeling of needle sensation refers to tenseness around the needle felt by the acupuncturist and numbness, distention, soreness, and heaviness around the point felt by the patient), in addition to electroacupuncture. During the verum acupuncture session, acupuncturists will add manipulation to the needles every other 10&#x000a0;minutes. In the control group, needles will be inserted about 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mm in depth with no manipulation. Participants in both groups will receive intravenous ondansetron (ondansetron hydrochloride injection; Ningbo Team pharm Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China) 8&#x000a0;mg twice daily as a foundation antiemetic regimen.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments.

The CTCAE system is established by the National Cancer Institute. It includes the standard to assess nausea and vomiting. It will be used at baseline, day 1, day 2, day 3, day 7 (&#x000b1;1), day 10 (&#x000b1;1), day 14 (&#x000b1;1), and day 21 (&#x000b1;1). Patients have daily questionnaires to fill in that will be used to record the frequency and extent of CINV during the observation period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>
<bold>ECOG</bold> The ECOG score, also called the <italic>World Health Organization score</italic> or <italic>Zubrod Performance Status score</italic>, runs from 0 to 5, with 0 denoting perfect health and 5 denoting death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Safety assessment</title><p>To exclude any related serious diseases, before randomization, patients will be asked to undergo routine tests of blood, urine, and stool; an electrocardiogram; a liver function test; and a kidney function test. These tests will be performed at the 14th day and the 21st day of the study to evaluate the safety of this trial. During the chemotherapy period, patients may be more prone to develop adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia, myelosuppression, and hemoglobin decrease. If any AEs occur during the trial, patients will be treated as soon as possible. Researchers will record drug combinations, including the drug&#x02019;s name, frequency of use, dosage form, and the dose. Additional antiemetic agents will be included in the record of drug combinations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis will be performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). First, the baseline characteristics of the two groups, such as age, sex, and chemotherapy regimen, will be analyzed by an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test or paired <italic>t</italic> tests. The second step is to compare the efficacy of acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of CINV in both groups. The average intensity of nausea and vomiting and the HADS score will be tested for normal distribution. If the data follow a normal distribution, a two-samples (independent) <italic>t</italic> test will be used. Otherwise, the data will undergo Wilcoxon testing. A <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</p><p>Efficacy and safety analyses will be conducted in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. Missing values will be imputed by the last observation carried forward method.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p>Acupuncture, one of the major components of TCM, is deemed to be an available complementary therapy to relieve symptoms. The efficacy of acupuncture has been proved by many randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Authors of a systematic review demonstrated that acupuncture was an appropriate adjunctive therapy for CINV, but the supporting evidence was not sufficient, because most of the randomized controlled trials analyzed had high or unclear ROB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These methodological and practical limitations included small sample size, greater-than-anticipated withdrawal, lack of a control group, and unclear statements about randomized allocation. Therefore, more powerful evidence is still needed to verify the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for CINV. We have presented the design of a randomized controlled trial of verum acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture. Completion of this trial will contribute to verifying the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of CINV.</p><p>However, this trial has several methodological and practical limitations. Previous randomized controlled trials showed that there is no significant difference in statistical analysis between verum and sham acupuncture groups. Shallow insertion may also lead to latent physiological effects to alleviate the symptoms. In this trial, the sham points are selected to avoid meridians and acupoints, but we cannot rule out physiological effects from the control group design. Another limitation is that the research assistant and therapists are not blinded in this study. It is almost impossible to have genuine double blinding in acupuncture trials, because acupuncturists are responsible for controlling participants&#x02019; perception of needling. We cannot distinguish effectiveness from placebo effects and physiological effects. A bias due to unblinding cannot be excluded.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is currently recruiting participants up to april 2017, the study has recruited 118 patients.
