However, the evidence for the efficacy of LIA in THA is not yet clear. We determined whether single-shot LIA in addition to a multimodal analgesic regimen would reduce acute postoperative pain and opioid requirements after THA.</p><p><bold>Patients and methods &#x02014;</bold> 116 patients undergoing primary THA under spinal anesthesia were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All patients received oral opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia: etoricoxib, acetaminophen, and glucocorticoid. The patients were randomized to receive either 150 mL ropivacaine (2 mg/mL) and 0.5 mL epinephrine (1 mg/mL) or 150 mL 0.9% saline. Rescue analgesic consisted of morphine and oxycodone as needed. The primary endpoint was pain during mobilization in the recovery unit. Secondary endpoints were pain during mobilization on the day after surgery and total postoperative opioid requirements on the first postoperative day.</p><p><bold>Results &#x02014;</bold> The levels of pain during mobilization&#x02014;both in the recovery unit and on the day after surgery&#x02014;and consumption of opioids on the first postoperative day were similar in the 2 groups.</p><p><bold>Interpretation &#x02014;</bold> LIA did not provide any extra analgesic effect after THA over and above that from the multimodal analgesic regimen used in this study.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Implementation of accelerated clinical pathways based on the fast-track principles reduces morbidity and enhances recovery for patients undergoing THA (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C10">Kehlet and Wilmore 2008</xref>). One of the key prerequisites is optimized pain relief, allowing early postoperative mobilization (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C10">Kehlet and Wilmore 2008</xref>). This requires that the pain treatment should be safe and effective, both at rest and during activity (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C22">Srikandarajah and Gilron 2011</xref>).</p><p>The concept of multimodal analgesia for acute postoperative pain is to combine analgesics with additive or synergistic effects, which is meant to reduce the use of&#x02014;and the adverse effects of&#x02014;opioids and to allow early mobilization (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C9">Kehlet and Dahl 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C11">Kehlet et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C4">Buvanendran and Kroin 2009</xref>).

They added ketorolac to the ropivacaine and epinephrine mixture and the effect of LIA alone was therefore not studied. The authors found a low pain score&#x02014;generally in the range of 0&#x02013;3&#x02014;both at rest and while walking, and reduced opioid consumption. Almost half of the patients were directly discharged home on the first postoperative day.</p><p>Using both NSAIDs and opioids in LIA is controversial, and few studies have attempted to identify which components in the mixture contribute to the outcome. Addition of NSAIDs to the LIA mixture without giving NSAIDs to the control group makes the results of the studies difficult to interpret (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C1">Andersen et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C12">Kerr and Kohan 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C13">Kuchalik et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C21">Solovyova et al. 2013</xref>) as NSAIDs have both a systematic and a local anti-inflammatory effect (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C18">Romsing et al. 2000</xref>). Instead of measuring the effect of the local infiltration analgesia, it may be the effect of NSAID(s) that is measured, which complicates the comparison between LIA and placebo.</p><p>Several trials investigating the effect of LIA following THA have used different pain treatment modalities such as spinal analgesic, epidural analgesic, or systematic analgesic. In addition, these are often used in combination with a LIA catheter placed intraoperatively giving repeated injections postoperatively (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C1">Andersen et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C12">Kerr and Kohan 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C17">Murphy et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C13">Kuchalik et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C21">Solovyova et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C27">Zoric et al. 2014</xref>). This further complicates interpretation and comparison of the results. In the present study, the patients received a single-shot local infiltration analgesic with ropivacain and epinephrine. NSAID was given as a part of a multimodal pain regimen. This makes the results of our study valid, as the only difference between the 2 groups was whether ropivacaine was administered.</p><p>A recent study with a similar design also had results comparable to ours. <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C15">Lunn et al. (2011)</xref> reported that infiltration with a single dose of 150 mL 0.2% ropivacaine with epinephrine following THA did not reduce postoperative consumption of opioids or reduce postoperative pain (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C15">Lunn et al. 2011</xref>). In this study, they used a multimodal analgesic approach consisting of acetaminophen, NSAID, and gabapentin rather than the glucocorticoid used in our study (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C15">Lunn et al. 2011</xref>). Gabapentin has possible side effects such as dizziness and visual disturbances, and its use is debatable as part of a multimodal pain regimen following THA (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C26">Zhang et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>A single preoperative dose of dexamethasone is a proven long-acting prophylactic agent for nausea and vomiting, and improves postoperative pain and mobilization (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C8">Kardash et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="C14">Lunn and Kehlet 2013</xref>). A single dose of dexamethasone has no known side effects either in the short term or long term, apart from increased blood glucose level on the first postoperative day (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C24">Waldron et al. 2013</xref>). There are no general recommendations for use of glucocorticoids following THA, and this suggests that further investigation is still required regarding dose-response and potential side effects.</p><p>Pain evoked by movement is often neglected as the primary clinical outcome following THA (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C22">Srikandarajah and Gilron 2011</xref>). The fast-track methodology requires a procedure-specific pain regimen to allow early mobilization, and thereby reduce the length of convalescence and morbidity (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C10">Kehlet and Wilmore 2008</xref>). In the present study, the patients had low postoperative pain scores irrespective of which study group they belonged to, both at rest and during mobilization. This indicates that the multimodal pain regimen that we used was safe, simple, and satisfactory&#x02014;and that the patient&#x02019;s preoperative expectations were met through information and education (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="C7">Hamilton et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our findings may be limited by missing registration of pain scores for 15 study participants during mobilization in the PACU, i.e. the primary outcome of this study. Nevertheless, this was a randomized trial, and we consider that the number of patients registered had a sufficient response rate to give reliable results.</p><p>One strength of our study was that the patients allocated to this trial were unselected. Our findings can therefore be generalized to other populations when using a multimodal pain regimen like ours after THA.</p><p>In conclusion, local infiltration analgesic with ropivacaine did not provide any extra analgesic effect after THA over and above that from the multimodal analgesic regimen consisting of acetaminophen, NSAID, and glucocorticoid.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All the authors contributed substantially to planning of the study and drafting of the article.
