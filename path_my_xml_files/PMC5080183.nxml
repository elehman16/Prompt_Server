muscle strength of the ankle joint, balance, and gait in stroke patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty-seven subjects who had had a stroke were randomly allocated to either the
ankle biofeedback training group (n=14) or control group (n=13). Conventional therapy,
which adhered to the neurodevelopmental treatment approach, was administered to both
groups for 30 minutes. Furthermore, ankle strengthening exercises were performed by the
control group and ankle biofeedback training by the experimental group, each for 30
minutes, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. To test muscle strength, balance, and gait, the Biodex
isokinetic dynamometer, functional reach test, and 10&#x02005;m walk test, respectively, were
used. [Results] After the intervention, both groups showed a significant increase in
muscle strength on the affected side and improved balance and gait. Significantly greater
improvements were observed in the balance and gait of the ankle biofeedback training group
compared with the control group, but not in the strength of the dorsiflexor and plantar
flexor muscles of the affected side. [Conclusion] This study showed that ankle biofeedback
training significantly improves muscle strength of the ankle joint, balance, and gait in
patients with stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Biofeedback training</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although human life expectancy has increased with economic growth and developments in
medicine, there are greater numbers of stroke patients because of irregular eating habits,
environmental pollution, and excessive stress due to rapid social change<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among 40% of stroke patients, 15 to 30%
have severe functional damage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The main
symptoms of stroke patients are an imbalance in muscle strength, difficulty in shifting
weight toward the affected side, impeded postural control, and gait disturbance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients have problems in the transmission process of nervous information involved
in the stimulation of the foot, which is delivered to and from the central nervous system
through the spinal cord and to the muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These factors frequently result in paralysis of the plantar flexor
and dorsiflexor muscles and a decrease in motor function and balance due to decreased muscle
strength<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result, ankle
strengthening can lead to improvements in the regulation of posture and strength of the
dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This, in turn, increases the impact on the biomechanical torque values<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscle strength is significantly improved by conventional physical therapy and progressive
resistance training applied to the ankle muscles, as well as causing improvements in walking
and balance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, sufficient
improvement in the gait of the resistance exercise group compared with the non-resistance
exercise group was not reported in this study. Furthermore, although walking ability,
including walking speed, cadence and stride length, were improved with muscle strength
training with body weight support in patients with stroke, the number of subjects was too
small and the results did not show an apparent effect on the ankle<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that the effects of ankle strength training on
balance are unclear, effective training methods are also unclear in patients with
stroke.</p><p>Recently, balance training equipment has been used clinically to promote and improve muscle
strength and balance in stroke patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This equipment helps balance by obtaining sufficient support from
increased muscle activity of the weakened low extremities, stimulating muscle stability, and
maintaining a standing position<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
effects of balance training on the strength of the muscles around the ankle and their
effects on balance ability remain unclear.</p><p>Therefore, the effects of ankle balance training with biofeedback on muscle strength and
the impact of improving the strength of the muscles around the ankle through ankle
biofeedback training (ABT) on balance in patients with stroke were examined in this
study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this research were 27 stroke patients hospitalized in the J rehabilitation
hospital in Incheon, Korea. All experimental procedures and contents were explained to each
participant, who subsequently provided written informed consent. The research protocols were
approved by the institutional review board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: presence of hemiparesis secondary to stroke that
had occurred less than 2&#x02005;years but more than 6 months ago; ability to walk 10&#x02005;m
independently with or without an assistive device or person; ability to communicate and
understand, as indicated by a Mini-Mental Status Examination score of more than 21 points;
and no visual disorders or visual field deficits. Exclusion criteria were use of medication
or other therapies for cardiovascular disease or metabolic disorder and known
musculoskeletal conditions that would affect the ability to walk safely.</p><p>The subjects were assigned to either of the two groups according to gender in a matched
pair randomization design for equivalent distribution. Fifteen male and twelve female
subjects were divided into the ABT (male: female, 8:6) and control groups (male: female,
7:6). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of their general
characteristics (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the general characteristics of the subjects in the ABT and control

times a week for 8 weeks was provided to all subjects. All participants were evaluated
before training and at the end of the 8-week training period.</p><p>The Biodex Balance System<sup>TM</sup> SD (Biodex, USA, 2009) balance training equipment
was used to train the ABT group. The training machine consists of a multiaxial standing
platform that can be adjusted to provide varying degrees of platform tilt or
instability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were trained
wearing footwear and were positioned on the platform in a comfortable position while
gripping a handlebar. Subjects were instructed and challenged from a monitor to try to
balance or hold the platform in various positions. Participants were offered real-time audio
and visual biofeedback during training. A maximum of 20 degrees of surface platform tilt was
selected. With this degree of surface tilt, a dynamic situation is created, similar to
actual functional activities that result in instability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the control group, ankle-strengthening exercises for the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor
muscles of the affected side were performed by a physical therapist at 70% of maximum muscle
strength. The strengthening exercises consisted of isometric, isotonic, and open and closed
kinetic chain exercises. Training was stopped immediately if subjects complained of
discomfort, pain, or excessive fatigue.</p><p>Ankle plantar flexor and dorsiflexor strength was assessed using a Biodex Isokinetic
Dynamometer<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants sat in the
Biodex chair and a foot was placed on the footplate. Their position was adjusted so that the
knee was comfortable (up to 60&#x000b0; flexion), and patients were secured with a Velcro belt
across the chest, pelvis, and thighs. Maximum isometric plantar flexor and dorsiflexor
strengths were assessed using the standard operating procedures for the dynamometer with the
ankle at 60&#x000b0;. For plantar flexion, the foot of the participant was pushed downward, as hard
as possible, against the footplate. It was then pulled upward, as strongly as possible, to
assess dorsiflexion.</p><p>The functional reach test (FRT) was conducted by replicating Duncan et al.&#x02019;s method<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject stood adjacent to a 100&#x02005;cm
tape measure that was placed at shoulder height. The start position and end position
measurements were recorded by the therapists, and three trials were performed by each
patient. Subjects were asked to reach as far forward as possible without losing their
balance. FRT was determined as the mean difference between the start position and end
position over the three trials. Patients were supervised by a physical therapist throughout
the trials.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; gait was evaluated using the 10&#x02005;m walking test (10MWT). For the 10MWT, the
subjects were instructed to walk a total of 14&#x02005;m at their fastest speed. The speed for the
middle 10 m, i.e., excluding the first 2&#x02005;m and the last 2 m, was measured. The 10MWT time
was measured with a stopwatch from the moment the subject&#x02019;s feet passed the starting line to
the moment they crossed the finish line. To ensure that the subjects had adapted to the
test, all measurements were performed three times and the average value was calculated. For
the 10MWT, the test-retest and interrater reliability have been reported to be 0.95 and
0.90, respectively; both of these values are very high<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics ver. 18.0 (IBM Co., Armonk,
NY, USA). The paired t-test was performed for comparison of ankle strength, balance, and
gait within the group before and after exercises. The independent t-test was used for
comparisons between the groups. The p-value for significance was set at 0.05 for all
analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of this study, there were significant changes in muscle strength,

improves muscular strength as compared to conventional strengthening exercises in stroke
patients. Although not all of the muscles of the lower extremity were measured, significant
improvements were seen in the measurements of the ankle muscles after training. The strength
of the ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors in the ABT group was found to have increased
significantly. Greater stability during the trials, along with significant improvement in
the strength of the lower extremity was indicated by the results. In the control group,
significant increases in the strength of ankle dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles were
also found. However, there were no significant differences in the strength between the two
groups.</p><p>The gain in strength in the ABT group was similar to that in the control group and may
possibly be due to improvements in sympathetic transmission of the motor neurons<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In earlier studies, electrophysiological
traces of reinforcement were shown when certain movements were performed. These changes
might be learning effects.</p><p>In the present study, balance significantly improved in the ABT group after 8 weeks of
training. The findings of the present study agree with previous studies. Barcala et al.
reported that a physical therapy program combined with balance training involving visual
biofeedback led to improvements in body symmetry, balance, and function among stroke
victims<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. After balance training, an
increase in balance performance could be expected and was shown in the measurement results.
This increase was not apparent after strength training. After strength training, dynamic
balance performance was also improved, presumably based on the effects of training on the
reflex control of muscle activity induced by exercising in a closed kinematic chain with
known proprioceptive effects<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The significant improvement in balance in our study may
be explained by the improved intramuscular and intermuscular coordination, as well as by
more economic activation of agonists, which resulted in the stabilization of the
extremities<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One previous study demonstrated that balance training using force plate biofeedback, in
addition to a conventional rehabilitation program for stroke patients, is useful for
enhancing postural control and weight bearing on the paretic side while walking<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study also reported that balance
training with visual feedback improved the symmetry of the walking pattern<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, both of the aforementioned
studies did not describe how biofeedback balance training influenced the affected side of
patients. In the present study, significant differences in balance and gait parameters, but
not in strength, were demonstrated between the ABT and the control groups. This indicates
that the muscle strength of the affected side significantly improved in both groups,
verifying the therapeutic effects of ABT. It is possible that ABT of the affected limbs,
which stimulates proprioceptive posture control, is crucial for the rehabilitation of
balance in stroke patients.</p><p>There is evidence that balance and locomotor capacities are correlated in adults with
stroke and patients with cerebral palsy<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, adults with hemiplegia had
decreased dynamic balance abilities compared with non-hemiplegic adults, and this ability
was correlated with walking ability. The present study supports the suggestion by Park et
al. that the use of ankle proprioceptive control programs improves balance and walking
performance of patients with stroke<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Since the ability to control posture in static and dynamic situations is an essential
prerequisite for walking, it is therefore not surprising that balance training has an impact
on gait<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite the fact that an
association between quiet standing and walking appears to be less straightforward, it has
been demonstrated that postural control during quiet standing was related to weight-shifting
capacity, suggesting that both tasks depend, at least in part, on the same physiological
mechanisms<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are some limitations in the present study. The first limitation is the small number
of participants included. Further studies using the same study protocol could be performed
in a larger population. The second limitation is that ankle strengthening in the control
group does not involve the entire lower limb or whole body, which is necessary to maintain
body balance. The final limitation is the ABT protocol because there were various conditions
dependent on the status of the patients. Although we used the same ABT program throughout,
it could be applied at different intensities. A gold standard protocol for ABT has not yet
been formulated.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that ABT is an effective
method for improving muscle strength, balance, and gait in patients with stroke. The
training increased the muscle strength around the ankle and improved dynamic balance and
gait velocity. Therefore, ankle biofeedback training can be used to improve muscle strength
around the ankle, balance, and gait in chronic stroke patients in clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Centers for Disease Control
