Seven first-line pharmacotherapies that are currently available are recommended in clinical practice guidelines to treat tobacco dependence; all of these therapies have been tested to be effective for increasing tobacco abstinence rates when used as monotherapies in comparison with a placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, not all smokers are able to quit with monotherapy. Some smokers may benefit from a combination therapy featuring the simultaneous use of different nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) or drugs with different mechanisms of action (for example, NRT and bupropion). In a recent meta-analysis conducted by Mills <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], treatment with NRT did not show a superior effect compared with the standard treatment of either nicotine patches or varenicline used as monotherapies. In contrast, in the meta-analysis by Cahill <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], varenicline was shown to be superior to both NRT (odds ratio (OR) 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 1.91) and bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.96) but not to an NRT combination (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.48).</p><p>Combination therapy with different drugs may provide a therapeutic advantage by increasing the serum nicotine concentrations and capitalizing on the synergy obtained from two different mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, some smokers may benefit from a combination of varenicline and a NRT. Varenicline may not fully saturate the nicotinic receptors, and incompletely saturated receptors may lead to only a partial attenuation of nicotine cravings. If supplemental nicotine replacement therapy is used, more receptor saturation is achieved, which may diminish the urge to smoke more completely.</p><p>The evidence from studies with combination therapy using varenicline and NRT is limited. In a study by Ebbert <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a number of pharmacological combination therapies were compared with a standard treatment in a clinical cohort of residential smokers. The study showed that the combination of varenicline and NRT was safe, but no differences were observed from the group that received standard treatment in terms of effectiveness.</p><p>Recently, a randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] observed that the addition of nicotine patches to varenicline among smokers who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day did not increase the efficacy of varenicline as a monotherapy. However, a study by Koegelenberg <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] suggested that the efficacy of varenicline was enhanced by the addition of nicotine patches.</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of combining varenicline with nicotine patches versus varenicline as monotherapy in smokers who smoked twenty or more cigarettes per day for the last six months. The primary end point was the continuous abstinence rate from week two to week twelve of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Smoking Cessation Clinic situated in the University Bellvitge Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, between February 2012 and December 2013.</p><p>The center&#x02019;s ethics committee approved the study.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: being 18&#x000a0;years old or older, having smoked &#x02265;20 cigarettes daily for the last six months, providing consent to participate and no period of smoking abstinence longer than three months in the last year. Female smokers were eligible provided that they were not breastfeeding, pregnant (negative pregnancy test) or at risk of becoming pregnant. The exclusion criteria were current or past psychotic disorder (schizophrenia), history of suicide attempts, not understanding the Spanish language and current or past alcoholism or other drug addictions.</p><p>Smokers who had used nicotine transdermal patches or varenicline (VRN) in the last six months were excluded. Smokers with chronic diseases were not excluded.</p><p>After a baseline assessment, the participants were randomly assigned to the treatment arms (varenicline&#x02009;+&#x02009;nicotine patch or varenicline&#x02009;+&#x02009;placebo patch) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated randomization system, and random numbers were individually placed into sealed envelopes. An independent study collaborator preserved the sealed envelopes and conducted the allocation, allotting one sealed envelope per patient and opening it in front of the therapist and the patient. The sample size was estimated, accepting Type I error alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05 and 80% power in a two-sided test. Sample size was calculated based on abstinence rates in previous combination NRT and varenicline trials. A total of 170 subjects per group was necessary to detect a statistically significant difference of &#x02265;15.0% between groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedures</title><p>All participants attended the clinic for baseline assessments one week before the target quit day (TQD). At the baseline assessment visit, written informed consent was obtained, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed, and the baseline demographic variables and smoking and medical history were collected.

At each clinic visit, the use of the trial therapy, adverse events and cigarette consumption since the last clinic visit and the levels of exhaled carbon monoxide were assessed. Weight and blood pressure were determined at each visit. At each visit, smokers participated in behavioral counselling sessions that had been previously standardized. Sessions lasted 10 to 15&#x000a0;minutes each and were based on motivational interviewing. The sessions included practical counselling elements, such as problem solving and skills training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial medication</title><p>Varenicline was used in the standard commercial supply beginning one week before the TQD: 0.5&#x000a0;mg once daily for three days, then 0.5&#x000a0;mg twice daily for four days, followed by 1&#x000a0;mg twice daily for eleven weeks. The smokers received identical packages of either nicotine (Nicotinell&#x000ae; 21&#x000a0;mg/24&#x000a0;hours) or placebo patches for 11&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measures</title><p>The primary end point was continuous abstinence defined as not smoking throughout the follow-up period from week 2 (1&#x000a0;week after the quit date) to week 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

An observational study by Ebbert <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported no differences in the 30-day point prevalence abstinence rate between patients receiving the usual care and patients treated with varenicline and NRT at the six-month follow-up and in the reported data on the safety and tolerability of the combination of varenicline and NRT. A study by Hajek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which used the same method as the present trial with medication started as per labelling found no effect of the combination treatment at three months. Koegelenberg <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] found the combination more effective than varenicline alone at three and six months, but patch use was started two weeks prior to target quit date. The three studies included smokers of 10 cigarettes or more, in contrast to this study in which the participants were smokers of 20 or more cigarettes. In the Hajek study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the continuous abstinence rate at 12&#x000a0;weeks was similar to that observed in this study for all smokers in the combination group as a whole (36% versus 39.1%, respectively), although in those studies, smokers had lower levels of nicotine dependence and more attempts to stop smoking than did the smokers in this study. The abstinence rates were also similar at 12&#x000a0;weeks, which may reflect the existence of other factors such as the size of the study sample. The study by Koegelenberg <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] shows higher rates of abstinence than this study, which may be due to the inclusion criteria in relation to the amount of consumption (10 or more versus 20 or more cpd), the possible heterogeneity of the participants and that the nicotine patch was used for two weeks prior to the TQD. The results could reflect the effects of &#x02018;nicotine preloading&#x02019; rather than any effects of medication combination.</p><p>However, in the sub-analysis of the smokers of 29 or fewer cpd and of those who smoked more than 29&#x000a0;cpd, the abstinence rates at 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks were higher and more significant among the heavy smokers who had received the combination therapy. These results are similar to those of a study of the combination of bupropion and varenicline for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>This study&#x02019;s sample size was sufficient to detect differences in the abstinence rates equal to or greater than 15% in one of the groups. The dropout rate in both groups was similar, and no significant differences were observed in the participants who withdrew from the study because of adverse events. In this study, the dropouts and the subjects who failed to provide validation data were considered relapsed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], although not all of the smokers who dropped out may have actually relapsed, and an underestimation in the rates could have occurred. However, the number of subjects without information in each group was similar and was not considered to be a potential source of bias.</p><p>The different usage periods for both of the medications could represent a possible bias in the results. To control for these biases, the varenicline and patches were administered for 11&#x000a0;weeks. Using 21&#x000a0;mg/24&#x000a0;hours patches in combination therapy did not show an increase in adverse events. The number of patients experiencing headache, insomnia and nausea was similar in both groups and comparable with the rates reported in previous studies using 15&#x000a0;mg/16&#x000a0;hours patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Finally, another potential limitation is the possibility for bias in the non-pharmacological interventions. The study involved three different therapists trained in the standardized study protocol who were experts in smoking cessation. However, and although no differences were observed between different therapists, the counsellor may still have been a source of bias in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To control for this potential source of variation, the therapist was introduced in the final model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the combination of the varenicline with the nicotine patches does not improve abstinence rates at 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks compared with varenicline used as monotherapy although the combination treatment may help patients smoking 29 or more cpd.
