Although TAK&#x02010;438 showed a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the hERG channel current at all concentrations examined (0.5, 5, and 50 &#x003bc;g/mL), based on a C<sub>max</sub> value of 59.9 ng/mL seen at the highest expected human dose (40 mg) of TAK&#x02010;438 and the percentage human plasma protein binding of TAK&#x02010;438 ranging from 85.2&#x02013;88.0%, the safety margin based on free drug is calculated to be &#x0003e;540&#x02010;fold. The metabolites of vonoprazan are inactive and have not been tested <italic>in vitro</italic> for their inhibitory effect on hERG. A single administration of TAK&#x02010;438 at doses up to 20 mg/kg had no acute effects on the dog cardiovascular system (M. Hayashi, H. Jenkins, D. Crawford, and R. Jenkins, Takeda Global Investigator's Brochure TAK&#x02010;438, vonoprazan fumarate).</p><p>Prolongation of cardiac repolarization, as measured by the QT interval, can potentially increase the probability of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> The ICH E14 guidance recommends conducting a thorough QT/QTc study for all new non&#x02010;antiarrhythmic drugs to characterize their effects on QT intervals.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cts12452-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> As part of the clinical development program, this phase I, randomized, single&#x02010;center, 4&#x02010;period, 4&#x02010;sequence, crossover study was designed to examine the effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of vonoprazan, a novel orally active P&#x02010;CAB, on the QT/QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects by analyzing the mean difference in the postdose, time&#x02010;matched, baseline&#x02010;adjusted QTcF between vonoprazan and placebo and between moxifloxacin and placebo. To prevent reader bias and to maintain consistency in QT measurement, the ICH E14 guidance states that ECGs should be read in a central laboratory by a small group of trained readers blinded to both treatment and patient identity.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> In the present study, continuous Holter ECG recordings were performed for 24 h at baseline and following each treatment regimen. ECGs were extracted at scheduled pharmacokinetic timepoints for blinded review by a trained cardiologist at the central laboratory. The maximum upper bound of the one&#x02010;sided 95% CI for ddQTcF for TAK&#x02010;438 40 and 120 mg were below the threshold of regulatory concern of 10 ms.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> The findings from this study demonstrate that, in healthy subjects, vonoprazan did not cause concern about QTc prolongation according to the ICH E 14 criteria, and was well tolerated.</p><p>In accordance with the ICH E14 guidelines, a positive control was used in this study to verify the assay sensitivity. This study included moxifloxacin 400 mg administered as a single dose at one of the four periods to each subject open&#x02010;label. Assay sensitivity was established in this study because the lower bound of the one&#x02010;sided 95% CI for ddQTcF was &#x0003e;5 ms between 1.5 and 12 h postdose. Therefore, QT data for vonoprazan could be interpreted, and following 40 mg and 120 mg doses of vonoprazan, the maximum upper bound of the one&#x02010;sided 95% CI for ddQTcF was 4.9 ms. This is less than the threshold of concern when the maximum upper bound of the one&#x02010;sided 95% CI for ddQTcF is &#x0003e;10 ms.</p><p>Since the QT interval shortens with increasing heart rate, QT correction methods are used.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> In this study, QT interval correction methods that were used included QTcF, QTcB, QTcss, and QTcI. An assessment of the QT correction methods using Spearman correlation coefficients indicated that the most appropriate intervals for assessment were QTcF, QTcI, and QTcss. Assessment and correction of QT/QTc by multiple correction methods confirmed that vonoprazan did not significantly prolong the QT/QTc in healthy subjects. There were no subjects with a QTcF interval &#x0003e;450 ms or an increase from baseline &#x0003e;30 ms after administration of vonoprazan.</p><p>For vonoprazan 40 mg and 120 mg, there was a small decrease from baseline in heart rate with a mean range of 2 to 6 bpm between 4 h and 6 h postdose. This decrease was considered not clinically significant and was not expected to confound heart&#x02010;rate correction of QT values. No clinically significant U&#x02010;waves or T&#x02010;waves were observed in any subject. In addition, no cardiac adverse events were reported. The results obtained from ECG recordings in this study are consistent with a lack of clinically meaningful changes for any ECG parameters observed during previous clinical studies of vonoprazan to date.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="cts12452-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cts12452-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> In addition, an analysis of dQTcF data from earlier phase I single rising dose PK studies (data on file) showed no statistical evidence of QT prolongation, with the rate of change of dQTcF per unit of concentration of TAK&#x02010;438 of &#x02013;0.023 (ms/ng/mL) (95% CI &#x02013;0.65, 0.19).</p><p>Similar to data from previous studies,<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="cts12452-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> plasma concentrations of vonoprazan increased in a slightly more than dose&#x02010;proportional manner. Thorough QT studies should ensure that dose&#x02013;response and concentration&#x02013;response relationships for QTc prolongation are fully characterized, including exploration of concentrations higher than those anticipated in therapeutic use. In this study, there was no evidence of QT/QTc prolongation or arrhythmogenic effects with maximum clinical and supratherapeutic doses of vonoprazan, and results from the linear model to evaluate the relationship between ddQTc and plasma vonoprazan concentration showed that there was no increase in the QTc interval with increasing concentration of vonoprazan.</p><p>The safety profile of vonoprazan in this study was consistent with previous studies of vonoprazan in healthy subjects.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="cts12452-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cts12452-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Single doses of vonoprazan at 40 mg and 120 mg were well tolerated and most adverse events were considered mild or moderate in intensity. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported during the study. No abnormal laboratory values were reported. Hepatic laboratory values were within normal limits.</p><p>A potential limitation of this study is that the study was conducted in healthy volunteers, rather than the target population. Another limitation is that the current study evaluated the effects on the QT interval after only a single dose of vonoprazan, while the recommended oral dose of vonoprazan is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks to 8 weeks, depending on the indication.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> However, in a phase I study of vonoprazan 10 mg to 40 mg once daily for 7 consecutive days in healthy Japanese males (<italic>N =</italic> 60), there was no clinically relevant accumulation of vonoprazan or its metabolites with similar pharmacokinetic parameters on Days 1 and 7.<xref rid="cts12452-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Although the long&#x02010;term effects of vonoprazan on QT/QTc in patients cannot be determined from the current study, long&#x02010;term clinical studies with vonoprazan lasting up to 2 years have not identified clinically meaningful changes in serum electrolyte levels or ECG parameters (unpublished data; OCT&#x02010;301, Mizokami Y, Oda K, Funao N, Nishimura A, Soen S, Kawai T, Ashida K, <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.; and OCT&#x02010;302, Kawai T, Oda K, Funao N, Nishimura A, Matsumoto Y, Mizokami Y, Ashida K, <italic>et al</italic>.)</p><p>The results of this study are strengthened by its randomized, 4&#x02010;period, 4&#x02010;sequence, placebo&#x02010; and active&#x02010;controlled crossover study design outlined in the ICH E14 guidelines for the evaluation of the QT/QTc interval with non&#x02010;antiarrhythmic drugs. Assay sensitivity was established in the study by the use of moxifloxacin as a positive control to detect clinically significant changes from baseline in QT/QTc. The present study utilized a supratherapeutic dose of vonoprazan in addition to a potential maximum therapeutic dose. Given that there was no increase in the QTc interval at the supratherapeutic dose, it can be expected that there will not be an effect of vonoprazan on the QTc interval at the dose targeted for clinical use.</p><p>In conclusion, this study met the requirements of a negative QT/QTc study and further supports the assertion that there is a limited likelihood that a clinically meaningful QT prolongation would occur in a clinical setting during treatment with vonoprazan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>
