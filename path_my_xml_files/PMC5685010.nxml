However, there is a need for increased knowledge regarding: a) differences in the peak pressure (PP) and pressure time integral (PTI) for different types of insoles; and b) the properties of the pressure distribution for insoles used over a period of several months. We present the results of a randomized trial to compare the plantar pressures of three commonly used insoles.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to compare the PP and PTI between three types of insoles. The secondary objective was to explore the long-term pattern of peak plantar pressure distribution and variations in specific regions of interest (ROI). The tertiary objective was to investigate the impacts of insole adjustments, how much the insoles were used, and the levels of patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a 2-year trial, 114 patients with type 1 (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;31) or type 2 (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;83) diabetes (62 men and 52 women; mean age, 57.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15.4 years; duration of diabetes, 12.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;11.2 years; neuropathy, 38%), were randomized to be supplied with one of three different insoles. The ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) insoles were used in outdoor walking shoes. The 35 EVA group (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;39) received soft custom-made insoles&#x000a0;composed of EVA of 35 shore A hardness, the 55 EVA group (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37) received custom-made&#x000a0;insoles composed of EVA of 55 shore hardness, and the control group (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;38) received prefabricated insoles composed of a hard core with a top layer of soft 12 shore hardness microfiber. Using F-Scan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, the in-shoe plantar pressures were measured at seven ROI (hallux, metatarsal head 1, metatarsal head 2, metatarsal head 4, metatarsal head 5, lateral aspect of the mid-foot, heel) on five occasions during the study period. The plantar-pressure variables used were PP (main outcome) and PTI. The plantar patterns of load were explored, satisfaction and usage of the insoles were rated by the participants, and insole adjustments were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A mixed model analysis estimated lower PP values in the heel regions for the 35 EVA and 55 EVA insoles (171&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13 and 161&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13&#x000a0;kPa, respectively) than for the prefabricated insoles (234&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;kPa) (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Also for some of the other six ROI indications of difference in PP or PTI could be observed. The redistribution of peak plantar pressure for all of the insoles, was stable at the mid-foot, while the proportion of load on the distal area changed during the study period According to the self-reported answers (scale, 0&#x02013;100), the average usage of the insoles was rated as 79 and satisfaction was rated as 85 (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;75). Thirty-two percent of the subjects had not received foot care. Fourteen adjustments to insoles were made during the study period, and 86 pairs of insoles were exchanged due to wear, with 49% being exchanged in the 35 EVA group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Custom-made insoles used in combination with stable walking shoes gave lower pressures at the heel region. The variation makes it difficult to detect a systematic difference in plantar pressure for the 6 ROI, if such a difference indeed exists. The levels of satisfaction and usage for all the insoles tested were high. The insoles maintained their pressure redistribution properties over long periods, and few adjustments were needed.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Diabetes</kwd><kwd>Foot ulcer</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Insoles</kwd><kwd>Offloading</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>EVA, ethylene vinyl acetate</kwd><kwd>35 EVA, 35 shore EVA insoles</kwd><kwd>55 EVA, 55 shore EVA insoles</kwd><kwd>ROI, region of interest</kwd><kwd>MTH1, metatarsal head 1</kwd><kwd>MTH2, metatarsal head 2</kwd><kwd>MTH4, metatarsal head 4</kwd><kwd>MTH5, metatarsal head 5</kwd><kwd>PP, peak pressure</kwd><kwd>PTI, pressure time integral</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The effective prevention of foot ulcers in the 347 million people around the world who are diagnosed with diabetes can be achieved with appropriate footwear <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

It is widely debated among clinicians whether or not: (i) all patients with diabetes should have custom-made insoles; and (ii) custom-made insoles constructed from softer material are more effective in reducing the pressures in areas where there is a high risk of an ulcer development. Using an in-shoe pressure measurement technique, new insights may be obtained as to plantar pressure distribution, which will enable the formulation of recommendations related to the optimal prescription of insoles. This paper presents the results of a study in which patients with diabetes were given different types of insoles and the impacts on plantar pressure were evaluated. The patients were followed for 2 years with regard to differences in the peak pressure (PP) and pressure time integral (PTI) for different types of insoles, and additional information, e.g., levels of patient satisfaction with the insoles, was recorded at the end of the study.</p><p>Several studies on this topic have been performed in recent years. The first randomized trial, which was conducted by Paton and colleagues in 2012, included 119 patients with diabetes (96% with type 1) and neuropathy <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and compared custom-made insoles with prefabricated insoles. The material used for both types of insoles consisted of a 3-mm-thick EVA base (medium density), with a top cover of 6-mm-thick Poron<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Their results showed no significant differences in peak plantar pressure between the different types of insoles, as measured with the F-Scan in-shoe measurement system. However, the PTI values during walking were lower for the custom-made insoles than for the prefabricated in the forefoot area.</p><p>Bus et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and Owings et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> measured plantar pressure in cross-sectional studies using the Pedar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> shoe-pressure measuring system. Bus et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> studied 20 patients with diabetic neuropathy and foot deformities and showed that custom-made CAD-CAM manufactured insoles (composed of urethane foam over a 2-mm base with a 0.7-mm top cover) significantly reduced the PP and force-time integrals at the heel and first metatarsal head, as compared with a flat insole made of open-cell polyurethane 0.95&#x000a0;mm. These two types of insoles were tested in super-depth shoes.</p><p>Owing et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> established a threshold value (207&#x000a0;kPa) for plantar pressure, and they recommended this value as the upper limit that should not be exceeded if ulcer recurrence was to be avoided. These results were obtained from a group of 49 patients with diabetes and neuropathy who used their own shoes during the study period. In the same study, the mean barefoot plantar peak pressure measured with the Emed<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> platform was 566&#x000a0;kPa.</p><p>The primary objective of the present study was to compare the peak pressures (PP), maximal peak pressures (maxPP) and pressure time integrals (PTI) for three types of commonly used insoles in a cohort of diabetic patients with or without neuropathy. The plantar pressure variables were studied for seven regions of interest (ROI). The secondary objective involved exploring the redistribution patterns of the average peak plantar pressures between the ROI, by studying the different sources of variations in the data and describing the insoles, adjustments, the frequencies of insole use, and the levels of patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>We performed a randomized, controlled trial that comprised patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were referred to the Department of Prosthetics and Orthotics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. The patients were supplied with insoles and shoes. Data collection and pressure measurements were performed in collaboration with the Gait Laboratory, Lundberg Laboratory for Orthopaedic Research, located at the same hospital. Recruitment took place between January 2008 and September 2009, and the patients were followed for 2 years, with examinations at approximately 6-month intervals. In line with regional guidelines and prevention strategies, the patients who were referred to be supplied with insoles and shoes were those who showed clinical signs of distal neuropathy or angiopathy, had a history of a previous ulcers or amputation, and had foot deformities or foot pathologies <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A total of 235 participants met the primary criteria for study eligibility, which were: &#x02265;18 years of age; diagnosis of diabetes; ability to walk unaided; ability to understand the Swedish language; no present foot ulcers and being first-time visitors. Patients who were included in the study were randomly allocated to one of the following three interventions: (i) custom-made insoles composed of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) with a hardness of 35 shore A (35 EVA group; <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;39); (ii) custom-made insoles composed of EVA of 55 shore A hardness (55 EVA group; <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37); and (iii) prefabricated insoles (control group; <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;38). The 35 shore A EVA is softer than the 55 shore EVA. A randomization with sealed envelopes (38 in each group) was performed prior study start prepared by the researchers at Lundberg Laboratory for Orthopaedic Research. The allocation was concealed until assignment occurred and the technician was informed of the assigned intervention. A mistake at the Department of Prosthetics and Orthotics at study start resulted that one participant extra got insoles of 35 shore hardness and the 55 EVA group got one less.</p><p>Custom-made insoles were fabricated using individual positive plaster molds, based on a negative plaster cast. Casting of the foot was performed with the patient in a prone position. The heating and vacuum formation of the 14-mm-thick EVA material followed the distributor's recommendations (E603442, E603402; &#x000d6;ssur Nordic, Uppsala, Sweden). Patients in the control group received prefabricated insoles (GloboTec<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Comfort 312750501400; GloboTec, Bauerfeind, Germany) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). One technician fabricated all the individual insoles with a standardized metatarsal bar proximal to metatarsal heads II&#x02013;IV. The insoles were adjusted to fit into the participant's shoes, which were designed to be used outdoors. All the shoes had a semi-rigid outer sole or stiff rocker bottom, a stable heel counter, and adjustable laces or Velcro straps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). Upon manufacturing, the shoes were checked, to ensure that they met&#x000a0;all the set criteria. In addition, at each follow-up, it was confirmed that the shoes still met the criteria. Photographs were taken of the shoes and the plantar surfaces of the feet of the subjects. All adjustments to the insoles during the study period were registered in the categories of: higher or lower metatarsal bar; more lateral or medial support; and more material under the heel. New insoles were supplied when any cracks or breakdown areas in the insoles were detected at follow-up (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). At baseline, the self-reported status was recorded, which included the duration of diabetes, type of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, use of medication, use of nicotine, and ability to walk normally (yes/no).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Insoles and shoes.

Participants who developed plantar ulcers discontinued the study and received appropriate treatment. The Gothenburg regional Ethics Review Board approved the study (diary number 299-07), and all the participants gave their written informed consent.

The ultra-thin pressure sensor was trimmed to fit into the participant's shoes before the assessment. The foot sensors had a spatial density of four pressure sensors per cm<sup>2</sup> and recorded the data for 400 frames in 8&#x000a0;s at a sampling rate of 50&#x000a0;Hz. The participants walked 10&#x000a0;m at a self-selected speed 6 times, and walking calibration was performed for each individual according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the protocol of Hsiao et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These authors recommend a calibration procedure with the sensors loaded with similar pressure as in the trial, giving a reasonable measurement error (1.3&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;5.8%). In the current study, each record was controlled for saturation before the record was saved. The investigator looked at the screen and confirmed that the saturation level of the pressure sensor was not reached. The sensors used had a durability that allowed each to be used several times, and they were discarded when signs of measurement error appeared on the screen at the time of recording.</p><p>The F-Scan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 6.62 software has predefined boxes with analysis tools for seven regions of interest (ROI), which correspond to regions that are exposed to high levels of pressure during walking, i.e., the heel, lateral aspect of the mid-foot, metatarsal head 5 (MTH5), MTH4, MTH2, MTH1, and the hallux.

The model had only one random effect, namely an intercept, with patients considered as the grouping factor.

In the first sub-analysis, the differences in total loaded plantar surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>) between the different insoles were evaluated. This evaluation was performed first using ANOVA, and then proceeding to pair-wise comparisons with <italic>t</italic>-tests. To account for multiplicity, Dunnett's multiplicity correction procedure was used. As the areas for different time-points for the same patient were expected to be dependent, this analysis was performed not on the raw data, but rather on the average of the loaded area (averaging for each patient over time). Thus, an additional response variable, termed &#x0201c;AVERAGE area,&#x0201d; was introduced.</p><p>In the second sub-analysis, differences in PP values for the participants with and without neuropathy were evaluated with a <italic>t</italic>-test. Following the reasoning outlined above, the response variable analyzed was &#x0201c;AVERAGE peak pressure&#x0201d; (averaging the PP for each patient over time). The calculation was done for all seven ROI.</p><p>The third sub-analysis was a further examination of the distribution of the data, made by examining measurement variations in five randomly selected participants. For these five participants, the pressure measurements for all 30 separate walks were available. Thus, the within-subject variation, &#x0201c;measurement error,&#x0201d; for each ROI at time-points 0&#x02013;4 was compared with the between-subject variation, &#x0201c;population diversity.&#x0201d;</p><p>Finally, the participants with values of peak pressure that exceeded 500&#x000a0;kPa were examined separately.</p><p>The Microsoft Excel 2010, SPSS version 19, and R software packages were used for the statistical calculations.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Results</title><p>The results of the exploratory analysis for PP, maxPP, and PTI at baseline for the three types of insoles are presented in <xref rid="tbl1A" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1B" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1B</xref>A and B. The graphical presentation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>) shows that all three insoles produced a median pressure of approximately 200&#x000a0;kPa throughout the study.</p><p>The distributions of the proportion of peak pressure during the study for each ROI and for each type of insole are presented in the <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>. The highest peak pressures were at MTH2 and the hallux, while the lowest peak pressure was at the mid-foot for all the insole types. The redistribution properties over the PP over the 2 years were stable at the mid-foot, while the proportion of load on the distal area changed during the study period. The overall peak pressures for the custom-made 35 EVA and 55 EVA insoles were lower than those for the prefabricated insoles (35 EVA, 180&#x000a0;kPa (15% lower); 55 EVA, 189&#x000a0;kPa (10% lower); prefabricated, 211&#x000a0;kPa), as we ignored the differences in the seven ROI.</p><p>From the mixed models analysis (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>), a clear difference is evident only for the heel region between the two custom-made insoles and the prefabricated insoles. The estimated difference in PP between the EVA 35 insoles and the prefabricated insoles was 63&#x000a0;kPa, and the estimated difference between the 55 EVA insoles and the prefabricated insoles was 72&#x000a0;kPa (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for both comparisons). The estimated difference in PTI between the 35 EVA insoles and the prefabricated insoles was 14&#x000a0;kPa&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;sec, and the estimated difference between the 55 EVA insoles and the prefabricated insoles was 20&#x000a0;kPa&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;sec (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). For such small <italic>p</italic>-values, the statistical significance would remain even if a multiplicity correction procedure (e.g. Bonferroni) would be performed.</p><p>The mixed model analysis also indicated possible differences in PP values between the prefabricated insoles and the EVA 35 insoles for MTH1 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.046) and MTH2 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.041), and a possible difference between the prefabricated insoles and EVA 55 insoles for MTH5 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). However, it should be borne in mind that these <italic>p</italic>-values are calculated without taking into account the issue of multiple hypotheses testing, and thus, although they indicate a difference, this cannot be seen as a confirmation of its existence.</p><p>Several of the mixed effects models (PP and PTI for the heel region, PTI for MTH4 and MTH5) also detected a possible effect of the &#x0201c;Age of insoles.&#x0201d; For all of these, the estimate of the effect was positive, supporting the intuitive belief that the pressures at some ROI should increase as the soles become older.</p><p>In the first sub-analysis of the total loaded plantar surface using ANOVA, the null hypothesis of no difference between the insoles could be rejected with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.028. The subsequent Dunnett's test gave <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.015 with an estimated difference of 12&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> when comparing EVA 35 insoles with the prefabricated insoles, and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.174 (estimated difference of 8&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>) when comparing EVA 55 insoles with the prefabricated insoles. Therefore, we conclude that the total loaded area differs between the EVA 35 and prefabricated insoles. The second sub-analysis showed no statistically significant differences between participants with and without neuropathy. The AVERAGE peak pressure was lower at the hallux region and higher at the heel for those participants with neuropathy (for the hallux, 215&#x000a0;kPa vs. 250&#x000a0;kPa, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.063; for the heel, 202&#x000a0;kPa vs. 191&#x000a0;kPa, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.399; values for &#x02018;with neuropathy&#x02019; versus &#x02018;without neuropathy&#x02019;).</p><p>The third sub-analysis of the variation (within-subject variation divided by between-subject variation, which we refer to as the &#x0201c;relative variance&#x0201d;) in PP values for the five participants' measurements (seven ROI at five time-points) showed variance of &#x0003c;20% in 74% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) of the measurements. Relative variance levels of &#x0003e;20% and &#x0003c;30% appeared in 20% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7) and relative variance of &#x0003e;30% appeared in 6% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) of the measurements.</p><p>Finally, the subjects with extremely high PP levels under the sole of the foot (&#x0003e;500&#x000a0;kPa) were examined separately. Such high pressures were observed in six participants. By analyzing images of the plantar surface in these cases, calluses, thin fat pads, and foot deformities were identified and found to correspond to the areas with PP values &#x0003e;500&#x000a0;kPa.</p><p>Patient compliance with the insoles was reported, with a mean score of 79 on the 0&#x02013;100 analogue scale (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;75) at the final follow-up (for the 35 EVA, 55 EVA, and prefabricated insoles groups: 73, 81, and 84, respectively). The satisfaction level was 85 (for the 35 EVA, 55 EVA, and prefabricated insoles groups: 86, 87, and 81, respectively). Forty-nine (66%) of the participants reported having had access to foot care.</p><p>In total, 86 pairs of insoles were exchanged due to wear (49% of the replacements occurred in the 35 EVA group, 20% in 55 EVA group, and 31% in the control group). Forty-three percent (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;49) of the participants used the original pair of assigned insoles throughout the study. The average life-time of the insoles per group, calculated as the mean number of days (SD), was 260 (252) days for the 35 EVA group, 327 (284) for the 55 EVA group, and 318 (278) days for the prefabricated insoles group. In all, 14 adjustments to insoles were made during the study. Ten adjustments were made in the 55 EVA group and two in each of the other groups. The adjustments made to insoles in the 55 EVA group were: lowering of the metatarsal bar (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5); addition of material beneath the insoles (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2); offloading a bony prominence at digit three (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1); and unspecified (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2). One insole had both an adjustment of a lower metatarsal bar and added lateral support. The adjustments made to insoles in the 35 EVA group involved the addition of material under the heel (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2). The adjustments made to the prefabricated insoles were: the addition material under the heel (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1); and unspecified (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1).</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p>The most important finding of the present study is the significantly lower pressure at the heel observed in the comparisons of the custom-made insoles with the prefabricated insoles. Both the PP and PTI analyzes of the heel confirmed this finding. Aging of the insoles also had an effect on the PP and PTI at this ROI.</p><p>The pressure redistribution capacities of custom-made insoles in the heel region assessed in the present study are in accordance with the previously described results of Bus et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Pressure reduction in the heel region is probably due to the casting procedure, which entails tight molding that follows the contour of the heel. A three-dimensional view of a custom-made insole (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>) shows a narrow heel width together with high edges, which retain the heel pad under the bony prominences of the calcaneus, thereby providing cushioning. Thus adjusting the prefabricated insoles with higher edges that are positioned tight to the heel can be assumed to improve the pressure reduction properties.</p><p>The overall peak pressures on the foot soles of the patients who wore custom-made insoles in our study were 180&#x000a0;kPa and 189&#x000a0;kPa. These pressures are comparable to the overall peak pressures reported by Ledoux et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, who studied patients with diabetes with or without foot ulcers. They also used the F-Scan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in-shoe pressure measurement system and reported overall mean peak pressures of 194&#x000a0;kPa for patients without ulcers (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;274) and 219&#x000a0;kPa for patients with foot ulcers (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;47). In that study, 81% of the patients the ulcerated group had neuropathy, whereas 48% of the non-ulcer group had neuropathy. The patients with foot ulcers in the study of Ledoux et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> had an overall peak pressure that was higher than the patients in the current study (none of whom had foot ulcers) who were provided with prefabricated insoles (211&#x000a0;kPa). However, the results of the&#x000a0;overall peak pressure measurements might not be fully comparable, as definition of the total area analyzed was different than current study.</p><p>The clinically relevant reference value to avoid diabetic foot ulcers recurrence has been variously reported as 207&#x000a0;kPa (measured using the Pedar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system) and 291&#x000a0;kPa (measured with the Pliance<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system) <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These values are similar to the peak pressures obtained for all three insoles in the present study (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). However, comparisons of threshold values should be interpreted with care, due to differences between ROI and differences in applied technologies (e.g., spatial resolution, pressure range, sampling calibration procedure, and raw data pre-processing) between the Pedar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pliance<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and F-Scan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> systems. The implication is that all three types of insoles possibly might reduce the pressure at the heel to a degree that prevents stress on the soft tissue. The issue as to whether or not differences in pressure distribution properties exist for the remaining six ROI analyzed here is not resolved in the present study.</p><p>Based on the results of the present study, we recommend that patients with diabetes should be given custom-made insoles when reduction of the peak pressure in the heel region is the primary goal. The current results can be generalized and are clinically applicable to patients with diabetes with or without neuropathy and without ulcers. It is assumed that walking shoes are used together with the insoles.</p><p>The second aim of the study was to explore the patterns of plantar pressure redistribution in the patients who wore the shoes with the different insoles. The proportion of the load shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> indicates that small changes occur over time in the seven ROI for all of the different insoles. The load on the forefoot is larger than that on the mid-foot. The main differences are in the heel region, with higher relative pressures for the prefabricated insoles than for the custom-made insoles. Differences between the insoles can be seen in the hallux region and the metatarsal heads. The reasons to the variation of pressure over time in these distal regions are not fully understood.</p><p>Three different pressure measurement outcomes were used in the present study, due to the lack of international consensus, to evaluate the different aspects of plantar pressure distribution. The PP variable and PTI are commonly applied in studies that use F-Scan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in-shoe pressure-measuring devices <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. The maxPP parameter was added for descriptive purposes (<xref rid="tbl1A" ref-type="table">Tables 1A</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1B" ref-type="table">B</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>), although is omitted in the subsequent analyzes. The sub-analyzes of total loaded plantar area are presented for the reader to evaluate further the differences in contact between the foot and insoles for the different types of insoles.</p><p>Twenty-eight (25%) of the participants were lost to the final follow-up. They left the study due to personal reasons (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15), disease (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), change of insoles (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3), death (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2), and the development of foot ulcers (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2). The missing pressure measurements (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;90) are mainly due to drop-outs (69%). The high dropout rates (25%&#x02013;50%) observed for patients with diabetes at risk of developing ulcers must be considered when designing future trials. Bus et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, who followed patients with diabetes and a healed foot ulcers over 18 months, reported a drop-out rate of 47%.</p><p>The annual incidence of foot ulcers in the present study (0.9%) is low compared with previously those in published population-based studies from the UK (2%), and USA (3%) <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. To evaluate the outcome of the yearly incidence of foot ulcers, a higher number of participants needs to be included in future studies.</p><p>In total, 14 adjustments to the insoles were made during the study. The 55 EVA insoles accounted for most (71%) of these adjustments. Overall, 43% of the participants did not change their shoe insoles during the entire study period. This result includes the participants who left the study before the last follow-up. It is noteworthy that the prefabricated and 35 EVA insoles had to be exchanged more frequently due to material fatigue. Surprisingly, the prefabricated insole had a longer life-span than the custom-made insoles. The life-span data show a large standard deviation, which is attributable to the extensive inter-subject variability; some participants exchanged their insoles frequently, while others used the originally assigned insoles for the entire duration of the study. The patient-reported outcomes reveal extensive use of the insoles and a high level of satisfaction among the participants, which are of importance for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. At the point in time when the present study initiated objective estimates of compliance were not available, therefore we used a visual analogue scale. To our knowledge, the first report of an objective instrument for adherence to footwear was presented in Year 2012 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>Prevention strategies to avoid foot ulcers recommend that foot care be included. In the present study, one-third of the patients had not received any foot care. Based on our result it is advisable to combine insole use with routine foot care.</p><sec id="sec7.1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study showed a high level of variation for the PP, maxPP, and PTI values (<xref rid="tbl1A" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1B" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1B</xref>A and B and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). These variations are similar to those reported in other studies <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, although the reasons for the variations are not fully understood. The current analysis of five randomly selected participants confirms the large variations, even though the measurements were recorded under stable and similar conditions for all the participants. All the participants walked on a level floor and used the same type of shoe during the assessments. The variability observed in the present study may be related to the complicated, dynamic nature of walking and the physiologic factors associated with diabetes <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. The variations in the pressure values can be attributed to a combination of the participant's adjustment and co-ordination in order to maintain balance, some technical error, and a wrinkled sock or sensor. The sensors used at each time-point were not assigned to a specific individual, possibly adding to the within-subject variation. The sensor had the following technical properties: linearity, &#x02264;3%, according to the end-point linearity of the transducer; hysteresis, &#x0003c;4.5% of full-scale output; and repeatability, &#x02264;3.5%, giving reasonable accuracy. To achieve a high level of accuracy, equilibration is recommended before calibration is performed <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, at the time that this study started, this was not a recommended procedure, and walking calibration was used to ensure appropriate accuracy.</p><p>In the sub-analysis of the six participants, who had PP values &#x0003e;500&#x000a0;kPa, some explanations for the large variation were found. During analysis of the photographs of the plantar surfaces of the feet of these participants, we noted the presence of atrophied fat pads, foot deformities, and calluses. Correlations between foot deformities, a thin fat pad, and gait deviation have previously been detected, although this remains a topic for further investigation <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. Only one of the five walking trials performed at each follow-up was analyzed due to the time-consuming manual procedure required to translate the data into numerical form. The availability of appropriate software, including the possibility to run the analysis automatically, would allow processing of all the data on plantar pressures and would decrease the variation. This would facilitate the detection of differences in the pressure redistribution properties in regions other than the heel. A limitation of the present study is that in-shoe pressure measurements were not performed when the patients walked with their assigned shoes without any insoles. Finally, barefoot measurements were not included in the present study. This was because the participants were recommended not to walk barefoot, as this might entail a risk for trauma. Nevertheless, it is true that barefoot measurements are essential for evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec7.2"><title>Measurement errors</title><p>Attempts to capture dynamic walking and the properties of three-dimensional insoles in a longitudinal study have inherent limitations, which might lead to measurement errors. First, the in-shoe pressure measurement only registers two-dimensional forces between the foot sole and the shaped insoles; shear forces are not recorded <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Second, equilibration and calibration procedures might affect the accuracy of subsequent measurements and is a topic for further investigation. The intra- or inter-subject variations in gait velocity, as well as the types of hosiery used were not strictly controlled during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that for patients with diabetes who are at risk for foot ulcers, custom-made insoles used in combination with stable walking shoes result in lower pressure levels at the heel region (one of the seven regions of interest investigated), as compared with walking shoes with the type of prefabricated insoles that were tested in the present study. The observed variability of the measurements makes it difficult to define systematic differences in plantar pressure for the other six regions of interest of the foot. The levels of self-reported satisfaction and usage of the insoles were high, and the insoles retained their pressure redistribution properties over a long time, so few adjustments were needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Danaei</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>G.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>M.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>L.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>C.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>National, regional, and global trends in fasting plasma glucose and diabetes prevalence since 1980: systematic analysis of health examination surveys and epidemiological studies with 370 country-years and 2&#x000b7;7 million participants</article-title><source>The Lancet</source><volume>378</volume><issue>9785</issue><year>2011</year><fpage>31</fpage><lpage>40</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adler</surname><given-names>A.I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Boyko</surname><given-names>E.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahroni</surname><given-names>J.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>D.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lower-extremity amputation in diabetes.
