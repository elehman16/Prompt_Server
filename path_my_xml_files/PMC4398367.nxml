According to the UNAIDS report for the year 2014 there were a total of 35.3 million people living with HIV, 2.1 million new infections, with 69% of all people living with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa and 1.5 million deaths attributed to HIV [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The currently available HIV preventive and control interventions require strict adherence to be effective [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] with a threat of recidivism [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore there is still a need to prevent and control the large number of new infections by complementing on-going interventions such as early detection, education on behavioral change and biomedical strategies with a safe, affordable and effective preventative HIV vaccine.</p><p>The search for an HIV vaccine during the past 25 years has been a challenge due to viral diversity and the ability of the persistently virus&#x02014;infected cells to evade the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However pre-clinical studies have identified immune and genetic biomarkers associated with protection against challenge that provide further insights for an HIV preventive vaccine for humans [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>So far there have been more than 180 clinical HIV-1 vaccine trials conducted in humans ranging from phase I to phase III [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], including the recently concluded RV 144 phase III trial in Thailand that showed a modest efficacy of 31% [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Post-hoc analysis of the RV144 trial evaluating associations between immune responses to vaccine and protection suggests that binding IgG antibodies specific to the variable regions 1 and 2 of the HIV-1 envelope protein are important [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An effective vaccine would be one that is capable of eliciting both antibodies and T cells that have antiviral capabilities [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Tanzania is one of the sub-Saharan countries that has been highly affected by HIV, and has participated in early phase I/II HIV vaccine trials [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Earlier studies evaluated different routes for HIV-DNA vaccine administration comparing intradermal to intramuscular routes of HIV-DNA delivery [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We have shown that intradermal priming thrice with 1000 &#x003bc;g of an HIV-DNA vaccine per immunization given as 5 injections of 0.1 ml and separating Env and Gag plasmid pools prior to boosting twice with an HIV-MVA vaccinia vector vaccine was safe and resulted in strong and broad antigen-specific cellular immune responses to HIV Gag and Env [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Importantly this study also showed that all vaccinees developed binding anti-HIV antibodies, and a high proportion had antibodies reactive in a peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) neutralization assay after the second HIV-MVA boost[<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>With overall feasibility in mind, it would be ideal to reduce the number of injections and combine the plasmid pools into a single injection. We therefore set out to address two questions. Firstly, could the number of injections be reduced to 2 per immunization, and secondly could the regimen be further simplified by combining the plasmid pools. Due to constraints in the volume that could be delivered intradermally and the highest available DNA concentration we compared the safety and immunogenicity of administering five injections of HIV-DNA at a total dose of 1000 &#x003bc;g (5x0.1mL of 2mg/mL) of separated plasmids (&#x0201c;standard regimen&#x0201d;), with a &#x0201c;simplified regimen&#x0201d; comprising 2 injections of a lower overall dose of 600 &#x003bc;g (2x0.1mL of 3mg/mL). We also compared the effect of combining versus separating the plasmid pools for the overall safety and immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards of the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, and the Mbeya Medical Research Ethics Committee.

Within each main group participants were block randomized to vaccine or placebo in a ratio of 9:1. Blocks of 10 individuals consisting of 3 in group I, 3 in group II, 3 in group III vaccine and one placebo allocation were randomized by the sponsor using random numbers generated from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org/list/">http://www.random.org/list/</ext-link>. Six blocks were assigned to each site in the form of a list maintained by the study pharmacist at each site. On the request of the clinic the pharmacist allocated the enrolled volunteer to a consecutive slot on the list. The clinic was not informed of vaccine/placebo allocation. Saline was used as a placebo to minimize the risk that participants would mistakenly believe themselves to be protected against HIV.

These were local (pain, redness, swelling and induration) and general (fever, headache, malaise, chills, nausea, vomiting, myalgia and arthralgia). Participants were also asked to make a daily record of these events in a diary card for seven days after each immunization. The diary card was reviewed by the study team and transcribed into the case report form. The study team monitored vital signs before and immediately after each immunization. Routine laboratory parameters (complete blood count, ALT, direct and indirect bilirubin, random blood glucose and creatinine) were collected at 2 weeks after each immunization.</p><p>Participants were given instructions on how to fill in the diary card and how to measure temperature, local swelling and grading of the symptoms based on predefined criteria. The study participants were also required to record or report on any medications used during the entire study duration. The clinical and laboratory events were graded for severity as either mild, moderate, severe based on the DAIDS toxicity scale (Division of AIDS, Natl. Institutes of Health) [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] except for neutropenia that was considered as mild with levels of 1100 cells/&#x003bc;l that is lower than the DAIDS scale and was based on the local reference ranges. HIV infection was regarded as a grade 4 event according to the study protocol. The clinical events were defined as solicited or non-solicited events. Each of the clinical events that occurred was evaluated for a relationship to vaccination and was classified as not related, probably not related, possibly related, probably related and definitely related to the study products.</p><p>Urinalysis, pregnancy and HIV tests were performed at screening, on the day of each vaccination and during the final visit. All women were required to have a negative pregnancy test at screening and prior to each vaccination.</p><p>Participants who were HIV infected or pregnant were stopped from further vaccination but were followed up until the end of the trial or post-delivery for pregnant women. Monitoring for HIV-1 infection was performed using a sequential algorithm of Murex HIV antigen/antibody combination (Diasorin S.p.A, Dartford, UK) and Enzygnost<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HIV Integral II (Siemens Health Care, Marburg, Germany) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays followed by INNO-LIA<sup>&#x02122;</sup> HIV I/II immunoblot (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) line immunoassay and Amplicor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HIV-1 DNA test version 1.5 (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ, USA) in case of reactive ELISA results for MUHAS center. For NIMR-MMRC center, HIV testing was performed using Biorad GS HIV-1/HIV-2 PLUS O EIA. If the EIA indicated HIV infection twice, Biorad GS HIV-1 Western Blot, Biorad laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany was performed, followed by COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 test, v.2.0 Roche. Only cases with detectable HIV-RNA were considered HIV infected, reports to the study clinics were termed HIV infected or not infected to maintain blinding.</p><p>A twelve lead electrocardiography (ECG) and troponin tests were performed at screening and 2 weeks after each HIV-MVA vaccination to monitor for possible peri/myocarditis according to US FDA requirements.

Freshly prepared purified PBMCs were used in the assay. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, positive control), a peptide pool (CEF) composed of a panel of 23 peptides from cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus and influenza virus [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a peptide pool of 138 peptides (15 mers with an overlap of 11 amino acids) spanning the pp65 protein of human CMV (PepMix, JPT, Berlin, Germany) and HIV-1 specific peptide pools representing MVA-CMDR subtype A Gag and subtype E envelope (Env) were used for stimulation (purity &#x0003e;80%, JPT, Berlin, Germany). A final concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g/ml was used for PHA and CEF. The pp65 CMV peptide pool and the two MVA-CMDR-specific peptide pools were used at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml. RPMI medium without stimuli was used as negative control (background). Fifty microliters cell suspension of PBMC was added to each well giving 2x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well. The plates were incubated for 20 hours at 37&#x000b0;C, with 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Frequencies of antigen-specific spot-forming cells (SFC) were measured using an automated Immunospot analyzer (CTL-Europe, Bonn, Germany). Results were expressed as SFC per million PBMCs and were calculated for each pool of peptides as follows: 5 x the mean SFC from three stimulated wells, without subtracting background. ELISpot responses were considered positive if the number of SFC was &#x0003e;55 spots/10<sup>6</sup> PBMC and at least 4 times the background value. Data where background responses in three medium wells exceeded a median of 60 per million PBMCs were excluded from analyses.</p><p>For the determination of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, a 4-colour ICS assay was performed on fresh PBMC which had been rested overnight following the purification procedure as detailed previously [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. 4-color ICS testing was performed on samples from only one center (MUHAS).

Staphylococcal enterotoxin A and B (SEAB, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml) (positive control) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), a CEF peptide pool (1&#x003bc;g/ml), a CMV peptide pool (PepMix, 0.5&#x003bc;g/mL), two HIV-1 Gag-specific peptide pools representing the HIV-DNA vaccine or MVA-CMDR vaccine and a HIV-1 Env-specific peptide pool representing MVA-CMDR were used for stimulation. The cells were incubated for 6 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in a 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and the stimulated cells were stored at 4&#x000b0;C overnight prior to staining with an antibody cocktail containing anti-CD3&#x02013;APC, anti-CD4&#x02013;FITC, anti-CD8&#x02013;PerCpCy5.5, anti-IFN-&#x003b3;-PE and anti-IL-2-PE (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Acquisition of samples was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and samples were analyzed using FlowJo software, version 8.7.1 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). A minimum of 50,000 CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes per well was required for a sample to be included in the analysis. Background reactivity to Gag and Env peptide pool stimulation was defined using pre-immunization samples collected from the vaccinees. ICS responses were considered positive if they were at least 2.5-fold higher than the mean of background (medium samples) and above 0.05% for CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and above 0.1% for CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes.</p><p>Binding antibodies to native gp160 (IIIB, Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.) were tested using a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Of note, ECG abnormalities in otherwise healthy volunteers contributed to the screen out in 32 participants (8%).

Of these, 15 participants did not complete the vaccination schedule. As a result nine participants were replaced in the randomization scheme during recruitment. The reasons for early vaccination terminations included: not meeting the eligibility criteria due to an abnormal ECG (1), pregnancy (3), lost to follow up (5), consent withdrawn (2), HIV infection (2). Vaccinations were discontinued in (2) participants following adverse events. One had moderate itching and excoriation at the injection site that occurred after the 2<sup>nd</sup> HIV-DNA vaccination and the other had non-specific ST changes on ECG after the 1<sup>st</sup> HIV-MVA vaccination. He had no clinical symptoms, the troponin test was negative and echocardiography did not suggest peri/myocarditis. Four other participants relocated and could not continue visits after completing the vaccination schedule.

The 1000 &#x003bc;g of HIV-DNA was administered in five different injections due to the limited volume that could be administered intradermally using the Bioject needle-free device.</p><p>In the current trial we have shown that the regimen can be simplified by reducing the number of injections and by combining the HIV-DNA plasmids before boosting with the vaccinia-based immunogen, HIV-MVA. We considered the five intradermal HIV-DNA injections with a total of 1000 &#x003bc;g DNA to be the &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; regimen, and compared this to two intradermal HIV-DNA injections using a higher HIV-DNA concentration of 3mg/ml, leading to 600 &#x003bc;g in total, termed the &#x0201c;simplified&#x0201d; regimen.</p><p>We also assessed the effect on the immune response of combining the HIV-DNA plasmids into a single injection compared to separating the Gag and Env plasmid pools in two different injections, since immunocompetition between Gag and Env antigens has been previously observed in mouse experiments [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In accordance with what has been reported previously, there were no major safety concerns with the use of HIV-DNA and recombinant HIV-MVA candidate vaccines and the events that occurred were mild and tolerable, irrespective of the number of injections [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Two participants were discontinued from further immunizations due to adverse events. One of them had ECG changes following the first HIV-MVA, but these were shown to be of no clinical significance following further investigations. The other had moderate itching following the first and second HIV-DNA vaccinations. However these events were not considered sufficiently severe to interrupt a licensed vaccine regimen. In one participant an elevated ALT was noted one month after the second HIV-MVA that was attributed to acute alcohol induced hepatitis.</p><p>We observed a number of male study participants with transiently low neutrophil counts, which commonly occurred 12&#x02013;24 weeks from the last immunization. These participants had significantly low neutrophil counts without clinical signs of infection or an increased susceptibility to infection. This perhaps is an indication of low transient neutrophil count which could be a normal variation in an African population, as has been described previously and regarded as benign ethnic neutropenia [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The simplified regimen with 2 intradermal injections of a total of 600 &#x003bc;g of HIV-DNA by Bioject had a similar priming effect as the standard regimen of 5 intradermal injections of a total of 1000 &#x003bc;g HIV-DNA, also given by the Bioject device. Further combining the plasmids into one injection had a similar effect on the frequency of immune responses when compared to separating the plasmids in two injections. With these findings the rather cumbersome regimen of 5 intradermal HIV-DNA injections at a somewhat higher dose of 1000 &#x003bc;g of HIV-DNA given as separated plasmids could be simplified to a regimen of intradermal HIV-DNA priming injections at two sites with combined or separated plasmids. Administration of fewer injections has clinical and public health relevance since the acceptability of a lower total DNA dose will reduce the cost of vaccine production. Presently these considerations are of importance especially when planning for larger future phase IIB or III clinical trials.</p><p>This study confirms the high response rates we observed in a previous study with this heterologous regimen [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This could possibly be explained by the recent finding of potentiation of immune responses by a boost with a heterologous vector and heterologous HIV-genes [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>There is paucity of data in the literature on the effect of combining compared to separating HIV-DNA antigens in humans. Studies in mice have indicated that separating the Gag from Env plasmids resulted in an increased immune response to Env, while combining the peptides made no difference in responses towards Gag [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We did not observe such effects in our human study.</p><p>We observed that the HIV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response rates measured by ICS were comparable after the first and second HIV-MVA vaccinations. In contrast the HIV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response rates were significantly higher after the second HIV-MVA compared to the response rates after the first HIV-MVA. Similarly, in a trial where GeoVax pGA2/JS7 HIV-DNA was given as a prime and MVA/HIV62 as a boost, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells response rates increased after the second dose of HIV-MVA in vaccinees who had received one or two HIV-DNA vaccinations followed by the two HIV-MVA doses [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>This study has some limitations. The highest concentration of HIV-DNA available was 3 mg/ml, thus a strict comparison of 2 and 5 injections could not be made since only 0.1 mL could be delivered intradermally with the Biojector. However, this difference in total dose, 600 &#x003bc;g vs 1000 &#x003bc;g, did not significantly affect the simpler regimen. A new study is underway to explore the effect of delivering 0.2mL intradermally with the Zetajet to address this problem. The comparison of the HIV-specific ICS responses in the three study groups included a smaller number of vaccinees than the corresponding comparison of IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot and antibody responses since 4-colour ICS was only performed at one of the two study sites. The choice of the primary endpoint as IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses after the second HIV-MVA was not optimal since we observed that the magnitude of ELISpot responses to Gag was higher after the first HIV-MVA vaccination compared to the responses after the second HIV-MVA boost similar to what was observed in our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similar findings have also been reported in a phase I trial that included priming with two doses of HIV-DNA subtype C and boosting with two doses of recombinant HIV-MVA vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present trial, we employed a short 4 month interval between the two HIV-MVA vaccinations. A lack of enhanced ELISpot responses to Gag peptides was also observed in our previous study when a 12 month interval was used between the two HIV-MVA vaccinations [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Our three immunization schedules also induced similar antibody titers to HIV Env. As was observed in the HIVIS03 study [<xref rid="pone.0119629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a majority of the vaccinees had binding antibodies to gp160 following the second HIV-MVA boost. A study of antibody responses in a subset of the vaccinees who received recombinant gp140 in GLA adjuvant after the second HIV-MVA boost, will be presented in a separate paper</p><p>In conclusion, intradermal HIV-DNA priming with a simplified regimen of 2 injections of 600 &#x003bc;g HIV-DNA, with combined plasmid pools followed by boosting with HIV-MVA is safe, and elicits cellular and antibody immune responses that are similar to the standard regimen of 5 injections of 1000 &#x003bc;g HIV-DNA, with separated plasmid pools. It is thus possible to explore if the immune response to HIV-DNA can be further enhanced with intradermal electroporation of HIV-DNA given in 2 injections of combined plasmid pools at a total dose of 600 &#x003bc;g in the ongoing phase II, TaMoVac-II study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119629.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol A; CONSORT Checklist A; Ethical Approval Request A; Ethical Approval A; Ethical Approval B; Ethical Approval C; Ethical Approval D; Regulatory Approval; Trial Registration A.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119629.s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We extend special thanks to the study volunteers.
