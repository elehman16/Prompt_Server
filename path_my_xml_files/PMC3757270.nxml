Based on published randomized controlled trial evidence, it was assumed that all four treatment regimens had a comparable effect on serum ferritin concentration (SFC) and liver iron concentration (LIC), and that DFP was more effective for reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality. Published utility scores for route of administration were used, with subcutaneously administered DFO assumed to incur a greater quality of life (QoL) burden than the oral chelators DFP and DFX. Healthcare resource use, drug costs (2010/2011 costs), and utilities associated with adverse events were also considered, with the effect of varying all parameters assessed in sensitivity analysis. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated for each treatment, with cost effectiveness expressed as incremental cost per QALY.

Children born with the &#x003b2;-thalassaemia major form of the disease suffer chronic severe anaemia and require blood transfusions every 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks to sustain life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been estimated that this form of the disease affects 1 in 100,000 of the UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and that approximately 700 patients with &#x003b2;-thalassaemia major were alive in the UK in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As a result of repeated transfusions, these patients accumulate iron at a rate of 0.3&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg per day. This results in a 60&#x000a0;kg person adding 6.6&#x02013;11.0&#x000a0;g of extra iron per year every year for the rest of their life. In contrast, healthy adults have stable iron stores of around 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Beta-thalassaemia major patients receiving regular transfusions are consequently at risk of iron overload, which can cause hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction and heart dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. If left untreated, patients are at risk of premature death in adolescence or young adulthood, mainly due to iron-induced cardiac disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The standard treatment for transfusional iron overload is chelation therapy, which has significantly reduced mortality since the introduction of desferrioxamine (DFO) in the 1960s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, DFO is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) infusion over 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;hours, 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This can have a significant impact on patients&#x02019; quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and sets younger patients apart from their peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; adherence to the DFO infusion schedule is therefore often resisted, significantly increasing patients&#x02019; risk of cardiac disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Oral chelation therapy has subsequently been developed in order to ease the treatment burden associated with iron chelation, and therefore increase patient compliance. The introduction of the first oral chelator, deferiprone (DFP), in 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] resulted in improved patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], while deferasirox (DFX) was licensed in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>When used as monotherapy, each of DFO, DFP and DFX have been shown to produce reductions in serum ferritin concentration (SFC) and liver iron concentration (LIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; however, these measures of total body iron are not effective in predicting heart failure, the most serious consequence of iron toxicity. For this outcome, it has been found that cardiac iron levels, as measured by cardiac MRI T2*, have the greatest predictive value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. DFP has been demonstrated to be superior to DFO in reducing cardiac iron levels, and in improving cardiac function as assessed by left and right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This is an important finding, as improvements in LVEF have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of future heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. DFP may also be used as a combination therapy with DFO, which has been shown to significantly improve SFC, LIC, cardiac MRI T2* and cardiac function, compared with DFO alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. DFX is contraindicated for use in combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The licensed indication for DFP in Europe is for patients in whom DFO therapy is contraindicated or inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, use of DFP in monotherapy or in combination with DFO is widespread. This is likely due to several factors, including the inadequacy of DFO in controlling body iron load in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; the significant QoL burden associated with its daily administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; and the superiority of DFP to DFO in reducing heart disease and/or increasing survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The combination of DFO and DFP has the added advantage of a more pronounced reduction of serum ferritin and liver iron concentrations than DFO monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>With four treatment regimens available with differing abilities to remove excess iron, different prices, and different treatment burdens, the relative cost effectiveness of these treatments is highly relevant when considering which treatment to prescribe. Previous economic evaluations have focused on DFO and DFX, and have reported that DFX is cost effective compared with DFO, although none have used published adverse event (AE) rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, DFP has been included in cost-effectiveness analysis in only one study, from a Thai perspective, which did not consider combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While this study found that DFP was cost effective compared with DFX and DFO, the lack of a full economic evaluation of all available treatment regimens from an EU member state with significant use of the relevant chelators (for example, the UK) to guide a European perspective may hinder decision makers.</p><p>This study consequently considers the cost effectiveness of DFO, DFP and DFX monotherapy, and combination therapy, from a UK perspective, using a full economic model which incorporates published treatment-related AE rates. The effect of varying all parameters used within the model was evaluated in sensitivity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods: Systematic Review</title><p>Systematic reviews were conducted to identify randomized controlled trial (RCT) and non-RCT characteristics of iron chelation with each treatment, and quality of life in patients receiving chelation therapy. Searches were conducted in The Cochrane Library, OVID MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-process) and OVID Embase on 9 February 2011, with no restrictions on date. Using Boolean operators, the searches combined terms (including MeSH headings as appropriate) for the condition, the treatments and the outcomes of interest. This was supplemented by hand searching of the following conference proceedings from the years 2008 to 2010: American Society for Hematology; European Haematology Association Congress; UK Thalassaemia Society; Thalassaemia International Conference; British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting; Caribbean Health Research Council Meetings; and the National Sickle Cell Disease Program Annual Meeting. Identified studies were independently assessed by two reviewers in order to confirm that they met the pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and any discrepancies were resolved by a third party (see Acknowledgments). Each reviewer&#x02019;s documents were checked by the second reviewer to ensure quality and any inconsistencies were resolved through discussion. The inclusion criteria for the systematic review were: <italic>population</italic>&#x02014;thalassaemia patients with chronic iron overload requiring blood transfusions; <italic>intervention</italic>&#x02014;DFP, DFO, DFX or combination therapy; <italic>study design</italic>&#x02014;RCT, prospective, or observational studies; <italic>outcomes</italic>&#x02014;SFC, LIC, cardiac MRI T2*, total iron excretion, mortality or AEs.

The model used a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective (including personal and social services), in line with UK health technology appraisal (HTA) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A societal perspective was not used due to a lack of data on productivity gains/losses or absenteeism with the available treatment regimens. The comparators considered were DFO, DFX and DFP monotherapy, and combination therapy with DFO&#x02013;DFP, with discounting at 3.5&#x000a0;% in line with guidance from the UK Treasury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Base Case</title><p>The base case for the model was a 5-year Markov-type model using an annual cycle where it was assumed that DFP-containing regimens confer an incremental benefit to patients in terms of cardiac morbidity and mortality over DFO or DFX monotherapy. A Markov structure was used based on the relevant clinical data (cardiac mortality and morbidity); this structure has been used in previous economic evaluations of iron chelation regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. An annual cycle was chosen given the availability of annual mortality data; such a cycle has also previously been used in economic evaluations of iron chelation regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Five years was chosen as the time horizon as this reflects the duration of the clinical trials from which the data on morbidity and mortality were derived. Model calculations were verified by a local health economist and model assumptions by two consultant haematologists and one consultant nephrologist.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Scenarios Considered</title><p>The cardiac benefit in morbidity and mortality of DFP over DFX is an assumption based on the available evidence (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">4.2.1</xref>); three alternative efficacy-based scenarios were therefore also considered using Markov-type models: the base case excluding a cardiac morbidity benefit but maintaining the mortality benefit over 5&#x000a0;years (Scenario 1) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); the base case excluding a cardiac mortality benefit but maintaining the cardiac morbidity benefit over 5&#x000a0;years (Scenario 2); and a 1-year Markov-type model where all treatments are assumed to have an equal effect on cardiac morbidity and mortality (Scenario 3). The 1-year approach is used in Scenario 3 as this is consistent with other economic evaluations which have assumed equal efficacy for all treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As DFO patients may receive treatment via a battery-operated pump instead of a balloon infuser, a scenario was also considered where all DFO and combination therapy patients received treatment via a pump (Scenario 4).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematics of the Markov model used for each scenario.

While DFX has been cited as a factor in a number of treatment-related deaths across several disease areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], no quantitative data were published on thalassaemia patients with transfusional iron overload, and so it was conservatively assumed that DFX was not associated with excess mortality.</p><p>DFP is associated with agranulocytosis and neutropenia events, with the SPC quoting rates of 0.6 and 2.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively. These were converted into annual rates of 0.6 and 2.5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], respectively, with an assumed agranulocytosis mortality rate of 13.83&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The mortality rate for agranulocytosis is based on post-marketing reporting of 13 deaths from 94 cases. However, 11 of these deaths (from 45 cases) occurred prior to the implementation of a physician and patient education programme in 2007. Fewer deaths have occurred since this time (2 deaths from 49 cases), and the true mortality rate is likely to be less than that used in the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>DFX is associated with hepatitis and Fanconi syndrome, with a hepatitis rate of 0.7&#x000a0;% assumed based on the DFX prescribing information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A specific rate for Fanconi syndrome is not reported in the DFX prescribing information; data from Yacobovich et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] were therefore used. It was conservatively assumed that the four cases reported represented a minimum estimate of the rate for the entire transfusion-dependent thalassaemia population requiring iron chelation for that country (estimated at 500) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This is consistent with the prescribing information for DFX, which lists Fanconi syndrome as an uncommon AE (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>While DFO is associated with neutropenia, in the absence of published rates it was conservatively assumed that DFO was not associated with any AEs. Due to the lack of appropriate data on AEs with combination therapy, it was assumed that the rate of AEs was equivalent to DFP monotherapy.

As the baseline utility for NYHA I is above the baseline values for chelation therapies, a proportional decrement was calculated and applied to the utility value for chelation (7.9&#x000a0;% decrement from perfect health).

When used in combination therapy, DFO was assumed to be administered four times weekly; the utility for combination therapy was therefore the utility for DFX minus 80&#x000a0;% of the difference between DFX and combination therapy (0.84&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;((0.84&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.66)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.8)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.696).

Published RCT evidence suggests that all chelators have a similar, or minimally different, effect on LIC and SFC levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. DFP has been shown to be more effective for reduction of excess cardiac iron and in reducing cardiac mortality and morbidity compared with DFO monotherapy, as reported in the SPC for DFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Combination therapy has also been shown to be more effective than DFO monotherapy in reducing SFC, LIC and cardiac iron levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the correlation between a reduction in SFC or LIC and cardiac morbidity and/or mortality is weak, with only cardiac iron levels shown to have a high predictive value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, only reductions in cardiac iron levels were considered to have an impact on cardiac mortality and morbidity; reductions in SFC and LIC were assumed to have no effect on these outcomes.</p><p>The magnitude of cardiac iron reduction was comparable in separate RCTs by the same lead investigator for DFP versus DFO and combination therapy versus DFO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Equivalent efficacy regarding LIC and SFC was therefore assumed in the model for DFO, DFX, DFP and combination therapy, with a cardiac benefit assumed for DFP-containing regimens over DFO and DFX. Dosing assumptions were daily administration for DFP and DFX, while DFO was administered five times weekly, or four times weekly when given in combination with daily DFP.</p><p>In order to obtain a realistic view of the cost effectiveness of the agents of interest, the model also included AEs. Common AEs indicated in product SPCs which were likely to have an impact on patient quality of life and/or cost implications were included. The AE assessment was limited by the availability and quality of reporting of AEs within the clinical studies, which were varied in sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of uncertainty.</p><p>The model base-case results suggest that DFP monotherapy is the dominant strategy (more effective and less costly), compared with DFX and DFO monotherapy or combination therapy. DFP is associated with 5-year cost savings of &#x000a3;80,172 per patient relative to DFX, &#x000a3;45,251 per patient relative to DFO and &#x000a3;59,456 per patient relative to combination therapy. DFX was not cost effective relative to DFO combination therapy or monotherapy (&#x000a3;36,141/QALY and &#x000a3;59,093/QALY, respectively). Although combination therapy was less costly than DFX, it had a lower QALY gain due to the lower utility score associated with SC administration of DFO, placing combination therapy in the south-west quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane. However, it should be considered that oral DFX has no proven cardiac morbidity or survival benefit over other treatment regimens, while combination therapy has been demonstrated to have benefits in terms of both cardiac morbidity and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. DFP monotherapy remained dominant in all scenarios, including a scenario where the cardiac benefits of the drug were excluded and all iron chelators were assumed to have the same efficacy. In this case, the time horizon was assumed to be 1 year, with DFP treatment resulting in a cost saving of &#x000a3;17,607 per patient relative to DFX.</p><p>The model used in this analysis is conservative in many of its assumptions, including AE rates for comparators, costs of AE rates, grade of cardiac disease applied to patients developing cardiac disease, and the compliance rate (which was assumed to be equal across all therapies). The majority of these assumptions bias the results against DFP. For example, we have conservatively assumed that DFX-induced Fanconi syndrome is not associated with a decrement in quality of life, and that only one outpatient nephrology appointment would be associated with its management. Furthermore, we have not considered the possibility that patients treated with DFX would develop either acute or chronic renal failure. However, the DFX SPC states that some patients within post-marketing studies developed renal failure requiring temporary or permanent renal dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given that renal failure has a significant impact on patient quality of life, and that the annual cost of renal dialysis is likely to exceed &#x000a3;8,000 (based on the average cost of haemodialysis from NHS reference costs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], our model likely underestimates the true costs associated with DFX therapy.</p><p>As with any economic evaluation, the current model has limitations. It was necessary to make assumptions around efficacy based on a systematic review of the literature; such a review can only include data up to a specified time (in this case, 9 February 2011). It will therefore be necessary to re-evaluate the findings from this study as the evidence evolves. No full published studies reporting the long-term cardiac effects of DFX were identified by the systematic review; it was therefore necessary to use proxy data in order to develop assumptions surrounding this outcome. Equivalence was assumed for DFX and DFO regarding long-term cardiac effects based on RCT data which indicate that DFX is non-inferior to DFO in reducing cardiac iron, as measured by T2*, with neither agent able to improve cardiac function as assessed by LVEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. This assumption is further supported via non-RCT studies by Pepe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Berdoukas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that demonstrate equivalent cardiac MRI T2* values between DFX and DFO. Another possible limitation is the assumption of equivalent efficacy regarding SFC and LIC for the three iron chelators. No RCT studies exist which directly compare DFP and DFX; it was therefore necessary to infer similar efficacy via comparison with DFO, which was found to have a similar effect on SFC and LIC when compared with DFP or DFX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It should be noted that, while both studies comparing DFP and DFO found no significant difference in SFC or LIC between the treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Pennell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] observed a non-significant trend towards greater reduction of these assessments with DFO. However, these potential differences in effect on SFC and LIC between treatment regimens, even if they had been statistically significant, were small and are unlikely to lead to an increase in complications in clinical practice. The leading cause of death in thalassaemia patients is cardiac-related complications, and small differences in SFC and LIC are not predictors of such events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In contrast, cardiac MRI T2* has been shown to have a high predictive value for heart failure and a strong correlation with iron-induced heart disease in studies by Kirk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Carpenter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The limitations around efficacy assumptions could be resolved by performing an indirect comparison using the available trial data. Such an evaluation was outside the scope of the current analysis, but would be desirable for any future studies.</p><p>Other limitations include the use of cost per mg for each regimen and the lack of national set NHS prices for laboratory tests. Using cost per mg may be a limitation as this assumes that tablets or vials may be halved or shared. While this may not be the case in clinical practice, this is a limitation inherent to the majority of economic models using an average dose per patient. This is therefore unlikely to have a significant impact upon the validity of the results. Due to the lack of a national set NHS price list for laboratory tests, it was necessary to use costs obtained through internal costing exercises provided by the Quality Manager at the Department of Laboratory Haematology at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford (personal communication). These internal exercises are designed to provide the hospital with a best estimate of the cost of laboratory tests, based on variables including consumable use and personnel costs. The John Radcliffe Hospital is a large UK institution; as its estimated costs are likely to be comparable to those in other similarly sized NHS trusts, it represents an appropriate source of information in the absence of set NHS prices. While there is no guarantee that these costs are generalizable, there is no evidence that they are not. These costs also comprise only a small proportion of total costs and therefore have a minimal effect on the model results.</p><p>The other main limitation of the model is the use of all treatment regimens in the same population. All three iron chelators have different indications in their SPCs; DFO is indicated for all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], DFX is indicated for all patients &#x02265;6&#x000a0;years old, or patients aged 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years in whom DFO is contraindicated or inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], while DFP is indicated for all patients in whom DFO is contraindicated or inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While these represent different populations, guidelines on the treatment of &#x003b2;-thalassaemia indicate that regimens should be tailored to the needs of the patient, rather than limiting their use to specific populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For example, DFP and DFX monotherapy are both recommended when adherence to DFO therapy is a concern, with DFP specifically recommended in patients with potentially dangerous cardiac iron levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Combination therapy may be recommended in patients with high SFC and LIC levels and &#x02018;normal&#x02019; cardiac iron levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Treatment choices are therefore dependent on the likelihood of compliance and the combination of SFC, LIC and cardiac MRI T2*. Given the complexity of modelling these different situations, and the absence of data to inform such a model, it was consequently decided to use the overall patient population.</p><p>The perspective used in the model was that of the UK NHS, including personal and social services. The societal perspective was not used due to a lack of data on productivity gains/losses or absenteeism with the various treatment regimens, and the consequent difficulty in quantifying their effect on these outcomes. However, it is highly likely that cardiac morbidity and mortality would be the main factors influencing productivity in the &#x003b2;-thalassaemia population. As DFP has been shown to significantly improve cardiac morbidity and mortality compared with DFO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the exclusion of the societal perspective is likely to bias the analysis against DFP.</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with an economic model by Luangasanatip et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which evaluated the cost effectiveness of DFP, DFX and DFO from a Thai perspective. The analysis was performed using a Markov model, as in the current analysis, and the same values were used for the QoL decrement associated with DFO administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the Thai study it was assumed that DFP, DFX and DFO had equivalent efficacy for all outcomes; however, the results indicated that DFP still dominated DFX and DFO, as was found in our analysis.</p><p>Three other studies have examined the cost effectiveness of DFX relative to DFO, two of which excluded DFP monotherapy from the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Given that DFP is likely to be used in a similar population in clinical practice, the exclusion of DFP in these studies means that they do not represent the true cost effectiveness of the interventions considered. These studies assumed that DFX and DFO have equivalent efficacy, as in our analysis, but did not include published AE rates. Karnon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] found that DFX dominated DFO over a 1-year period in their base case (mean patient weight 42&#x000a0;kg), and resulted in an ICER of &#x000a3;7,775 when mean patient weight was assumed to be 62&#x000a0;kg. A later study by Karnon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] considered cost effectiveness over a lifetime, using the assumption that the increased compliance afforded by oral treatment would lead to a survival benefit. AEs were considered in the analysis by Karnon et al., although rates for these were not obtained from published literature, but were simulated based on expected compliance. The Karnon study found that DFX gave a cost saving of &#x000a3;72,089 over a patient lifetime compared with DFO; however, the use of modelled AE rates and an inferred survival benefit are not as robust as those used in the current analysis, where published evidence was used. Despite this, the sensitivity analyses performed in the Karnon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] study resulted in a maximum ICER of &#x000a3;12,166, indicating that DFX is still likely to be cost effective over a lifetime, compared with DFO. The current analysis found that DFP dominated both DFX and DFO over a 5-year period, and would therefore most likely result in cost savings against both DFX and DFO over a patient lifetime, although this was not modelled.</p><p>McLeod et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] evaluated DFX, DFO and DFP in a simple model as part of a UK HTA in all conditions requiring regular transfusions, using a 1-year time horizon. This group found that DFX was likely to be cost effective compared with DFO, with an ICER of &#x02264;&#x000a3;30,000 per QALY. DFP was not assumed to provide any additional health benefits; however, in the analysis where it was assumed that DFP and DFX had equivalent efficacy, it was found that DFX was not cost effective for any patient compared with DFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although this model considered all three iron chelators, it did not compare DFP with DFO, did not evaluate combination therapy, and used a much broader patient population than the current model. Despite this, the finding that DFP is cost effective compared with DFX is consistent with the conclusions from the current study.</p><p>The results of this analysis are specific to the UK NHS; however, they are likely to be applicable in most countries. It is highly unlikely that the efficacy of the available regimens, the utility associated with their administration, or the incidence of AEs would vary between countries. In contrast, the costs associated with each regimen (including drug costs, management of AEs, and monitoring) would be expected to vary. However, as DFP generated more QALYs than DFO, DFX or DFO&#x02013;DFP, it will always be the dominant strategy unless it is more expensive than the other treatment regimens. It is therefore likely that the results of the model would be relevant in any countries where DFP is less expensive than DFX (or priced similarly to DFO).</p><p>The results of this analysis indicate that, from a UK perspective, DFP monotherapy dominates DFX and DFO monotherapy and combination therapy over a 5-year time horizon. DFP is currently indicated for use in all patients when DFO is inadequate; however, the high QoL burden associated with DFO administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the consequent implications for compliance mean that DFO therapy may be inadequate for many patients. Adopting DFP in these patients has been shown to confer a cardiac benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and, as shown in the current analysis, it may also result in substantial cost savings compared with DFO and DFX.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>DFP appears to be the dominant treatment strategy from a UK NHS perspective for chronic iron overload in &#x003b2;-thalassaemia patients; at a willingness-to-pay threshold of &#x000a3;20,000 per QALY, there is a &#x0003e;99&#x000a0;% probability of DFP being cost effective in all scenarios explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec29"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40273_2013_76_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 168 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>The registration trial for DFX failed to meet the primary endpoint of maintenance or reduction of LIC; however, this was attributed to the fact that patients received proportionally lower doses of DFX relative to DFO.
