CFS is characterized by unexplained fatigue lasting more than 6 months. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has proven to be effective. However, CBT availability for adolescents with CFS is limited and requires special therapeutic skills not always readily available. An alternative to the face-to-face CBT is FITNET, a web-based therapeutic program designed specifically for adolescents diagnosed with CFS, and their parents. This new CBT approach appeals to the modern youth, who grow up with internet as their main source of information. A web-based program offers the opportunity to lower thresholds for the acceptance and realization of healthcare. This treatment can be activated at any chosen time. The communication between patient and therapist can elapse asynchronously. If effective, this web-based program would greatly increase the therapeutic accessibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized clinical trial is currently conducted. One-hundred-forty adolescents aged 12-18 years diagnosed with CFS will be recruited and randomized to one of two groups: FITNET or usual care. After 6 months, the usual care group will have access to the FITNET program. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post intervention, and at 6 months follow-up. Primary outcome measures are school presence, fatigue severity, and physical functioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The FITNET study is the first randomized clinical trial which evaluates the effect of web-based CBT versus usual care in adolescents with CFS. The intervention is based on a theoretical existing model of CBT for patients with CFS. The results of this study will provide information about the possibility and efficacy of web-based CBT for adolescents with CFS and will reveal predictors of efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN59878666">ISRCTN59878666</ext-link> and ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00893438">NCT00893438</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy or ME) is a disabling disorder, characterized by persistent or relapsing severe fatigue that is not the result of an organic disease or ongoing exertion and is not alleviated by rest. Symptoms last for at least 6 months and are accompanied by other symptoms like muscle pain and concentration problems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The cause of CFS is still unknown. CFS is explained in terms of a central neurobiological disturbance with triggering, sustaining and perpetuating factors both on a biological and psychosocial level[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cognitions concerning these sustaining and perpetuating factors are subject of the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) regimen for adolescents. CBT is the only evidence-based treatment with a recovery rate of 70% directly after treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. An uncontrolled study of the efficacy of family cognitive behaviour therapy for adolescents with CFS, revealed even better results with a recovery rate of 83%, with a maintained gain at 6 months follow-up[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the availability of this treatment in the Netherlands is limited and it requires special therapeutic skills that are not always readily available.</p><p>Furthermore, not all cases of CFS are adequately recognised, neither by the patient nor by their doctor. A large population study in the Netherlands revealed a prevalence rate of 16.4% of severe fatigue lasting more than one month in adolescent girls[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The proportion of undiagnosed cases of CFS among these girls is unclear. The lack of treatment possibilities within reach may enhance the reticence in diagnosing CFS.</p><p>Although untreated CFS in adolescents has a better prognosis than in adults, the risk of disruption of development and education asks for a prompt recognition of the syndrome and an effective treatment method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The longest follow-up study, covering a 13 year follow-up period, showed that the majority of adolescents have mild to moderate persisting symptoms with a considerable period of school absence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The lack of skilled cognitive behavioural therapists to treat adolescents with CFS made us decide to develop a web-based application combing CBT by a skilled therapist with a regular internet contact. In a recently published non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) by the Expert Centre for Chronic Fatigue (ECCF) in Nijmegen, a minimal intervention based on CBT for CFS, consisting of a self help booklet (workbook) supported by email contact with a cognitive behavioural therapist, appeared to be effective[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This Self Help Program resembles a web-based CBT in certain aspects, such as the absence of face-to-face contact between therapist and patient. However, in the minimal intervention study the contact between therapist and patient was minimal, whereas in the web-based CBT there will be frequent email contact between therapist and patient.</p><p>Web-based CBT for illnesses other than CFS has been found effective, but most research has been conducted with adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For adolescents, web-based CBT has been developed for disorders such as obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The efficacy of these web-based CBT programs in general is comparable with the face-to-face treatments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>FITNET (web-based treatment for Fatigue In Teenagers) is a Dutch web-based program developed in close collaboration between the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital (University Medical Centre Utrecht, UMCU) and the Expert Centre for Chronic Fatigue (Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, ECCF). FITNET is a highly structured program for adolescents with CFS and consists of two parts: a psycho-educational part for both adolescents and parents and a CBT part based on the protocol of the ECCF[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The efficacy of this protocol in a face-to-face setting for adolescents has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of FITNET for adolescents with CFS in the Netherlands. The second goal of this study is to explore predictors of outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A single-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 6 months follow-up will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of FITNET compared to usual care for adolescents with CFS. Efficacy of FITNET compared to usual care will be determined after 6 months, the maximum duration of the treatment. Patients assigned to FITNET have to agree to not have any further medical examinations or other treatments for fatigue whilst in therapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The adolescents who have been assigned to the usual care will get the opportunity to attend the program after these 6 months. The total follow-up time is 12 months after the start of the web-based program.

Once the diagnosis is established, study eligibility will be assessed by completing self-reported questionnaires on fatigue, physical complaints, physical functioning, depression and anxiety. Eligible patients will be asked to participate in this RCT.

The patients with a possible psychiatric comorbidity and their parents will be examined by an experienced child psychologist before randomisation. Patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis, as assessed by this psychologist, will be excluded from the trial.

The available usual care for adolescents with CFS in the Netherlands includes: individual/group based rehabilitation programs, psychological support including CBT face-to-face, graded exercise therapy by a physiotherapist, etc. All care received will be monitored during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Web-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (FITNET)</title><p>FITNET is a web-based cognitive-behavioural treatment accessible to patients and both parents, based on the existing face-to-face CBT protocol for adolescents developed by the ECCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Trained cognitive behavioural psychotherapists from the ECCF will support the patients by e-consults. There will be no face-to-face contact between the therapists and patients at all.</p><p>The web portal is designed by the UMCU in collaboration with the ECCF, and has been developed in cooperation with adolescents with CFS who critically appraised text, lay-out and structure. Two authors of children books (Mr. and Mrs. van Hagen) revised the textual content on readability for adolescents. All therapists receive a special half a day training in the application of written language for this target group.</p><p>The programme consists of a psycho-educational and a CBT section. The psycho-educational section will be readily available, after receiving log in codes. The CBT section consists of 21 interactive modules (<italic>see appendix 1</italic>), accessible upon activation by the therapist. The web-based therapy comprises about 20 internet-sessions over 6 months. Meanwhile, the parents will follow a parallel program. All users will have a unique username and password, ensuring private communication with the therapist. Both parents and adolescents will have a regular e-consult (email contact) with the therapist, wherein results so far are discussed and new assignments can be given. The therapist will reply on a fixed weekday. The patient will have the ability to send an emergency email, on which a prompt reply will be made. For emergency situations, telephone contact details are available for the patient.</p><p>The FITNET treatment programme is implemented in a portal with a lay-out especially designed for adolescents, combining different applications such as: e-consult, personal diaries, questionnaires, psycho-education, all treatment steps and the possibility to review previous communications and assignments. Patient data and emails will be encrypted and securely stored on the UMCU mainframes to guarantee privacy and confidentiality. The treatment protocol is described in more detail in the appendix.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Compliance and attrition</title><p>Therapy compliance will be assessed by recording the number of treatment-modules (CBT) that have been completed. When applicable, participants will be asked for their reasons for poor compliance. In the case of therapy drop-out, patients will be asked for the reason of non compliance and stimulated to continue participation in the assessments until the last follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcome measures and predictors of outcome are listed in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2"

The psychometric qualities are good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], (e) Self-efficacy (Self Efficacy Scale-28) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], (f) Perceptions of parental rearing behaviours (the adolescent version of the Egna Minnen Betr&#x000e4;ffende Uppfostran, EMBU-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Possible parental predictors of response to treatment are: (a) Parental fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength-20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], (b) Parental psychological distress measured by the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], (c) Parental focussing on bodily symptoms by the subscale private body consciousness of the Body Consciousness Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], (d) EMBU-P, the parental version of the Egna Minnen Betr&#x000e4;ffende Uppfostran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], (e) parental causal attributions to the origin of CFS (Causal Attribution List, CAL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the patients and parent(s) treated with FITNET (including the drop-outs) will be interviewed (responsive evaluation) about their experiences with the FITNET intervention. The interviews are semi-structured, with open questions guided by a topic list (10 point scale, questionnaire especially developed for this study). Different aspects of this web-based programme will be evaluated: text, lay-out, feedback by the therapist, scheduling of modules, technical experience, etc.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>The delivery of CBT to adolescents and adults is considered safe.</p><p>All adverse events reported spontaneously by the participants or observed by the therapists will be recorded. All adverse events will be followed until they have aborted, or until a stable situation has been reached.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>One-hundred-forty newly diagnosed CFS patients will be included in two years. The data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis. Prognostically important baseline characteristics will be tabulated by treatment modality in order to evaluate success of randomisation. The main efficacy analysis will pertain to the data obtained after a 6 months FITNET or usual care condition. Differences between treatment groups concerning the primary outcome measures will be expressed as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals or as central estimators and variance measures where appropriate. In case of baseline differences in prognosis between groups, treatment effects in primary outcome will additionally be adjusted for these differences using logistic regression for binary outcome data and linear regression for continuous outcome measures. At 12 months follow-up after randomization, a repeated measurement of the primary outcome measures will be undertaken as well as an evaluation of participants' experiences with the FITNET intervention. The latter measurements will have a descriptive nature.</p><p>Concerning the predictors of outcome, the study will be merely exploratory because statistical power is not calculated for subgroup analyses. To that end, linear regression analysis will be used with primary continuous outcome measures as dependent variables and interaction terms of putative response predictors and treatment modality as independent variables. Separate analyses will be run for predictors in adolescents and predictors in parents respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Power</title><p>We estimate that under care as usual the estimated average percentages of school absence, our primary endpoint, at the end of follow-up, will be 40%. Given the efficacy of face to face CBT in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] we consider a reduction of school absence of 15% in the e-intervention group to be realistic and highly relevant. In order to statistically detect such a reduction, given a 2 sided-alpha of 0.05 and with 90% power, we will need to allocate 60 patients to each group. In order to accommodate a small anticipated percentage of non-participation we will include 140 diagnosed patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, the FITNET study will be the first randomized clinical trial which evaluates the effect of web-based treatment versus usual care in adolescents with CFS.</p><p>This study has several strengths. Firstly, the FITNET treatment is based on a theoretical model of a proven effective face-to-face CBT for adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and will be compared with usual care in a randomized design. This will enable to determine the additional value of FITNET in the current therapeutical spectrum. Secondly, FITNET involves parents in the treatment of adolescent CFS. Earlier studies from Chalder et al showed the importance of family-focused CBT to achieve treatment success in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, the advantage of making treatment available at any time by internet is considerable. Online treatment can reduce face-to-face treatment barriers (i.e., inconvenience of scheduling appointments, missing school/work, travelling to and from a clinician's office) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], increase adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and reduce treatment time and costs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We hope that a web-based treatment will increase the therapeutic accessibility. A limitation of the study is that the design is not appropriate to compare the efficacy of web-based CBT with face-to-face CBT. That would have asked for a non-inferiority design with comparison of the two interventions.</p><p>In conclusion, the FITNET study will provide greater insight on evidence-based treatment options for adolescents with CFS. If web-base CBT is more effective than usual care, this web-based program would greatly improve the prognosis of the adolescents with CBT.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CBT: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; CDC: Centre for Disease Control and Prevention; CFS: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; CIS-20: Checklist Individual Strength; CHQ-CF87: Health Questionnaire-Child Form; ECCF: Expert Centre for Chronic Fatigue; RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial; UMCU: University Medical Centre Utrecht.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SN is primary investigator and responsible for data collection and analysis and for drafting the manuscript.

Follow-up</p><p>FITNET is derived from the protocol for CBT that was developed on the basis of a model of perpetuating factors of CFS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been tested in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and is aimed at changing fatigue related cognitions and a gradual increase of activities.</p><p>Typically, treatment involves (a) formulation of treatment goals, (b) establishing a sleep routine, (c) encouraging the participant to achieve a balance between activity and rest, (d) gradually increasing activities including home, social and school life, (e) addressing cognitions about fatigue, (f) gaining independence from surroundings and parents, (g) reducing the focus on fatigue, and (h) paying attention to relapse prevention.</p><p>Addressing physical activity patterns is important in CBT for adolescent CFS. The CBT modules are adapted for two levels of physical activity: relative active and passive, based on the existing protocols[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. An actometer, a motion sensing device that can quantify physical activity, will be used to assess the activity pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Adolescents with a <italic>relatively high physical activity pattern </italic>alternate between periods of activity and periods of rest[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For these patients the therapy focuses on learning to recognise and accept their current state of fatigue and impairment. Then they learn to distribute their activities more evenly. After this, the patient will start to build up activity levels. In contrast, patients with a <italic>low physical activity pattern </italic>spend most time lying down and go out infrequently. Most do not attend school at all. For them, the treatment program starts with a systematic build up of activity as soon as possible, while addressing and challenging their beliefs that activity would aggravate symptoms.</p><p>Modules 1, 2 and 4 introduce CBT and explain the role of the therapists, and the context of the family. A rationale based on a multi-factorial model of CFS that distinguished predisposing, precipitating and maintaining factors is presented. Parents will be actively involved in supporting their child and parents' beliefs and behaviours regarding the condition of their child will be explored and addressed. The aims of therapy take into account the specific developmental tasks of adolescents. In children younger than 15 years, parents often act as a coach; for older participants, parents have to step back and encourage their child to take responsibility for the treatment.</p><p>Modules 3 and 5 are focused on treatment goals. Return to full time education is always a goal of treatment, and a plan for returning to school will be discussed early with everyone involved.</p><p>Modules 6 to 19 focus on cognitive behavioural strategies and include instructions and exercises on how to identify, challenge and change cognitive processes that contribute to CFS. There are two treatment protocols, depending on the pattern of physical activity of the patient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Module 20 evaluates treatment success.</p><p>Module 21 is a relapse preventing module focusing on maintaining gains and staying healthy.</p></sec><sec><title>Diaries</title><p>Sleep diary, Helpful Thoughts, My goals, Activity schedule, School schedule</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/11/23/prepub">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/11/23/prepub</ext-link></p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Our study is granted by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ID ZonMW 60-60800-98-013).</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fukuda</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Straus</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Hickie</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharpe</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Dobbins</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Komaroff</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><article-title>The chronic fatigue syndrome: a comprehensive approach to its definition and study.
