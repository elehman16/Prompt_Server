There were no restrictions such as blocking and block size. Allocation into the two trial arms were implemented using sealed envelopes.

In the P-LSM group, advice was given every 3&#x000a0;months, on a one-to-one basis, on the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle with the aim of reducing weight, encouraging regular exercise and managing psychological stress, as described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Briefly, participants with a raised BMI or WC were set a target of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5% weight loss over 12&#x000a0;months. In children, the aim was to limit excessive weight gain. Participants were advised to avoid a high intake of foods containing simple sugars, refined carbohydrates and high saturated fats (total fat&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;g/day) and recommended to increase their intake of fibre-rich natural foods such as wholegrains, legumes, vegetables and fruits.</p><p id="Par17">Participants with physical inactivity at baseline were advised to increase physical activity to at least 30&#x000a0;minutes of continuous exercise a day for more than 5&#x000a0;days a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Sedentary activities such as playing computer games and watching television were discouraged in all participants.</p><p id="Par18">Peer educators were selected following local advertisements for the positions, and were trained by specialist nutritionists and diabetes specialists for 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to starting work. The selection criteria were young persons (aged 18 to 40&#x000a0;years) living in Colombo District with secondary school education (with three advanced level passes in studied subjects), and good communication skills. A training manual was developed for the peer educators and their training supervised by&#x000a0;University of Colombo staff, and two external experts on lifestyle modification from South India. The&#x000a0;standardised training manual was used by all the peer educators as a guide to deliver the interventions.</p><p id="Par19">Criteria for failing training included an inability to demonstrate a sound understanding of the lifestyle programme and intervention, and poor communication skills after the training period. Approximately 20 peer educators were trained during the study with a drop-out rate of 25%. Monthly training refresher sessions were performed throughout the study with peer-to-peer education actively encouraged.</p><p id="Par20">With regards to receipt of intervention, this component of fidelity was evaluated by recording attendance at sessions, adherence to goals set and impact of the intervention on motivation by assessing behaviour change and readiness to change as detailed below. Each session lasted at least 30&#x000a0;minutes. In younger children (age&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;16&#x000a0;years) the LSM advice and guidance was also&#x000a0;given to the child&#x02019;s parents. A readiness to change ruler and questionnaire was utilised to assess behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Participants were asked about their readiness to change before assessing the results. These parameters were used to facilitate the participants&#x02019; understanding of the importance of behaviour change and to aid the delivery of the intervention. The stages of behaviour change were defined as pre-action (pre-contemplation, contemplation and preparation) and action (action and maintenance), using the trans-theoretical model of behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The presence or absence of stress and depression was assessed at each visit using the Perceived Stress Score Questionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Participants were provided counselling and advice on pragmatic strategies to reduce stress. It was emphasised that improving lifestyle would have a positive impact on perceived stress and anxiety levels over the duration of the study.</p><p id="Par22">All participants in the intensive group received trimonthly individualised LSM advice to assess progress (P-LSM). If needed, goals were reiterated and reinforced. The control group (C-LSM) received lifestyle advice annually, which was identical in format and structure to that provided to participants in the P-LSM group. The control group received annual LSM counselling as it would have been unethical to withhold any intervention in participants considered to be at future risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p id="Par23">The primary composite cardio-metabolic endpoint was new onset T2DM, hypertension, IGT, impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG), CVD and renal disease.

Participants with IFG or IGT diagnosed at baseline evaluation were eligible to participate in the trial. In these subjects, development of T2DM was the metabolic endpoint. Participants with endpoint diagnoses, including diagnosis of diabetes, underwent medical and clinical review. All participants with a new diagnosis of diabetes had a clinical history and features of T2DM. No participant with a diagnosis of new onset diabetes had clinical or biochemical features indicative of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, none of the participants diagnosed required insulin treatment or displayed any features of insulin deficiency.</p><p id="Par25">In adults, new cases of hypertension were defined as brachial blood pressure&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;140/90&#x000a0;mmHg; in subjects aged below 18&#x000a0;years, hypertension was defined following Joint National Committee 7 guidelines (blood pressure that is, on repeated measurement, at the 95th percentile or greater adjusted for age, height and sex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Renal disease was defined as&#x000a0;new onset microalbuminuria (urine albumin/creatinine ratio of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;22&#x000a0;mg/g in men and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;31&#x000a0;mg/g in women confirmed on one repeat test) or new onset renal impairment defined as estimated GFR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;mL/min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Initiation of statin therapy was included in the primary composite endpoint in view of recent substantive data that this class of drugs can influence glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Because of the young age range of our study population the composite outcome was composed of predictors/risk factors for clinical events with the addition of CVD events and all cause death. Participants were asked about events and only positive events were followed by review of hospital records. CVD event information was obtained from local hospital records, and when participants gave a positive response they were asked about events.</p><p id="Par26">The choice of risk factors in the primary outcome is clearly relevant to the younger age groups as occurrence of these risk factors has been shown to occur in childhood and track with time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par27">No information was available in a population comparable to the one reported on in this proof of concept work and hence the power calculation was largely&#x000a0;hypothesis driven and based on risk reductions for new onset T2DM in older IGT subjects observed with more intensive LSM from South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We assumed a 15% incidence of the primary end-point in the C-LSM group and estimated that approximately 2300 participants in each group will enable the detection of at least 25% relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint with P-LSM, at the 90% power level with a type-1 error of 0.05 (two-sided) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis of demographic and clinical features of the cohort. Comparison of proportions was performed by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis. Analyses of the incidence of dysglycaemia and the impact of the intervention in participants above and below 18&#x000a0;years of age were not pre-specified and performed post hoc. Regression analyses were used to estimate mean differences between the groups at the end of the study, which were adjusted for baseline value. For the biomarker endpoints, the last observation was carried forward for those participants with missing endpoint values who did not complete the full duration of the trial. There was no interim analysis performed.</p><p id="Par28">The final analysis was in the intent-to-treat population, who were randomised and had at least one post-randomisation visit/evaluation where intervention was delivered. We also report analyses for all participants who attended randomisation irrespective of whether they attended their first post-randomisation visit.</p><p id="Par29">We had originally proposed to perform survival analysis to estimate the cumulative incidence end-points and test the difference between the groups by means of the two-sided log-rank test. However, we updated the analyses plan to Poisson multivariate regression analyses (analyses were performed by the statistician on blinded data set) rather than survival analyses due to the following reasons. The Poisson approach is suitable when analysing time to event data when times between successive events are independent and exponentially distributed and the distribution of follow-up times similar for both groups (as was the case in our data set). In this scenario, a survival analysis would not be the most robust form of analyses because end points could not be observed continuously. Moreover, the Poisson method enables an efficient method to deal with cumulative exposure and other time-dependent covariates and allows for risk to depend on multiple timelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

The specific mechanisms that explain the reduction in the primary cardio-metabolic endpoint with the P-LSM intervention are unclear. In our trial, P-LSM had no effect on weight loss.

Similar results were observed in the IDDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These results from Asian participants are at variance with results from predominantly Caucasian participants studied in the North American&#x000a0;DPP and Finnish DPS, in which the impact of lifestyle modification on preventing T2DM was mostly driven by weight loss, though physical activity also increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Our P-LSM intervention resulted in increased physical activity and improved behaviour change to increase physical activity and this was true for participants both above and below 18&#x000a0;years of age. Exercise, even in the absence of weight loss, is known to improve insulin sensitivity, which is a key determinant of the 2-hour glucose concentration following an OGTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, our study was not designed to examine the mechanism of effect or test the relative contributions of weight change and physical activity&#x000a0;on cardio-metabolic endpoints. Our results indicate that, at least in young healthy South Asian participants, weight loss per se is not essential for reducing the risk of cardio-metabolic disease and we can speculate that increased physical activity may be an important factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

However, participants might have also defaulted because they were too ill to attend. We have no evidence for or against either of these situations. Nearly 24% of randomised participants were not eligible for analyses as they did not attend any visits to receive lifestyle advice and we had no follow-up data available on them. These participants had similar baseline features as compared to those who were eligible for analyses but the lack of follow-up information is a significant limitation of our work.

Our relatively conservative P-LSM programme with four visits a year undertaken by young peer educators is likely to be at least as cost-effective, but detailed cost-benefit and economic analyses are required and planned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">We take the view that, in South Asian subjects, who are known to be at enhanced and premature risk of T2DM and CVD, early interventions that can delay or prevent onset of cardio-metabolic endpoints are of clinical importance. Longer term follow-up of the DPP and Da Qing study cohorts showed a lasting effect of the original life change intervention with a significant reduction in new onset T2DM up to 10&#x02013;14 years&#x000a0;later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This suggests a significant legacy effect of the intervention and emphasises the importance of early intervention especially in a younger at-risk group. Recent publications highlight the urgent need and beneficial impact of diabetes prevention and implementation into general practice and promote the concept that even small changes in lifestyle can result in big changes in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">In summary, this is the first study to prove that in an at-risk urban South Asian population, across a wide range of young ages, a pragmatic lifestyle modification programme can significantly reduce the development of risk factors that are causally related to future development of T2DM and CVD in later life. Our study highlights the importance of early intervention and establishes the proof of concept and rationale for further pragmatic lifestyle modification intervention studies in young South Asian participants at risk of cardio-metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
