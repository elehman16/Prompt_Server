The manufacturing consistency of 3 lots of AS03-TIV based on HI antibody responses was demonstrated. Twenty-one days after one dose of vaccine in Year 1 and after another dose of vaccine in Year 2, the immunogenicity of both AS03-TIV and TIV fulfilled licensure criteria for influenza vaccines.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>Here we describe the immunogenicity findings from the Phase 3 <italic>Influence65</italic> trial, which was based on a subset of 5187 subjects, of which 60% of in each vaccine group were seropositive (HI antibody titer &#x02265;1 :10) before vaccination in Year 1. After vaccination, HI antibody responses were robust, although some strain dependent differences were observed.</p><p>After vaccination in Year 1, SCRs against the B strain (Victoria lineage) were 67.9% with AS03-TIV and 59.2% with TIV, and were lower in Year 2 against the B strain (Yamagata lineage) at 48.7% and 36.9%, respectively. For the B strain, the 95% CI for the SPR was &#x02265;60% and for the SCR was &#x02265;30% (fulfilling licensure criteria) in both vaccine groups in both years at Day 21, and SCRs and SPRs remained above this threshold at Day 180 in Year 1. We observed differences in HI antibody responses against the 2 influenza A strains. Immune responses overall were weakest against A/H1N1 in the AS03-TIV and TIV groups at Day 21 in Year 1 (SCRs, 58.3% and 47.4%, respectively). Day 21 SCRs against A/H3N2 were robust in the AS03-TIV and TIV groups in Year 1 (87.7% and 74.1%, respectively), yet were slightly lower in Year 2 (53.0% and 43.9%, respectively). In both years in both vaccine groups, licensure criteria were fulfilled at Day 21 for A/H3N2, and SPRs remained above the licensure threshold at Day 180 in both years in both vaccine groups. SCRs for A/H3N2 at Day 180 remained above the Day 21 licensure threshold in Year 1, but not in Year 2.</p><p>A possible explanation for the lower SCR against A/H3N2 in Year 2 than in Year 1 is the effect of baseline antibody titers on immune responses to vaccination. Various studies have shown that pre-vaccination titers, resulting from natural exposure or previous vaccination, can affect the immunogenicity of subsequent seasonal influenza vaccines.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12-15</sup></xref> In our study, in the immunogenicity cohort, in Year 1, the rate of influenza vaccination in the previous season was 75% and in Year 2 was 100% (i.e. due to study vaccination during Year 1), and during both season in the study A/H3N2 was the predominant circulating strain. It is possible that vaccination in Year 1 or natural exposure to A/H3N2 could have had a negative impact on the immune response in Year 2.</p><p>The immunogenicity subset included subjects from all 15 countries in the <italic>Influence65</italic> trial and the wide regional spread of the population is a strength of the trial. However, 66.5% of the immunogenicity subset were recruited in Germany (n = 1068), Czech Republic (n = 1096), and US (n = 1048), which was based the need to limit variation in the population in order to compare immunogenicity between vaccine lots to assess the consistency of the manufacturing process. The results of the <italic>Influence65</italic> trial suggest that AS03-TIV improved protection compared with TIV against influenza A infection (secondary analysis, relative efficacy 17.5%) and influenza A/H3N2 infection in particular (<italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis, relative efficacy 22.0%).<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In the immunogenicity subset, the A/H3N2 attack rate was 0.74% in the AS03-TIV group and 1.74% in the TIV group. The estimated relative efficacy between the vaccine groups in the immunogenicity subset appeared high (&#x0223c;57%), and well above the point estimate (12.16%) in the overall study population. No explanation for this phenomenon has been found.</p><p>The relatively high rate of antigenic drift observed with A/H3N2 is thought to be associated with an increased risk of complications and death by this influenza subtype compared with influenza B strains and A/H1N1 in older adults.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16-18</sup></xref> For example, based on analysis of US hospital discharge records collected for 22 seasons (1979&#x02013;2001), severe influenza outcomes were much more frequent in the elderly population than among younger adults and children, and the rates of primary pneumonia and influenza-related hospitalization tended to be higher overall in years when A/H3N2 predominated.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In the 2008/09 influenza season in the countries in our study, A/H3N2 was the predominant strain, including high epidemic intensity in Czech Republic and moderate epidemic intensity in Germany.

The correlates of protection analysis was based on a randomly selected subset and showed that HI titres of 1:40 corresponded with 50% protection for A/H3N2 cases that were antigenically matched to the vaccine, whereas HI titres of 1:203 to 1:437 were needed for 50% protection in A/H3N2 cases with poor vaccine match.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In the <italic>Influence65</italic> correlates of protection analysis we assessed the distribution of HI titers and the distribution of A/H3N2 cases, and showed that among subjects with post-vaccination HI titers of &#x0003c;1:40, 4.6% had A/H3N2 infection, compared with 0.95% of subjects with post-vaccination titers of &#x02265;1:40. Next we performed a logistic regression, and confirmed a relationship between post-vaccination HI antibody titers against A/H3N2 and the risk of A/H3N2 infection. A 4-fold difference in post-vaccination HI antibody titers against A/H3N2 was associated with a 2-fold decrease in the odds of A/H3N2 infection. However, it should be noted that the population was elderly, and these findings may not extrapolate to younger populations.</p><p>It has been previously suggested that HI-based surrogates may be unsuitable for older people because they do not take into account declines in cell-mediated immune responses.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> It is recognized that multiple components of immune function are affected by the aging process including impairment of CD4 and CD8 effector and memory T cell responses, and as such, assessments of immune responses to vaccines in older populations should include both humoral and cell-mediated responses, with the clinical goal of increasing both to levels which are correlated with protection.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,11,14,20,29</sup></xref></p><p>Although our modeling analysis provides an important insight into correlates of protection in elderly people, a limitation of the study was that the <italic>Influence65</italic> trial was not initially planned to include a correlate of protection evaluation. A barrier to evaluating correlates of protection is that most influenza vaccine trials are not powered for this type of assessment. Moreover, in an active control trial, a large proportion of subjects may have high titers and be well protected whereas assessment of a correlate involves contrasting those with low titers and high rates of disease with those with high titers and low rates of disease, and there may be relatively few of the former in an active control trial such as influenza vaccine trials in elderly populations.</p><p>In summary, in this large randomized study of people aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years, AS03-TIV and TIV elicited strong antibody responses against each vaccine strain 21 d post-vaccination and antibody persistence 6 months post-vaccination were strongest for A/H3N2 and lowest for A/H1N1. A model based on HI titers and A/H3N2 attack rates suggests that a single threshold value for antibody titers within the current definition of seroprotection may not demonstrate adequate protection in older people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0004"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Design and objectives</title><p>This Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study was conducted to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of an AS03-adjuvanted TIV compared with a non-adjuvanted TIV during the 2008/09 (Year 1) and 2009/10 (Year 2) influenza seasons.
