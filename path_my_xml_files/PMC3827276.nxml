One such trial, Project Accept, a Phase III, community-randomized trial, evaluated the impact of enhanced, community-based voluntary counseling and testing on population-level HIV incidence. The primary endpoint of the trial was based on a single, cross-sectional, post-intervention HIV incidence assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Test performance of HIV incidence determination was evaluated for 403 multi-assay algorithms [MAAs] that included the BED capture immunoassay [BED-CEIA] alone, an avidity assay alone, and combinations of these assays at different cutoff values with and without CD4 and viral load testing on samples from seven African cohorts (5,325 samples from 3,436 individuals with known duration of HIV infection [1 month to &#x0003e;10 years]). The mean window period (average time individuals appear positive for a given algorithm) and performance in estimating an incidence estimate (in terms of bias and variance) of these MAAs were evaluated in three simulated epidemic scenarios (stable, emerging and waning). The power of different test methods to detect a 35% reduction in incidence in the matched communities of Project Accept was also assessed. A MAA was identified that included BED-CEIA, the avidity assay, CD4 cell count, and viral load that had a window period of 259 days, accurately estimated HIV incidence in all three epidemic settings and provided sufficient power to detect an intervention effect in Project Accept.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In a Southern African setting, HIV incidence estimates and intervention effects can be accurately estimated from cross-sectional surveys using a MAA. The improved accuracy in cross-sectional incidence testing that a MAA provides is a powerful tool for HIV surveillance and program evaluation.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Primary sources of support: This research was sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health as a cooperative agreement, through contracts U01MH066687 (Johns Hopkins University &#x02013; David Celentano, PI); U01MH066688 (Medical University of South Carolina &#x02013; Michael Sweat, PI); U01MH066701 (University of California, Los Angeles &#x02013; Thomas J.

In clinical trials, HIV incidence is usually assessed by enrolling HIV-uninfected individuals and following them over time to detect HIV acquisition. An alternate approach is to assess HIV incidence by analyzing specimens from cross-sectional surveys without longitudinal follow-up <xref rid="pone.0078818-Busch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This approach may be needed for evaluation of population-level interventions for HIV prevention, particularly when HIV testing is part of a combination prevention strategy <xref rid="pone.0078818-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078818-Padian1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this report, we describe the development of methods that were used to analyze HIV incidence in a large, Phase III community randomized trial: National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Project Accept (HIV Prevention Trials Network 043 [HPTN 043]) <xref rid="pone.0078818-Sweat1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Project Accept is one of the largest randomized, controlled trial performed to date, and is the first randomized controlled trial with a primary study endpoint based solely on cross-sectional estimation of HIV incidence.</p><p>Project Accept evaluated the impact of integrated behavioral interventions on HIV incidence in 48 paired communities (34 in Africa, 14 in Thailand) <xref rid="pone.0078818-Laeyendecker4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Control communities received standard, clinic-based, voluntary counseling and testing services; intervention communities received enhanced, community-based voluntary counseling and testing services. After a 3-year intervention period, samples were collected from individuals in the communities (aged 18 to 32 years) in a single cross-sectional survey. When the trial was designed, the study plan was to estimate HIV incidence using the BED capture immunoassay (BED-CEIA, Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Lake Oswego, OR, USA) <xref rid="pone.0078818-Dobbs1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. That approach was not used because the BED-CEIA was later found to overestimate incidence in many settings <xref rid="pone.0078818-UNAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we describe the laboratory and statistical analysis that was used to identify an alternate testing strategy for HIV incidence estimation in Project Accept. The testing strategies that were evaluated used multiple biomarkers to assess HIV incidence <xref rid="pone.0078818-Mastro1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This approach was based on recent success using a multi-assay algorithm (MAA) to estimate HIV incidence in populations in the United States (clade B settings) <xref rid="pone.0078818-Laeyendecker1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0078818-Eshleman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. That MAA combines serologic assays (the BED-CEIA and an antibody avidity assay) with non-serologic biomarkers (CD4 cell count and HIV viral load) to identify individuals who were likely to have been recently infected at the time of sample collection (referred to in this report as MAA positive). In Project Accept, because HIV prevalence in the communities in Thailand was low (&#x0003c;1%, <xref rid="pone.0078818-PiwowarManning1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>), data from Thailand were not included in the primary endpoint analysis. Therefore, we focused on identifying a MAA that could be used to estimate incidence in the African communities of the trial, using validation samples obtained from seven African cohorts.</p><p>Development of methods for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation is challenging for several reasons. First, an assay or MAA must have a suitable mean window period; this term refers to the average period of time that individuals are identified as positive by a specific assay or MAA. If the window period is too short, fewer individuals will be classified as positive, resulting in higher variance and lower precision of incidence estimates, reducing the power to determine an intervention effect. Conversely, if the window period is too long, the precision of incidence estimates will be reduced because of high bias; furthermore, if too many individuals with long-term infection (e.g, infected &#x0003e;1 year) test positive by an assay or MAA, the incidence estimates will not reflect the current epidemic. Bias is reduced when the probability of being classified as positive approaches zero as the time since infection increases <xref rid="pone.0078818-Brookmeyer2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078818-Brookmeyer3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The performance of serologic assays used for cross-sectional incidence estimation may also be affected by HIV viral load, frequency and duration of antiretroviral treatment (ART), the stage of HIV disease, HIV subtype, and race <xref rid="pone.0078818-Laeyendecker3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0078818-Hallett1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Finally, the performance of assays and MAAs for incidence estimation varies by the stage of the epidemic. For example, a given test method may perform well in an emerging epidemic with high incidence, but may not perform well in waning epidemic where incidence is low and many individuals have advanced HIV disease. In this report, we describe the laboratory and statistical methods used to identify a MAA for incidence analysis in Project Accept.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Samples used for analysis</title><p>Samples obtained from seven African cohort studies and clinical trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0078818-t001">Table 1</xref>) were used for validation. Samples were selected based on availability of stored plasma, known infecting subtype, known duration of infection (known date of a prior positive and/or negative HIV test), and available CD4 cell count data from the time of sample collection. Of the samples that did not have a known prior HIV negative time point, 99.3% were from individuals who were HIV seropositive for &#x0003e;1 year and 52.7% were known to be from individuals who were HIV seropositive for &#x0003e;2 years. Infection times were either interval-censored (the dates of the first positive and the last negative HIV tests were available) or right-censored (the date of the last negative test was unknown). In the latter case, we assigned the 14th birthday as the date of the last negative test and treated the infection time as interval-censored. Interval-censored infection times were randomly imputed in the simulations. For almost all of the samples, the infection time was generated from the uniform distribution between the last negative and first positive test dates. However, for 147 samples from subjects who had another visit following the current sample date, the infection time was generated from a posterior Weibull density truncated to the interval between the last negative and first positive test dates. We assumed a Weibull distribution on the survival of HIV-infected subjects and a uniform prior distribution of the infection time, and calculated the posterior distribution of the infection time given the date of the last known visit. We used the Weibull survival distribution with the shape parameter 1.856 and rate parameter 4358.5 days. The truncated Weibull density puts more weight on the more recent infection times if the subject is known to have survived for a long time after the first positive test date and so improves the precision of the imputed infection times compared to the uniform distribution. More details on these methods are presented elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0078818-Kulich1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

These scenarios were constructed by randomly selecting samples from the validation data set so that the distribution of durations of infection corresponded to the desired scenario (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078818-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

These samples were from individuals with a broad range of infection times who had CD4 cell count data available from the time of sample collection. We found that testing algorithms that included multiple assays were superior to single serologic assays; the incidence estimates obtained using multiple assays had lower bias and better precision. We used simulation exercises to demonstrate that the 4-assay MAA that was selected for use in Project Accept provided a more precise estimate of the ratio between incidence in the intervention and control communities than would have been obtained by following a cohort for seroconversion over a 6-month period.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate the importance of including samples from very long-term infections when validating methods for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation. Using a sample set that included individuals infected &#x0003e;10 years, the mean window period for the BED-CEIA was 1.63 years, which is approximately three times longer than the mean window period previously reported for this assay <xref rid="pone.0078818-Parekh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We found that the BED-CEIA and avidity assay frequently identified individuals infected &#x0003e;2 years as positive. This effect was most pronounced for subtype D. Previous studies have shown that misclassification of subtype D samples using these assays reflects differences in the serologic response to subtype D infection compared to subtype A infection; differences in the sequences of subtype D viruses in the region corresponding to the BED-CEIA target antigen also negatively affect assay performance <xref rid="pone.0078818-Mullis1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We recommend against using the BED-CEIA or Bio-Rad avidity assays for cross-sectional incidence estimation in populations that include a substantial proportion of subtype D-infected individuals. Additional studies should be performed using different test methods [e.g., different assay (s) and/or different cutoff (s)] to identify an effective method for cross-sectional incidence estimation in subtype D endemic areas. Fortunately, the prevalence of subtype D was low in the Tanzanian communities in Project Accept <xref rid="pone.0078818-Laeyendecker5" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, we felt it was reasonable to use a MAA that was optimized for subtypes A and C for estimating incidence in the four African sites in Project Accept.</p><p>In this report, we used a novel approach to compare the performance of a large set of MAAs that employed different combinations of assays and assay cutoffs in three different simulated epidemic scenarios. The MAAs that included both serologic assays and non-serologic biomarkers (CD4 count and viral load) had lower bias and variance for estimating incidence than algorithms based on a single assay. The MAA that provided the greatest power to detect a reduction in incidence in Project Accept used relatively high cutoffs for both the BED-CEIA (&#x0003c;1.2 OD-n) and the avidity assay (&#x0003c;90% AI), which increased the identification of individuals infected within 1 year. Use of these higher cutoffs for increased the frequency of misclassification, though it was still &#x0003c;1.5% for individuals infected &#x0003e;2 years.</p><p>HIV viral load was included in 77 of the 403 MAAs evaluated in this study. This biomarker identifies both elite suppressors and individuals who are virally suppressed from ART. It is important to identify both of these groups, since viral suppression is associated with down-regulation of the humoral immune response to HIV infection and with increased rates of false-recent misclassification using serologic HIV incidence assays <xref rid="pone.0078818-Busch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. ART also serves as an independent surrogate for non-recent HIV infection, since individuals with recent HIV infection are not likely to be identified or to access ART in many settings. We recognize that the 4-assay MAA selected for endpoint analysis in Project Accept may misclassify some individuals on ART who are not virally suppressed (e.g., those with low viral loads that are &#x0003e;400 copies/ml). This was addressed in Project Accept using a two-step approach: first, the MAA was used to identify samples from individuals who were likely to have had recent infection; second, these samples were tested for the presence of antiretroviral drugs <xref rid="pone.0078818-Laeyendecker5" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. When using antiretroviral drug testing in an HIV incidence assessment, it is important to consider the test results in the context of antiretroviral drug regimens that were used in the communities at the time the incidence survey was conducted; this should take into account use of antiretroviral drugs for HIV prevention (e.g., for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, where those receiving prophylaxis may have been recently infected).</p><p>The novel approach that was used to select an optimal testing algorithm for HIV incidence assessment in Project Accept is of general relevance to HIV prevention trials. We demonstrate that a large validation data set from individuals with known duration of infection can be used to assess the performance of various testing algorithms in terms of estimating incidence, providing estimates of bias and precision, and comparing the cross-sectional estimates to cohort-based estimates. We also used an empirical approach to determine assay cutoffs that optimized the precision of cross-sectional incidence estimates using MAAs. The methods described in this report could be used for cross-sectional incidence assessment in non-subtype D epidemics of Southern Africa for HIV prevention studies, surveillance, and other purposes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0078818.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Window periods, bias, root square mean error (RMSE) for stable, emerging and waning epidemics for 403 multi-assay algorithms (MAAs). *</p><p>*BED: BED capture immunoassay (results expressed as normalized optical density units); AI: avidity assay (results expressed as a percentage, avidity index); CD4: CD4 cell count (results expressed as cells/mm<sup>3</sup>); VL: viral load (results expressed as HIV RNA copies/mL); yrs: years;</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0078818.s001.avi"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the communities that partnered with us in conducting this research, and all study participants for their contributions.
