shockwave therapy (ESWT) for patients with chronic low back pain and their dynamic balance
ability. [Subjects] Twenty-eight patients with chronic low back were divided into an
extracorporeal shockwave therapy group (ESWTG: n=13) and a conservative physical therapy
group (CPTG, n=15). [Methods] An exercise program that included Williams&#x02019; exercises and
McKenzie&#x02019;s exercises was performed by both groups. The program was implemented twice a
week for six weeks. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure the chronic low back
pain of the patients. Their dynamic balance ability was measured with BioRescue. [Results]
The within-group comparison of the VAS of the ESWTG and the CPTG showed significant
improvements after the intervention. In the VAS comparison between the groups after the
treatment, the ESWTG showed a significantly larger improvement. In the within-group
comparison of dynamic balance ability, the ESWTG showed significant improvements after the
intervention in SAPLS, SAPRS, SAPFS, SAPBS, and TSA, and the CPTG showed significant
improvements in SAPLS and SAPBS. In the between-group comparison of the dynamic balance
ability after the treatment, the ESWTG showed significantly larger improvements in their
SAPLS, SAPRS, SAPFS, and TSA. [Conclusion] The exercise program combined with the ESWT
relieved chronic back pain more than the exercise program combined with the CPT. The
former was also more effective at improving the patients&#x02019; dynamic balance ability in terms
of SAPLS, SAPRS, SAPFS, and TSA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd><kwd>Conservative physical therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is the second most common ailment suffered by adults, surpassed only by the
common cold. It is recognized not only as a health problem, but also as a social problem,
because it is the most frequent cause of absenteeism among office workers. In modern
industrial society, the number of low back pain patients has been gradually increasing due
to sedentary lifestyles with little exercise.</p><p>Simple low back pain can be prevented by habitually adopting a proper posture while
sitting, and avoiding sitting in one position for a long time. Chronic low back pain has
many causes, which are treated with diverse methods, such as bed rest, lumbar support
devices, traction, thermotherapy, electrical stimulation, and manipulation in most
cases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, invasive treatment
methods, such as selective nerve root block and epidural injection, may be used. Surgery may
be performed if there is no response to these treatment methods or if the disease is deemed
serious<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. New conservative treatment
methods, including extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), have recently been
implemented<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In ESWT, extracorporeal shockwaves are applied to lesions to help revascularization and
stimulate or reactivate the process of connective tissue and bone healing, thereby relieving
pain and improving functions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. ESWT can be
used for pain relief as well as improving muscle strength through appropriate motor
simulation of the muscles and tendons with extracorporeal shockwaves<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although ESWT is currently used to treat diseases of the
musculoskeletal system, few studies have examined the effect of ESWT on chronic low back
pain, or pain and balance ability following treatment. Therefore, the present study
investigated the effects of ESWT on patients with chronic low back pain and their dynamic
balance ability following treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 28 patients (9 males, 19 females) who visited K
neurosurgical hospital located in Daegu, Korea. They were classified by neurosurgeons as
having chronic low back pain because their low back pain persisted for 12 weeks or longer.
The study subjects were divided into an ESWT group (ESWTG, n=13) (mean&#x000b1;SD age
53.92&#x000b1;10.38&#x02005;years, height 163.15&#x000b1;10.61&#x02005;cm, weight 64.54&#x000b1;11.98&#x02005;kg) and a conservative
physical therapy group (CPTG, n=15) (mean&#x000b1;SD age 54.33&#x000b1;13.16&#x02005;years, height 160.27&#x000b1;7.41&#x02005;cm,
weight 60.20&#x000b1;6.92&#x02005;kg). All the subjects read and signed consent forms in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Additional criteria for inclusion in the
study were never having undergone surgery for the relief of low back pain, having no mental
or cognitive problem that would have affected the study, and having been advised by their
attending neurosurgeon that lumbar exercises were not prohibited.</p><p>A JEST-2000 (Joeun Medical, Daejeon, Korea) was used to administer the treatment for the
ESWTG. with the patients in a prone position, 2,000 (7 times per sec) shockwave impulses
(5&#x02005;Hz) at an energy flux density of 0.10&#x02005;mJ/mm2 were delivered using a 17-mm head. After
determining the regions of low back pain through physical examinations, a surgical lubricant
was applied to the contact surface, and the shockwave energy was delivered. The chief
complaint of the patients with chronic low back pain was pain in the buttock and lumbosacral
region of the spine. Therefore, the treated regions were mainly the quadratus lumborum
muscle, the gluteus maximus muscle, the gluteus medius muscle, the gluteus minimus muscle,
and the piriform muscle. The CPTG received thermotherapy using hot packs, and ultrasound and
electrotherapy using TENS. Both the ESWTG and the CPTG received treatment twice a per week
for six weeks, and both groups took part in an exercise program comprised of Williams&#x02019;
exercises and McKenzie&#x02019;s exercise.</p><p>The exercise program was designed to strengthen the lumbar muscles. It was implemented in
30 minute sessions, twice a week, for six weeks. The Williams&#x02019; exercise is composed of a
posterior pelvic tilt (10 sec/1 set, 3 sets), followed by sit-ups (10 times/1 set, 3 sets),
and a knee to chest exercise (10 sec/1 set, 3 sets). McKenzie&#x02019;s exercise involves bending
the trunk back while supporting the trunk with both elbows in a prone position (trunk
extension) (20 sec/1 set, 3 sets), followed by bending the trunk back while supporting the
trunk with both hands with the elbow extended in a prone position (10 sec/1 set, 3 sets),
and then bending the trunk back in a standing position (10 sec/1 set, 3 sets).</p><p>The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the levels of the patients&#x02019; pain. To
examine the subjects&#x02019; dynamic balance ability, their surface area per left side (SAPLS),
surface area per right side (SAPRS), surface area per forward side (SAPFS), surface area per
back side (SAPBS), and total surface area (TSA) were measured using the BioRescue (RM
Ing&#x000e9;nierie, France) system. BioRescue has a baropodometric platform equipped with 1,600
pressure sensors, which can be used to evaluate weight bearing, body movements, and balance
between the left and the right lower limbs using pressure sensors under the feet. The
subjects adopted an upright standing position on the platform, with the feet making an angle
of approximately 30&#x000b0; at the heels, by placing the toes further apart than the heels. The
subjects moved their weight in four directions prompted by a monitor placed in front of
them: forward, backward, leftward, and rightward. APLS, SAPRS, SAPFS, SAPBS, and TSA do not
measure the shift in weight by moving the trunk. Rather, they measure the maximum limits of
the shifts in weight at the ankles, while maintaining stability and without losing balance.
The maximum limits were analyzed by measuring the areas of sway during the weight shifts
from the center point to the farthest point from the center point. The shifts were measured
three times in total, and the average values of the measured values obtained through the
repeated measurements were used.</p><p>In the present study, to examine differences in the pain scales and the dynamic balance
ability, the paired sample t-test was conducted for comparisons within the groups, and the
independent sample t-test was conducted for comparisons between the groups. The data were
statistically processed using SPSS 12.0 for Windows with asignificance level, &#x003b1;, of
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the VAS comparisons within the groups of chronic low back patients, the ESWTG and the
CPTG showed significant improvements after the intervention. In the VAS comparison between
the groups after the treatment, the ESWTG showed a significantly larger improvement
(p&#x0003c;0.05). In the dynamic balance ability comparisons within the groups, the ESWTG showed
significant improvement after intervention in SAPLS, SAPRS, SAPFS, SAPBS, and TSA, and the
CPTG showed significant improvements in SAPLS and SAPBS (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the dynamic balance
ability comparison between the groups after the treatment, the ESWTG showed significantly
larger improvements in SAPLS, SAPRS, SAPFS, and TSA (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of the PS and DBA between each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">PS (point)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">VAS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESWTG**</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.2&#x000b1;0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5&#x000b1;1.1<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CPTG**</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.6&#x000b1;0.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.5&#x000b1;0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="10" colspan="1">DBA (mm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">SAPLS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESWTG**</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,770.2&#x000b1;804.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,072.3&#x000b1;1,917.8<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CPTG*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,036.1&#x000b1;1,198.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,636.1&#x000b1;1,071.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">SAPRS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESWTG**</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,098.7&#x000b1;908.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3,652.5&#x000b1;1,626.4<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CPTG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,235.7&#x000b1;1,422.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,498.1&#x000b1;1,025.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">SAPFS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESWTG**</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,094.1&#x000b1;1,012.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,429.6&#x000b1;2,491.6<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CPTG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,439.8&#x000b1;1,934.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,610.4&#x000b1;1,229.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">SAPBS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESWTG**</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,851.8&#x000b1;910.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3,295.2&#x000b1;1,322.9</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CPTG*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,858.7&#x000b1;1,013.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,523.9&#x000b1;931.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">TSA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESWTG**</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,153.6&#x000b1;1,499.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7,724.7&#x000b1;3,490.7<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CPTG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,298.7&#x000b1;2,660.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5,134.3&#x000b1;2,033.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>PS: pain scale, DBA: dynamic balance ability, VAS: visual analog scale, SAPLS:

pain patients on their pain and dynamic postural balance.</p><p>Loew et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when 20
calcific tendinitis patients were treated with shockwave therapy and followed up three
months later, 75% of the patients showed pain relief and improvements on the Constant and
Murley scale (CMS). Rompe et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that when shoulder joint calcific tendinitis patients were treated with sporadic shockwave
therapy, 60% of the patients recovered normal functioning, and 72% of the patients showed
only intermittent discomfort based on their CMS. Cho et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when elbow joint lateral epicondylitis patients were
treated with ESWT, their pain was significantly relieved, and their muscle strength
significantly increased. Na<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
pain was significantly relieved in patients with chronic low back pain who were treated with
ESWT. Lee<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when ESWT was
applied to patients with elbow joint lateral epicondylitis, their pain was relieved, their
simple elbow test scores significantly improved, and 83% of patients showed satisfactory
results. Lee suggested that ESWT may present a new effective and noninvasive conservative
treatment method for elbow joint lateral epicondylitis that fails to respond to conservative
treatment. According to the results of the present study, both the ESWTG and the CPTG showed
significant decreases in the VAS in the within-group comparisons after the treatment, and
the ESWTG showed a significantly larger decrease in the VAS than the CPTG. These results are
consistent with the results of the study conducted by Rompe et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, which indicated that gentle and repetitive stimuli given
through shockwave therapy were effective at relieving pain. Also a report by Hammer et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that ESWTG cured
inflammation in the tendons and ligaments when applied to lesions. ESWT is thought to work
by breaking calculi and gallstones, inducing increases in the blood flow rate and
revascularization, thereby stimulating and reactivating the process of healing of the
tendons, surrounding tissues, and bones. We consider the present study showed decreases in
the VAS as a result of the same processes.</p><p>In the present study, to examine the relationship between pain relief and postural balance,
changes in the patient&#x02019;s balance ability were measured using a Biorescue. Lee<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the sway distance and the
rate of movement in standing positions was significantly decreased in patients with low back
pain compared to healthy subjects, and that the proprioceptive sense inputs in the low back
pain patients were altered due to pain; thus, somesthesia was damaged, and their motile
responses were changed. Yun<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that
athletes with pain in their arms adopted an asymmetric body posture and that this led to
pain throughout their bodies and affected their balance ability. In addition, Poole et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when the postural
balance ability of 20 elderly subjects with cervical pain was compared with that of 20
elderly subjects without pain, those with cervical pain showed significantly poorer balance
ability, indicating that the cervical pain significantly affected their balance. According
to the results of the comparisons of the dynamic balance ability within the groups in the
present study, the ESWTG showed significant improvements after intervention in SAPLS, SAPRS,
SAPFS, SAPBS, and TSA, and the CPTG showed significant improvements in SAPLS and SAPB. In
the comparison of the dynamic balance ability between the groups after the treatment, the
ESWTG showed significantly larger improvements in SAPLS, SAPRS, SAPFS, and TSA. Gill and
Callagham<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that pain displaces
the normal signals coming from muscles and sensory organs, thereby hindering balance
ability. Magnusson et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that
if active ranges of joint motion are limited due to chronic pain, then the actual ranges of
joint motion also decrease. In the present study, ESWT likely reduced the low back pain,
reducing its interference with the signals coming from the muscles and the sensory organs,
thereby improving the active ranges of joint motion. As a result, the ranges of joint motion
were improved, and the weight shift distances increased.</p><p>The limitations of the present study were as follows. First, the number of subjects with
chronic low back was limited, meaning the results cannot be generalized. Second, the lumbar
lesion regions were limited. Third, the subjects&#x02019; daily living activities could not be
completely controlled. Fourth, objective evaluations of blood tests for parameters such as
lactic acid, prostaglandin E, substance P, and kinin were not undertaken, and finally the
results of the evaluation of the patients&#x02019; dynamic balance ability could not be compared
with previous studies because data from previous studies were not available. In later
studies, the blood test results of patients with chronic low back and their muscle strength
following ESWT should be examined.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name></person-group>: The effects of traditional physical therapy on pain reduction and
