The study aimed at evaluating the role of initial surgery in treatment of stage II and III pediatric WT as a part of the short administration schedule as in National Wilms&#x02019; Tumor Study (NWTS)-4 and evaluating its effectiveness compared to the long administration schedule.</p></sec><sec id="a2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study included 30 children who were primarily diagnosed as stage II and III WT. They were divided into two equal groups. Group I (n = 15) included those children who had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and postoperative chemotherapy, while group II (n = 15) included those children who had undergone primary surgery as an initial management followed by chemotherapy. After a mean postoperative follow-up period of 14 &#x000b1; 5 months, clinical and radiological evaluation was performed to all patients.</p></sec><sec id="a3"><title>Results</title><p>In group I, 10 patients were preoperatively diagnosed as stage II and five patients as stage III while in group II, 11 patients were proved to be stage II and four patients were stage III.

The incidence varies from 10.9 per million in the USA to 2.5 per million in Chinese [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therapeutic approach varies geographically as it sometimes depends largely on the cost-effectiveness of the chosen policy [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In Europe and some extra-European countries, patients are treated according to Societe Internationale d&#x02019;Oncologie Pediatrique/International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) protocol which advocates preoperative chemotherapy for 4 - 6 weeks relying on initial diagnostic imaging, followed by surgery [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Most of the United States and Canada follow the National Wilms&#x02019; Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) protocol which mandates primary nephrectomy for all cases with the exception of the large unilateral or bilateral tumors, while further adjuvant therapy is given based on surgical and pathologic findings [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6-8</xref>]. The fundamental differences existing between these two large cooperative multinational trials are primary surgery in NWTSG versus initial or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in SIOP [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite the debate over whether chemotherapy should be given before surgery [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9-11</xref>], the clinical outcomes are excellent in both groups, and productive debate continues on the merits of each approach [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The issue here is which approach should supersede the other as a treatment option specifically in stage II and III. Some researchers tried to find out the answer [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At present, the decision to follow either approach is subjective in centers that are not a part of these groups.</p><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of initial surgery (NWTSG) as a guide to determine an accurate stage and to tailor treatment for children who were primarily diagnosed as stage II and III WT as a short administration treatment schedule compared with the long administration schedule in SIOP and its effect on lowing the total treatment cost in resource challenged setting nations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials | methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study recruited 30 children who were primarily diagnosed as stage II and III WT over a period of 8 years (2004 - 2012). The initial assessment included clinical examination as well as laboratory investigations including complete blood count, urine analysis specially urine catecholamines to rule out neuroblastoma, serum urea and creatinine levels. Abdominal ultrasonography and CT were performed to all patients to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other abdominal masses not originating in the kidney. Chest CT and radiographs were used for detection of lung metastases.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were CT proved unilateral WT (stage II and III) children. While excluded were those children presenting with other abdominal malignancies and/or other renal lesions such as hydronephrosis or cystic disease. Patients with hematogenous metastasis were also excluded.</p><p>Children were divided into two equal groups. In group I (n = 15), preoperative chemotherapy was decided according to CT diagnosis, whereas precise staging was assigned after surgery. In group II (n = 15), surgical intervention was done as an initial management followed by chemotherapy. Commonly employed chemotherapeutic agents included dactinomycin, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. Chemotherapy dosage depends on the particular stage of the disease and the child (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In group I, surgical exploration was performed as soon as the child health was optimized, usually within 6 weeks after the initial diagnosis.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Chemotherapeutic Agents Used for WT Treatment</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drug name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pediatric dose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dactinomycin</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.015 mg/kg IV push qd for 5 days</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vincristine</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV q1-3 weeks, not to exceed 2 mg/dose</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cyclophosphomide</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2 - 2.2 g/m<sup>2</sup> IV qd for 1 - 3 days</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Etoposide</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV qd for 5 days</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Doxorubicin (adriamycin)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Chemotherapeutic Regimens in Relation to the Stage of WT</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chemotherapeutic regimen</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage II (FH), stage III (FH)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DD-4A (AMD, VCR, and DOX; 24 weeks</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage II or stage III (focal or diffuse anaplasia)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I (VCR + CPM + E; 24 weeks)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>FH: favorable histology; AMD: dactinomycin; VCR: vincristine; DOX: doxorubicin; CPM: cyclophosphamide: E: etoposide.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Surgery entailed radical excision of the tumor whenever amenable. A transverse abdominal incision was done to provide adequate exposure, from the tip of the 12th rib on the involved side to the lateral rectus border on the opposite side.

The two main study groups are SIOP and NWTSG. SIOP has advocated preoperative radiotherapy in the first two trials and then used chemotherapy in the following four trials for 4 - 6 weeks. The advantage of SIOP protocol is to reduce the incidence of tumor rupture, intra-peritoneal tumor spillage, obtain a more favorable stage distribution, and in turn, reduce the treatment burden. Beside that this protocol gives the opportunity to judge responsiveness of the tumor to the standard regimen of chemotherapy so that risk stratification and treatment adjustments are feasible in postoperative period. However, the potential disadvantages of SIOP are not obtaining untreated tissue for proper histopathological study, treatment of a benign condition with chemotherapy and treatment of a different malignant disease with the wrong chemotherapy as well as the relative long time of administration schedule that may be more expensive [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The NWTSG approach recommends up-front surgery with certain exceptions: bilateral tumors, tumors in a solitary or horseshoe kidney, extension of tumor thrombus in the supra-hepatic cava or heart, and extensive metastatic disease causing respiratory distress. There are mainly two advantages of this approach: accurate and early complete staging and obtaining an untreated tumor specimen that can be subjected for tissue diagnosis and other biological prognostic studies as well as the short administration schedule that may decrease the cost of treatment [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disadvantage of this approach is higher rate of surgical complications like tumor rupture and intra-operative spillage [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12-15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have applied the two protocols for children who were primary staged as stage II and III according to the CT findings. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was adopted as the first line of management in group I children which coincided with researchers who primarily stemmed their experience from the application of SIOP protocols including a period of preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery and a period of postoperative chemotherapy [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In group II, we adopted the National Wilms&#x02019; Tumor Society protocol (NWTS) with surgery as the first line of treatment followed by chemotherapeutic application [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This group has the advantage of histological confirmation of the disease as well as accurate staging during surgery. During the operation, the contralateral kidney was also explored to ensure that the disease was indeed unilateral and lymph node dissection was carried out [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We did not perform transcutaneous biopsy for any of our cases with the concept that it may complicate the treatment in accordance with the same concept in a previous study [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The study results showed that patients in group I were having a significantly less success rate as compared to those in group II. Such results were contradictory to previous published results of SIOP protocols [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] while coincided with those of NWTSG [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Tumor histology and stage are the two most significant prognostic factors for patients with WT [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In group I, the preoperative chemotherapy alters the tumor&#x02019;s histological features [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], thus making the pathologist&#x02019;s job to assign the subtype of histopathology and stage very difficult while in patients with group II, the pathologist could properly identify and stage the tumor.</p><p>Generally, children can tolerate the acute toxicities of chemotherapeutic drugs better than adults [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, they are more susceptible for delayed side effects of chemotherapy like growth problems, infertility and neuropsychological dysfunction [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the most commonly encountered complication is bone marrow depression (30%) followed by bowel obstruction (13.3%). This is in agreement with other recent studies [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, initial surgical resection remains a crucial part in treatment of stage II &#x00026; III WT patients as a short administration schedule that will reduce the cost-effectiveness of treatment especially in resource challenged settings as in our case. It can provide a local primary tumor control, accurate staging, proper histological interpretation and possibly controlling the metastatic spread. However, patient selection for surgery is an important determinant for successful outcome.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The
