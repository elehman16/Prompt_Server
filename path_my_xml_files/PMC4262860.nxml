According to the report of previous studies, the incidence of shivering was up to 56.7%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The most consequential complications of shivering are increases in oxygen consumption, lactic acidosis, carbon dioxide production and increasing the metabolic rate to more than 400%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence, it may have serious complications for patients with low cardiovascular reserve.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Furthermore, shivering may cause interference in monitoring of electrocardiogram, blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Intravenous (IV) meperidine is routinely used to treat shivering during operation and at recovery.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Previous studies showed that low-dose intrathecal fentanyl is an appropriate method to reduce the incidence and severity of shivering during spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Davoudi <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that a small dose of intrathecal meperidine was effective and safe to decrease the incidence of shivering associated with spinal anesthesia during transurethral resection of prostate.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>There were no previous studies comparing fentanyl with meperidine with this respect. Hence, this randomized double-blinded clinical trial was designed to compare the effect of intrathecal fentanyl with intrathecal meperidine for prevention of shivering in patients who underwent lower extremity orthopedic surgeries under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was performed from September 2012 through November 2013 at Kashani Teaching Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. After obtaining ethics committee approval from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and written informed consent, 90 patients with the age of 18-65 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to II, indicated for various lower limb orthopedic surgeries under spinal anesthesia, were recruited to the study. We did not include patients with thyroid disorders, Raynaud's syndrome, cardiopulmonary disorders, coagulopathies, allergy to anesthetic drugs, history of alcohol, sedative or vasoconstrictor agents&#x02019; consumption. The exclusion criteria for this study were severe hemorrhages, blood transfusion during surgery and changes in spinal anesthetic technique.</p><p>All the spinal anesthesia procedures were performed by one Anesthesiologist who was not interfered to collect information. All patients were covered with a layer of the gown on lower limb during operation and a blanket on their trunk and limbs after operation, but they were not actively warmed. Temperature of the operation room was between 21 through 23&#x000b0;C, while all fluids and drugs for IV injection kept in 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Following establishing IV access and placing the standard monitors, each patient received IV lactated Ringer's 10 ml/kg over 1&#x000bd; h that was decreased to 6 ml/kg during surgery. Then according to the standard protocol, the zone of spinal anesthesia in L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace was sterilized. The procedure was continued with a 25-gauge spinal needle in the sitting position and intrathecal injection of 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and the determined volume of the studied drugs. Patients were immediately changed back to the supine position after completing the spinal block.</p><p>We allocated the patients randomly to three groups using Random Allocation Software 2.0: Group M received 0.2 mg/kg meperidine, Group F received 20 &#x003bc;g fentanyl, and the Group S (control group) received equal volume of normal saline, each in addition to bupivacaine 0.5%. The sensory level was ascertained by maximum loss of pinprick sensation in the midline of the vertebral column every 5 min for the first 15 min and then every 15 min for 1 h.</p><p>All patients received nasal oxygen (2 L/min) continuously during operation. Noninvasive heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded every 15 min over 2 h during surgery and at 0, 15, 30, 60 min in the recovery room. Temperature of the recovery room was about 25-26&#x000b0;C.</p><p>After injection of drugs in subarachnoid space, a nurse blinded to the type of the studied drugs and anesthetic protocol, recorded shivering, central and peripheral body temperature, sedation, allergy, pruritus, HR, BP, nausea, vomiting and urinary retention. Core and peripheral temperature was measured by tympanometer and axillary thermometer, respectively.</p><p>Sedation of patients was quantified in 5 scores: 0 = fully awake; 1 = somnolent; 2 = closed eyes, opens to call; 3 = closed eyes, opens to physical stimuli; 4 = closed eyes, nonresponsive to painful stimuli.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Shivering intensity was recorded according to Tsai and Chu shivering scale: 0 = no shivering, 1 = piloerection or peripheral vasoconstriction, but no visible shivering, 2 = muscular activity in only one muscle group, 3 = shivering involving the whole body.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Shivering frequency and intensity was registered every 15 min during operation and postoperative time in the recovery room. After 15 min from beginning of spinal anesthesia, if the shivering score developed equal or more than 3, then 25 mg IV meperidine was injected. IV 0.7 mg atropine was used to treat bradycardia (HR &#x0003c; 50 bpm). Hypotension (systolic BP &#x0003c; 20% from baseline) was improved with IV bolus of 10 mg ephedrine after infusing IV Lactate Ringer's. Ephedrine and atropine dose was recorded for each group. Nausea or vomiting was treated with 10 mg metoclopramide injected as IV bolus.</p><p>Using Med Calc statistical software (version 9.2.0.1., Mariakerke, Belgium) it was determined that a sample population of 30 patients in each group would have 80% statistical power (1&#x02212;&#x003b2;) at &#x003b1; =0.05 to detect of 21% difference in the incidence between Group P or F with Group S in response to shivering treatment at a 5% significance level.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Data were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Analysis of variances was used to compare categorical scales. Ordinal scales were compared by Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test. Chi-Square test was performed for comparison of nominal scales. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Ninety patients were included to the study.

Roy <italic>et al</italic>. study showed that meperidine added to intrathecal 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine 10.5 mg for spinal anesthesia in cesarean section decreased significantly the incidence and intensity of shivering during operation but there were not statistically different in the incidence of side effects between this combination and placebo.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Our data showed that meperidine 0.2 mg/kg added to 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine decreased the incidence and intensity of intraoperative and postoperative shivering in lower limbs operations, while usage of meperidine was not preferable than fentanyl for reducing the shivering.
