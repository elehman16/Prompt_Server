Unlike traditional sodium channel blockers affecting fast inactivation, lacosamide selectively enhances sodium channel slow inactivation. This mechanism of action results in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes, inhibition of neuronal firing, and reduction in long-term channel availability without affecting physiological function. Lacosamide has a well-characterized and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, including a fast absorption rate, minimal or no interaction with cytochrome P-450 izoenzymes, and a low potential for drug&#x02013;drug interactions. Lacosamide clinical development included three placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trials conducted in more than 1300 patients, each demonstrating safety and efficacy of lacosamide compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy for adults with POS. The clinical use of lacosamide may broaden, pending results of trials evaluating its use as monotherapy for POS in adults, as treatment for epilepsy in pediatric subjects, and as adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled primary generalized tonic&#x02013;clonic seizures in those with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lacosamide</kwd><kwd>partial-onset seizures</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>antiepileptic drug</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Epilepsy is the third most common neurological disorder in the United States, with approximately 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> The term <italic>epilepsy</italic> refers to a number of different syndromes characterized by spontaneous or unprovoked disturbances in brain activity with varying characteristics, duration, and severity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Epilepsy syndromes are classified into two main categories: generalized (seizures beginning in both cerebral hemispheres) or partial (seizures initiating in one specific location).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Though much progress has been made in the diagnosis and characterization of specific seizure types within these broad categories (e.g., simple partial seizures, primarily generalized tonic&#x02013;clonic seizures), the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms resulting in seizure activity are largely unknown.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref></p><p>Treatment guidelines for newly diagnosed epilepsy vary, so there is not a standardized approach to epilepsy treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> An area of agreement for most physicians, however, is that the first pharmacotherapy in newly diagnosed patients should be a single antiepileptic drug (AED). When patients fail to achieve seizure control with AED monotherapy, physicians must decide whether additional attempts at monotherapy with other AEDs or introduction of adjunctive AEDs is the best treatment course. While the relative merits of each approach continue to be debated,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> an estimated one-third of patients are unable to achieve adequate seizure control despite the availability of dozens of AEDs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> Therefore, continued development of treatments for those living with epilepsy is a necessary and worthy endeavor.</p></sec><sec><title>History of lacosamide development</title><p>The anticonvulsant properties of lacosamide were characterized by the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP). On the basis of these screening results, lacosamide was identified as a promising clinical candidate,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and in 2000, Schwarz Pharma (Monnheim, Germany) and Harris FRC Corporation partnered in the preclinical and clinical development of lacosamide. It was first approved for clinical use in 2008; of note, the availability of multiple lacosamide formulations (oral tablets, syrup, and intravenous (IV) infusion) is distinctive among the AEDs and allows flexibility of administration. UCB Pharma acquired Schwarz Pharma in 2007, and following its approval, lacosamide has been marketed by UCB Pharma or its partners under the brand name VIMPAT&#x000ae;.</p><p>The drug discovery process for lacosamide was a combined effort from academia, government agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry. In 1973, Dr. Harold Kohn (an academic chemist now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) joined the Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston. Dr. Kohn's original scientific interest was in understanding the mechanism of action of biotin, a low molecular weight coenzyme necessary for biological carbon dioxide transfer reactions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> Biotin contains an embedded imidazolidone group, which is a structural unit similar to that found in several AEDs. The potential benefit to drug function through targeted manipulation of chemical structure prompted Kohn to catalog new chemical entities with proven activities in anticonvulsant screens and ultimately led him to propose a novel structural motif (pharmacophore) common in some of these active central nervous system&#x02013;acting agents. Kohn hypothesized that upon incorporation of this pharmacophore into a new class of compounds, termed functionalized amino acids, a candidate molecule could be synthesized possessing structural specificity along with a favorable anticonvulsant profile. Kohn <italic>et al</italic>. synthesized approximately 250 derivatives of the molecule now known as lacosamide. Lacosamide has a molecular weight of 250.3 Da, and the <italic>R(+)</italic> enantiomer is the active form of the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Lacosamide: nonclinical development</title><p>Lacosamide demonstrated antiepileptic effectiveness in different rodent seizure models and antinociceptive potential in experimental animal models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Preclinical electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that lacosamide targets voltage-gated sodium channels and acts by specifically enhancing slow inactivation without affecting fast inactivation of the channel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Initial preclinical investigations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> suggested that lacosamide might have an additional mode of action by binding to the collapsin response&#x02013;mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2). However, in a recent publication, Wolff <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that there is currently no experimental evidence to support direct binding between lacosamide and CRMP-2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> Lacosamide was also evaluated in a comprehensive preclinical toxicology and pharmacology program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. These studies found lacosamide to be well tolerated; either no or only minor side effects were observed in safety studies involving the central nervous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal systems, and in three animal models there was no indication of abuse liability. Long-term, repeated-dose toxicity studies demonstrated that after either IV or oral lacosamide administration, adverse events were reversible and consisted mostly of exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects on the central nervous system. No genotoxic or carcinogenic effects were observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and lacosamide showed a favorable profile in reproductive and developmental animal studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of action: a new way to target sodium channels</title><p>It is well established that voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for generating action potentials and are therefore intimately involved in controlling neuronal excitability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> In epilepsy, aberrant and repetitive neuronal firing leads to the generation of seizures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> The excitability of the brain depends on the number of sodium channels available for activation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Two mechanisms regulate the proportion of sodium channels available for activation: fast inactivation (occurring on a millisecond time scale) and slow inactivation (occurring within seconds or minutes). Slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels is induced by sustained membrane depolarization due to repeated neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> like that involved in epilepsy.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mechanism of action of lacosamide, classical anticonvulsants, and local anesthetics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nyas1291-0056-f1"/></fig><p>Lacosamide was the first AED described to selectively enhance sodium channel slow inactivation, a mechanism of action distinct from traditional sodium channel&#x02013;blocking AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine), which predominantly affect fast inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Errington <italic>et al</italic>. showed that at clinically relevant concentrations, lacosamide inhibits repetitive fir-ing of neurons characteristic of epilepsy through selective enhancement of sodium channel slow inactivation.

Steady-state concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice-daily (bid) dosing. Lacosamide is eliminated primarily by renal excretion and biotransformation. Importantly, studies have confirmed that IV lacosamide is bioequivalent to the oral tablet when infused over 30 or 60 minutes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> In addition, studies have confirmed the bioequivalence of syrup and tablet formulations of 200 mg/day lacosamide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref></p><p>Given the low protein binding and minimal cytochrome P450 interactions demonstrated by lacosamide, the risk for drug&#x02013;drug interaction is low.

In each trial, enrolled patients were required to have had an average of &#x02265; four partial-onset seizures per 28 days with or without secondary generalization, despite a stable regimen of one to three concomitant AEDs (one to two in SP667). Following an 8-week baseline phase, a 4- (SP755) or 6-week (SP667 and SP754) titration period initiated with either placebo or lacosamide 100 mg/day and continued with 100-mg/day weekly increments. Patients randomized to lacosamide 200 mg/day received placebo during the first two (SP755) or four (SP667) weeks of titration. Patients randomized to lacosamide 400 mg/day received placebo for 2 weeks in SP667. One back-titration of 100 mg/day was allowed at the end of titration in cases of intolerable adverse events.

While the authors proposed that this suggests a potential for improved tolerability, it was also noted that the population size of the nonsodium channel&#x02013;blocking group was too small to draw definitive conclusions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref></p><p>Others have published small case series and retrospective studies also identifying potential differences in tolerability with lacosamide based on the mechanism of action of concomitant AEDs, though variation in how treatment groups were defined based on the mechanism of action complicates the ability to compare findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> Regardless, without properly controlled, prospective studies to directly address the potential for differential outcome with lacosamide in combination with individual AEDs, it is not possible to make definitive comparative statements on treatment combinations with lacosamide.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 10 lacosamide randomized controlled trials in various indications was performed by Zaccara <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> In this analysis, the risk of experiencing an adverse event significantly differed between lacosamide and placebo groups for the following adverse events: dizziness at 200 mg/day; dizziness, vertigo, abnormal coordination, abnormal vision, nausea, and vomiting at 400 mg/day; and dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, balance disorder, diplopia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and tremor at 600 mg/day. Furthermore, although no formal cognitive testing was performed in the randomized controlled trials, lacosamide was not associated with any adverse event obviously related to cognition in this analysis. The authors also noted that the analyses indicate that the tolerability profile of lacosamide is dose dependent. Applicability of these findings to routine clinical practice is limited by a number of factors, including the heterogeneous populations from the studies used, which evaluated outcome as adjunctive therapy in patients with partial-onset seizures or as monotherapy in patients with neuropathic pain, migraine, fibromyalgia, or knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Long-term studies</title><p>Three long-term, open-label studies that were extensions of the original phase II/III lacosamide studies have been completed (SP615 (exposure up to 8 years),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> SP756 (exposure up to 5 years),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and SP774 (exposure up to 5.5 years)).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> For all of these trials, the primary objective was an evaluation of safety and tolerability, and in each trial, lacosamide doses up to 800 mg/day and changes in concomitant AEDs were allowed.</p><p>In the three open-label trials combined, 1054 patients were treated with lacosamide. Of these, 75%, 53%, and 18% of patients were exposed to open-label lacosamide for &#x0003e;1, &#x0003e;3, and &#x0003e;5 years, respectively, with a median modal dose of lacosamide 400 mg/day. The most common TEAEs were dizziness (37.2%), headache, (18.8%), nasopharyngitis (15.75), and diplopia (15.4%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. An additional long-term study (SP926) was an open-label extension of an IV loading dose trial (SP925). As observed with the other long-term studies, no new safety concerns were identified in SP926, which included treatment with oral lacosamide (100&#x02013;800 mg/day) for up to 2 years. Overall, safety outcomes with lacosamide observed in long-term extension trials are similar to those reported in the short-term trials and indicate a favorable long-term tolerability profile for lacosamide.</p></sec><sec><title>IV lacosamide</title><p>The availability of an IV formulation represents an important advantage of lacosamide relative to many other AEDs. The IV formulation is compatible with a number of other solutions, including saline, dextrose, and lactated Ringer's solutions, and has a demonstrated bioequivalence to the oral formulation with no need for dose adjustment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> The safety and tolerability of IV lacosamide were initially evaluated in two studies (SP616,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> SP757<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Study SP616 (double-dummy, randomized inpatient trial) evaluated safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide (200&#x02013;600 mg/day) administered as 60- or 30-min twice-daily infusions as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with POS. TEAEs were reported in 16/60 patients and included dizziness, headache, back pain, somnolence, and injection-site pain. All were considered mild or moderate in intensity. The tolerability profile of IV lacosamide in this trial was consistent with that observed with oral lacosamide. Study SP757 evaluated IV lacosamide (200&#x02013;800 mg/day) at 10-, 15-, and 30-min infusion rates. No increases in frequency or severity of AEs were observed with shorter infusion duration or increased days of exposure, supporting the safety of a 15-min infusion duration for temporary replacement of oral lacosamide.</p><p>A recent study, SP925<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> (open-label, multicenter cohort trial), evaluated safety and tolerability of adjunctive lacosamide IV loading dose in lacosamide-naive patients with POS. An IV lacosamide loading dose (200, 300, or 400 mg) was administered over 15 min, followed 12 h later by initiation of oral dosing consisting of half of the loading dose administered twice daily for 6.5 days. All 100 patients enrolled in the trial completed IV lacosamide infusion, supporting the feasibility of rapid initiation. IV loading doses of 200 and 300 mg lacosamide were better tolerated than the 400-mg dose. Most TEAEs occurred within 4 h of infusion start and are reasonably attributed to the rapidity of infusion or dose. Most commonly reported TEAEs were typical for neuroactive drugs and AEDs in particular. Seven patients discontinued prematurely due to TEAEs. In general, the types of TEAEs leading to discontinuation were similar regardless of the time of onset and were consistent with the most frequently reported TEAEs for the whole trial population. Evaluation of changes in laboratory, electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital sign values following IV loading and oral maintenance lacosamide were consistent with the known oral and intravenous safety profile.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Approval and clinical use</title><p>On the basis of the three randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb/III trials in adults with POS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> lacosamide was first approved in 2008 (by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of POS in adults (aged &#x02265;17 years in the United States and &#x02265;16 years in Europe).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> The lacosamide solution for infusion is also approved as an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></p><p>The recommended starting dose of lacosamide is 50 mg twice/day, which should be increased after 1 week to an initial therapeutic dose of 100 mg twice/day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 50 mg twice/day every week to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg twice/day).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> Lacosamide may be taken with or without food.

Lacosamide is associated with an ease of use given its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, lack of drug&#x02013;drug interactions, and availability in multiple formulations (tablet, syrup, and IV). It has been extensively studied and has established efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of POS. The effectiveness of lacosamide in POS supports a role for the proposed mechanism of action involving the modulation of slow inactivation of sodium channels as a therapeutic target in epilepsy and could lead to the development of additional treatment options for patients with this condition.</p><p>UCB Pharma continues efforts to support the availability of lacosamide to patients worldwide. Also, the clinical utility of lacosamide may broaden depending on the results of additional clinical trials evaluating its safety and efficacy as a monotherapy for POS in adults, adjunctive therapy for epilepsy in pediatric subjects, and as adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled primary generalized tonic&#x02013;clonic seizures in those with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Writing and editorial support was provided by Jennifer Hepker, Ph.D. of PMCG in Chicago, IL and funded by UCB.
