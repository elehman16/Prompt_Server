The pharmacokinetics and safety of BCQB in animals have been established in preclinical studies. However, no clinical pharmacokinetic data are available for BCQB in humans.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> The aim of this first-in-human study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of BCQB following single and multiple intranasal doses in healthy Chinese subjects.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The clinical trial was comprised of the following four studies: (i) an open-label, single-dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects after intranasal doses of BCQB ranging from 45 to 450 mg (total of six doses); (ii) an open-label, multiple-dose escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects after intranasal administration with 120 and 150 mg doses of BCQB (360 and 450 &#x003bc;g/day) administered three times daily for 15 days; (iii) a randomized, open-label and parallel-group design to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of BCQB after intranasal dosing (45, 90, and 180 &#x003bc;g); and (iv) ten subjects received 120 &#x003bc;g of BCQB by intranasal administration, three times daily for 5 days with a final single dose on day 7 to assess its multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. Safety and tolerability of BCQB were evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs), ECG recordings, vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters. The pharmacokinetic parameters for BCQB were calculated by software using noncompartmental methods.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All AEs were mild, of limited duration and no more frequent at higher doses. There was no serious adverse event, death or withdrawal. No clinically significant change was noted in clinical laboratory parameters, cardiac parameters or vital signs. Following single intranasal dosing, BCQB was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximum concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) of 8 minutes for 45, 90, and 180 mg dose groups; the plasma concentration of BCQB decreased in a biphasic manner with the mean half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 8.5 hours; the maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of BCQB increased linearly across the examined dose range of 45&#x02013;180 &#x003bc;g. During the multiple dosing, the steady state was achieved within 3 days of 120 &#x003bc;g three times daily dosing of BCQB. A slightly greater AUC was observed after 5 days of multiple dosing, with the mean accumulation ratio of 1.26; however, the half-life was unchanged.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> BCQB was safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects when administered intranasally with single and multiple doses across the doses studied. The mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC increased proportionally to the studied doses, and the steady state was achieved within 3 days after three times daily dosing. A slight accumulation of BCQB following multiple dosing was observed. The pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability profiles of BCQB pose it as a good candidate for further development in the treatment of rhinorrhea in rhinitis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bencycloquidium bromide, 3&#x02212;(2-cyclopentyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenyl) ethoxy&#x02212;1-methyl&#x02212;1-azabicyclo [2, 2, 2] octane bromide (BCQB, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>), is a novel selective muscarinic M1/M3 receptor antagonist for the treatment of rhinorrhea in rhinitis by intranasal administration. Rhinitis, an inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane, is one of the most common diseases, and is estimated to affect 10&#x02013;40% of the global population with increasing prevalence in both children and adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Currently, ipratropium bromide (IB) is the only muscarinic antagonist in clinical use for the treatment of rhinorrhea in rhinitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] However, the anticholinergic effect of IB is short-acting, and IB is less selective among the M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Recently, long-term use of inhaled IB has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] which may be related to its action on the muscarinic M2 receptor in the heart. Given the high prevalence of rhinitis and the undesirable safety profile of IB, the development of additional options is clearly warranted. Many studies have shown that intranasal BCQB has good efficacy in the treatment of rhinitis especially rhinorrhea in preclinical studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Additionally, BCQB displayed a better safety profile than IB due to its high selectivity for the M1 and M3 receptors over the M2 receptor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] As a result, M2 cardiac receptors are spared thereby reducing the risks of cardiovascular adverse events.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Preclinical toxicity studies also showed no apparent change in the ECG or heart rate in dogs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Our recent phase II clinical trial in China showed that intranasal administration of BCQB was effective in reducing rhinorrhea with few side effects. Preclinical studies described the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, excretion and metabolism of BCQB after intranasal dosing in rats[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or beagle dogs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] However, no data are available on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of BCQB in humans. Therefore, as a first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial, this study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BCQB after single and multiple intranasal doses in healthy Chinese subjects.</p><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structure of bencycloquidium bromide.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40268_2012_12010017_Fig1" id="MO1"/></fig></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The FIH clinical trial was performed at a single center (First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University) in Nanjing, China.

There was no trend for increasing AEs with increasing doses over the dose range evaluated.</p><fig id="Tab5"><label>Table V</label><caption><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in two or more subjects (safety population, n = 58)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40268_2012_12010017_Tab5" id="MO9"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>At present, the anticholinergic medications used in the treatment of airway diseases are not selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] The novel selective muscarinic M1/M3 receptor antagonists, such as aclidinium bromide[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and penehyclidine hydrochloride,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] are under development for the therapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while the novel agents under development for the treatment of rhinorrhea in rhinitis are limited. BCQB is under development not only for the treatment of rhinorrhea in rhinitis but also for the therapy of COPD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] The aerosol with quantitative inhalation of bencycloquidium bromide[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] is under development.</p><p>The objective of this FIH study was to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability after single and multiple intranasal doses of BCQB in healthy Chinese subjects. Following single intranasal doses in healthy Chinese adult subjects, BCQB was rapidly absorbed, the plasma concentration of BCQB decreased in a biphasic manner, the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of BCQB increased in proportion to the studied doses, and the mean t<sub>1/2</sub> and the mean CL/F were independent of the administered doses. The mean t<sub>1/2</sub> of the studied dose groups ranged from 7.4 to 10.7 hours. The small difference of t<sub>1/2</sub> observed was due to assay limitations in the determination of the BCQB concentration in the terminal phase of the concentration-time curve, where plasma concentrations of BCQB at sampling times in the latter part of the concentration-time curve were below the LLOQ (5 pg/mL) for many subjects, particularly at lower doses (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). However, no statistical significance (p &#x0003e; 0.05) in t<sub>1/2</sub> was found among the studied dose groups. The duration of action of 50% of BCQB (t<sub>1/2</sub>, off-set) in classical bioassays was approximately 3 hours,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] which was shorter than the terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> of BCQB in plasma. It may be due to the fact that the terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> in plasma is reflective of the rate of drug elimination from the body but not reflective of the duration of drug action.</p><p>In the multiple-dose study, the steady-state concentration was achieved within 3 days of consecutive dosing and the pharmacokinetic parameters of BCQB were similar to those following single dose except AUC. A slight accumulation was noted with the mean R<sub>ac</sub> of 1.26 based on AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>, but the slight accumulation resulted in sustained plasma exposure upon daily dosing. A high DF for BCQB concentration in plasma was observed, for the concentrations of BCQB in plasma declined rapidly from t<sub>max</sub> to &#x003c4;.</p><p>Wide inter-subject variability in pharmacokinetic parameters was reflected in their SD (<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="fig">tables III and IV</xref>), but the reasons were not clear. There are several factors that can lead to the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters. First, although physicians administered BCQB carefully according to the SOPs, the intranasal administration process may cause variability. For example, while intranasal doses were administered to the lateral nasal wall, the influence of factors (such as posture, position of the head, and nasal mucosal blood flow) could increase the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters. Second, the presence of nasal mucosal physiology and pathology is another potential source of variability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] For example, hyperemia would be expected to influence drug absorption after intranasal application, for the hyperemia can change the penetration of nasal mucosa, which may influence drug absorption. Third, only ten subjects had been studied for the pharmacokinetic profile in each group and the variability in one or more individual would affect the overall results greatly. Future clinical studies should also seek to identify the factors responsible for variability in intranasal dose delivery, deposition and mucosa absorption in order to optimize the safety profile of BCQB that could often be required for long-term therapy.</p><p>In this FIH study, repeated administration of BCQB did not lead to any cardiovascular adverse event in healthy subjects, consistent with previously published results in animals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] However, future investigations to evaluate the effect of long-term doses of BCQB on the nasal mucosa, ECG and heart rate are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>BCQB was safe and well tolerated in this FIH study. No SAEs occurred, no change of ECG and heart rate was observed, and all subjects were in good compliance. The mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of BCQB were proportional to the studied doses, and the steady state was achieved within 3 days. A slight accumulation following 5 days of 120 &#x003bc;g three times daily dosing of BCQB was observed, but the elimination rate showed no change. On the basis of this study in healthy subjects, BCQB is worthy of further investigation for treating rhinorrhea in rhinitis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was sponsored by Beijing Shiqiao Biological and Pharmaceutical Co.
