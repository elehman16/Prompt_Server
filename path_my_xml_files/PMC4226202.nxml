Current clinical feeding evaluations performed by speech pathologists have poor reliability in detecting OPA when compared to radiological procedures such as the modified barium swallow (MBS). Improved ability to diagnose OPA accurately via clinical evaluation potentially reduces reliance on expensive, less readily available radiological procedures. Our study investigates the utility of adding cervical auscultation (CA), a technique of listening to swallowing sounds, in improving the diagnostic accuracy of a clinical evaluation for the detection of OPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We plan an open, unblinded, randomised controlled trial at a paediatric tertiary teaching hospital. Two hundred and sixteen children fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomised to one of the two clinical assessment techniques for the clinical detection of OPA: (1) clinical feeding evaluation only (CFE) group or (2) clinical feeding evaluation with cervical auscultation (CFE + CA) group. All children will then undergo an MBS to determine radiologically assessed OPA. The primary outcome is the presence or absence of OPA, as determined on MBS using the Penetration-Aspiration Scale. Our main objective is to determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of &#x02018;CFE + CA&#x02019; versus &#x02018;CFE&#x02019; only compared to MBS-identified OPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Early detection and appropriate management of OPA is important to prevent chronic pulmonary disease and poor growth in children. As the reliability of CFE to detect OPA is low, a technique that can improve the diagnostic accuracy of the CFE will help minimise consequences to the paediatric respiratory system. Cervical auscultation is a technique that has previously been documented as a clinical adjunct to the CFE; however, no published RCTs addressing the reliability of this technique in children exist. Our study will be the first to establish the utility of CA in assessing and diagnosing OPA risk in young children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR) number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=364291">ACTRN12613000589785</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Paediatric dysphagia</kwd><kwd>Cervical auscultation</kwd><kwd>Assessment</kwd><kwd>Oropharyngeal aspiration</kwd><kwd>Sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Specificity</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Feeding difficulties in children encompass a wide spectrum including delayed feeding skills development, disordered sensory processing, preferences for a limited range of food types or textures, aversive feeding behaviours resulting in food refusal and/or difficulty with swallowing (oropharyngeal dysphagia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is the term used to define dysphagia involving the oral and/or pharyngeal phases of swallowing. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is clinically important in children as its consequences may include inadequate nutritional intake, dehydration and oropharyngeal aspiration (OPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. OPA is defined as the entry of fluids, food particles and/or oral secretions into the airway below the level of the true vocal cords [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. OPA is associated with acute respiratory sequelae such as apnea, tachypnea and pneumonia and chronic sequelae such as chronic cough and bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, early detection and appropriate management of OPA is important to prevent chronic pulmonary disease and poor growth in children.</p><p>Proving the diagnosis of recurrent OPA as the reason for persistent or chronic respiratory systems remains elusive in respiratory medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The first step in evaluating a child for oropharyngeal dysphagia is often a clinical feeding examination (CFE) conducted by a speech pathologist. It is subjective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] but inexpensive, non-invasive, time efficient and repeatable. The CFE involves a case history and mealtime observations of the child&#x02019;s oral sensorimotor, feeding and swallowing skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the examination only provides an estimation of the co-ordination and movement of food/fluids through the pharyngeal phase. This is determined through visual observation of laryngeal movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], palpation of laryngeal movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and listening to clinical features (e.g. cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], wet voice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], choking, voice change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In particular, clinical features such as wet voice and wet breathing have been significantly associated with OPA detected on MBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In children, high sensitivity (92%) on fluids but low sensitivity (33%) on solids for the detection of OPA via CFE has been documented in comparison to MBS findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similarly, the CFE in adults is limited by low sensitivity and specificity values for the identification of OPA when compared with MBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This limitation to the accurate identification and assessment of OPA means many children require further objective assessment, such as a MBS or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), to more accurately detect and identify OPA on a variety of food textures and fluid consistencies.</p><p>MBS and FEES have comparable sensitivities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and reliably detects OPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], especially when the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, both procedures are usually limited to specialist paediatric tertiary centres, are expensive, and require the expertise of a paediatric speech pathologist and radiologist or an otolaryngologist. These may not be readily available because of scheduling requirements of personnel, suites and equipment. Furthermore, MBS involves radiation although at acceptable levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>To improve the diagnostic accuracy of the CFE for detecting OPA, several approaches to the examination have been studied. These include combining the CFE with water swallow challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], trial swallows using different viscosities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], pulse oximetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and using cervical auscultation (CA). CA is a portable, non-invasive technique that uses a stethoscope to detect cervical sounds generated during the swallow and breath sounds pre- and post-swallow. It is based on the premise that fluid flow through the upper oesophageal sphincter can be heard by listening to the cervical neck region. Higher OPA agreement between CFE + CA (76%), rather than CFE only (42%), when compared to MBS results have been reported in separate adult studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Further, unpublished data titled &#x0201c;Impact of cervical auscultation on accuracy of clinical evaluation in predicting penetration/aspiration in a paediatric population&#x0201d; by Eicher et al. presented at a CA workshop in Virginia (1994) compared CFE (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and CFE + CA (<italic>n</italic> = 41) with MBS findings in 56 children (aged 1&#x02013;312&#x000a0;months) and found that CFE + CA had a higher agreement with MBS results than CFE only (83% vs. 76%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. CFE + CA had 89% sensitivity and 83% specificity in detecting OPA/penetration compared to MBS. Other adult studies on CA used to accurately identify OPA have described sensitivities of 62-94% and specificities of 66-70% when compared to MBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Current studies documenting the validity of CA in conjunction with the CFE are limited to the adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and have methodological limitations such as small subject numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], observational study designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], clinician bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], selection bias with large age differences between comparative groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and undefined abnormal swallowing sound parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. As such, there are no randomised controlled trials that have examined the utility of CA in adults and children. Hence, a better understanding of the diagnostic value of this technique for improving OPA detection is required before it can be used routinely in the clinical setting.</p><sec><title>Aims of the study</title><p>Our study investigates the utility of cervical auscultation (CA) in the assessment and diagnosis of OPA in children. The primary aim is to determine whether the CFE combined with CA increases the detection of OPA determined by MBS, compared to the CFE only. We hypothesise that the use of CA (compared to not using CA) as an adjunctive clinical tool to assess oropharyngeal dysphagia improves the detection of OPA in children as assessed with the current gold standard, MBS.</p><p>Our secondary aim is to determine the perceptual characteristics of common typical respiratory and swallow sound patterns and/or descriptors pre- and post-swallow in children with OPA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Open, randomised controlled study.

Children can only participate for one series of evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>The parents/guardians of eligible children will be initially approached by the clinical speech pathologist responsible for the child&#x02019;s assessment. Parents/guardians interested in participating will then be referred to the principle investigator (TTF). The study will be explained using written information statements and face-to-face interviews. Written informed consent will be obtained from the parents/guardians of children enrolled. Written informed assent will also be obtained from young people aged 12&#x000a0;years and over.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>A computer-generated simple randomisation list, stratified by age (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;year or &#x02265;1&#x000a0;year), was produced by an external statistician. Allocation concealment will be maintained by group allocation (i.e. CFE or CFE + CA) being concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes until after consent and baseline information has been obtained. The envelope is opened in front of the treating speech pathologist and caregiver prior to the commencement of their feeding examination.</p><p>We stratified by age because swallowing function is influenced by age. The cutoff of 12&#x000a0;months was chosen based on two factors: (1) the swallow-respiration pattern changes at 1&#x000a0;week and between 6 to 12&#x000a0;months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; (2) anatomical maturity that occurs at approximately 12&#x000a0;months that impacts on a child&#x02019;s ability to feed more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These maturity factors include fusion of the mandible halving to improve jaw grading ability, fat pads reducing to increase the oral cavity size and the position of the trachea being more vertical in toddlers than infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>We plan a sample size of 216 children based on previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] in which the sensitivity of CFE for OPA was 76%. Having 108 children per group provides 80% power (two-sided &#x003b1; = 0.05) to detect a 15% difference between the two groups. A smaller difference between groups was considered insufficient to influence clinical practice. Allowing for 8% attrition (due to unlikely loss to follow-up with both time points at close proximity to each other), a total of 233 children will be enrolled.</p></sec><sec><title>Standardisation of speech pathologists performing CFE + CA</title><p>Prior to the commencement of the study, all speech pathologists involved in the assessment of participants will be asked to read through and familiarise themselves with a folder containing a (1) swallowing sound definition sheet; (2) a compact disc (CD) of ten audio examples of normal swallows of puree, lumpy mash, biscuit (chewable) and thin fluids (bottle and cup) in children and one adult; (3) a sheet containing website links to respiratory sound examples of wheeze, stridor, crackles and normal breathing in children; (4) the data collection form. This training package was provided to help attune the clinician&#x02019;s perception of swallowing sounds and definitions prior to their involvement in the study. The swallowing sounds definition sheet is in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Inter-rater reliability</title><p>Inter-rater reliability for the detection of OPA will be determined on 20 swallowing sounds scored independently by four speech pathologists who have familarised themselves with the training package, as outlined above. Intra-rater reliability will also be determined for these same 20 sounds. Three swallowing sound clips of swallows from healthy children (with no oropharyngeal aspiration/penetration), four sound clips of abnormal swallows (from patients with radiologically defined oropharyngeal aspiration) and three sound clips of abnormal swallows (from patients with radiologically defined penetration) will be recorded onto a CD twice in random order based on a computer-generated randomisation list, giving a total of 20 examples.</p><p>Good to very good intra-rater reliability kappa scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] will be accepted for continued involvement in the study. Speech pathologists who do not meet this criterion will receive specific training with the researcher to discuss perceptual characteristics of normal and OPA identified swallows, as confirmed on MBS.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure and equipment</title><sec><title>Clinical feeding examination with cervical auscultation (CFE + CA)</title><p>Standardised procedures and data collection will be undertaken. Children may be fed by their caregiver, treating speech pathologist or nurse, depending on the child&#x02019;s preference and/or medical needs.</p><p>Swallowing sounds are recorded using an omnidirectional condenser microphone with sensitivity at 1&#x000a0;kHz of 10&#x000a0;mV/Pa, impedance 200 and frequency range 20 to 20,000&#x000a0;Hz (Model C417, AKG Acoustics, Vienna, Austria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The microphone is attached (by tape) on the lateral border of trachea, immediately inferior to the cricoid cartilage, by the principal researcher only for consistency. Recordings of swallow sounds will be digitally recorded (Digital H4n Handy Recorder, Zoom Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Nasal airflow direction will be measured by an infant- or paediatric-sized cannula placed at the entrance of each nostril and secured firmly behind the ears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The quality of sound is monitored consistently throughout the session by listening to extraneous noises (e.g. carotid artery, room noises, reduction of skin-to-skin contact). The researcher or clinician monitors the sound quality and adjustments are made where necessary. To confirm the onset of a swallow, a digital video recorder (model DCR-DVD605E, Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan) will be used to provide visuals of laryngeal movement associated with the swallow. Nasal airflow data and visuals of the child&#x02019;s performance will be simultaneously recorded onto the Digital Swallowing Workstation (KayPENTAX, PENTAX Medical Co., NJ, USA). A vocal signal will be used at the beginning of all assessments so synchronisation of acoustic, nasal airflow and visual data can be undertaken. The treating speech pathologist will wear headphones (Model ATH-M50, Audio-Technica, Taiwan) to access the recorded swallowing sounds during the assessment.</p><p>Children will be offered three bites or sips/mouthfuls of each age-appropriate food/fluid item (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) followed by free eating/drinking to finish the test meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Standard presentation of food and fluids during CFE, CFE</bold> + <bold>CA or MBS</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Age</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Food and fluid</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom">4 &#x02013; 6&#x000a0;months<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Puree<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Thin fluids via breast or bottle feeding<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="left" valign="bottom">8 &#x02013; 12&#x000a0;months<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Puree<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Lumpy mash<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Thin fluids via breast, bottle or spout cup<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" align="left">1 &#x02013; 18&#x000a0;years</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Puree<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Lumpy mash<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x025cf; Chewable solids (biscuit)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x025cf; Thin fluids via breast, bottle or open cup</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Three bites or sips of food or fluid are consistent with normative data obtained previously in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and allow for variations in normal swallowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

OPA, if left unmanaged, may result in substantial acute and chronic respiratory morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Current diagnostic techniques are limited by accessibility and cost. CA is a tool that potentially improves the clinical assessment of children with oropharyngeal dysphagia at risk of OPA, particularly in regions where MBS is not readily available. This unique study will therefore inform the clinical care and management of children with oropharyngeal dysphagia.</p><p>Using CA is dependent on sound differentiation. The link between perceptual and acoustic sound parameters to differentiate between normal and abnormal swallow sounds has been described in three studies that used different parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Rommel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] collected perceptual and acoustic swallow parameters on 17 healthy children and 9 children with OPA. They defined perceptual swallowing parameters as &#x0201c;abnormal&#x0201d; (flushing sound of liquid heard prior to swallow, coughing or throat clearing after the swallow and/or laryngeal stridor) or &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; (clear breath sounds heard after the swallow during post-swallow inspiration or expiration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Statistically significant differences in acoustic parameters of peak amplitude (ranges 16, 25) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and relative amplitude fundamental frequency (means &#x02212;11, -16) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) data between normal and abnormal perceptual swallow sounds were reported. However, the study had several limitations including a small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 26), poor matching between groups (children were not age-matched, which is important as age influences swallowing function), and limited data on different viscosities and textures with only thin fluids data reported. Further data on acoustic and perceptual parameters of swallowing on a variety of food and fluid consistencies are required to see if this result is generalisable to other consistencies, apart from thin fluids.</p><p>Vice et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] described different sound types in swallowing on a study that evaluated six healthy newborn (within the first 2&#x000a0;days post delivery) infants. They found that the initial discrete sound (IDS) heard at the beginning of the bolus transit sound (BTS) became more uniform with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Swallow sounds were recorded using an accelerometer and subsequently transferred on to a signal file manager. From these files, waveforms of the swallow sound against time (seconds) and amplitude (volts) were obtained. The IDS was consistently objectively identified from the swallow waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Study limitations included a small sample size and unclear definitions. In another study, accelerometer recorded swallow sounds, which were converted to waveforms via a signal file manager, demonstrated waveform shape differences on initial discrete sounds between pre-term infants with and without chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The shape of the waveform or &#x0201c;variance index&#x0201d; in infants with CNLD was significantly different from that in infants without CNLD.</p><p>Despite the limitations of the three studies above, they provided proof of concept. Perceptual parameters of swallowing sounds can be linked to objective acoustic data in infants and young children and a differentiation between normal and abnormal swallows is possible perceptually and acoustically. Our study has therefore been designed to build upon previous CA research and addresses the limitations of those studies.</p><p>Limitations of this study protocol include variability in clinical assessment given the number of clinicians conducting a clinical feeding examination and delayed scheduling of the MBS following the clinical feeding examination (within a 2-week timeframe). To minimise clinician variability in assessment of swallowing sounds, all clinicians will be required to familiarise themselves with a folder that contains definitions and clip examples of swallow and breath sounds and the data collection booklet. Inter- and intra-rater reliability on the detection of OPA and perceptual swallow sound parameters will also be determined during the course of this study. As with most clinical research studies, scheduling of the MBS post clinical feeding examination is dependent on clinical constraints and staffing, which is difficult to address in a clinical care setting. We acknowledge that using swallowing performance data from one time point to another time point 24&#x000a0;hours to 2&#x000a0;weeks later may have an impact on final results. To reduce this possibility, we are collecting data on time period between clinical feeding examination and MBS. Statistical analysis using interaction models will incorporate this information to determine its potential influence on our findings.</p><p>In conclusion, our randomised controlled trial will establish the utility of CA in assessing and diagnosing OPA risk in young children. CA has the potential to identify OPA earlier and minimise the serious consequences on the paediatric respiratory system. If CA improves the diagnostic accuracy of CFE, this will markedly improve the diagnostic abilities of clinicians. It may minimise the need for invasive procedures (e.g., MBS) and tertiary facility assessment of oropharyngeal dysphagia. It may therefore have a substantial impact on both health care costs and service delivery. Particularly in the rural and remote areas, not having to rely on tertiary services will have a positive impact on children and their families in these regions. It is anticipated that this research will influence future clinical practice in the assessment of OPA in children through the inclusion or non-inclusion of CA in routine clinical feeding examinations in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment commenced in October 2012 and will continue for a planned 2-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANZCTR: Australia &#x00026; New Zealand Clinical Trials Register; BTS: Bolus transit sound; CA: Cervical auscultation; CFE: Clinical feeding evaluation; CNLD: Chronic neonatal lung disease; IDS: Initial discrete sound; MBS: Modified barium swallow; NPV: Negative predictor value; OPA: Oropharyngeal aspiration; PPV: Positive predictor value.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing.</p></sec><sec><title>Author&#x02019;s contributions</title><p>TF contributed to the study design and protocol; recruited and collected participant data; and drafted the manuscript.
