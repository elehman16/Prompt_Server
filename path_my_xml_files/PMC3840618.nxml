Persons undergoing rehabilitation often have difficulties transferring the learned health behaviors into their daily routine after returning home and maybe to work. This includes physical activity as well as fruit and vegetable consumption. Computer-based tailored interventions have been shown to be effective in increasing physical activity as well as fruit and vegetable consumption. The aim of this study is, to support people in transferring these two learned behavior changes and their antecedents into their daily life after cardiac rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study will have a randomized controlled design and will be conducted among German and Dutch people who participated in cardiac rehabilitation. The study will consist of one intervention group which will be compared to a waiting list control group. During the eight week duration of the intervention, participants will be invited to participate in the online after-care program once per week. The intervention encourages participants to define individual health behavior goals as well as action, and coping plans to reach these self-determined goals. The effectiveness of the program will be compared between the intervention condition and the control group in terms of behavior change, antecedents of behavior change (e.g., self-efficacy), ability to return to work and increased well-being. Further, subgroup-differences will be assessed including differences between the two countries, socioeconomic inequalities and across age groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study will make a contribution to understanding how such an online-based tailored interventions enables study participants to adopt and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Implications can include how such an online program could enrich cardiac rehabilitation aftercare further.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>NTR 3706, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01909349">NCT01909349</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiac rehabilitation aftercare</kwd><kwd>Physical exercise</kwd><kwd>Fruit and vegetable consumption</kwd><kwd>Multiple behavior changes</kwd><kwd>Internet based intervention</kwd><kwd>Tailored feedback</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular diseases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major health problem in western countries and cause approximately 30% of the global deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and 48% of the deaths in the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Medical cardiac rehabilitation is a multifaceted approach to improve social, mental and physical recovery from any cardiac event. This rehabilitation aims at preventing future events by reducing CVD risk behaviors such as insufficient physical activity and unhealthy nutrition patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Regular physical activity and healthy nutrition habits are important components within rehabilitation treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as these lifestyle changes reduce mortality and morbidity in CVD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity has a wide range of beneficial effects and has been proven to be protective against several diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As a result of regular physical activity patients in rehabilitation gain a better physical condition, muscle strength and report a reduction of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Studies also reveal that CVD patients have reduced mortality and morbidity if they improve their physical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, maintenance of physical activity is associated with a 45% risk reduction for subsequent CVDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The benefits of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables have been extensively studied and revealed that it reduces the risk of future cardiovascular issues and lowers CVD mortality by approximately 27% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, fruit and vegetable consumption reduces the risk factors for cardio vascular diseases like high cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A healthy diet increases health (e.g., via a reduction of body weight) and is therefore important for people undergoing rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Even though several studies have demonstrated that adhering to rehabilitation treatment will reduce medical costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and reduce morbidity and mortality by 20% to 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], it is difficult for many patients in rehabilitation to adopt and especially maintain healthy behaviors after they participated in rehabilitation programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Because of these health benefits, the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle is important for those patients beyond the duration of the rehabilitation treatment. Yet, aftercare programs are limited and not always available for cardiac rehabilitation patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Computer-based tailored health interventions are a promising tool for multiple behavior change and provide several benefits: patients can take part in the aftercare from home and do not have to travel; patients can participate at their preferred time and it is cost-effective because more people can be reached compared to face-to-face or group aftercare programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Due to simplicity and ease of use online-based programs promise to be effective in implementing the new behavior changes into daily routines. Computer-based programs also provide the opportunity to deliver tailored messages. Tailored feedback is more effective than generic messages which provide standardized information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and also more cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Current studies have shown promising results in raising the motivation of patients in rehabilitation to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, these previous studies have not made use of computer based personalized feedback which might increase their effectiveness.</p><p>This personalized information is based on individual assessment, meets individual needs and contains less redundant information. Therefore personalized information is remembered better and increases the intention to change behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Tailored messages should include different kinds of feedback: personal behavioral feedback and action feedback to increase the effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Personal feedback provides the person with a reflection of the actual behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This feedback mechanism increases the risk perception, awareness and the motivation to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Action feedback provides the individual with practical information about how to change and maintain certain behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Tailoring can be categorized into two broad forms: static and dynamic. Static tailoring is based on one assessment at the beginning of the intervention while dynamic tailoring can be done by assessing the information needed at the relevant time before the feedback is given. Dynamic tailoring was shown to be more effective in health behavior change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>This research project will be conducted and evaluated in the Netherlands and Germany to investigate if an online-based rehabilitation aftercare program is equally effective in countries with different rehabilitation systems.</p><p>In the Netherlands, the majority of cardiac patients receive aftercare from their general practitioner (GP) after discharge from hospital. Only a small percentage of CVD patients (28%) receive rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Most of these patients receive rehabilitation in policlinics (80%), a minor part is treated in rehabilitation centers (20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The Netherlands have a dense network of medical facilities working together (hospitals, policlinics, rehabilitation centers, medical practices) enabling patients to reach cardiac rehabilitation without long travel distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>In Germany, the number of patients who receive cardiac rehabilitation is low as well. Only one third of cardiac patients are transferred to rehabilitative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, in contrast to the Netherlands, rehabilitation in Germany mainly takes place as an inpatient service and patients are seldom able to stay at home during partaking the rehabilitation treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This implies that, in contrast to the Netherlands, a major part of the patient education needs to be provided in the clinical setting. In the Netherlands the majority of persons undergoing rehabilitation is treated within policlinics for several hours a week and can stay in their home environment. Besides, the concept of aftercare in Germany differs from that in the Netherlands. In Germany, CVD patients are offered intensive aftercare rehab (IRENA), intensive after care (INA) and cardiac exercise groups with the aim of reintegration into the work life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This aftercare is not provided in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. How these structural differences work together or boost the effect of an online intervention addressing health behavior adoption and maintenance was not tested before and is the main unique feature of this study.</p><sec><title>Study aims</title><p>The aim of the present study is to test the effectiveness of the online-based aftercare program &#x0201c;RENATA (Rehabilitation aftercare program for an optimal transfer into daily life)&#x0201d; for cardiac rehabilitation in order to improve physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. To acquire a deeper understanding of the usefulness of aftercare interventions in countries with different rehabilitation systems, the study will be implemented in Germany and the Netherlands.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Atrium Medical Centre Heerlen in the Netherlands (METC number 12-N-124) and by the <italic>Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Psychologie</italic> (DGPs; EK-A-SL 022013).

In order to be eligible to participate in this study participants need to be able to use a computer, familiar with the use of the Internet, and need sufficient reading and writing language skills in the relevant language (German or Dutch). Patients with contraindications for physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption will be excluded (e.g., heart failure patients which are not allowed to eat 2 pieces of fruit per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Power analysis</title><p>The power analysis was based on the assumption that the intervention will result in a small improvement of effect to improve fruit and vegetable consumption and in a small to medium effect to improve physical activity for the study conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The calculation was based on an effect size of 0.3, with a power (1-&#x003b2;) of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05.</p><p>No cluster effect is expected due to the fact that the randomization of the participants is independent of the place of recruitment. Further, it is necessary to take interaction effects into account between the intervention and the control group, and between Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p>Therefore, to be able to detect a small to medium effect, 263 people have to participate in every group in each country. This means that the required total sample size will need to consist of 1052 participants, not adjusted for potential drop out during the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>During the rehabilitation period, patients will be recruited within the rehabilitation center by their therapists. These therapists will first inform the person undergoing rehabilitation about the study and hand out study information. Participants will log in on the project website and have to give online informed consent. Randomization will be done by the computer software <italic>TailorBuilder</italic>, which is developed for internet based tailored interventions. Participants will be randomly allocated to the study group or to the waiting list control group. The waiting list control group will get access to the intervention after eight weeks (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The Health-Action Process Approach (HAPA) will be used as a theoretical framework to develop the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The HAPA Model distinguishes two phases during the process of behavior change: a motivational phase in which the intention to perform a specific behavior is formed and a volitional phase in which the intention is translated into the actual performance of the behavior. Depending on the stage, people have different needs. Within the motivational phase positive outcome expectancies, a high risk perception and a high self-efficacy to perform the specific behavior are necessary to develop an intention. Once people have formed the intention to perform a certain behavior, skills such as action and coping planning, self-efficacy, and social support are necessary. The HAPA Model further distinguishes between stages of intention. Non-intenders are in the motivational phase and have no intention to change their behavior. Intenders are in the volitional phase but do not perform the behavior in contrast to actors, who carry out the behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The intervention will target the concepts of the different stages via the use of behavior change techniques. In line with Abraham and Michie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], we use several behavior change techniques like providing information about behavioral risk and benefit of behavior change, prompting intention formation, prompting barrier identification, providing instructions how to perform a behavior, prompting specific goal setting and review of behavioral goals, providing feedback on performance, prompting practice and providing follow-up prompts, prompting to plan social support and finally prompting relapse prevention, also based on strategies used by other effective computer tailoring programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>During the eight-week intervention period, participants will be invited to access the online program once per week and take part in one of the intervention modules. These eight modules aim to increase participants&#x000b4; risk perception of CVD, support positive outcome expectancies towards physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption, and guide participants in defining and reflecting on their own goals, action plans and coping plans. Further, self-efficacy regarding the participant&#x02019;s ability to perform and maintain the two targeted behaviors will be addressed.</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> presents a short overview about the weekly intervention content. During the first session, participants will receive feedback and information about their risk perception, outcome expectancies and their behavior with regard to physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption which is based on the previous assessment. During the following session, participants formulate their own individual goals and specific plans with regard to physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake. Participants will receive information about how to structure a plan as good as possible. For example <italic>&#x0201c;I would like to go for a walk in the park for 30 minutes each Tuesday.&#x0201d;</italic> All plans have to be evaluated with regard to their feasibility through self-reflection. This will be achieved by asking the participants questions like: <italic>&#x0201c;Is your plan &#x02018;to go for a walk in the park&#x02019; easy to implement into your daily routine?</italic>&#x0201d;</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Intervention content</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Weekly sessions</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Weekly content</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Session 1 PA and Session 5&#x000a0;F&#x00026;V<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Questionnaire and personalized feedback, increase risk perception and outcome expectations, defining own health outcomes; (Session 5: Assessment of social cognitive factors)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Session 2 PA and Session 6&#x000a0;F&#x00026;V<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Personalized feedback, defining action plans<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6" align="left" valign="bottom">Session 3 PA and Session 7&#x000a0;F&#x00026;V<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Personalized feedback<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Evaluation and self-reflection about action plans<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adjusting action plans<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Defining personal barriers<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Develop personal coping plans<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Evaluation and refection about coping plans<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Session 4 PA and Session 8&#x000a0;F&#x00026;V</td><td align="left">Personalized feedback, adjusting coping plans, thinking about social support and development of a list of potential supporters from the social environment; (Session 8: T2 questionnaire)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><bold>(PA)</bold> physical activity; <bold>(F&#x00026;V)</bold> fruit and vegetable consumption.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>After reviewing the plans, participants get the opportunity to adjust them. After each session, participants will be motivated to practice their plans. During the next session, participants are asked to evaluate their action plans and if necessary adjust them. People who indicate to have problems formulating plans will receive role model examples. Furthermore, they are asked to identify their personal barriers and obstacles that prevent them from putting plans into practice. Barriers need to be defined and participants are again asked to define plans on how to deal with those plans. For example, if someone chooses &#x0201c;<italic>It is difficult for me to eat fruit and vegetables when I am not at home</italic>&#x0201d;, the person will be asked to think about a strategy to be able to eat fruit and vegetable like <italic>&#x0201c;when I leave the house for some hours I will take an apple with me&#x0201d;</italic>. Defining action and coping plans has been proven to be an effective tool to increase physical activity among cardiac rehabilitation patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Again, these coping plans have to be evaluated during the next session and can be adjusted if necessary. During the last session of each behavior, participants will be asked to think about persons in their social environment who could be able to support their change and can be useful to help them.</p><p>The intervention will be enriched by different kinds of feedback: ipsative feedback will be used to provide participants with an overview of their development with regard to physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. At the beginning of each session participants will be asked about the physical activity or fruit and vegetable consumption during the preceding seven days. After that, they will receive tailored feedback about their behavior.</p><p>Normative feedback will be provided to give information about whether the behavior meets the recommendations for both target behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Feedback will not only be based on the assessment at the beginning of the intervention T1 but also given dynamically with the use of information that will be assessed during the intervention. In this way the feedback is based on the newest information and contains more relevant information. <italic>&#x0201c;Ben, you ate 3 portions of fruit and vegetable per day.
