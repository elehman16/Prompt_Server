The progression of the disease, however, is determined by host factors. One of the mediators that influence this progression is the prostaglandins (PGs) which are formed from arachidionic acid under the influence of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have shown therapeutic benefits in slowing down the rate of progression of periodontal disease by the effective inhibition of PG synthesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Local drug delivery is aimed at site-specific therapy; it helps to avoid systemic complications and at the same time achieve high concentrations of the drug at the diseased site. Most research initially conducted utilized antimicrobial agents. This principle is now applied to NSAIDs. One such NSAID that can be used for this purpose is ketoprofen. This propionic acid derivative exhibits a marked potency relative to other agents in blocking human periodontal PGE2 synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Other <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen include an anti-bradykinin activity and stabilization of lysosomal membranes. A number of studies have shown that differences in disease susceptibility between patients are primarily due to the fact that endotoxin-stimulated monocytes secreted two to three times more PGE than subjects without disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Ketoprofen has the added advantage of directly inhibiting monocytes and macrophages, which are predominant cells involved in the synthesis of PGs, thereby modifying the response of the host to the process of inflammation.</p><p>For a locally delivered drug to be effective, an adequate concentration of the drug requires to be present at the desired site. The vehicle therefore plays an important role in determining the mode of application as well as obtaining sufficient concentrations. Presently, thermo-reversible hydrogels are the most commonly used vehicle in most pharmaceutical applications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Arneth index is usually considered to estimate the age of the neutrophil. A number of conditions are present wherein older, multilobed neutrophils have been found. recovering from a longstanding infection has been demonstrated as a possibility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>This study was directed at modulating the host response by utilizing an indigenously prepared anti-inflammatory drug containing ketoprofen. The study was double blinded in order to eliminate the possibility of a bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This double-blind clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of the NSAID, ketoprofen, on patients with chronic periodontitis. Two similar local drug delivery preparations of a poloxamen gel containing 1.5% ketoprofen and a placebo were indigenously prepared for this purpose. The drug release pattern of the gel was obtained through static diffusion analysis. This demonstrated an initial burst with approximately 20% of the drug being released in the first hour and the remaining released in a linear manner over a period of 3 days [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Drug release pattern of ketoprofen</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-255-g001"/></fig><p>The sample constituted 10 subjects aged 33-55 years with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis reporting to the outpatient department, C. I. D. S. Three sites in each patient (total of 30 sites) with a probing depth of 5-8 mm were selected. The patients were recruited and monitored for a period of 90 days. Informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to the initiation of the study.</p><p>Patients with a history of allergy to propionic acid derivatives, subjects under chronic treatment with NSAIDs within 1 month, subjects under medication likely to induce gingival hyperplasia, pregnant women and subjects with systemic diseases or habits that might modify the periodontal status were excluded from the study.</p><p>All subjects received oral hygiene instructions.

PGs formed by the arachidionic acid-cyclooxygenase pathway are one of the key mediators of the disease. Two isoforms of the enzyme cyclooxygenase exist: cox-1 is constitutively expressed and the resulting PGs are responsible for physiological functions (e.g. gastric mucosal secretions, renal homeostasis) and cox-2 is inducible and is said to be produced during inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] NSAIDs, with the exception of selective cox-2 inhibitors, inhibit both the isoforms of cyclooxygenase, resulting in adverse effects (gastritis, peptic ulcers, impaired renal function).</p><p>In previous reports, use of NSAIDs to control inflammation and as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] has proven beneficial in comparison with controls. The drawbacks of systemic NSAIDs can be avoided by using a local drug delivery that allows the concentration of a particular drug at the desired site. Ketoprofen, a propionic acid derivative, has been found to be effective against a number of inflammatory conditions and is currently under investigation as a potential adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Besides its ability to block the cyclooxygenase pathway, <italic>in vitro</italic> reports have also demonstrated an anti-lipoxygenase activity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and hence the added ability of the drug to inhibit leukotriene formation.</p><p>In this study, a local drug delivery system containing 1.5% ketoprofen gel was used in conjunction with SRP in order to assess periodontal outcomes in subjects with chronic periodontitis.</p><p>The results of this double-blind clinical trial of 10 patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis at 30 and 90 days following SRP and oral hygiene index (OHI) indicate that the overall oral hygiene status showed considerable improvement (<italic>P</italic>=0.00 for plaque index; <italic>P</italic>=0.044 for gingival index).</p><p>BOP is considered the first clinical sign that denotes inflammation, and is therefore a valuable indicator in assessing the status of the inflammatory component.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] All sites treated with SRP showed improvement at 30 and 90 days, respectively. At 90 days, reduction of BOP with ketoprofen was found to be highly significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.00) in comparison with the other two groups. Results in relation to group A (SRP + placebo) were found to be significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.24), while BOP did not achieve statistically significant values in relation to group C, indicating that group B (SRP + ketoprofen) demonstrated a significant reduction in the clinical signs of gingival inflammation. This is in conjunction with previous reports of reduced inflammatory components following the application of a similar gel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The presence of increased levels of PGs has been implicated in the loss of attachment and alveolar bone loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Controlling PG synthesis can therefore reduce bone loss and maintain attachment levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Recently published data utilizing different concentrations of a topically applied ketoprofen gel demonstrated decreased PG levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] A number of investigations using anti-inflammatory medications as an adjunct to SRP have reported significant differences between test and control groups with regard to PPD, CAL and loss of alveolar bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>In this study, although there was a highly significant overall gain in CAL and reduction of PPD, inter-group variations were not found to be statistically significant. This variability in responsiveness may be attributed to differences in study design in terms of duration and due to the lack of a standardized drug regimen.</p><p>The differential count was estimated in order to assess the effect of ketoprofen on monocytes (<italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that ketoprofen can suppress monocytes and macrophage).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] This study did not demonstrate any inter-group variation in the proportion of WBCs which remained constant throughout the study. This difference may be attributed to the fact that this was an <italic>in vivo</italic> study.</p><p>Arneth's index is the result of computations based on nuclear structures. It is a method of estimating the relative age of a neutrophil. Neutrophils with less lobes are younger forms, while those with greater number of lobes represent older cells. An increase in the number of lobes (shift to right) was demonstrated at 30 days following application of drug B. The values returned to normal when examined at 90 days. During recovery from an infection, there is a shift to the right. This is because the number of young cells entering the site is decreased and the cells already present are somewhat effected by the toxemia of the infectious process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Another explanation could be the fact that ketoprofen is capable of inhibiting interleukin (IL)-8-induced chemotaxis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>As far as the limitations of this study are concerned, a larger sample size with a longer duration of follow-up would have proven to be beneficial. Since NSAIDs are currently in an experimental stage, a standardized drug regimen would have established desired concentrations of the drug within the gingival crevice for the required period of time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ketoprofen has important anti-inflammatory properties, and is therefore beginning to be utilized in periodontics. In this study, locally delivered ketoprofen in conjunction with mechanical periodontal therapy has proven to be beneficial in controlling the clinical signs of inflammation. However, further long-term studies are required to substantiate this effect of ketoprofen as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jeffcoat</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Reddy</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Haigh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Buchanan</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Doyle</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Meredith</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A comparison of topical ketrolac, systemic flurbiprofen, and placebo for the inhibition of bone loss in adult periodontitis</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1995</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>329</fpage><lpage>38</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7623251</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Paquette</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name><name><surname>Maynor</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilder</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Binder</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Troullos</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Pharmacodynamic effects of ketoprofen on crevicular fluid prostanoids in adult periodontitis</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2000</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>558</fpage><lpage>66</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10959781</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Garrisons</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>FC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>LPS elicited secretory responses in monocytes: Altered release of PGE2 but not IL-1 beta in patients with adult periodontitis</article-title><source>J Periodontal Res</source><year>1989</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>88</fpage><lpage>95</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2524582</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Escobar-Ch&#x000e1;vez</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>L&#x000f3;pez-Cervantes</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Na&#x000ef;k</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalia</surname><given-names>YN</given-names></name><name><surname>Quintanar-Guerrero</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ganem-Quintanar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Applications of thermo-reversible Pluronic F -127 pharmaceutical formulations</article-title><source>J Pharm Pharm Sci</source><year>2006</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>339</fpage><lpage>58</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17207417</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burns</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Studies in osteopathic sciences, cells of the blood</article-title><date-in-citation>Last cited on 2011 Jan 03</date-in-citation><volume>4</volume><comment>chapter 4, version 5.0 Available from:
