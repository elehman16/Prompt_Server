taping therapy on degenerative knee arthritis patients&#x02019; pain, function, and joint range of
motion. [Subjects] To conduct the experiment in the present study, 30 patients with
degenerative knee arthritis were divided into a control group (the conservative treatment
group) of 15 patients, who received conservative physical therapy, and an experimental
group (the kinesiology taping group) of 15 patients, who received kinesiology taping
therapy. [Methods] All patients received treatment three times per week for four weeks.
The kinesiology taping group had elastic tapes applied to the hamstring muscles, anterior
tibialis, quadriceps femoris, and gastrocnemius. The range of motion was measured using
joint goniometers, pain was measured using visual analog scales, and functional evaluation
was conducted using the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
Index. [Results] In intragroup comparisons of the kinesiology taping group and the
conservative treatment group, the visual analog scale and Korean Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores significantly decreased, and the range
of motion increased more than significantly. In intergroup comparisons, the kinesiology
taping group showed significantly lower visual analog scale and Korean Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores and significantly larger ranges of
motion than the conservative treatment group. [Conclusion] Kinesiology taping therapy is
considered to be an effective nonsurgical intervention method for pain relief, daily
living activities, and range of motion of degenerative knee arthritis patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinesiology tape</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Knee joint</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Degenerative arthritis is a major factor that reduces an individual&#x02019;s ability to perform
acts of daily living, which causes secondary problems, including psychological and social
problems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is one of the joint
diseases that leads to degeneration of joint cartilage and degenerative changes in the areas
surrounding the joints and subchondral bones, resulting in pain and functional
disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This disease appears when
the joint cartilage is degenerated due to aging, excessive use, injury, etc., and this leads
to joint deformation. Arthritis begins when cartilage is severely worn because the muscles
and ligaments that move the joints have been weakened; pain appears thereafter<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. As causes of degenerative arthritis, age,
gender, obesity, knee damage or surgical history, genetic causes, and knee joint
misalignment have been reported<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
these develop into mechanical and biological factors of abnormal degeneration in cartilage
cells and the extracellular matrices of joint cartilage<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatment of degenerative arthritis is aimed at temporarily
reducing pain to improve joint function, thereby improving health-related quality of
life<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The treatment methods are mainly
rest and stabilization at the early stage and drug therapy, exercise treatment, and surgical
methods in the chronic phase<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
therapies, taping, a nondrug/nonsurgical treatment method, is mainly used for pain relief
and muscle/joint function improvement and enhancement, and the effects of taping have been
identified in many studies on the nervous system and musculoskeletal diseases<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, studies are insufficient on the effects of the application of taping therapy for
degenerative arthritis on joint range of motion (ROM) and functional performance. Therefore,
the present study is aimed to apply taping therapy to degenerative knee arthritis patients
to examine the effects on pain, joint ROM, and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 30 elderly patients who had visited S orthopedic
hospital in Daegu and were inpatients at the hospital; these patients had no fractures in
their knee joints or damage to ligaments or other soft tissues and agreed to participate in
the study. All patients could communicate with the researcher, since they had no disturbance
of consciousness or dysesthesia. The patients had been diagnosed with degenerative knee
arthritis based on clinical findings and with medical imaging such as X-rays and had been
prescribed physical therapy. The aim of the present study and all experimental processes
were sufficiently explained, and voluntary agreement to participate was obtained before the
experiment. In addition, ethical approval for the study was granted by the Youngdong
University Institutional Review Board.</p><p>The 30 patients with degenerative knee arthritis were divided into two groups: the
conservative treatment group (CTG, n=15) and the kinesiology taping group (KTG, n=15). The
mean age, height, and weight in the CTG were 73.1&#x000b1;5.8&#x02005;years, 156.3&#x000b1;7.7&#x02005;cm, and 61.1&#x000b1;10.7&#x02005;kg,
respectively. Those in the KTG were 72.0&#x000b1;4.0&#x02005;years, 160.7&#x000b1;7.1&#x02005;cm, and 64.9&#x000b1;8.8&#x02005;kg,
respectively.</p><p>The CTG received hot-pack treatment with surface heat for 20 minutes, as well as general
physical therapy using interference wave therapy equipment at 100 bps for 15 minutes. The
KTG was also provided with the same general physical therapy followed by kinesiology taping
therapy. All patients were treated three times per week for four weeks. For the KTG, 5-cm
wide elastic tapes (Original Kinesiology Tape, Nasara Corporation, Republic of Korea) were
applied on the hamstring and the anterior tibialis in cases where the patient felt pain when
the knee joint was bent or on the quadriceps femoris and the gastrocnemius in cases where
the patient felt pain when the knee joint was extended. The tapes were replaced with new
ones at each treatment session. In the case of the hamstring, the subject was instructed to
extend the leg to below the bed in a lateral decubitus position, and a Y-shaped tape was
prepared. The beginning tips were fixed to the back of the thigh and to the center of the
ischium, and the tape was extended with some pulling force to the back of the knee and
attached at a point 3&#x02005;cm downward from the centerline of the back of the kneecap while being
spread laterally. In the case of the anterior tibialis, the subject was instructed to take a
supine position, and one end of an I-shaped tape was fixed to the lateral surface of the
tibial tuberosity. The tape was attached along a line that passed the medial condyle of the
ankle and the medial sole and went to the centerline of the instep with the ankle in a state
of plantar flexion. In the case of the quadriceps femoris, the subject was instructed to
extend the leg to below the bed in a supine position, and the beginning end of a Y-shaped
tape was fixed to the center of the thigh 5&#x02005;cm downward from the line of the inguinal
region. The tape was attached along a line going to a point above the kneecap, with the knee
joint in a state of 90&#x000b0; flexion, and the two tips of the split end were attached to the
kneecap and wrapped around it. In the case of the gastrocnemius, the subject was instructed
to take a prone position, and a Y-shaped tape was fixed to the heel after bending the knee
joint to 90&#x000b0;. The tape was attached around the Achilles tendon after extending the knee
straight and maintaining the ankle in an anatomical posture at 90&#x000b0;, and the two tips of the
split end were attached on both sides, along the gastrocnemius up to the centerline of the
back of the knee<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS), and daily living activity
functions were evaluated using the K-WOMAC (Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
Osteoarthritis Index). The K-WOMAC is a questionnaire for the evaluation of treatment
results in patients with lower extremity osteoarthritis, and it divides difficulties in
daily living into scales. Pain, stiffness, and the degree of inconvenience in relation to
the performance of daily living activities were measured before and after treatment to
examine the changes felt by the patients. To examine the range of motion (ROM) of the knee
joint, the joint was maximally extended passively in a prone position three times to measure
the angle to the maximum flexion position with a goniometer, and the average value was
obtained. In the present study, for statistical analysis, paired t-tests were conducted to
examine intragroup changes, and independent t-tests were conducted to analyze intergroup
comparisons. SPSS/PC Ver. 13.0 was used for statistical processing, and the significance
level of &#x003b1; was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of the present study, intragroup comparison of the CTG and KTG
revealed that the VAS and K-WOMAC scores were significantly decreased and the ROM was
significantly increased in the KTG. Furthermore, intergroup comparison revealed that the KTG
showed significantly lower VAS and K-WOMAC scores and a significantly larger ROM than the
CTG (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of VAS, K-WOMAC, and ROM between groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VAS (points)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTG<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.1&#x000b1;1.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.7&#x000b1;0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KTG<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.5&#x000b1;1.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.3&#x000b1;1.2<sup>&#x02020;&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WOMAC (points)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTG<sup>**</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.1&#x000b1;14.0</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.6&#x000b1;11.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KTG<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.4&#x000b1;11.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.1&#x000b1;6.7<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ROM (degrees)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTG<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">119.9&#x000b1;9.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">123.5&#x000b1;8.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KTG<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">121.1&#x000b1;7.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">130.3&#x000b1;6.0<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>VAS: Visual analog scale; K-WOMAC: Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities

results of application of kneecap medial taping to patients with degenerative knee arthritis
indicated that it could be a simple and safe treatment method that could relieve pain in a
short time. Lee et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
results of application of kinesiology taping to the vastus medialis oblique and vastus
lateralis of patients with patellofemoral pain indicated that pain was relieved, the maximum
isometric contractile force (MVIC) of individual muscles was increased, and the activity of
individual muscles was decreased during moving up and down stairs. In the present study, the
results of analysis of pain using the VAS revealed that pain was significantly relieved in
the KTG. Given this, it is assumed that application of kinesiology taping relieved the
weakening of the quadriceps femoris muscle and the tonus and shortening of the
gastrocnemius, improving the imbalance of muscle strength occurring in the knee joint,
thereby relieving pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The K-WOMAC scores widely used in evaluating the daily living functions of degenerative
knee arthritis patients were analyzed in the present study, and the results showed
statistically significant decreases. Hunter et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that the results of follow-up studies conducted with
3,705 patients with problems in the knee indicated that the pain indexes were significant
among the subitems of the WOMAC. These results are considered attributable to the fact that
the stimuli of the kinesiology tape attached to the muscles around the knee joint, where
abnormal muscle tonus appeared due to the wear and degeneration of the joint cartilage,
helped the homeostasis of muscles and gradually reduced the pain and stiffness, thereby
preventing aggravation of the muscle tonus state so that knee joint function was
improved<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A study conducted by Park and Kim<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that application of taping therapy three times per week for four weeks to elderly
persons complaining of knee pain, showed significant effects on knee joint ROM. In the
present study too, the results of the analysis of changes in joint ROM showed significant
effects in the KTG. This is considered attributable to the fact that in these elderly
patients with degenerative knee arthritis, who were showing lower extremity muscle weakening
and abnormal muscle tonus around the knee joint, the skin stimuli of the kinesiology taping
acted on the muscle spindles or tendon organs to support the muscles around the joint. It
also relieved the muscle tonus through the mutual suppression effects of the muscles,
thereby further smoothing joint flexion and extension and increasing extensibility and
flexibility, leading to increased joint ROM<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, general physical
therapy modalities and kinesiology taping were applied and compared, and the kinesiology
taping group showed significant effects. Through future studies, the physiological
mechanisms of the diverse effects of taping therapy should be proved further, and approaches
should be expanded to the function of patients with diverse musculoskeletal diseases, in
addition to those with degenerative knee arthritis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jee</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effects on rehabilitative exercise on pain degree,
