The prevalence of AD is 5&#x02013;20% worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Altered immunity and reduced barrier function are fundamental to the development of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the heterogeneous pathologic abnormalities observed in this patient population may contribute to the different clinical features seen in each patient. In the acute phase, AD manifests as erythema, microvesiculation, exudation, and crusting; however, in the chronic phase, the main symptoms of AD include hyperpigmentation, excoriation, and dryness. Additionally, severe itch can induce lichenification in the chronic stage owing to protracted rubbing of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The most effective therapy for AD includes short-term treatment of flares and a long-term maintenance approach to skin care designed to prevent or minimize flares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Topical anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids (GCs) are standard therapy; however, long-term use of GCs carries the risk of side effects leading to the need for development of a therapeutic nonsteroidal topical agent.</p><p>
<italic>Jaungo</italic> is an herbal ointment for xerosis cutis, frostbite, miliaria, anal fissures, and rhus dermatitis and approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA). It is composed of two herbs and three carrier oils: <italic>Lithospermi</italic> radix, <italic>Angelica gigantis</italic> radix, sesame seed oil, bees wax, and swine oil.

Additionally, a case series in 1999 reported the effect of <italic>Jaungo</italic> on AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and two more recent studies reported the effects of <italic>Jaungo</italic> on both radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients and cutaneous leishmaniasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase IIa clinical trial to investigate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and dose response of <italic>Jaungo</italic> for treatment of AD. The study aims to enroll 34 patients with AD. Participants fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be selected and randomly distributed into three parallel groups: treatment 1, treatment 2, and the placebo group.

<italic>Jaungo</italic> ointment (Hanpoong Pharm and Foods, Co., Ltd., Wanju, Korea) was produced according to Korea Good Manufacturing Practice standards. <italic>Jaungo</italic> was approved for the treatment of xerosis cutis, frostbite, miliaria, anal fissure, and rhus dermatitis on 11 September 2014, by the KFDA. It is licensed to be applied to skin lesions one or more times per day.</p><p>
<italic>Jaungo</italic> is composed of two herbs and three carrier oils: 72.7&#x000a0;mg of <italic>Lithospermi</italic> radix, 60.6&#x000a0;mg of <italic>Angelica gigantis</italic> radix, 60.1&#x000a0;mg of sesame seed oil, 242.4&#x000a0;mg of bees wax, and 18.2&#x000a0;mg of swine oil based on a total 1&#x000a0;g of ointment. It is a red-colored ointment with an herbal fragrance. The characteristic red color is due to the <italic>Lithospermi</italic> radix, and the distinctive aroma is due to the flavor components of bees wax and <italic>Angelica gigantis</italic> radix.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Placebo medicine</title><p>Hanpoong Pharm and Foods Co., Ltd., developed a homogenous ointment that is red in color with an herbal fragrance made with 698.1&#x000a0;mg sesame seed oil, 279.2&#x000a0;mg bees wax, 21&#x000a0;mg swine oil, 1.2&#x000a0;mg red iron oxide, and 0.5&#x000a0;mg ginseng-flavored extract based on a total 1&#x000a0;g of ointment.

If an applicant meets the study criteria, they will be invited to the clinical research center to be examined for eligibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Randomization and allocation</title><p>Before assigning randomization, all participants will be informed that they will be distributed into one of three groups. Thirty-four participants will be randomized into three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, using block randomization with a block size of 3 or 6, where 11&#x02013;12 participants are planned for each group. Randomization distribution will occur on the second visit to the clinical research center. Participants will be assigned random numbers via a web-based random number generator system developed by an independent expert on web programming using Django Web Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">https://www.djangoproject.com</ext-link>). The clinical pharmacy will be supplied with the experimental and placebo ointments in identical containers labeled with random numbers, which correspond to the participant&#x02019;s assigned number, and &#x0201c;for morning use&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;for evening use.&#x0201d; The participant&#x02019;s randomly assigned number will dictate which ointments the clinical pharmacist will supply to them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Blinding</title><p>To ensure blinding, a matched placebo ointment identical in color, texture, weight, and odor will be utilized and stored in a container identical to that of <italic>Jaungo</italic>. The <italic>Jaungo</italic> and placebo ointments will be labeled with a random number and &#x0201c;for morning use&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;for evening use&#x0201d; in an identical form. Treatment group 1 will receive two containers of <italic>Jaungo</italic>, one labeled with &#x0201c;for morning use&#x0201d; and the other &#x0201c;for evening use,&#x0201d; treatment group 2 will receive one container of <italic>Jaungo</italic> and one container of placebo ointment where one of the containers is labeled with &#x0201c;for morning use&#x0201d; and the other &#x0201c;for evening use.&#x0201d; The placebo group will receive two containers of placebo ointment, one labeled with &#x0201c;for morning use&#x0201d; and the other &#x0201c;for evening use.&#x0201d; The clinical pharmacist will supply <italic>Jaungo</italic>, the placebo ointment, or both to the patient depending on the patient&#x02019;s assigned number. If the ointments are lost or destroyed, the clinical pharmacist will supply the patient with extra ointment labeled in an identical manner to maintain blinding.</p><p>In this trial, treatment distribution will remain unknown to the participants, investigators, outcomes assessors, statistician, and other staff until the end of the study. The randomization list and blinding codes will be kept strictly confidential. Access to the randomization list will be limited to the Clinical Research Organization (CRO) staff and the list will only be opened as a standard operating procedure. In the event that the randomization list has to be opened immediately, owing to an urgent situation pertaining to serious adverse events, the primary investigator must report the incident to the CRO. Participants will remain blinded to their respective treatment group until the final visit of the last randomized participant. The success of blinding will be assessed at each participant&#x02019;s final visit. Researchers who are blinded to the distribution data will perform the outcome assessment. The blinding procedure will also be verified by the authorized CRO.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data collection, management, quality control and monitoring</title><p>To maintain the quality of this trial, monitoring and data management including data collection, validation, and completion will be conducted by the Institute of Safety and Effectiveness Evaluation for Korean Medicine (ISEE), a CRO located in Seoul, Korea. To ensure that outcome assessments are of a high standard in accordance with the trial protocol, the investigator and the assistants will attend a 6-h training workshop prior to the initiation of the trial. The investigator and the assistants will also be provided with a written protocol and standard operating procedure documents. All the data will be checked regularly by clinical trial coordinators from ISEE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary hypothesis is that topical application of <italic>Jaungo</italic> is more effective than the placebo ointment for treating AD. Baseline data collected on each participant at randomization in the trial will be used to describe the population of patients, assess comparability of treatment groups, achieve balanced randomization, adjust for possible confounding prognostic factors, and undertake subgroup analyses. The baseline characteristics of the three groups, including sex, age, duration of AD, total IgE level, and SCORAD score will be compared. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to investigate differences in continuously scaled variables, and chi-squared tests will be used to identify significant variations in proportions across treatment groups.</p><p>We will also compare the efficacy of <italic>Jaungo</italic> and placebo ointments based on the change in primary outcome, or EASI score, from day 0 to the end of the study period (3&#x000a0;weeks). Mean differences in the EASI score from baseline value to the end of treatment will be compared using ANOVA among the three groups. A paired Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test will be used to compare the mean change within a group. Secondary outcomes (SCORAD score, TEWL, DLQI, total IgE, eosinophil count, IL-17, IL-22, and IFN-&#x003b3;) will also be utilized to compare the efficacy of <italic>Jaungo</italic> and placebo ointments in the same manner as the primary outcome/EASI score. To evaluate safety, the Draize score and adverse events will be presented in a descriptive manner.</p><p>Analyses will be performed for two populations: (1) an intention-to-treat population consisting of all randomized participants who have at least one measurable outcome to report following treatment (missing data are replaced with the last observation values) and (2) a per-protocol population including only participants without major protocol deviations. All data will be descriptively analyzed. All main analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat population and conducted using the last observation carried forward imputation method. Statistical analyses will be conducted in a blind manner by an independent statistician and performed using the SPSS 21 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA), where the level of significance is established at <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>AD is an eczematous disorder that manifests with erythema, microvesiculation, exudation and crusting in its acute phase, and dry, red, scaly skin in its chronic phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Treatment guidelines for AD focus on the acute stage of the disease which includes emollients and topical GCs. Topical GCs are the mainstay treatment for AD flare-ups, and in many cases AD can be controlled with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors; however, some chronic AD patients require other treatment options due to GC side effects.</p><p>
<italic>Jaungo</italic> is an approved herbal ointment for xerosis cutis, frostbite, miliaria, anal fissures, and rhus dermatitis in Korea. Topical application of <italic>Jaungo</italic> was found to have anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity in our previous in-vivo and in-vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Based on these findings, we designed a phase IIa clinical study to determine the clinical efficacy of <italic>Jaungo</italic> and its possible treatment mechanism in chronic-stage AD. This preliminary and exploratory study is critical for future confirmatory clinical trials, as no information exists for <italic>Jaungo</italic>&#x02019;s application dose, frequency, and length of time that it should be administered in AD.</p><p>One of the important issues that we had to consider in this study was the blindness between the experimental drug, <italic>Jaungo</italic>, and the placebo ointment. <italic>Jaungo</italic> has a unique color and aroma. The characteristic red color is due to the <italic>Lithospermi</italic> radix, and its distinctive aroma is due to the flavor components of bees wax and <italic>Angelica gigantis</italic> radix. Red iron oxide and ginseng-flavored extract were used to manufacture the placebo ointment. Substances, composition, and manufacturing methods of the placebo ointment were approved by the KFDA. Additionally, to conceal the distribution data from researchers and participants, a web-based random number generator system was developed by an independent expert on web programming using Django Web Framework.</p><p>Limitations of this study are that it involves only 34 participants in a single center. This could potentially influence the generalizability of the study results. However, this study was designed to find the most responsive AD symptoms, to establish the proper application dose and frequency of <italic>Jaungo</italic>, and to identify the possible mechanism of action utilized by <italic>Jaungo</italic> for further study. In conclusion, this exploratory study will contribute to establishing <italic>Jaungo</italic>&#x02019;s efficacy, safety, and dose response in AD.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently ongoing.
