Among the primary diseases that lead to ESRD are the primary and secondary glomerular diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and tubulointerstitial nephritis.</p><p>Primary glomerular diseases and nephrosclerosis still comprise a significant proportion of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Primary glomerular diseases are especially important causes for the need for dialysis in Asian countries. They are currently the most frequent causes in China
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the second in most other Asian countries
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nephrosclerosis is the third frequent cause in most Asian countries and has been increasing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The primary care of CKD treatment is to delay renal function deterioration. Current treatments include dietary restriction and antihypertensive drug therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), which are often administered to both diabetic nephropathy and non-diabetic CKD patients, have been established as the recommended treatment agents for non-diabetic nephropathy patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], although either ACEIs or ARBs are insufficient for the prevention of progressive renal disease. Therefore, an additional treatment that is able to significantly delay the progression of CKD is highly coveted.</p><p>To meet this unmet medical need, clinical trials have been conducted attempting to delay CKD progression with combination therapies using renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors. Unfortunately, these trials failed to show an improvement in efficacy with composite renal endpoints while adverse events increase in some of them. Clinical benefits of combination treatments with multiple RAS inhibitors are therefore unproven, at least for diabetic nephropathy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, a recent trial of Nrf2-activating bardoxolone methyl in diabetic nephropathy patients (BEACON) was prematurely terminated due to safety concerns
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A trial of an orally administered activated carbon preparation (AST120: Kremezin&#x000ae;), which is currently used in clinical practice for chronic renal failure in Japan, Republic of Korea and Taiwan, also failed to meet the efficacy endpoints in composite renal endpoint in the large EPPIC randomized controlled trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The development of a novel CKD treatment strategy is therefore increasingly needed.</p><p>Beraprost sodium (BPS) is a stable orally-active prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) analogue discovered by Toray Industries, Inc. to overcome instability of prostacyclin <italic>in vivo</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. BPS has a novel mechanism for suppressing the progression of CKD. This treatment also targets renal hypoxia, reflecting a growing body of evidence implicating this as a valid therapeutic approach
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. BPS has been found to be effective in various animal models of renal disorders
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, BPS immediate-release tablets prevented the decrease in renal blood flow and function in patients with chronic renal failure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Using sustained release tablets of BPS (TRK-100STP), a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled comparative phase II trial aiming to determine the optimal clinical dose was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in Japanese patients with primary glomerular disease or nephrosclerosis as the primary disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this trial, serum creatinine (SCr) values were 1.5 to 4.5 for male and 1.3 to 4.0 for female at the initiation of treatment. Randomized patients received oral TRK-100STP 120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day (60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g b.i.d.), 240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day (120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g b.i.d.) or placebo for 28&#x000a0;weeks after the 22-week run-in period. The primary endpoint was the difference in slope of 1/SCr vs. time between the run-in period and the treatment period. No statistical difference in the primary endpoint was found between the high-dose (240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) group and the placebo group and so a clinical dose recommendation was not determined. Both treatment groups showed better outcomes than the placebo group, with the low-dose (120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day) group showing the highest efficacy. Both active dose groups showed similar effectiveness for additional efficacy endpoints including creatinine clearance, SCr ratio and serum cystatin C, compared to those of the placebo group.</p><p>A subgroup analysis was also conducted in the same study among patients with SCr 2.0&#x000a0;mg/dL or higher, whose renal function deterioration was considered irreversible
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Deteriorations in all the representative renal filtration functions (i.e. difference in the slope of the 1/SCr vs. time between the run-in period and the treatment period, SCr ratio, serum cystatin C and eGFR) were suppressed in the treatment groups and significant suppressions have been observed in some of these parameters. On the other hand, no clinically relevant safety issues were observed.</p><p>Based on these results, it was judged that a hypothesis could be set up to be verified in the phase IIb/III trial. The clinically recommended dose is to be re-evaluated using the same doses as ones in the phase II trial.</p><p>This paper details the design and methodology of a phase IIb/III trial (CASSIOPEIR: <bold>C</bold>RF <bold>As</bold>ian <bold>S</bold>tudy w<bold>i</bold>th <bold>O</bold>ral <bold>P</bold>GI<sub>2</sub> derivative for <bold>E</bold>valuating <bold>I</bold>mprovement of <bold>R</bold>enal function) conceived on the basis of the evidence and findings mentioned above in order to investigate whether TRK-100STP is superior to placebo in treating patients with primary glomerular disease or nephrosclerosis. Evaluating composite renal endpoints, the trial aims also to determine a recommended therapeutic dose of TRK-100STP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim of trial</title><p>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative trial targeting CKD patients designed to: (a) demonstrate the superiority of TRK-100STP over placebo using renal composite endpoints, including the extension of the time to the start of dialysis treatment; (b) determine the recommended clinical dose by comparing the low-dose (120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day), high-dose (240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day), and placebo groups; and (c) assess the safety of TRK-100STP in this population and setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The trial is being conducted in approximately 160 sites, including centers in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee/Institutional Review Board affiliated with each center. The trial is being conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, and Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent. The trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01090037.</p><p>A total of 750 patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;250 per group) with primary glomerular disease or nephrosclerosis are planned to be randomized. The rationale for setting the sample size at 250 subjects per group is based on &#x0201c;data handling procedure #2: 3-month lag censoring analysis&#x0201d; as follows. In the event of doubling of SCr or increase in SCr to &#x02265;6.0&#x000a0;mg/dL, the 2.5-year event rate estimated from subjects with SCr &#x02265;2.0&#x000a0;mg/dL that were enrolled in the last phase II trial was 48% for the placebo group and 33% for 240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group. Therefore, assuming a 2-year-enrollment period, a 2-year follow-up period, and a 35% dropout rate at 2.5&#x000a0;years for each group, the number of subjects required per group is estimated at 237 (with two-sided 5% significance level and 90% statistical power). For all subjects, placebo was orally administered for 2 to 8&#x000a0;weeks, twice a day, during the run-in period, when subjects were blinded although investigators recognized that subjects received placebo (Figure&#x000a0;

<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) after 2-to-8-week run-in period were randomized into one of three treatment groups for the 2-to-4-year treatment period in a double-bind manner: TRK-100STP 120 &#x003bc;g; TRK-100STP 240 &#x003bc;g; or placebo. Subjects randomized in the 240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose group started with a daily dose of 120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for 2&#x000a0;weeks and was then increased to 240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day. While the treatment period was planned to last for 2 to 4&#x000a0;years, this may be extended if the incidence of renal composite endpoint is smaller than expected.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

BPS is a stable orally-active prostacyclin analogue and its immediate-release tablet obtained manufacturing approval for the treatment of chronic arterial occlusive diseases from the Japanese regulatory agency in January 1992 (brand names: Dornar&#x000ae; and Procylin&#x000ae;). An additional indication for primary pulmonary hypertension was approved in September 1999. Besides Japan, BPS immediate-release tablets were launched in other Asian markets including China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Thailand and The Philippines, between 1997 and 2006.</p><p>TRK-100STP, a hydrogel-forming matrix preparation, provides a sustained-release preparation of BPS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In October 2007, TRK-100STP was given marketing approval in Japan for the treatment of PAH with a maximum daily dose of 360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (180&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g b.i.d.) (Brand names: Careload&#x000ae; and Berasus&#x000ae;). The maximum daily clinical dose of TRK-100STP has doubled those of the immediate-release tablet for the indication of pulmonary hypertension in Japan.</p><p>BPS has the same pharmacological actions as those of natural prostacyclin, including anti-platelet and vasodilating effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], as well as being able to protect vascular endothelial cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and inhibit inflammatory cytokines production including MCP-1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The importance of tubulointerstitial hypoxia has recently been highlighted as the final common pathway of CKD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a notion supported by an increasing body of evidence from animal models
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and clinical study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Renal blood flow is reduced when renal glomeruli are damaged by pathological factors such as inflammation and hypertension. Lack of oxygen, particularly in the tubulointerstitium of the outer-medullary region which is susceptible to hypoxia, triggers further damage to renal glomeruli which causes renal function to progressively decline
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It has been demonstrated, in the glomerular nephritis rat model, that the beneficial effects of BPS are attributed, at least in part, to the amelioration of tubulointerstitial hypoxia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Prostacyclin is a vasodilator which, at a high dose, diminishes blood pressure or brings about increased heart rate (HR) as compensation in several animal species
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, neither increased HR nor lower blood pressure is observed at the clinical dose up to 180&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g b.i.d. in patients with PAH
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additionally, the phase II trial of CKD patients demonstrated that TRK-100STP up to 120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g b.i.d. does not affect either blood pressure or urinary protein. Thus the effect of BPS to suppress the reduction of renal function is not related to blood pressure lowering or to reducing urinary protein levels. This suggests that the mechanism of beneficial effect of BPS for renal function is different from that of ACEIs/ARBs.</p><p>Other features of this trial are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Treatment with TRK-100STP is employed, in principle, as an add-on to existing treatments. No limitation was set against concomitant ACEIs/ARBs use, although dose alternation and newly initiated prescription is restricted. Meanwhile recent evidence from large-scale clinical studies indicates that combination therapy with RAS inhibitors is not effective and also increases certain safety concerns in some of them. The add-on approach was therefore chosen in this trial, based on the observation that a new approach is required beyond RAS inhibitor-based combination therapy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This trial utilizes carefully defined eligibility criteria that allows for sufficient numbers of events while excluding slow-progressing patients. This is important because the pace of renal function deterioration varies widely among patients, especially among non-diabetic CKD patients where disease progression is sometimes very slow. Enrollment is limited to patients with SCr of 2&#x000a0;mg/dL or higher where an irreversible decrease in renal function is reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Clinical benefits were more clearly apparent in such patients in the previous phase II trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Participants must also have experienced progression in renal function deterioration, assessed by the slope of 1/SCr vs. time, within one year before the start of the study. These aspects of recruitment may subsequently help us define the target population likely to benefit most from intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The necessity of introduction of dialyses or kidney transplants were determined by the principal investigator based on medical need assessment. All endpoints including the dates of introduction of dialyses or kidney transplants, as well as cardiovascular event occurrence, were validated by an EJC whose members are third-party physicians.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with diabetes at pre-enrollment were excluded. The findings of several animal model studies have indicated that BPS may be effective against diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Researchers have also reported that BPS was effective in patients with microalbuminuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, there are several methodological difficulties in covering both diabetic and non-diabetic CKD in a single study protocol. In addition, considering there is a great unmet need for non-diabetic nephropathy treatment in Asia, we decided to prioritize and focus on non-diabetic CKD, wherein renal disorders are not modified by diabetes. As it is difficult in practice to definitively distinguish between patients with diabetic nephropathy and non-diabetic CKD patients with diabetes, all patients with diabetes at pre-enrollment are excluded.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In the original trial design, handling of primary data was stipulated as &#x0201c;3-month lag censoring analysis&#x0201d;. However, Japanese regulatory authority, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), advised that ITT analysis should be primary analysis. The priority order of data handling was therefore amended based on the PMDA&#x02019;s advice. Meanwhile, the sample size estimation and rationale for setting the sample size in &#x0201c;study design&#x0201d;, which was designed based on 3-month lag censoring analysis, was not amended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of TRK-100STP in the treatment of patients with primary glomerular disease or nephrosclerosis using renal composite endpoints, and also aims to establish a recommended dose of TRK-100STP to optimize clinical outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Endpoint judgment committee members</title><p>Akira Hishida (Chair), Enyu Imai, Masato Nakamura</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data and safety monitoring board members</title><p>Akira Saito (Chair), Masaki Kobayashi, Naoki Kashihara</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This trial has been approved by competent regulatory authorities of China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.
