However, the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of this service model for people with a severe mental disorder (SMD) have not been evaluated in a low-income country.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial will be carried out in a predominantly rural area of Ethiopia. A sample of 324 people with SMD (diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) with an ongoing need for mental health care will be recruited from 1) participants in a population-based cohort study and 2) people attending a psychiatric nurse-led out-patient clinic. The intervention is a task-sharing model of locally delivered mental health care for people with SMD integrated into PHC delivered over 18&#x000a0;months. Participants in the active control arm will receive the established and effective model of specialist mental health care delivered by psychiatric nurses at an out-patient clinic within a centrally located general hospital. The hypothesis is that people with SMD who receive mental health care integrated into PHC will have a non-inferior clinical outcome, defined as a mean symptom score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, expanded version, of no more than six points higher, compared to participants who receive the psychiatric nurse-led service, after 12&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome is change in symptom severity. Secondary outcomes are functional status, relapse, service use costs, service satisfaction, drop-out and medication adherence, nutritional status, physical health care, quality of care, medication side effects, stigma, adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Sustainability and cost-effectiveness will be further evaluated at 18&#x000a0;months. Randomisation will be stratified by health centre catchment area using random permuted blocks. The outcome assessors and investigators will be masked to allocation status.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Evidence about the effectiveness of task sharing mental health care for people with SMD in a rural, low-income African country will inform the World Health Organisation&#x02019;s mental health Gap Action Programme to scale-up mental health care globally.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02308956">NCT02308956</ext-link> (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Ethiopia is typical of most low-income countries, with fewer than 10 % of people with severe mental disorders (SMD) receiving mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. SMDs are predominantly psychotic disorders that are chronic or recurrent, have a substantial impact on affected people and their families and rank highly in terms of disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The lack of treatment or inadequate treatment for SMDs is associated with a high level of suffering and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], family burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], stigma, discrimination and human rights abuses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], out-of-pocket costs and opportunity costs to affected individuals and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], poor physical health and under-nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Centralised services, a critical shortage of specialist mental health workers and an absence of mental health care in general health care settings are the main causes of this large treatment gap for SMDs in the low-income countries of sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Ethiopia, outside of the capital city, Addis Ababa, mental health services are largely limited to regional cities, with most care provided within psychiatric nurse-led, hospital-based clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The majority of Ethiopia&#x02019;s population, however, lives in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In order to improve access to mental health care, a &#x02018;task sharing&#x02019; approach is required. The concept of task sharing is similar to that of task shifting, defined as delegating tasks to existing or new cadres with either less training or narrowly tailored training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] but also recognises the ongoing role of specialists. For mental health care, it is advocated that primary care and general health care workers be given brief training to deliver circumscribed aspects of care for prioritised mental, neurological and substance-use disorders, with the support of specialist mental health workers who provide supervision, consultation, refresher training and referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In a series of systematic reviews conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO), packages of mental health interventions were identified (detailed in the Mental Health Gap Project Intervention Guide: mhGAP-IG) that can be delivered in the PHC setting and have demonstrated effectiveness for a range of mental, neurological and substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The task sharing model of mental health care integrated into PHC, proposed by WHO in mhGAP, is expected to be more affordable and accessible for the majority of people with SMD in low-income countries. By locating mental health care in PHC, the potential exists for people with SMD to receive improved physical health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The need for trials of task-sharing interventions for mental health care</title><p>Despite the potential advantages of task-sharing mental health care, little is known about how different aspects of the care needed by people with SMDs can be safely and effectively transferred to the PHC setting in a rural, low-income country setting such as Ethiopia. In a recent review of task-sharing approaches to health care in LMICs, evidence was offered that task sharing can improve the productive efficiency of services (that is, the greatest amount of care at a given quality and a given cost), although challenges regarding quality, safety and sustainability were also identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Most of the identified evaluations of task sharing were in the fields of surgery, obstetrics and HIV care, and few employed randomised, controlled trial designs. With respect to mental health care in particular, little is known about the acceptability of task sharing to service users or PHC workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or the feasibility and sustainability of such a model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Uncertainty also exists as to whether stigma will be greater or lesser in a separate psychiatric clinic that is further from the place of residence compared to an integrated service that is in the person&#x02019;s locality. The paucity of clinical trials of interventions for SMD in Africa has been highlighted, concluding that there is a pressing need for high-quality evidence from pragmatic trials with adequate follow-up periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a consensus exercise conducted to set priorities for global mental health, the integration of mental health care into primary care was within the top five issues to be addressed to improve scale-up and impact of mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The TaSCS trial, therefore, addresses an important evidence gap and has the potential to inform policy initiatives to scale-up mental health care in the African region and beyond.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Context of the TaSCS trial</title><p>The Africa Focus on Intervention Research for Mental health (AFFIRM) programme was established in 2011 with the objective of investigating strategies for narrowing the treatment gap for mental disorders in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. AFFIRM connects six countries of sub-Saharan Africa - Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe - and is engaged in developing contextualised trial outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], building capacity for intervention research, developing a collaborative network and conducting trials of task-sharing interventions in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and Ethiopia. Ethiopia was selected as the setting for a task-sharing trial for care of people with SMD for several reasons: 1) the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia is just beginning to scale up mental health care through integration into PHC and has prioritised care for people with SMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; 2) a well-described, population-based cohort of persons with standardised, clinician-defined diagnoses of SMD in Butajira, Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], provides a more relevant sample within which to nest a trial to inform scale-up than the usual facility-based samples; and 3) Ethiopia is a predominantly rural, low-income African country, which provides an important test case for WHO&#x02019;s mhGAP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Rationale for a non-inferiority trial</title><p>In this trial, we propose to investigate the non-inferiority of a task-sharing model of mental health care in PHC compared to the established alternative service model within Ethiopia: a less accessible (more centralised), but more specialist, psychiatric nurse-led model of care. The psychiatric nurse-led model of care has been demonstrated to be acceptable and associated with improved clinical outcomes for people with SMD engaged in the service in this sample in Butajira, Ethiopia, thus making this an appropriate comparison model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Task-sharing mental health care in PHC in Ethiopia is expected to allow more mental health care to be provided for the same cost compared to expanding specialist mental health care and is, therefore, of critical importance in addressing the high treatment gap. However, the important policy question for Ethiopia, and other low-income countries, is to establish whether or not the new task-sharing model for mental health care in PHC is good enough to meet the needs of people with SMD. At present, no evidence exists to inform this policy question. We will therefore conduct a non-inferiority trial in order to evaluate whether or not task sharing is at least no worse than specialist mental health care across a range of outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Objectives</title><p>The overall objective of the TaSCS trial is to determine the acceptability, affordability, effectiveness and sustainability of mental health care for people with SMD, delivered by trained and supervised non-specialist PHC workers compared to an existing psychiatric nurse-led service.</p><p>The specific objectives are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of task-sharing mental health care for people with SMD with PHC, compared to psychiatric nurse-led mental health care, on the primary outcome measure of symptom severity and on a series of secondary outcome measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine factors influencing the implementation of the task sharing intervention and future scale-up, by examining the feasibility, sustainability, quality and safety, and by qualitative exploration of the experience of task sharing from the perspectives of service users, PHC workers and health service managers.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>People with SMD who receive mental health care that is task shared with PHC will have a non-inferior clinical outcome, defined as a difference in the mean symptom score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, expanded version (BPRS-E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], of no more than six points higher, compared to people with SMD who receive a psychiatric nurse-led model of mental health care, after 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is an individual level, randomised, controlled non-inferiority trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will be conducted in the Meskan and Mareko districts of the Gurage Zone and the Silti Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People&#x02019;s region, Ethiopia. The Meskan and Mareko districts have an estimated population of 159,884 and 63,436, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The area is predominantly rural. Most inhabitants are farmers, growing maize for subsistence and chili pepper and khat (an amphetamine-like substance) as cash crops. The main town is Butajira, located around 130&#x000a0;km from the capital city, Addis Ababa. Road infrastructure has expanded in the last few years, but the majority of the population do not live close to all-weather roads. The population is prone to food insecurity and was affected by famine in 1974, 1985, 1999 and 2003. Mental health research activities have been carried out in the Butajira area for the last 18&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Within the study site, one government general hospital is present, located in the town of Butajira. The hospital is staffed by general physicians, a surgeon and obstetrician, as well as health officers (3 to 4&#x000a0;years of training at BSc level) and nursing staff (2 to 3&#x000a0;years training at BSc and Diploma level). There are 13 health centres in the rural areas surrounding the town of Butajira. Health centres provide PHC services comprising preventive health care, treatment of acute illness and delivery services, but no in-patient care. Health centres are staffed by health officers and general nurses. Each health centre is linked to five satellite health posts, staffed by two community health extension workers and located within walking distance of most residents (most with 5 to 10&#x000a0;km). Health extension workers are all women from the local area who have completed high school (grade 10) and a year of training in health promotion and illness prevention. The health extension workers form an interface between the PHC system and the community, dividing their time between house-to-house visits, community awareness-raising activities and a limited range of health post-based primary care services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants</title><p>Study participants will be recruited from two sources: (1) the population-based Butajira SMD cohort study sample and (2) the Butajira psychiatric nurse-led out-patient clinic.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Butajira SMD cohort</title><p>The Butajira SMD population-based cohort was established between 1998 and 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. People with possible SMD were identified in two ways: (1) through a house-to-house survey covering 68,378 people using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] as a screening tool, and (2) through community key informants, who had been trained using vignettes describing typical presentations of SMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. All potential cases were invited for a second phase clinician assessment conducted by an Ethiopian physician using the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Of the 2285 SCAN assessments conducted, 844 people were diagnosed as having SMD and recruited into the cohort. Incident cases (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;75) from the geographical catchment area over the next 2&#x000a0;years also underwent confirmatory diagnosis with SCAN and were recruited into the cohort, giving a total of 919 people with SMD: 359 with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 345 with bipolar disorder and 215 with severe major depressive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After 10&#x000a0;years (2011/2012) of follow-up, a clinician assessment was carried out using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) chart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. At that time, loss to follow-up from the cohort was as follows: 121 had died, 112 had refused to continue study assessments, 15 were vagrant and 70 had changed address and were not contactable. Study participants were more likely to be lost to follow-up if they were male, unmarried, had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and were more severely unwell at baseline, although the differences were small. However, loss to follow-up was not associated with age, literacy or employment status. The Butajira SMD cohort is one of the very few population-based studies of SMD from a LMIC. Even with the potential attrition bias, the Butajira SMD cohort offers a unique opportunity to obtain a sample that is free from the substantial selection bias associated with facility-based recruitment and is potentially more generalisable to people with SMD, who would access task-shared mental health care in PHC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Butajira hospital psychiatric out-patient clinic</title><p>In Butajira, the general hospital has a psychiatric out-patient clinic run by psychiatric nurses. At present this clinic is the only mental health care available within the districts covered by the TaSCS trial, as is the case in most of Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Since completion of the Butajira SMD cohort recruitment, additional people with SMD living in the Butajira SMD/TaSCS recruitment area have sought care from this clinic because they are (1) incident cases, (2) missed cases from the original recruitment, or (3) they have migrated into the area. If the TaSCS trial is unable to recruit a sufficient sample size from the Butajira SMD cohort, consecutive attendees at the Butajira hospital psychiatric clinic will be screened for eligibility.</p><p>Recruitment into the trial will be divided into two phases. In Phase 1, only people with SMD who are clinically stable will be recruited. Three months after beginning recruitment, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review adverse events, including non-engagement with the service, disengagement from care and evidence of potentially dangerous prescribing, before Phase 2 recruitment is permitted. In Phase 2, people with SMD who have more complex needs or who are clinically unstable will be recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Eligibility criteria for both phases of recruitment</title><p>To be eligible, participants must meet the following criteria:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders (version IV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder made using a standardised, semi-structured clinician-administered assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ongoing need for mental health care, defined as active prescription of psychotropic medication or prescription of psychotropic medication within the preceding 2 years, or the person being in partial or full relapse....

The BPRS-E is a 24-item, clinician-rated scale that was originally developed for detection of symptom change in persons with persistent SMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 to 7 (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not present; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;very mild; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;mild; 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate; 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderately severe; 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe and 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;extremely severe). The maximum total score is 168. The BRPS-E focuses on symptoms of psychosis but also has items covering the symptom domains of somatic concerns, anxiety, depression and mania. The total BPRS-E score is sensitive to change in treated in-patient populations of persons with persistent SMD, including those with diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The BPRS-E has also been used in treatment trials with out-patient populations of persons with SMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and has been used in Ethiopia previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Using a statistical approach, the &#x02018;reliable change index&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] for change in BPRS-E score from beginning to end of an in-patient admission in persons with SMD equated to 18 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. However, change in symptoms in a person with acute psychosis receiving in-patient care is likely to be larger than the MCID and not applicable to the out-patient sample of people with SMD to be included within this sample. In a study looking at change in symptoms in response to a psychological intervention for an out-patient sample of people with chronically symptomatic schizophrenia, a mean change of 7.9 points on the BPRS-E was considered clinically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A mean change of 7.9 points equates to a standardised effect size of around 0.50, which we take to be the MCID.

Trial data with unmasking potential (process data and data pertaining to adverse events) will be handled by the Butajira mental health research office following the same standardised operating procedures as for the Clinical Trials Unit. Data cleaning based on frequency distributions and logic checks will follow standard procedures with reference to source documents as required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Data analysis approach</title><p>Data analysis will follow a detailed statistical analysis plan that specifies all planned analyses. Data analysis will take place using Stata Version 13 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA) under the direction of the trial statisticians. All analyses will be masked to study arm until the analysis is finalized and approved by all investigators. Descriptive analyses will include frequency distributions and measures of central tendency and dispersion, as appropriate, with 95 % confidence intervals. Bivariable comparisons will employ &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact, Student&#x02019;s t- or rank-sum tests, as appropriate. All statistical tests will be one-sided at &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, as we are testing a hypothesis of non-inferiority and not superiority or equivalence.</p><p>Analysis will be by intention-to-treat, that is, on the basis of the group to which the participant is allocated randomly at the beginning of the trial. Intention-to-treat has the potential to lead to false acceptance of the hypothesis of non-inferiority in the presence of a true difference if there is a large cross-over from the primary care to the psychiatric nurse service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Therefore, the intention-to-treat analysis will be presented together with the percentage of participants who deviate from the protocol in the following ways: (1) cross-over protocol deviation which is indicated by the percentage who attend for more than two consecutive visits at the service they were not randomised to receive, unless they were referred to that service, and (2) disengagement from care protocol deviation, which is the percentage who miss more than 50 % of their scheduled health facility appointments (not attending within 2&#x000a0;weeks of the appointment date). Per protocol analyses will also be conducted, and the findings presented as a sensitivity analysis. Account will be taken of clustering at the level of the health facility.</p><p>Analysis will be carried out on the complete data set at 12 and 18&#x000a0;months. For the primary outcome time-point of 12&#x000a0;months, it would not be appropriate to carry forward the last observation to replace missing data as this would have taken place at the baseline of the study and could, therefore, increase the chance of non-inferiority even in the presence of a difference between the allocated services.</p><p>If more than 15 % of the primary outcome scores are missing, we will conduct multiple imputation analysis (including age, sex, baseline symptom severity and substance use disorder) in the model and present this as an exploratory analysis alongside the analysis on the complete dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>An interim analysis will be conducted at 12&#x000a0;months. The DSMB will assess the primary outcome (BPRS-E score) and adverse events by arm of the trial and decide if there is evidence of inferiority of one arm, guided by the definition of clinical inferiority used for the primary hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Analysis of primary outcome</title><p>The analysis for the primary outcome will be carried out by AHRI in order to ensure masking of the treatment group. The primary outcome measure (change in BPRS-E score) will be analysed using linear regression adjusting for baseline symptom severity. Statistical tests will be one-sided, reflecting our interest in testing the hypothesis that task-shared care is non-inferior. The validity of regression assumptions will be checked using residual plots. For the purpose of safety monitoring, the Phase 1 primary outcome at 12&#x000a0;months will be analysed as an interim analysis. For the purpose of hypothesis-testing for the main trial, Phase 1 and Phase 2 primary outcomes at 12&#x000a0;months will be combined. Both crude and adjusted (for baseline symptom severity, age and sex) effect sizes will be presented for the primary analysis. Exploratory analysis of the non-inferiority of the new intervention in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 participants will be carried out separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Analysis of secondary outcomes</title><p>These analyses will be carried out by the trial statisticians. The planned approach for data analysis of secondary outcomes is outlined in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Multivariable analysis will be used to adjust for the following potential confounding variables measured at baseline: age, sex, socioeconomic status, substance use and symptom severity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>The economic analysis will measure both the costs associated with a task-sharing model of care, as well as the consequential impact on service use. Local unit costs will be applied to resources used so as to estimate changes in services costs in both intervention and comparator groups. Time lost from work by people with SMD and their caregivers will be valued using appropriate wage rates, adjusted to take account of patterns of employment in an agrarian economy. Costs will be analysed using multiple regression analysis so that the effect of the intervention on costs can be estimated whilst adjusting for differences in participant characteristics. Non-parametric bootstrap methods will be used if the residuals of the regression model are non-normally distributed. Further regression models will include the main clinical measures so that the relationship between costs and outcomes can be assessed. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out. Differences in cost and primary outcome measure (BPRS-E) that take into account the uncertainty around point estimates will be plotted and subsequently presented as a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical approval for the trial has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University (Reference Number 030/12/Psy), the AHRI-ALERT Ethics Review Committee (Reference Number P037/13), the National Research Ethics Review Committee of Ethiopia (Reference Number 3.10/758/07), the Food, Medicine and Health Care Administration and Control Authority (Reference Number 02/6/22/13), the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference Number 226/2011) and the National Institute of Mental Health Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).</p><p>The trial will include people with SMD who lack capacity to consent to participate in the trial as long as they are not actively refusing and they have a guardian who gives permission. Given the lack of knowledge on task-sharing care for people with SMD, and the intention of the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to implement this new model of service provision, it is crucial that people with SMD who are representative of those who will receive the task sharing model in the future have the opportunity to participate in the study. In participants who lack capacity at baseline, the capacity to consent will be reviewed at follow-up assessment time-points. If the participant regains capacity, they will be informed about the trial and will only continue in the trial if they give informed consent. No out-patient treatment from non-specialist mental health workers will be provided to people with any mental disorder against their will, except for management of acute behavioural disturbance where the person poses an imminent risk to themselves or others.</p><p>There is genuine uncertainty as to whether or not a task-sharing model of mental health care for SMD can be as effective as mental health care delivered by mental health specialists, but also no evidence that it is any worse, supporting a position of clinical equipoise. In the absence of any difference in effectiveness of care, a task-sharing model of care may be preferred through being locally available, even if the practitioners delivering the care are not specialists.</p><p>During the trial period participants will directly benefit from free treatment for both mental and physical health problems. Participants will be compensated for transport and their time when attending for trial-related assessments. Transport costs for attending Butajira hospital will also be covered.</p><p>We anticipate that the main risks for those allocated to the task-sharing model of mental health care in PHC will be modest: 1) moving from a familiar arrangement to a new treatment setting may be unsettling at the beginning, and therefore, monthly reviews will be scheduled at the beginning of the trial in order to facilitate engagement; and 2) there is a risk of receiving inferior care, which will be detected through monitoring of clinical records, supervision and the 12&#x000a0;month interim analysis. It is not anticipated that either arm of the trial will be associated with an increase in serious or other adverse events; however, procedures are in place for minimising the risk of adverse events and ensuring monitoring, reporting and management of adverse events to the DSMB and other regulatory bodies. The risk of suicide will be minimised by excluding people who express active suicidal intent at the time of recruitment and requiring clinicians to use structured clinical follow-up forms that prompt for screening for suicide risk. The phased nature of recruitment is also designed to reduce risk of adverse events by ensuring that PHC workers have gained competence in managing care of people with stable or uncomplicated SMD before they take on the care of people with more complex illness. The occurrence of serious or other adverse events will be formally reviewed at 12&#x000a0;months as part of the interim analysis.</p><p>All trial-related assessments will take place in a location that respects the participant&#x02019;s privacy. The confidentiality of the participants will be respected, and the names of the patients will not be quoted or published.</p><p>The trial will be subjected to rigorous on-site monitoring of safety and quality at study initiation and thereafter twice per year by an independent external monitor reporting to the NIMH DSMB, in addition to routine reporting to the NIMH DSMB twice per year.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Discussion</title><p>A pressing need exists to scale up evidence-based packages of mental health care in LMICs and thereby improve the clinical, functional and social outcomes of people with mental disorders. Alongside this imperative runs a critical need to evaluate the success of the task-sharing models of mental health care, which are proposed as solutions to the treatment gap for mental disorders. Human resource and health system constraints mean that interventions that are demonstrated to be efficacious when evaluated individually cannot be assumed to be effective when delivered as part of a service in more real-world conditions. The dearth of high-quality mental health service trials from LMICs generally, and from low-income countries in particular, is a serious impediment to the successful scale-up of mental health care. The TaSCS trial seeks to provide high-quality evidence that will be timely for informing mental health care scale-up in other rural, low-income countries, as well as contributing to the international discourse on task sharing as an acceptable model of care for people with SMD.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started on 13 March 2015 and is ongoing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec42"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1191_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
