It consisted of two different phases, the assessment of tolerability phase on 20 healthy volunteers, and the evaluation of the efficacy on 21 subjects affected by chronic moderate/severe blepharitis; the treatment period was 2 weeks, followed by 1-week of follow-up. In the efficacy phase, in both eyes, eyelid hygiene was also performed. At day 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 a complete ophthalmological examination was performed. In the tolerability phase, signs of clinical toxicity were recorded and subject-reported symptoms were collected using a questionnaire. In the efficacy phase, global signs and symptoms of blepharitis scores were collected using standardized photographic scales and questionnaire. The statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No ocular signs of drug toxicity were reported. During the treatment period for tolerability phase, there were statistically significant higher scores of tearing and ocular discomfort in the tolerability study group versus the tolerability control group.

The presenting clinical features can be variable, depending on the association with coexisting ocular surface pathologies (eg, allergy or dry eye syndrome) and dermatologic conditions (eg, rosacea or seborrheic dermatitis). Blepharitis is usually a chronic condition, with recurrent acute exacerbations and relapses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-1403">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-7-1403">2</xref></p><p>Based on the anatomic classification of this condition, the clinical presentations can be divided in anterior blepharitis, involving the anterior lid margin, the base of the eyelashes, and the eyelash follicles, and posterior blepharitis, affecting the meibomian glands and gland orifices (meibomian gland dysfunction).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-1403">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-1403">3</xref> Anterior blepharitis has been traditionally sub-classified on the basis of the presumed etiology in staphylococcal, seborrheic, and mixed blepharitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-1403">1</xref></p><p>Staphylococcal blepharitis is associated with Grampositive bacterial colonization of the eyelid margin, most frequently <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, that can cause ocular surface chronic inflammation by toxic and immune-mediated mechanisms; seborrheic blepharitis is due to the overproduction of sebum and is often associated with seborrheic dermatitis of the eyebrows or of the scalp. On the other hand, posterior blepharitis has a prominent inflammatory etiology and is characterized by plugging of the meibomian gland orifices and by altered gland secretions.</p><p>Despite this classification, the etiology is often multifactorial and the most common presentations may have features of both anterior and posterior involvement, making blepharitis one the most difficult anterior segment conditions to manage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-1403">1</xref></p><p>Presently in the US there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapy of blepharitis, and there is no sufficient evidence to strongly recommend any one a treatment option.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-1403">1</xref></p><p>Given the frequent presence of both bacterial and inflammatory etiology, the management of blepharitis consists principally in accurate eyelid hygiene, warm compresses, topical antibiotic, systemic antibiotics (in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction and rosacea), artificial lubricants, and topical corticosteroid.

Topical corticosteroids are often used for the management of severe inflammation associated with blepharitis, and can offer patients rapid relief of symptoms. As their prolonged use can cause side-effects, such as IOP increase and cataract formation, they should only be used in short courses at the minimal dose. Given the frequent exacerbations and the severe chronic inflammation often occurring in blepharitis patients, sometimes not adequately managed with eyelid hygiene and artificial tears, the finding of new compounds that can exert anti-inflammatory activity without relevant side-effects is now considered more urgent.</p><p>Recently, the 18-beta-glycyrrhetic acid the triterpene structure of the HMGB1-binding compound glycyrrhizin, has been extensively studied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-7-1403">13</xref></p><p>Clinically, glycyrrhizin has been used for 20 years in Japan for the treatment of the viral hepatitis (hepatitis virus B and C),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-7-1403">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-7-1403">19</xref> and studies have demonstrated that glycyrrhizin affords protection in a mouse model of hepatitis B by impairing the HMGB1-dependent recruitment of immune cells in the liver.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-opth-7-1403">20</xref></p><p>Recent studies indicate an active role of HMGB1 release in inflammatory/degenerative pathologies of the eye: the protein is released in the aqueous humor or vitreous during experimental autoimmune processes, such as uveoretinitis in the rat,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-7-1403">10</xref> or bacterial infection such as endophthalmitis in humans;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-7-1403">11</xref> increased levels of extracellular HMGB1 have also been found in the vitreous of patients affected by proliferative diabetic- or vitreo-retinopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-7-1403">12</xref> Recently, it was also found that the concentration of HMGB1 in subjects affected by bacterial or allergic seasonal conjunctivitis is 15-fold higher than in healthy human subjects, and in patients with blepharitis it is 10-fold higher.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-7-1403">4</xref></p><p>18b-glycyrrhetic acid was also reported to impair antibody recognition of HMGB1, suggesting direct binding, to prevent HMGB1-dependent COX2 expression and cluster formation in primary cultures human macrophages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-7-1403">4</xref></p><p>The purpose of our study was to evaluate for the first time the tolerability profile in healthy volunteers and the efficacy in subjects affected by moderate/severe blepharitis of a novel medical device 5% glycyrrhizin and copolymer PEG/PPG ophthalmic solution (DMG Italia SRL).</p><p>In the tolerability evaluation phase, no clinical signs of clinical toxicity or hypersensitivity, no rise in IOP, and no serious adverse event were reported.

Although at day 0 the eyes randomized to the efficacy study group showed a higher score (corresponding to a worse clinical picture at baseline) than the efficacy control group, the difference was no more statistically significant at day 14, and at day 21 (follow-up) there was an inversion, with a lower global score in the efficacy study group.</p><p>Even if the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant at the end of treatment (day 14), these results can be interpreted in our opinion as a higher efficacy of the glycyrrhizin ophthalmic solution compared to lid hygiene alone, lasting after treatment suspension.</p><p>The principal limitations of our study were the small number of subjects (20 healthy volunteers and 21 blepharitis patients), the open-label design, and the short duration of follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, the 5% glycyrrhizin ophthalmic solution was well tolerated in healthy volunteers and in patients with chronic moderate/severe blepharitis, and in association with eyelid hygiene showed good clinical anti-inflammatory activity, lasting after suspension.</p><p>Further clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of the 5% glycyrrhizin and copolymer PEG/PPG ophthalmic solution in larger groups of patients for different periods of treatment and follow up. Given the high levels of HMGB1 also present in conjunctivitis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-7-1403">4</xref> glycyrrhizin can be considered a promising therapeutic option for other inflammatory conditions of the ocular surface.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Prof Riccardo Pistelli (Universit&#x000e0; Cattolica, Rome, Italy) for data management and statistics.
