Previous studies have demonstrated a rapid decline in oral hygiene compliance after the initial bonding, and the appliance favors plaque accumulation and represents an obstruction to the hygiene procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Optimal oral hygiene requires thorough and clear professional instructions, adequate tools, and patient motivation, which is an essential factor to obtain compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials conducted by Gao and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] showed varied success in using motivational approaches, which are potentially more useful to achieve behavioral changes than conventional health education, focusing on disseminating information and giving normative advice. Studies in medicine and dentistry have asserted that active reminders induce positive behavioral change and disease prevention. A 2009 systematic review of the influence of text messages on behavior changes in the medical field demonstrated positive behavior changes in 13 of the 14 studies examined by the authors, including smoking cessation therapy, diabetes self-management, and anti-obesity behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In dentistry, telephone calls and text messages can reduce appointment no-show rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>A follow-up procedure, which provides encouragement and reassurance after orthodontic treatments, may be helpful in reducing the participants&#x02019; feeling of uncertainty and anxiety. The gate control theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which integrates the sensory aspects of pain with cognitive behavioral and psychological factors, indicates that both anxiety and stress are directly correlated with the perception of pain that can be considered like a negative stimulus to obtain a proper behavior. Several studies have recently demonstrated that a telephone call or a text message from a healthcare provider during the first hours following orthodontic treatment significantly decreases post-procedural pain and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], facilitating also health-related lifestyle changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as these patients are less worried and they showed more aptitude for following oral hygiene instructions.</p><p>Bowen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have shown text messaging to be an effective tool for improving oral hygiene compliance in orthodontic patients.</p><p>A post-procedure communication between the orthodontist and the patients demonstrates that the orthodontist is concerned about patient&#x02019;s well-being, increasing patient&#x02019;s satisfaction, and improving orthodontist-patient relation. Reinforcing reciprocal confidence, the orthodontist will obtain a better adherence to oral hygiene protocol, making patients more aware about the advantages of a correct behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate in a short period of time the effects of a post-procedure communication on the oral hygiene compliance in a cohort of participants who underwent orthodontic treatments. As a secondary outcome, this research evaluated the best way to communicate with patients after the treatment to obtain the most compliance, comparing the effects of a structured telephone call to the ones of a structured text message.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Guidelines</title><p>The study was conducted according to current guidelines of CONSORT 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 patients&#x02019; flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40510_2016_154_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The phone calls and text message were performed 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;h after the bonding by the orthodontists. The structure of the call consisted of the following aspects: (i) to thank the participant for participating in the study and for attending the previous orthodontic appointment, (ii) to explain possible reasons of pain or discomfort, (iii) to encourage appropriate dental hygiene, (iv) to recommend adequate use of painkillers/analgesics, and (v) to stress the importance of a positive attitude towards orthodontic treatment.</p><p>All patients were bonded with fixed self-ligating maxillary appliances, but depending on the degree of crowding, some variation of the initial arch wire may have occurred in certain cases.

However, this last analysis was a subgroup analysis with multiplicity problems. To really evaluate the difference between the two communication methods, a new research is needed. In fact, it cannot be excluded that the effect of a communication with a text message with respect to that of a telephone call can be different. The difference also in median values of the plaque index, together with the interquartile range amount, between the two groups could raise some doubts about a real difference in influence on oral hygiene between the two communication procedures.</p><p>On the other hand, in this study design, the two methods were combined into one group only for a primary evaluation, because they are both commonly used in daily practice.</p><p>The theory of token economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] maintains that both positive and negative reinforcements are essential to obtain a proper behavior and to avoid the extinction process, described by Skinner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The lack of compliance may be explained by the pain associated with orthodontic procedures and by the absence of adequate encouragement. We believe that post-procedure interventions may facilitate health-related lifestyle changes, reducing the individual perception of pain (negative stimulus) and promote correct habits (positive stimulus). Significant correlation has been demonstrated between psychological factors and individual perception of pain, which can influence negatively the compliance, as patients worried about pain are less inclined to follow the correct rules. The positive stimulus is represented by the promotion of correct habits, encouraging appropriate dental hygiene and stressing the importance of a positive attitude towards orthodontic treatment.</p><p>In contrast to the social psychology literature, it takes a median time of 66&#x000a0;days to have significant results and to turn a behavior into an automatic habit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our study, differences in oral hygiene measures were seen at T1, which was two appointments after baseline. Instead, Eppright et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] demonstrated significantly lower plaque index scores in the text message group just at T2, which was four appointments or an average of 5.44&#x000a0;months after baseline (T0). Our results show that a text message, used as an active reminder, can induce positive behavioral change also after a short period of time.</p><p>Psychological approaches, such as the cognitive restructuring method, which provide encouragement and reassurance to reduce patients&#x02019; anxiety and feeling of uncertainty, may have a positive impact on the individual perception of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In our previous study, a verbal communication approach (i.e., spoken words) proved to be more powerful than a written approach on the perception of pain. Through a telephone call, it is possible to demonstrate empathy, understanding, and sharing other people&#x02019;s emotions and feelings. Engaged communication has been linked to decreasing patient anxiety that can lead to physiological effects and improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Studies in medicine and dentistry have shown text messaging to be an effective tool for behavioral change; for this purpose, the emotional component of the communication style appears to be less important than the control of the perception of pain, and the easy use and the accessibility of this kind of communication appear to be the key of its effectiveness.</p><p>Since its creation over 20&#x000a0;years ago, SMS or short message service has revolutionized the way we communicate. In 2011, 7.8 trillion SMS messages were sent globally, highlighting that SMS is a mass communications medium used by billions of people around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>There is a vast body of research aimed at understanding how and why people, in particular teenagers, have adopted SMS communication in their daily lives. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, researchers have explored various factors behind the adoption, usage, and language of SMS messages across different countries and demographics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The studies describe that SMS or text messaging is an area of growth in the communications field. The findings suggest that text messaging is being used by a wide range of people for all kinds of activities and that for some people it is the preferred way of communication. The SMS message goes directly to the individual without external interferences, it avoids the embarrassment of a face-to-face interaction, it is more discreet than a telephone call, it gives more time to think about the content and the structure of the communication, and it guarantees the possibility to send a standard message avoiding the emotional and empathic influence of a verbal confront.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of the present study is that the plaque index was measured only at the first appointment after bonding. Further investigations should analyze the effects of repeated motivation on PI score trends during the entire duration of orthodontic treatment in order to provide an orthodontic hygiene protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Even though a certain degree of bias exists in any randomized clinical trial, we tried to minimize major potential biases.
