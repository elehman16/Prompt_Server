INTRODUCTION</title><p>The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly worldwide. Physical inactivity and obesity are the major determinants of disease and with the heritage are the main causes of insulin resistance, which reduces the sensitivity of tissues to insulin and brings in prediabetes condition. Persons with prediabetes are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, and also in an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Prediabetes or disturbed glycoregulation means that blood sugar is above normal, but not so large that they meet the requirement for the diagnosis of diabetes, and there are categories: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).</p><p>Primary prevention refers to intervention before the development of an underlying disorder, and is trying to prevent its occurrence and development. Usually involves attempts to influence the risk factors, in terms of reducing their impact, and strengthen protective factors.</p><p>One of the most used strategies for primary prevention is education. Primary prevention of DM 2 entails health monitoring of people at risk categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>).</p><p>Screening asymptomatic patients as well as health monitoring risk categories include the following activities: education about diabetes, education about healthy nutrition and physical activity, prevention and treatment of obesity, measures to protect the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>Secondary prevention includes measures for the early detection of diabetes by mass examinations of the population and screening examinations with increased surveillance of the risk categories for diabetes (patients with prediabetes, IFG and IGT), and people with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it is recommended preventive use of metformin in patients with IFG and IGT that increases glucose utilization and sensitivity of insulin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). People with impaired glycemic control are at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes and enter in the intensive supervision program for primary and secondary prevention of DM 2. The objective of the study was to examine the effects of various measures of prevention to the glycemia and obesity, by lifestyle modification and metformin treatment in patients with prediabetes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective study was performed in the Team 1 Family Medicine Health Center Kalesija.</p><p>The study was conducted in three groups of 20 patients each (total of 60 patients) aged 45 to 80, with an abnormal glycoregulation and prediabetes. The study did not include patients who already met the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. During the study period of 6 months, one group was extensively educated on changing lifestyle (healthy nutrition and increased physical activity), the second group was treated with 500 mg metformin twice a day, while the control group was advised about diet and physical activities but different from the first two groups. At beginning of the study, all patients were measured initial levels of blood glucose, HbA1C, BMI, body weight and height and waist size. Also the same measurements were taken at the end of the conducted research, 6 months later. For the assessment of diabetes control was conducted fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test and 2 hours after a glucose load, and HbA1C.</p><p>The results are expressed as average values with standard deviation. Comparison between the groups of patients was made using the Student T-test for continuous variables and <italic>HI square</italic> or Fisher&#x02019;s test for categorical variables.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3. RESULTS</title><p>At the beginning of the study the average HbA1C (%) values in three different groups according to the type of intervention (lifestyle changes, metformin, control group) were as follows: (6.4 &#x000b1; 0.5 mmol/l), (6.5 &#x000b1; 1.2 mmol/l), (6.7 &#x000b1; 0.5 mmol/l). At the end of the research, the average HbA1C values were: 6.2 &#x000b1; 0.3 mmol/ l, 6.33 &#x000b1; 0.5 mmol/l and 6.7 &#x000b1; 1.4 mmol/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the control group, in the group of patients who received intensive training on changing lifestyle or group that was treated with metformin, there was a significant reduction in the mean fasting glucose and HbA1C value, they were above the reference range, but were not sufficient for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Changing lifestyle (healthy nutrition and increased physical activity) led to significant reduction in initial body weight in 60% of patients, BMI in 65% of patients, waist size in 60% of patients, and HbA1C in 55% of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Metformin therapy led to a decrease in the average initial body weight by 3.83 kg, BMI by 1.33, the waist size by 3.27 cm, HbA1C by 0.13% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig003">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>4. DISCUSSION</title><p>Prevention of diabetes type 2 can be achieved with lifestyle changes and the use of some medications. There is evidence that combined diet and exercise, as well as drug therapy (metformin, acarbose), can be effective in people with IGT in order to prevent progression to diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Our results showed that, in contrast to the control group, the group with changing lifestyles, and a group treated with metformin, significantly reduced the initial body weight, BMI, waist size and HbA1C. Some studies suggest that weight loss of 5 to 10% of the initial body weight during the six-month period improved overall metabolic and glycemic control in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). In our study, reduced levels of fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were outside of the reference range, but it was not sufficient for the diagnosis of diabetes. Also, the initial decrease in body weight, BMI and waist size in our study was similar to the published results of studies conducted in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), which was proven to significantly reduce the risk of diabetes associated with lifestyle modifications, as well as studies in which was proven to reduce the risk of diabetes associated with a healthy diet (31%), exercise (46%), and a healthy diet and exercise (42%), by study conducted in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>In DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) Study the incidence of diabetes was reduced by 58% in the group with changing lifestyle and about 31% in the group treated with metformin, compared to placebo group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Insufficience of our study was that the treatment duration of only 6 months was not long enough to lead to a significant loss of body weight, BMI, and to reduce abnormal glucose regulation. Lack of the respondents willing to participate in the study and some other issues made it difficult to conduct research that would last longer. Finally, the benefits will depend on whether the glycemia could be held below those values as diagnostic criteria for prediabetes, and whether maintaining these low values would improve the long-term outcome. Also, this study did not show what are the individual contributions of physical activity and diet for the overall lifestyle change benefits, which could be investigated in the future.</p><p>Some studies suggests that prevention of diabetes leads to significant reduction of atherosclerosis, that is the main cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), which could also be investigated in the future.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. CONCLUSION</title><p>Lifestyle modification (diet and increased physical activity) improves glycemic regulation and reduces obesity, can prevent or delay the onset of developing type 2 diabetes. Pharmacological treatment with metformin also reduces the risk, although less dramatically. It is assumed, that the good and ongoing diabetes prevention through education about the benefits of lifestyle change and metformin treatment could lead to a reduction in atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases, which are the main cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Diabetes Association Screening for type 2 diabetes</article-title>. <source>Diabetes Care</source>. <year>2004</year>; <volume>27</volume>(Suppl. <issue>1</issue>): <fpage>S11</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>S14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14693922</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Dowd</surname><given-names>JE.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Primary prevention of type 2 (non-insulindependent) diabetes mellitus</article-title>. <source>Diabetologia</source>. <year>1990</year>; <volume>33</volume>: <fpage>3</fpage>-<lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2406178</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Knowler</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrett-Connor</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
