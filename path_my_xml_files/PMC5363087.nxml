Symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) are extremely common in patients with HCM, and patients with HCM also have a high prevalence of nonfatal arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardias (45%), atrial fibrillation (25&#x02013;30%), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (26%). HCM is also the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. Progression to disabling and debilitating symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Classes III and IV) is relatively common, occurring in 15&#x02013;20% of unselected populations.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Symptom management can be very challenging and involve multiple medications, with 5% of patients developing drug refractory heart failure. Currently, there is no cure for this common cardiac genetic malady.</p><p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors effectively prevent and ameliorate HCM in a transgenic rabbit model. Atorvastatin prevents the onset of hypertrophy,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and simvastatin causes the regression of established hypertrophy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] As well, human data suggest a similar potential benefit. Statin therapy was associated with improved survival in a retrospective study of 551 patients with ischemic and nonischemic CHF.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] there was 20% of reduction in heart failure with simvastatin compared to placebo. In a prospective randomized trial in patients with dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, simvastatin significantly improved both NYHA functional class and LV ejection fraction (LVEF).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, we evaluated the effects of atorvastatin on LV hypertrophy (LVH) in a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with HCM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The Statin Induced Regression of Cardiomyopathy Trial (SIRCAT) was a proof-of-concept, prospective, parallel design, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the University of Calgary, Canada, between July 2007 and December 2010.

Secondary outcomes include (1) improvement in myocardial relaxation velocities by echocardiography, (2) change in maximal ventricular wall cross-sectional width, and (3) change in volume of dense myocardial fibrosis (absolute, fibrotic mass, and percentage) as quantified by MRI. Follow-up visits were performed at 6 and 12 months. All images were deanonymized and assessed blindly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging</title><p>All CMR studies were performed using a clinical 1.5-T MRI system (Avanto<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen Germany) with a 32-channel cardiac coil and retrospective electrocardiogram gating. The CMR imaging protocol included standard, end-expiratory cine imaging in sequential planes (from above the mitral valve annulus to beyond the LV apex) using a steady-state free-precession pulse sequence. Typical imaging parameters were: Slice thickness 10 mm, gap 0 mm, TE 1.12 ms, flip angle 74&#x000b0;, matrix 256 &#x000d7; 205, temporal resolution 30&#x02013;67 ms, acceleration factor of 2. Gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (0.175 mmol/kg) was administered intravenously. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging (LGE) imaging was obtained with the following parameters: Phase-sensitive inversion recovery, slice thickness 10 mm, TE 3.35 ms, flip angle 25&#x000b0;, and TR 550 ms.</p><p>All images were de-identified and digitally stored for off-line analysis. Sequential short-axis cine image data sets were examined to determine the LV volumes and mass by semi-automated contour tracing.

Grothues <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported a within-patient SD of 8.4 g for two CMR measurements in a single day. We doubled the daily within-patient SD of 8.4&#x02013;17.0 g to accommodate increased variability with time. Using the targeted effect size (20 g) and estimated SD (17 g), 16 completed patients would be required per group to achieve 90% power with a two-sided type I error of 5%. This was inflated to 38 recruited patients to allow for a 15% patient loss due to drop-out, noncompliance, and loss to follow-up. However, the executive Committee elected to stop the study after 22 patients had been enrolled for logistic reasons, recognizing the complete follow-up, and compliance. This provided &#x0003e;80% power with a two-sided type I error of 5% to detect the prespecified effect size.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample distributions were summarized and described with means and SDs as well as median and interquartile ranges if appropriate.

Atorvastatin did not have any effect on the primary outcome of regression in the LV mass after 12 months of follow-up.</p><p>This randomized clinical trial was prompted by contemporary and compelling evidence that statins prevent and reverse HCM in rabbits, reverse hypertrophy in humans, and reduce heart failure symptoms in patients with reduced LVEFs. Simvastatin induced the regression of cardiac hypertrophy <italic>in vivo</italic> in a transgenic rabbit model of human HCM.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Rabbits with &#x003b2;-myosin heavy chain HCM received either simvastatin or placebo. The simvastatin group had a significant reduction in LV mass, interventricular posterior wall thickness, LV filling pressure, and lower left atrial pressure. Similarly, simvastatin given to rats with LVH significantly improved LV function.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Statins also prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy in young transgenic rabbits carrying the myosin heavy chain mutation Q403 without cardiac hypertrophy at baseline.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, statins both prevent the development and induce the regression of HCM in rabbits carrying a mutated gene for HCM.</p><p>Analyses of several retrospective and randomized clinical trials of statins suggested that they may reduce LV mass and improve heart failure. A recent retrospective case&#x02013;control study evaluated the association between treatment with statins and regression of cardiac mass in 304 patients with angina who underwent angiography.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Patients treated with statins finished the study with a significantly lower LV mass index compared to the control subjects. In two randomized studies of pravastatin in hypertensive and normotensive patients, pravastatin significantly reduced LV mass.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Finally, statins reduced heart failure symptoms and improved cardiac function in one large retrospective study[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and two large randomized studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>These reports prompted the SIRCAT study, which was designed as a pilot, proof-of-principle assessment in the anticipation of a subsequent randomized trial with clinical outcomes. The study was negative, finding no benefit in any measure of myocardial mass, volume, or function. The close similarity between control and experimental point estimates suggests that the negative results are not due simply to inadequate power. It might be that the highly selected randomized sample in some way provided an atypical population. As well, there may be important differences between our patients with HCM and the transgenic rabbit model. Similarly, there are important differences among HCM, hypertensive heart disease, and myocardial hypertrophy that mitigated against a successful study.</p><p>Since the implementation of SIRCAT two similar studies have been published. Nagueh <italic>et al</italic>. reported[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] the results of an open-label, uncontrolled, prospective, dose-ranging study of atorvastatin in 32 patients with HCM. Only 11 subjects completed the 12-month study, and there was no significant improvement while taking atorvastatin in brain natriuretic peptide, NYHA functional class, or any echocardiographic measure of ventricular mass, or diastolic function. Echocardiography has considerably higher interstudy variability than does cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Bauersachs <italic>et al</italic>. reported a study[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] very similar to SIRCAT: A prospective, placebo-controlled study of atorvastatin, with 22 randomized patients followed for 9 months. LV mass was estimated with cardiac MRI. They too detected no significant benefit from atorvastatin. Kostner[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reviewed these and earlier animal and human studies and raised the possibility that the two reports of statins and HCM may have been underpowered, or limited by drop-out. With this third negative report and second tightly controlled randomized clinical trial with negative results, the answer now seems conclusive: Atorvastatin does not cause regression of LV mass in subjects with HCM.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Limitations</title><p>As with earlier studies, SIRCAT was composed of a small sample size, but due to the low interstudy variability of cardiac MRI, it had adequate power to detect a clinically significant difference.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] As with Bauersachs <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] a very small proportion of patients who were screened was eventually randomized, and it remains possible that there was an unintended selection bias. There are several genes known to be associated with HCM, and it is possible that our subjects had genotypes that did not respond to atorvastatin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"
