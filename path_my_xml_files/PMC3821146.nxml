Background</title><p>Infectious and inflammatory diseases which involve pharynx, tonsils and adenoid, are of
great importance among children&#x02019;s diseases. They mostly result in two common
pediatric surgeries: tonsillectomy, and adenotonsillectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R1">1</xref>). Modern anesthesiology has been focused on perioperative period
along with intraoperative period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R2">2</xref>). Post
tonsillectomy pain is a common problem of this surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R3">3</xref>). Severe pain can cause reduction in oral intake, dehydration, impairment or
latency in recovery after surgery. The most common administered drug for reducing post
tonsillectomy pain is acetaminophen but it cannot relief pain completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R4">4</xref>). In a questionnaire study including 52 children
following tonsillectomy, 90% of the children receiving paracetamol as pain medication,
experienced pain at home during the first 24 h after the operation, and in many cases the
pain still remained seven days after the operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R5">5</xref>). Thus along with acetaminophen, other drugs are used for lowering post
tonsillectomy pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), opiates,
injectable steroids, topical anesthetizing sprays, fibrin glue, fusa fungine or sucralfate
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R7">7</xref>), but the efficacy and side
effects of these agents necessitate more surveys to find post tonsillectomy pain relieving
drugs besides acetaminophen. It is a long time that honey is used for its biological and
therapeutic effects. About 400 years before Jesus Christ, Hypocrite used honey for wound
healing, especially the ones on foot. Even ancient Egyptians used honey for treatment of the
corneal and conjunctival inflammation, and burns at about 5000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R9">9</xref>). In
modern medicine, honey has been used successfully in treatment of burns, split-thickness
skin graft donor site, necrotizing fasciitis, operation site infection in neonates, skin
injuries, pressure induced wounds, infective wounds, infected surgical wounds, diabetic
wounds, malignancy related wounds, gangrene, osteomyelitis, gingivitis, periodontal
diseases, bullous keratopathy, and corneal lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R10">10-13</xref>). Honey speeds up healing in
chronic wound by stimulating production of inflammatory cytokines (CK) from monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R14">14</xref>) and keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R15">15</xref>). It is shown that honey motivates monocytes to secret CKs like
Interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. These mediators play an
important role in healing, and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R17">17</xref>). Administration of oral honey
after tonsillectomy in children decreases the need to analgesics via pain reduction after
surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R9">9</xref>). In previous studies, there is no
report for honey&#x02019;s side effects in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R18">18</xref>). Human allergy to honey is rare, but an allergic reaction to
proteins and allergens of honey is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R10">10</xref>). Honey rarely contains clostridial spores which cause wound botulism, however
there is no report through many researches when open wound is being sterilized before honey
usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec11722"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of honey administration on pain along
with acetaminophen, following pediatric tonsillectomy or adenotonsilectomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec11723"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><p>The study design was randomized, double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. One
hundred and two patients, aging from 8 to 15 years, who had been referred to otolaryngeal
clinic of Khatam-ol-anbia hospital (a referral and educational hospital) in Zahedan, Iran
were recruited. This study was approved by the regional ethics committee of Hospital. Inform
consent was obtained from each parent. All subjects who had the indication of tonsillectomy,
and had undergone classic tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy were included in this
study. For all the subjects, endotracheal intubation and anesthesia method was the same
(Fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg, Lidocaine 1 mg/kg, Thiopental Na 5 mg/kg, and Atracurium 0.6 mg/kg,
for induction, and a mix of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)/oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) 50%/50%,
Sevoflurane 3.3%, and Atracurium 0.2 mg/kg every 30 minutes were used as maintenance).
Subjects who had allergy to honey or acetaminophen, disliked to consume honey, were affected
to diabetes mellitus, had abnormal coagulopathy or any extra surgery were excluded from the
study. The acetaminophen group was treated with antibiotic (amoxicillin 40 mg/kg),
acetaminophen (15 mg/kg/dose maximum 5 times a day), and as placebo, a tea spoon (5 ml) of
sugar syrup in honey-like concentration, consistency and coloring (no artificial color or
flavor was added). Acetaminophen-plus-honey group was treated with antibiotic (amoxicillin
40 mg/kg), acetaminophen (15 mg/kg/dose maximum 5 times a day), and a tea spoon (5 ml) of
honey when they woke up. Parents were asked to give acetaminophen to their children.
Acetaminophen was used as tablet 325 mg after 24 hour post tonsillectomy according to
patient&#x02019;s request and severity of pain. Administration of placebo and honey was
started when the patient was able to have oral intake and continued for 5 days. Six hours
after the operation the patients began to have oral intake, and all of them tolerated PO. To
prevent bias, the study was designed double blinded, and none of the patients and their
parents knew what their group is, as well as the surgeon. From the first to 5th day after
the operation, visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied for subjective assessment of
postoperative pains by the parents every day, and also 4 hours after acetaminophen
consumption, while the numbers of painkillers taken daily and awaking at night due to pain
were used for objective assessment. The Statistical Package of Social Science version 15.0
(SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used for data analysis. Statistical significance was
noted for p value of &#x02264; 0.05. Chi-square test was used to compare frequencies and
distributions, and t-test was used to compare quantitative data and means between groups.
Data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></sec><sec id="sec11724"><title>4. Results</title><p>The study consisted of 52 subjects in case group and 52 ones in control group. Totally, 48
subjects were male (46.1%), and 56 cases were female (53.8%). There was no significant
difference between groups in gender. Age range of subjects was 8 to 15 years. The average
age in the case group was nine years, and in the control group was 10 years. There was no
significant difference in age, between groups. From the first day to the third day after the
operation, the mean pain score in case group (honey) was significantly less than control
group (placebo) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3524">Table 1</xref>). In the 4th day after
the operation, pain score in case group was 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.28 and in control group was 2.6
&#x000b1; 0.3, which was not statistically significant. Similarly, in the fifth day
postoperative, there was no significant difference between groups in pain scores. From the
first to fifth day after the operation, the need to analgesics was significantly lower in
honey group compared to the placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3525">Table 2</xref>).
There was not any significant difference between groups in awaking at night because of pain.
There was not any allergic reaction to honey in this study.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3524" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Pain Scores of Groups in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd DayAfter Tonsillectomy (Variables

Discussion</title><p>Medical practitioners have become increasingly concerned about adequate pain management
because of the increasing number of complex outpatient procedures, and ambulatory surgeries
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R21">21</xref>). Nowadays honey is one of the remedies
being used widespread, and is not palatable even for children. In a meta-analysis held by
Wijesinghe et al. in 2009, it was reported that those studies indicated markedly greater
efficacy of honey compared with alternative dressing treatments for superficial or partial
thickness burns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R22">22</xref>). Macroscopic and
microscopic studies under in vivo assessment suggested that the topical application of honey
influences the various phases of burn and wound healing by anti-inflammatory agents, and
growth factors from monocytes, and the mechanisms are unclear yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R14">14</xref>). The data show that the wound healing properties of honey
include stimulation of tissue growth, enhanced epithelialization, and minimized scar
formation. These effects are ascribed to honey&#x02019;s acidity, hydrogen peroxide content,
osmotic effect, nutritional and antioxidant contents, stimulation of immunity, and to
unidentified compounds. Prostaglandins and nitric oxide play a major role in inflammation,
microbial killing, and the healing process. Honey was found to lower prostaglandin levels
and elevate nitric oxide end products. These properties might help to explain some
biological and therapeutic properties of honey, particularly as an antibacterial agent or
wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R23">23</xref>). The most common morbidities
after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy are bleeding, edema, nausea, vomiting,
poor oral intake, and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R24">24</xref>). Despite
advances in anesthetic and surgical techniques, post tonsillectomy morbidity remains a major
clinical problem. On the other hand, many studies are being performed to find treatments
with fewer side effects, especially for pediatric patients who are more sensitive. Many
researches have been performed to investigate different analgesics&#x02019; effects on post
tonsillectomy pain, especially together with acetaminophen. In many studies, relief of early
postoperative pain, in first hours of operation, was investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R26">26</xref>). On the other
hand, many studies look into postoperative pain after recovery room; in a study held in
Finland, it was shown that ketoprofen combined with paracetamol - codeine seems to provide
sufficient analgesia during 10 days after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R27">27</xref>). A systematic review published in the same country revealed that no analgesic
in single prophylactic dosage is enough to provide analgesia during the day of operation,
thus, repeated administration, and also combination with NSAIDS, and titrated opioids are
needed to reach optimal result, and guarantee freedom from pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R28">28</xref>). It also recommended the use of oral acetaminophen rather than
rectal form, as used in our study. In a study from Turkey in 2006, the post tonsillectomy
effect of honey in pain killing was surveyed for 14 days, and it was reported that pain
scores in first two days after the operation were significantly less in honey group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9246R9">9</xref>), compared to our study which shows this difference
from the first to the third day after tonsillectomy. They also reported the reduction in
taking analgesics from the first to 8th day post tonsillectomy. Similarly, our study shows
significant difference of using analgesics in all five days of study and by using honey, the
need for using analgesics decreased. Oral administration of honey after wake up, following
tonsillectomy or adenotonsilectomy can reduce postoperative pain in pediatric patients, and
may substantially decrease the need for analgesics during taking honey in this challenging
group. More studies are necessary to be performed to investigate microscopic mechanisms of
honey pain relieving effects. There were some limitations in this study such as:
disagreement of parents in continuing their cooperation, the child&#x02019;s dislike for
eating the placebo or honey, misunderstanding of the details of VAS by parents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and health services.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn8217" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:</bold>
