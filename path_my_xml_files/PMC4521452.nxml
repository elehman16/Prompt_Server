The intervention comprised a mobile application &#x02013; <italic>Breathe-easy</italic><sup><italic>&#x000a9;</italic></sup> supported by a Bluetooth-enabled handheld device (COPD-6&#x000ae;), which was used for self-monitoring of lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>6</sub>) twice daily, and recording asthma symptoms and medication usage weekly; and a written asthma action plan (WAAP). The primary outcome measure is change in asthma control measured using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). Secondary outcomes include changes in mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (mAQLQ) score, lung function, asthma-related health visits, days off work/study, and oral corticosteroid use.

Previous studies have demonstrated that asthma during pregnancy improves in slightly more than a quarter of patients, but worsens in slightly more than one-third, and remains unchanged in one-third [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Poorly controlled asthma increases the risk of poor outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and need for caesarean delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given the lifelong health decrements associated with these outcomes, an approach to optimise monitoring and treatment of asthma could have major short and long term public health benefits.</p><p>Education and regular monitoring by a pharmacist-led multidisciplinary team has been shown to improve asthma control during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Asthma management programs for pregnant women which involve regular monitoring of lung function and assessment of asthma symptoms appear to be effective in reducing asthma exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, further studies are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Better asthma control can be achieved if patients are involved in self-management. This includes self-monitoring of asthma symptoms or lung function and following written asthma action plans while maintaining regular contact with their health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Telehealth supports asthma management through patient education, adherence support, telephone follow-up and remote monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Telehealth interventions have shown significant clinical improvement and potential benefits in patients with asthma, including: reduced time to access healthcare services and reduced cost linked to travelling; earlier detection of worsening asthma (e.g. exacerbations), and reduced healthcare visits/hospitalisations due to asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Lung function data derived from telehealth assessment studies were comparable to those collected under supervision by healthcare professionals and thus valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Telehealth programs also appeared to be feasible for asthma patients, as compliance with monitoring was high and most patients found the equipment easy to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Telehealth studies show potential benefits for asthma management in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However the feasibility of telehealth for supporting asthma management in pregnant women has not been investigated to date. Pregnant women with asthma are young and are likely to be willing to use new technology to assist self-management of their asthma. Hence, the present study will examine the potential for enhanced asthma management in pregnancy through a telehealth program.</p><p>The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a telehealth intervention supported by a handheld respiratory device and a written asthma action plan (WAAP) for management of asthma in improving asthma control during pregnancy. We hypothesised that the telehealth intervention group will have better asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score changes than the control group at three and six months from baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p>Participants were recruited when attending scheduled antenatal visits at two large maternity hospitals in Melbourne, Australia (Mercy Hospital for Women and The Royal Women&#x02019;s Hospital); each hospital has approximately 6000 births per year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a prospective multi-centre single-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) with outcome assessors masked to group allocation at follow-up assessments.

The daily lung function data were uploaded to a central server where the researchers, participants and their health professionals had secure access to the data. The participants&#x02019; health professionals were contacted by one of the researchers, a trained asthma educator (EZ), if any medication changes or unscheduled asthma-related visits were needed.</p><p>A WAAP consistent with NAC guidelines was designed for each participant based on information obtained at baseline. The WAAP contained instructions on which medications to take when feeling well, how to recognise worsening asthma, what to do when symptoms are getting worse and what to do in the event of an acute attack, including a first aid plan. Each participant received an automated weekly message regarding their asthma status based on the <italic>Breathe-easy</italic><sup>&#x000a9;</sup> algorithm that was designed based on NAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). An automated weekly message of overall asthma control status was displayed as &#x02018;well-controlled&#x02019; (score 0, green zone), or &#x02018;not well controlled&#x02019; (score 5, yellow zone and score 6, orange zone) to encourage participants to follow their agreed asthma action plan and/or contact their health professional the next working day if there was no improvement. If the asthma control status was displayed as &#x02018;very poorly controlled&#x02019; (score 7&#x02013;15, red zone), patients were prompted to follow their agreed asthma action plan and contact their health professional on the same day.

Lung function testing (pre-bronchodilator) was performed by trained research assistants using EasyOne&#x02122; Worldspirometer (ndd Medizintechnik AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Maternal and neonatal outcomes data collected are the gestational age of the baby at delivery, development of any antenatal complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, fetal growth restriction, antepartum hemorrhage, and delivery details. Neonatal outcomes collected at delivery include birth weight centile, birth length, head circumference, and Appearance Pulse Grimace Activity and Respiratory (APGAR) scores at 1 and 5&#x000a0;min after delivery. Birth weight centiles were calculated using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gestation.net/grow-au.aspx">www.gestation.net/grow-au.aspx</ext-link>, which adjusted for maternal characteristics including height, weight, ethnicity, parity and fetal gender.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data collection and follow-up</title><p>ACQ, mAQLQ scores, asthma-related health visits, asthma-related days off work/study, and&#x000a0;oral corticosteroid use were collected at baseline, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months from baseline to allow comparisons. Identical data collection forms were used for both groups. Maternal and neonatal outcomes data were collected shortly after delivery by reviewing medical records. The assessors responsible for collecting outcome data at three and six months were masked to the participant group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size of 28 per arm is sufficient to detect the minimum clinically important difference in ACQ score of 0.5 or more between treatment groups using a standard deviation of 0.66 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

If these improvements are sustained at 6&#x000a0;months, then with 28 evaluable subjects in each arm, and assuming an independence model for measurement variation, and an intraclass correlation of 0.5 (equivalent to a within patient variance of 0.218 when the total variance is 0.66<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.436), the F-test, conducted at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level will have at least 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a treatment by time interaction effect. If these conjectured improvements by month 3 are not durable and the scores return, on average, to their baseline levels at 6&#x000a0;months, then both the F-test for the interaction and the two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test comparing the two arms at month 3 at the 5&#x000a0;% level of significance will continue to have at least 80&#x000a0;% power.

The MASTERY trial is designed to evaluate a telehealth program aimed at helping pregnant women with asthma to monitor their lung function and better manage their asthma during pregnancy. The Vitalograph COPD-6&#x000ae; is designed to enable the lung function data to be transmitted automatically via a Bluetooth connection to another enabled device (e.g. phone, computer). In our study, the Breathe-easy<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> application installed on a smart phone acquires the data and transmits via internet to a secure website, which can be accessed only by patients and other authorized personnel.</p><p>Automatic transmission can minimise the risk of errors when data are entered/reported manually. The <italic>Breathe-easy</italic><sup>&#x000a9;</sup> application has been developed to record lung function data, asthma symptoms and medication usage and provides a user-friendly interface through a smart mobile phone. Recording symptoms as part of asthma management is known to reduce costs associated with unplanned hospitalisation and improved quality of life in asthma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Daily recording of lung function and weekly assessment of asthma symptoms could allow women to recognize early worsening of their asthma control. Participants in the intervention group were provided with a WAAP as it was part of the algorithm of the telehealth intervention (MASTERY). The automated messages sent to each participant in the intervention group contained feedback regarding their asthma control/condition and asked them to refer to their individualised WAAP for further management. The individualised WAAP designed for each woman provided clear guidelines in terms of actions to be taken in case of worsening asthma. Although the WAAP alone may be effective in achieving asthma control, the telehealth (Breathe-easy<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>) app had additional features for monitoring and recording symptoms and lung function to give instant feedback to participants about their asthma status using an algorithm based on an individualized WAAP.</p><p>The proposed intervention has the potential to identify worsening asthma control early and prevent asthma exacerbations during pregnancy by regularly monitoring lung function and asthma symptoms. This may translated to reduce health care costs through fewer asthma-related unplanned medical and emergency department visits. If the intervention is efficacious, this could potentially influence clinical practice and health policy.
