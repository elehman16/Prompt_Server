work at night in a three-shift system. Of the 15 nurses who were included as study
subjects on a night shift, eight took two short naps (the Nap condition), and seven worked
without taking a nap (the No-nap condition) during the night shift. We measured sublingual
temperature and the bispectral index (BIS), obtained heart rate and heart rate variability
measures from an electrocardiogram (ECG), and evaluated sleepiness and fatigue levels
every hour using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Both subjective sleepiness and fatigue
increased between 4:00 and 5:00, with no significant differences observed between the two
groups. However, the low- to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF) in the Nap condition group was
found to be significantly lower than in the No-nap condition group. Furthermore, a sudden,
brief increase in HF values was observed in the No-nap condition group in the morning. The
results of this study suggest that taking two short naps may effectively reduce tension
and prevent a brief increase in HF values by suppressing sympathetic nervous activity in
the morning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Two 15-min naps</kwd><kwd>Nurse</kwd><kwd>Sleepiness</kwd><kwd>Fatigue</kwd><kwd>Night shift work</kwd><kwd>Heart rate variability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Japan today, a variety of businesses, including medical care organizations,
manufacturers, and service industries, provide 24-h services; our modern society would not
function without night work. However, night or shift work disrupts regular life rhythms,
posing a wide range of safety and health risks, such as increased fatigue and lack of
rest<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this context, it is essential to develop
and implement measures to enhance the safety of night shift workers.</p><p>In particular, nurses work shifts because they are required to provide patients with
around-the-clock health care services. In Japan, nurses work on a two- or three-shift
system. According to the results of previous studies, nurses working a night shift often
feel sleepy, fatigued and weighed down in the morning<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which increases the risk of
accidents, burnout, and turnover<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has
also been pointed out that car accident rates are high among night shift nurses on their way
home<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Humans have biological clocks that follow a circadian rhythm of approximately 24&#x02005;h. The
circadian rhythm may be seen in patterns of sleeping and waking<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, secretion of hormones such as melatonin<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>
and in body temperature<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Normally,
patterns of sleeping and waking are synchronized with internal rhythms such as body
temperature. People sleep during periods of low body temperature<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and are aroused and active during periods of high body
temperature.</p><p>However, shift workers are forced to work with their patterns of sleeping and waking out of
balance with their body temperature and hormonal rhythms, which poses a high risk to their
health<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to increased
early morning sleepiness, fatigue, and decreased performance, the risk of cancer, high blood
pressure, heart disease, and gastrointestinal disease can also increase as shift work
continues<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, napping has received attention as a method of reducing the bodily fatigue
of night shift nurses and alleviating their sleepiness<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. A 15-min nap in the
daytime is believed to effectively maintain arousal levels<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Napping during a night
shift is regarded as a feasible measure to reduce the burden on night shift nurses because
it helps reduce the disruption of the regular sleep-wake rhythms of those who work in the
daytime and sleep at night<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Napping is also expected to reduce fatigue and
sleepiness, and improve how the time during off-duty hours is spent. Previous studies have
shown that napping for 60&#x02013;120&#x02005;min during the night shift is effective for reducing fatigue
and sleepiness and maintaining performance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Japanese law stipulates that nurses
working for more than 8&#x02005;h must take at least a 60-min break, and most hospital nurses
working on a three-shift system take a 60- to 75-min rest at night<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is difficult for nurses to spend the entire
break napping since the break must also include time for eating and providing care to
patients. As a substitute for 60&#x02005;min of napping, 40-min napping has been shown to improve
performance<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and 30-min napping
frequently resulted in improved awakening and alertness<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, 20-min
napping prevented sleepiness. Therefore, even napping &#x02264;60&#x02005;min may be considered effective
for awakening, alertness, and sleepiness.</p><p>However, 40-min napping resulted in a feeling of sleepiness after awaking due to sleep
inertia<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hayashi <italic>et
al.</italic><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a short
daytime nap of &#x0003c;20&#x02005;min is effective as a countermeasure against the post lunch dip.
Moreover, napping for 15&#x02005;min or more during the daytime results in the appearance of
slow-wave sleep<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, which causes sleep
inertia and negatively impacts nighttime sleep. According to other studies, 30-min napping
prevented sleepiness for 2 to 3&#x02005;h<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, 20-min napping to prevent
sleepiness continued for only 1 to 2&#x02005;h<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is considered difficult to prevent
drowsiness and the sense of fatigue until 9:00, which is the usual end of a night shift.
When taking a 15-min nap at 3:00, sleepiness increased 3&#x02005;h after the nap<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study aimed to measure any reduction in sleepiness and fatigue and any
physiological changes resulting from short naps taken during night shifts, at 2:30 and 4:30,
through a comparison with workers who did not take naps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>This study was conducted in three public general hospitals (300 to 800 beds, 200 to 400
nurses) in Okayama and Hiroshima Prefectures, Japan, between September and November 2009.
Subjects comprised 15 female nurses working on general wards (mean age: 23.71 &#x000b1; 1.88&#x02005;yr).
Measurements were taken hourly during the night shifts. Eight of the nurses napped (Nap
condition) and seven took no nap (No-nap condition).</p><p>All subjects were single, and lived in dormitories, apartments, or with their families.
Two nurses in the Nap condition group worked on the surgical ward and the other six on
mixed wards. The No-nap condition group included one nurse working on the surgical ward,
one on the orthopedics ward, and another five on mixed wards. The ratio of patients to
nurses was 7:1 in each ward, and three to four nurses worked on each ward during night
shifts.</p><p>All participants were healthy nurses who did not smoke or drink regularly or use drugs.
Participants were asked directly to confirm whether or not they smoked, drank regularly,
or used drugs when the study was explained to them, and the researchers confirmed that the
participants did not smoke or drink or use drugs during the night shift.</p><p>All participants were given explanations concerning the details of this study, including
the recording methods for subjective symptoms and physiological measures prior to the
start of the study, and gave their written informed consent. This study was approved by
the Ethics Board of Okayama University Graduate School of Health Sciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Shift schedules</title><p>Three hospitals that used a three-shift system were targeted. The shifts were categorized
as follows: day (8:30&#x02013;17:15 or 8:00&#x02013;16:45); evening (16:00&#x02013;0:45 or 16:30&#x02013;1:15); night
(0:00&#x02013;8:45 or 0:30&#x02013;9:15); and off. The day before the night shift started was counted as a
day off at all hospitals. Nurses therefore worked seven to eight night shifts every month.
The study was carried out on the first day of the night shift. Nurses were allowed to
alternatively take a 60-min break between 1:00 and 6:00 in a resting room.</p><p>Nurses were allowed 60&#x02005;min of break time, and were free to take it how they wanted,
either all together or divided into shorter times. They were therefore able to take two
separate naps.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The present study evaluated nurses working an 8-h night shift to examine the perceptions
of sleepiness and fatigue and physiological indices by comparing two groups: one group of
nurses who took two 15-min naps during the break time, and the other group consisting of
nurses who did not. The nurses were randomly allocated to the two (Nap and No-nap
condition) groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>A total of five dependent variables, which included physiological and subjective ratings,
were monitored during all the night shifts.</p><sec><title>Physiological measures</title><p>These included sublingual temperature and heart frequency (HR), heart rate variability
(HRV) and body movement measures. The circadian rhythm of body temperature is one of the
most common indicators of circadian rhythmicity<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sublingual temperature was measured as an index of internal
body temperature. The armpit is more readily affected by external factors such as sweat
or room temperature, so body temperature measured from the armpit is more prone to error
than temperature measured sublingually. Aural thermometers have low reliability, as it
is not possible to confirm that the probe is pointing correctly at the tympanic membrane
when the temperature is being taken<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sublingual temperature was therefore selected as the index
of body temperature. When a subject drinks either cold or warm water, the oral
temperature takes approximately 20&#x02005;min to return to its previous level<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, assuming that body
temperature measurement takes 5&#x02005;min, it was confirmed that subjects had not consumed
anything for 15&#x02005;min prior to the measurement. Using an oral thermometer (MC-509, Omron
Inc., Kyoto, Japan), body (sublingual) temperature was measured hourly to examine
changes in circadian modulation during night work. To gain insights into the effects of
night shift work and the associated circadian-modulated changes on heart rate, simple
measures of heart rate frequency were included for the duration of each shift. HRV
measures were included so as to monitor the autonomic nervous system activity throughout
each night shift<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical activity
and posture were continuously recorded every 5&#x02005;min in each group with an ambulatory
monitor worn on the nurses&#x02019; waists, ActiMarker (EW4800, Panasonic Inc., Osaka, Japan).
An ActiMarker was used to accurately quantify body movements during activities that
required low to medium exertion. The ActiMarker is a compact, lightweight, and accurate
physical activity monitor that was developed with the use of an algorithm for estimating
physical activity from the standard deviation of 3-axis composite acceleration of body
movements<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjective measures</title><p>Sleepiness and Fatigue were assessed subjectively using the Visual Analog Scale
(VAS)<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants rated their
sleepiness and fatigue on a 100-mm line. The values ranged from 0&#x02005;mm (not at all sleepy
or tired) to 100&#x02005;mm (extremely sleepy or tired).</p></sec><sec><title>Power spectral analysis</title><p>The ECG tracings were recorded using the HOLTREC RAC-T102 (Nihon Kohden Inc., Tokyo,
Japan) and were analyzed using MemCalc for Windows (Global Medical Solutions, Inc.,
Sherman Oaks, CA, USA). Data were analyzed offline after analog-to-digital conversion of
250-Hz R-R waves. Irregularities in ECG recordings were excluded from analysis.
Variability was measured as an indicator of autonomic nerve activity. For frequency
domain analysis of R-R wave intervals, the percentage of low-frequency power (LF) was
calculated as the power within the frequency range of 0.04 to 0.15&#x02005;Hz, and the percent
of high-frequency power (HF) was calculated as the power within the frequency range of
0.15 to 0.4&#x02005;Hz. The LF/HF ratio represents the sympathetic to parasympathetic
balance.</p><p>The bispectral index (BIS) monitor (A-2000; Covidien Inc., Dublin, Ireland) is a system
used to measure sedation levels<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.
BIS measurement is taken using three to four dedicated electrodes attached to the
forehead, and part of the cortical activity associated with level of consciousness is
calculated on the basis of the frequency, amplitude, and interference of the
electroencephalogram. This is continuously displayed as the BIS value. Some
investigators recently analyzed changes in the BIS during natural sleep in adults and
found that the BIS diminished considerably as sleep became deeper<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mean
BIS values of coma, semicoma, stupor and drowsiness are 0.14 &#x000b1; 0.23, 38.9 &#x000b1; 18.0, 60.3 &#x000b1;
14.5, and 73.6 &#x000b1; 16.5, respectively<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. BIS is often used as a tool to measure sleep<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even though the BIS could never
replace polysomnography (PSG) when a more precise determination of the stages of sleep
is necessary, the BIS is easier to use and interpret, is less time consuming, and allows
for continuous monitoring. Information was also collected regarding subjective
assessment of sleep quality; all participants were asked immediately after the nap
whether they felt they had slept properly.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>The researcher attached an electrocardiograph and an ActiMarker to subjects while
explaining the measurement methods to them before they started to work. In addition, the
BIS monitor was attached to the participants in the Nap group prior to the nap. Other
measurement methods had been explained in advance, and the researcher confirmed them at
the time of measurement. To reduce the stress on the nurses in each group as much as
possible, the researcher instructed them to spend break time (including eating and
drinking) in the same way as much as possible as they did on other night shift days.
Subjects were requested to refrain from eating or drinking for 15&#x02005;min before each hourly
temperature measurement, and at each measurement researchers confirmed that participants
had not had any food or drink.</p><p>The researcher also noted and recorded the time of awakening and amount of time spent
napping the day before the night shift, break time during the night shift, and sleeping
time in the daytime following the night shift.</p><sec><title>No-nap condition</title><p>At hourly intervals, beginning at 0:00 or 0:30 and ending at 9:00, participants were
required to complete a brief battery of scales (sleepiness and fatigue VAS). These
measurements were taken at the nursing station, and each hourly measurement took
2&#x02013;3&#x02005;min. They were asked not to lie down or sleep during break time.</p></sec><sec><title>Nap condition</title><p>The general procedure for the Nap condition was similar to the No-nap condition, except
that participants were allowed to have a nap for 30&#x02005;min. This time included 5&#x02005;min to go
to the restroom, 5&#x02005;min for attaching the BIS monitor, 15&#x02005;min for sleeping, and 5&#x02005;min for
removal of the BIS monitor and checking sleepiness, etc. A nap was taken twice,
beginning between 2:30 and 3:00 (first nap), and between 4:30 and 5:45 (second nap) in a
resting room. The nap opportunity was set at 30&#x02005;min for two reasons. First, this
duration fits within current employee break restrictions. Second, available data on nap
efficacy suggest benefits for greater alertness from naps of 15-min duration<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was expected that a 30-min break
time would allow 15&#x02005;min of sleep to be achieved, with time for normal sleep onset
processes. There were three to four nurses on each ward who took turns to nap or take a
break.</p><p>To take either their naps or their breaks, participants were able to use a resting room
in an isolated section of the hospital, away from patient rooms and staff activity, but
less than 10&#x02005;m from the nurse&#x02019;s station. Noise levels were minimal and naps were taken
on a mattress on the floor of the room, with ample linen for participants&#x02019; comfort.
During this nap break, participants were connected to a portable BIS monitor to record
their sleep activity.</p><p>Participants were awakened by the researcher 15&#x02005;min after the nap started. After the
nap, at least 10&#x02005;min was allowed for a break before the participant returned to
work.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To ensure validity of the comparisons between the Nap condition and No nap condition, the
first step of the analysis compared participants&#x02019; age, hours of sleep before the night
shift, break time during the night shift, and hours of daytime sleep after the night
shift.</p><p>Values are shown as mean &#x000b1; SD or SE of mean unless otherwise noted. In analyses of
napping time before work, break time, and sleep time in the daytime, the Mann-Whitney U
test was conducted.</p><p>In analyses of body temperature, sense of fatigue, and subjective evaluation of
sleepiness (measured using the VAS), the Shapiro-Wilk (normality) test was first conducted
to identify differences in the conditions for napping from the start of work (0:00 or
0:30) to 9:00. Differences were noted in body temperature and sleepiness (VAS), and the
Friedman test was carried out following determination of the ranges of data with
significant differences using the Bonferroni post-hoc test to compare the conditions for
napping. For multiple comparisons with the data before work, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was conducted. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare factors at every hour between
the two groups. No marked difference was noted between the two groups in the sense of
fatigue (VAS); therefore, a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed (with taking or not taking a nap and data range as factors). A one-way
repeated-measures ANOVA (timing of nap during the shift as the factor) was conducted to
examine changes to each of the conditions over time, and the Bonferroni post-hoc test was
used for multiple comparisons with the data before work. To compare the two groups hourly,
a <italic>t</italic>-test was used.</p><p>The Shapiro-Wilk (normality) test was conducted to compare HF, LF/HF, heart rate (HR),
and level of activity at every hour between the two groups. Marked differences were noted
and the Mann-Whitney U test was carried out.</p><p>Using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, correlations between factors,
including the start time, level of activity, sleepiness, sense of fatigue, LF/HF, and HR
were examined.</p><p>Analyses were carried out using SPSS 16.0&#x02005;J for Windows (SPSS, Tokyo, Japan), with
significance set at 5% (two-sided).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In comparing resting time, no significant difference was identified between the two groups

the afternoon and the start of the night shift, with six participants in the Nap group and
four in the No-nap group having more than 3&#x02005;h sleep before the night shift. During the night
shift, three participants in the Nap group and four in the No-nap group had a meal,
consisting of a small amount of bread or rice, during the time after the fifth hourly
measurement and 5&#x02005;h 45&#x02005;min. Three nurses from each group drank one cup of coffee during the
shift. Of the three nurses who drank coffee, two drank it at 2:00 and one drank it at 4:00.
One of the nurses who drank coffee at 2:00 and the nurse who drank it at 4:00 did not nap at
all. The remaining nurse who drank coffee at 2:00 slept during both nap times. The
relationship between coffee and sleep was not investigated in the present study.</p><p>The sleep stage while napping was determined based on BIS monitor measurements. The mean
BIS values at 2:30 and 4:30 were 90.3 &#x000b1; 4.60, 81.1 &#x000b1; 13.1, respectively. The mean BIS values
from the first and second nap indicated that sleep was deeper during the second nap, but the
difference was not significant.</p><p>In the nap at 2:00, which was the first nap, five participants had mean BIS value &#x02265;90 and
three participants had mean BIS value &#x0003c;90. Of the five people with BIS &#x02265;90, one reported
dozing and the other four reported that they could not sleep. Of the three participants with

In the second nap starting from 4:30 onward, four participants with BIS &#x02265;90 reported they
could not sleep, and of the four participants with BIS &#x0003c;90, two reported they were able
to sleep and two responded &#x0201c;I slept well and dreamed.&#x0201d; Seven of the eight nurses felt they
could not sleep well and that napping did not reduce sleepiness or fatigue. Their comments
after napping included: &#x0201c;I could not have sufficient sleep&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;It did not reduce sleepiness&#x0201d;,
and &#x0201c;I felt better by just lying down&#x0201d;. The other nurse felt that the second nap was
effective: &#x0201c;Although I had never slept on a break during work, I was able to take a nap for
15&#x02005;min during this time.

the night shift. Although napping for 15&#x02005;min at 2:30 and during the period from 4:30 to 5:45
during the night shift was not shown to decrease subjective sleepiness or fatigue, HF/LF in
the Nap condition group was significantly lower than in the No-nap condition group.
Furthermore, a sudden, brief increase in HF values was observed in the No-nap condition
group in the morning.</p><p>Most participants did not recognize sleep, although the BIS monitor showed data indicating
deeper sleep during the second nap compared with the first one. Sleepiness fluctuates during
the course of a day, and the main causes of this fluctuation are circadian rhythms and
continued prolongation of the waking time until sleep<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The body temperature decreased after each nap. In general, one sleep cycle lasts 90 to
120&#x02005;min<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it has been reported
that the body temperature decreases with sleep<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. With regard to the relationship
between changes in body temperature and sleepiness, there is a positive correlation between
the time of most intense sleepiness and the time when deep body temperature shows its
maximum reduction<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. As body temperature was low at 3:00 in both the Nap and No-nap
groups, this reduction could not have been the result of taking a nap and so was likely to
have reflected circadian rhythms and be due to reduced body movement. However, while body
temperature in the No-nap group increased toward morning, in the Nap group it was at its
lowest between 6:00 and 7:00, and at 7:00 the difference between the two groups was
significant. Thus, during the first nap, the body temperature decreased and the nurses were
readily able to sleep due to the effects of circadian rhythm and reduced body movement<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the second nap, body temperature
was probably lower due to the effect of the first nap. It may be conjectured that in both
the first and the second naps, the reduced body temperature resulted in increased
sleepiness, thus facilitating sleep. Sleepiness increases with prolongation of the waking
time<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>, and subjects&#x02019; inability to
sleep during the first nap may have been due to the effects of taking a nap before the
shift. Furthermore, a likely reason for deeper sleep during the second nap than the first
was that subjects chose by themselves the time for the nap that suited them<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While previous studies recommended taking a 120-min nap, the present study found that
similar effects were obtained by taking short, 15-min naps. Because the night shift nurses
remained awake for a longer period of time to work during the night-time, sleep latency
might be shortened<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the condition
during a 15-min nap may have become similar to that during sleep despite its shortness,
leading to a decrease in body temperature. Generally, the level of arousal falls when body
temperature decreases, but in the present study the increased level of activity in the
morning from 6:00 onward was not accompanied by increased sleepiness. When seen from changes
in HF as well, no decrease was found in the level of arousal. It therefore appears that
while the second nap contributed to the noticeable decrease in body temperature, it did not
have any effect on the increase in sleepiness.</p><sec><title>Influences on subjective sleepiness and fatigue</title><p>In both the Nap and No-nap condition groups, fatigue increased after 6:00. A previous
study reported that in a 16-h night shift, there was no difference between the level of
fatigue at the end of the shift as a result of a nap of 120&#x02005;min or less and a nap of
120&#x02005;min or more during the shift<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similarly, it has also been reported that with naps, a difference in fatigue was found as
a result of the timing of when the nap was taken rather than the length of the nap, and
that a later nap may be expected to reduce fatigue<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been reported that napping for 40&#x02005;min at 3:00 in a
12-h night shift reduced fatigue<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the present study, no differences in fatigue were found after multiple naps, suggesting
that it may be difficult to reduce fatigue by increasing the number of naps during a night
shift. In order to reduce fatigue, it is probably necessary to ensure that the nap starts
in the second half of the night shift, and that the nap is at least 40&#x02005;min rather than
15&#x02005;min.</p><p>Regarding subjective sleepiness, this increased most markedly between 4:00 to 5:00, and
decreased after 6:00, when the activity level increased in both groups. While no
differences in subjective sleepiness were observed between the groups, the HF, an
objective index of sleepiness or parasympathetic activity, was stable in the morning in
the Nap condition group, suggesting that the waking level was maintained. On the other
hand, in the No-nap condition group, the parasympathetic activity level occasionally
increased after 6:00, indicating an increase in HF values. In previous studies, subjective
and objective sleepiness were empirically differentiated, and subjects were
electroencephalographically shown to be sleepy when working without taking a nap<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similar results were also obtained in
the present study, suggesting occasional brief increase in HF values in participants who
did not have a nap during a night shift. Nurses are often at their busiest after 6:00,
when they tend to patients who are waking up, and they need to be able to accurately judge
their own condition at this time. As shown in this study, The HF occasionally increases
with such a rise in the activity level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>).
The increase in patient care in the early morning may be accompanied by an increase in
sleepiness that goes unnoticed, which is a potential cause of occupational injuries or
errors<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the level of activity could not be strictly controlled for the Nap condition
group or the No-nap condition group in the present study, the results of the present study
show that taking a 15-min nap twice&#x02014;at 2:30 and between 4:30 and 5:45, when the levels of
sleepiness and fatigue would usually increase&#x02014;may prevent the sense of fatigue until 9:00
or the end of the shift.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that nurses who took a nap on a night shift can spend more
time for other activities the following day because they would not have to sleep long in
the daytime<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in the present study, no marked differences were noted
in sleep times in the daytime or in the perceptions of fatigue between the Nap and No-nap
condition groups. Taking a 15-min nap twice during the night shift did not increase waking
hours during the day following a night shift or reduce the sense of fatigue, and there was
no increase in the time that could be spent for other domestic activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Stress-reducing effects</title><p>The LF/HF values were significantly lower in the Nap than in the No-nap condition group
at 6:00 to 9:00. Because the LF/HF has been reported to represent changes in the
sympathetic nerve activity of the autonomic nervous system as a stress index<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref><sup>)</sup>, the stress level may have been lower in
the former than in the latter. Taking a nap can be effective in reducing stress<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the results of the present study
appear to be consistent with this. In night shift nurses who remain awake for a long
period of time to work, sleepiness and fatigue increase, and their stress levels also
gradually rise with an increase in the amount of work around the end of their shifts<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref><sup>)</sup>. If such a stressful situation is
prolonged, chronic fatigue may develop. The results of the present study suggest that it
may also be effective to take two short-term naps to reduce such stress in the morning.
The main reason for reduction in stress would be the effect of the nap itself, but also
being away from the tense workplace, even for just a short while, would be relaxing. Also,
it may be conjectured that stress levels decrease because napping provides an opportunity
to reduce sleep pressure<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings regarding nursing care work</title><p>In the present study, only one of the eight nurses subjectively reported benefits for
greater alertness from napping. This was presumably because most of the subjects did not
have the habit of napping, let alone taking a 15-min nap twice per night. By continuing
the habit of taking a short nap, the effects of napping could be further increased. For
night shift nurses to take turns taking a nap twice per night or more, it is necessary to
address the issue of the workplace as a whole, in addition to the effort by individual
nurses. As some of the nurses who could not sleep well while napping commented: &#x0201c;Just
lying down for a while, I felt better&#x0201d;, simply lying on a bed during break time on a night
shift to stretch the arms and legs and relax the muscles is expected to reduce
fatigue<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although 120&#x02005;min of
napping is recommended, taking a 15-min nap twice should be effective as well if break
time is 60&#x02005;min at a time. If this is established as a way of spending break time, it will
help prevent medical malpractice and chronic fatigue, and help nurses to maintain their
health and improve medical safety.</p><p>The present study had several limitations. First, the study included only a small number
of participants. It is necessary to conduct further studies involving a larger number of
subjects in order to validate the results. Second, measurements of brain waves using
polysomnography were not conducted in this study, and the sleep stage of the subjects
during their naps was not clearly determined. Third, the start time of napping varied
widely between 4:30 and 5:45 (more than 1 h). It is almost impossible for all nurses to
take a nap at the same time in clinical practice. Fourth, the start time and the length of
naps taken before the night shift affect sleepiness and fatigue during the shift, but this
could not be standardized. Finally, although the level of activity was measured, the sense
of mental fatigue that nurses must have felt while performing handover and other tasks
during busy hours in the morning was not determined. Further studies using a combination
of critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) and questionnaires to measure fatigue
subjectively and objectively are needed in order to clarify the relationship of fatigue to
sleepiness.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (20890140 and 22390409)
