patients during the waiting period of the result of intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment. The aim of this study was
to compare the effects of a positive reappraisal coping intervention (PRCI) and problem-solving skills training (PSS)
on depression during the waiting period of the result of IUI Treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized control clinical trial was done among 108 women undergoing IUI treat-
ment. In the control group, the women received routine care. In the PRCI group, women attended two training sessions
and were asked to complete coping thoughts cards and fill out daily monitoring forms during the waiting period. In
the PSS group, PSS were taught over three sessions. The depression was measured by the beck depression inventory.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>On the 10<sup>th</sup> day of the IUI waiting period, there were significant differences between the control group (21.42

cal pregnancy after 12 months or more of unprotectedsexual intercourse (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Infertility can threaten the men.
tal health of infertile couples. In a study by Peyvandiet al. (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), 62% of women who had been visiting in.
fertility treatment had various degrees of depression:
27.5% suffered from mild depression, 25.5% moderate depression, and 9% severe depression. Intrauterineinsemination (IUI) treatment combined with ovulationinduction is usually considered the first-line treatmentfor many infertile couples and it is the most common ofthe treatment methods. Although with the advancement
of science and new assisted reproductive techniquessuch as: <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF), intra cytoplasmsperm injection (ICSI), and IUI, the hopes of infertilecouples have increased, these methods are expensiveand involve broad medical interventions and long periods of treatment (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The waiting period of the result of IUI treatment,
refers to the time interval between the IUI operationand the time of the pregnancy test (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This can beassociated with severe distress in individuals, the out.
comes of fertility treatments are often unpredictableand the infertile women are not able to control or pre.
dict the treatment outcome (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). According to a study
by Osuna (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the waiting period causes psychological 
reactions, stress, and anxiety in individuals as a result 
of their concerns about an event which will happen in 
the future, and which they are not able to predict or 
control. In a more recent study, Boivin and Lancastle 
(<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) showed that the degree of anxiety and depression 
increased during the waiting period before fertility 
treatment.</p><p>One of the interventions designed to help people 
cope with the medical waiting period is the Positive 
Reappraisal Coping Intervention (PRCI). The PRCI 
is based on positive reappraisal coping strategies, and 
use of this intervention helps people emphasize the 
positive aspects of the situation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This technique has 
been used for the waiting period associated with IVF 
treatment, genetic tests, and recurrent miscarriage. In 
a study by Ockhuijsen et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) use of positive coping 
thoughts cards led to an appreciation of the positive 
aspects of the situation and creation of a positive feeling 
in infertile women during the waiting period of the 
result of IVF treatment. Although research suggests 
an effect of the PRCI on positive feeling during the 
waiting period of the result of IVF treatment, there is 
disagreement about the effect of this intervention on 
negative emotions, anxiety, and depression in infertile 
women during waiting period (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is also necessary 
to use other interventions to reduce depression 
during the period of waiting for fertility treatments.</p><p>Problem Solving Skills training (PSS) is a psychological 
intervention, which aims to help individuals 
adapt more effectively to stressful problems in life 
(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Problem solving is one of the most important 
strategies in facing infertility (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In a study by Kordi 
et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the severity of postpartum depression was 
significantly lower in the PSS group than in the control 
group. But no similar studies have been conducted 
on the effect of PSS on depression in infertile women. 
According to increased levels of depression during the 
waiting period and contradictions in the studies (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). 
This randomized controlled trial was conducted with 
the aim of comparing the effects of a PRCI and PSS 
on depression during the waiting period of the result 
of IUI treatment in infertile women in the Milad Infertility 
Treatment Centre in Mashhad, Iran, during the 
years 2015 and 2016.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized control clinical trial involved 108 
women, referred to the Milad Infertility Treatment 
Centre in Mashhad for IUI treatment. Sampling for 
the trial was undertaken after the research had been 
approved by the Ethics Committee of Mashhad University 
of Medical Sciences (Registration number: 
IRCT2016020926490N1) and consent obtained from the 
officials of Milad Infertility Treatment Centre. In order 
to prevent the dissemination of information between the 
groups were considered at three different times, so that 
after the completion of the sampling in a group, sampling 
was started in the other group. The manner of assignment 
was in this way that first the groups&#x02019; names 
were written on paper, then according to the draw, the 
first time interval was assigned to the control group, for 
the second period the PRCI group and for the third period 
PSS group was assigned. Available sampling method 
was applied in each group.</p><p>The sample size was calculated based on Cohen&#x02019;s 
(1987) table, and considering a power of 80%, a confidence 
level of 95%, and an effect size of 70%, we determined 
33 individuals to be required in each group. 
To take into account a 10% loss, we determined that 
36 individuals were required for each group. Inclusion 
criteria for the study were: Iranian nationality, 18-40 
years of age, ability to read and write, primary infertility, 
and obtaining a score less than 28 on the General 
Health Questionnaire (GHQ 28). Exclusion criteria for 
the study were: consumption of any psychoactive drug, 
occurrence of any stressful and unpleasant incidents 
over the past 6 months, suffering from medical illness, 
obtaining a depression score higher than 28 on the Beck 
Depression Inventory, cancellation of IUI treatment cycle, 
failure to participate in all training sessions, and unwillingness 
to continue cooperation in the research.</p><p>The instruments used in this trial included: a questionnaire 
on demographic and infertility-related information, 
the beck depression inventory, GHQ-28, daily 
monitoring forms, positive coping thoughts cards, and a 
checklist for implementing problem-solving skills. The 
questionnaire on demographic and infertility-related information 
consisted of questions about: age, level of education, 
employment status, duration of marriage, family 
income, duration of infertility, duration of treatment, 
number of times the participant had undergone IUI and 
IVF, cause of infertility, treatment seeking, expectancy 
of successful treatment, and the cost of treatment. The 
beck depression inventory contains 21 questions with 
answers scored between 0 and 3. The minimum possible 
score on the depression questionnaire is zero and the 
maximum is 63, classified as follows: minor depression 
0-13, mild depression 14-19, moderate depression 20-
28, and severe depression 29-63.</p><p>The GHQ 28 is a questionnaire containing 28 questions 
that measure physical symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, social 
dysfunction, and severe depression. The answers are 
on a four-point Likert scale. The threshold score for this 
questionnaire is 28 and a score higher than 28 is a sign 
of susceptibility to mental disorders. The daily monitoring 
form was designed by Ockhuijsen et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) to assess 
physical and mental changes in infertile women during 
the waiting period before fertility treatment. It consists 
of 46 questions related to the person&#x02019;s emotions, physical 
symptoms, including symptoms related to anxiety 
and to the failure or success of treatment, coping strategies, 
person&#x02019;s assessment during the period of waiting 
of the result of treatment and coping strategies during
this waiting period. This form is a part of the PRCI and 
was completed each day by the PRCI group during the 
waiting period.</p><p>The positive coping thoughts card contains 10 statements 
based on the positive reappraisal coping strategy. 
The PRCI group repeated the positive thoughts at least 
twice a day during the waiting period. The validity of 
the qualitative content of this trial was assessed as follows: 
after the preparation and translation of the questionnaires 
(demographic data and information related 
to infertility, daily monitoring forms, positive coping 
thoughts cards, and check list of problem solving skills) 
under the supervision and guidance of professors in 
counseling, the questionnaires were reviewed by seven 
experts and professors from the Mashhad University of 
Medical Sciences. The final tools used incorporated the 
necessary revisions suggested by the experts.
The reliability of the beck depression inventory 
(&#x003b1;=0.83), GHQ28 (&#x003b1;=0.83), and daily monitoring form 
(&#x003b1;=0.74) were ascertained using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha. Infertile 
women who visited the centre to plan their IUI 
treatment and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the 
study were recruited into the trial. PSS sessions and the 
PRCI sessions were performed by the researcher after 
confirmation of the researcher&#x02019;s ability by a specialized 
consultant with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology.</p><p>In first session in the PSS group, which was on days 2-3 
of the menstrual cycle, we discussed infertility and the 
IUI treatment process, the research objectives and how to 
conduct the sessions, and the role of using PSS in dealing 
with the problems of life. The participants were then 
asked to write a list of problems that they have had during 
the course of their IUI treatment and determine the most 
important issue. In the second session, on days 9-12 of the 
menstrual cycle, the participants were asked to suggest 
solutions to their problems using a brainstorming method 
which they were taught in the session and prepare a list of 
the solutions that came to mind. During the third session, 
on days 14-15 of the menstrual cycle, the participants discussed 
the disadvantages and advantages of implementing 
the solutions arrived at in the second session. Following 
the discussion they made a list of the disadvantages 
and advantages of implementing each of the solutions and 
chose the best solution. The participants were also taught 
how to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution and advised 
of the possibility of returning to the previous step in 
case a solution was deemed to be ineffective. They were 
asked to implement this PSS in dealing with their daily 
problems during the waiting period, and record their efforts 
in the checklist for implementing PSS.</p><p>The first session of the PRCI group was held on days 
2-3 of the menstrual cycle. We discussed infertility, the 
IUI treatment process, the research objectives, types 
of coping strategy, and the positive reappraisal coping 
strategy. The second session was held on days 9-12 of 
the menstrual cycle. In this session we explained the ten 
statements on the positive coping thoughts card using 
examples and showed participants how to complete the 
daily monitoring form. The Participants were then asked 
to repeat the positive coping thoughts at least twice a 
day during waiting period. Control group participants 
received the center&#x02019;s routine care, and presented themselves 
at Milad Infertility Treatment Center on days 2-3, 
9-12, and 14-15 of the menstrual cycle to undergo an ultrasonography 
and determine any remedial measures for 
the IUI treatment. The beck depression inventory was 
completed by all the three groups on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of the 
waiting period. Depression score means were compared 
between the three groups before the intervention and on 
the 10<sup>th</sup> day of the waiting period.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>After collection and coding, the data were entered into 
the computer and analyzed using SPSS version 16, with 
P&#x0003c;0.05 considered statistically significant. The normality 
of the quantitative variables was determined using 
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the variables were normal 
parametric statistics were used, otherwise the non-
parametric equivalent was used. Means, frequencies and 
standard deviations were used to describe the characteristics 
of the participants in each of the three groups. To 
compare depression between the three groups we used the 
ANOVA test and the paired t test for intra-group comparisons 
of depression if the data were normal. In the case 
of non-normal data the Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon 
tests were used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Data were obtained from 34 individuals in the control 
group, 34 individuals in the PSS group, and 35 individuals 
in the PRCI group. Two individuals in the control 
group and one individual in the PRCI group were excluded 
from the study due to the cancellation of their 
treatment program, and in the PSS group one individual 
was excluded from the study due to the cancellation of 
their treatment program, and one individual in the was 
excluded due to her unwillingness to continue participating 
in the research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig .1</xref>).</p><p>There was no significant difference between participants 
in the three groups in terms of level of education 
(P=0.853), the woman's occupation (P=0.364), cause of 
infertility (P=0.824), experience of using assisted reproductive 
techniques (P=0.410), and paying for the treatment 
(P = 0.392, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The mean GHQ28 score was 
25.85 &#x000b1; 3.93 in the control group, 25.28 &#x000b1; 4.20 in the PSS 
three groups were homogeneous in terms of this variable 
(P=0.712, X<sup>2</sup>=0.68).</p><p>According to the paired t test and comparison of mean 
scores for depression in the two time intervals; before the 
intervention and on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of the waiting period (a 
within-group comparison), the mean score for depression 
showed a significant decrease in the PSS group (P&#x0003c;0.001) 
and PRCI group (P=0.002), and a significant increase in 
the control group (P=0.007, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>The stages of the

showed that there was no significant 
difference in mean depression score between the three 
groups (P=0.716) before the intervention. However, on the 
10<sup>th</sup> day of the waiting period of the result of IUI treatment, 
there were significant differences between the mean depression 
scores of the three groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). The results of the 
Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test showed that there were significant 
differences in mean depression scores between the control 
and the PSS group and also the control and the PRCI group 
(P=0.001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, depression increased in the control 
group during the waiting period of the result of IUI treatment. 
This is consistent with the results of studies conducted 
by Boivin and Lancastle (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and Ockhuijsen et al. 
(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Being in a medical waiting period causes psychological 
distress and increased levels of anxiety and depression 
in the infertile women (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These feelings result from 
their concerns about an important event (the result of the 
pregnancy test) which will happen in the future and which 
(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) they are unable to change or control and about which 
there is little information through which they can predict 
the treatment outcome (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In our study, the mean depression score decreased in the 
PRCI group and PSS group. But, in a study by Ockhuijsen 
et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), depression increased during the waiting period 
after IVF treatments in the PRCI group which is not consistent 
with the results of the present study. In this study 
the inclusion criteria for the study included being under 
IVF treatment and speaking the dutch language, but in 
the present study, those who obtained a score higher than 
28 on the general health questionnaire and a depression 
score higher than 28 on the beck depression inventory, as 
well as cases who needed to be referred to a psychologist, 
were excluded.</p><p>In a study by Kordi et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), after 5 sessions of PSS, 
the level of postpartum depression significantly decreased 
in the PSS group which is consistent with the results of 
the present study. Problem solving is an important coping 
strategy that enables an individual to appropriately control 
problematic situations (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). PSS have an important 
role in mental and physical health, especially when 
people face unpleasant events and negative tensions in 
their lives (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In a study by Talaei et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), after 10 
sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy group training, 
the level of depression in infertile women significantly 
decreased in the cognitive-behavioral therapy group compared 
with controls which is consistent with the results of 
the present study.</p><p>Despite the fact that infertility treatments are stressful, 
infertile women expressed little desire to use the proposed 
psychological interventions. The reasons mentioned were 
as follows: fear of attending consultation sessions, loss of 
personal privacy, the cost of consultation, and ineffectiveness 
of the consultation process (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The PRCI is a new intervention based on positive reappraisal 
coping strategies for medical waiting periods, 
whose implementation does not need an in-person visit 
to the advisor, and which is affordable (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Positive reappraisal 
coping strategies can help people adapt to unpredictable 
and long times, because positive reappraisal 
coping strategies lead to a reappraisal of the situation and 
emphasis on discovering the benefits and positive aspects 
during stressful conditions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The basis of this intervention 
is creating a positive thought through a cognitive 
process. The design of the PRCI is based on Lazarus and 
Folkman&#x02019;s theory of stress and coping. In their study, Lazarus 
and Folkman came to the conclusion that positive 
emotions play the most important role in encouraging 
people to continue making efforts to cope with stressful 
situations (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Among the strengths of this study are the adaptability of 
the training sessions to the therapeutic program intended 
for the participants. A limitation of our study is that the 
trial was not double-blind, which introduces the possibility 
of observer bias. However, the fact that our findings 
are consistent with those of other studies in the field 
means that this is unlikely to have had a major impact on 
our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As the results of this study found the impact of PRCI 
and PSS on depression during the waiting period of the 
result of IUI treatment were the same, it is suggested both 
interventions can be used, if facilities are available, to 
help infertile women reduce the depression generated by 
the waiting period and increase their adaptability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Research Deputy of University, Mashhad University
