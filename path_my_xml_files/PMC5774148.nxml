The few existing studies present methodological shortcomings limiting the conclusions and generalisability of results. It is hypothesised that exercise could have positive physical, psychological as well as immunomodulatory effects and may be a beneficial addition to current pharmacological management of this chronic disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits on perceived quality of life (QOL) and physical fitness of a home-based physical exercise program compared to usual care, for patients with stabilised, generalised auto-immune MG.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">MGEX is a multi-centre, interventional, randomised, single-blind, two-arm parallel group, controlled trial. Forty-two patients will be recruited, aged 18&#x02013;70 years. Following a three-month observation period, patients will be randomised into a control or experimental group. The experimental group will undertake a 40-min home-based physical exercise program using a rowing machine, three times a week for three months, as an add-on to usual care. The control group will receive usual care with no additional treatment. All patients will be followed up for a further three months. The primary outcome is the mean change in <italic>MGQOL-15-F</italic> score between three and six months (i.e. pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention periods). The <italic>MGQOL-15-F</italic> is an MG-specific patient-reported QOL questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include the evaluation of deficits and functional limitations via MG-specific clinical scores (Myasthenia Muscle Score and MG-Activities of Daily Living scale), muscle force and fatigue, respiratory function, free-living physical activity as well as evaluations of anxiety, depression, self-esteem and overall QOL with the WHO-QOL BREF questionnaire. Exercise workload will be assessed as well as multiple safety measures (ECG, biological markers, medication type and dosage and any disease exacerbation or crisis).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This is the largest randomised controlled trial to date evaluating the benefits and tolerance of physical exercise in this patient population.

The incidence is estimated to be 30 per 1,000,000 people per year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. MG affects both genders and symptoms include fluctuating fatigue and weakness which vary in intensity and location (upper and/or lower limbs, axial, eyes and face, bulbar and respiratory muscles) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These symptoms affect patients to varying degrees and while disease-induced mortality is rare nowadays, activities of daily function are affected and quality of life (QOL) is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Relapses are unpredictable and can be present throughout the disease course, especially in the initial stages when the disease may not yet be treated. Current treatment includes various pharmacological agents which are either symptomatic such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors which act to temporarily relieve symptoms or disease-modifying immunosuppressors aimed at minimising the auto-immune response. As there is currently no known cure, the goal of treatment is to obtain remission; and where this is not possible, to obtain disease stability with the least symptoms.</p><p id="Par20">While rest is recommended during an acute exacerbation of MG, evidence is lacking as to whether exercise is both feasible and beneficial in periods of disease stability. Anecdotal evidence from patients with MG suggests that those who participate in regular physical exercise feel better. According to them, it gives them confidence in their capacities and helps them understand their disease and their personal limits. Some even report experiencing symptom improvement and reduced levels of fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">For the general population, it is widely accepted that regular physical exercise has multiple positive physical and psychological effects as well as being effective in the prevention of various non-communicable diseases such as stroke, heart disease and cancer and increasing longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, the use of exercise has been proposed in the management of various neurological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Exercise has even been compared to pharmacological treatment and has been found to be equivalent in some populations, supporting the recent notion that &#x02018;exercise is medicine&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Traditionally, exercise was thought to exacerbate symptoms for patients suffering from MG as their muscle weakness and fatigue was thought to be brought on or worsened by physical exertion and improved with rest. Despite the increasing number of studies exploring exercise in various neuromuscular pathologies, to date, little research has explored physical activity in the context of MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Several case studies exist which demonstrate that despite the disease patients can participate in sport and increase their strength, power or endurance with adequate training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A within-subject control study provided promising results, yet these limited data do not enable us to draw reliable conclusions concerning the safety and benefits of physical exercise for patients with MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Two new studies provide further information including different types of physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the study by Rahbek et al., progressive resistance training appears to be beneficial however aerobic training seems to increase depression and fatigue and reduce knee extensor strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The mixed aerobic resistance program study carried out by Westerberg improved functional physical performance and exercise self-efficacy without strength improvements noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Exercise was well tolerated in both studies; however, due to small sample sizes and lack of control group, it is difficult to make firm conclusions about the various possible benefits. It is hypothesised that physical exercise is beneficial for adults with stabilised MG.</p><p id="Par22">The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a regular moderate intensity physical exercise program improves perceived QOL for patients with stable, generalised MG. Secondary aims are to evaluate the effects of this exercise program compared to usual care on physical fitness, depression and self-esteem as well as on the immune system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design, ethics, consent and permission</title><p id="Par23">This is a multi-centre, interventional, randomised, single-blind, parallel group, controlled trial with a planned duration of four years (nine months for each patient) (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT <italic>flow diagram</italic> of the MGEX study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2433_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Standard protocol items recommendations for interventional trials (SPIRIT).

The upper arm is placed on a support, the elbow flexed to 90&#x000b0; and the forearm in full supination, with the strap placed at the wrist, leaving the hand free. The axis of the dynamometer is aligned with the joint axis of rotation of the elbow. Bilateral shoulder straps and a waist strap are used to stabilise the thorax and pelvis to avoid compensations. For the lower limb knee extension force is evaluated with the patient seated in the Biodex chair with the hips and knees flexed to 90&#x000b0;. The thorax, pelvis and right thigh are secured with straps. The axis of the dynamometer is aligned with the axis of rotation of the knee. Both positions are designed to avoid the influence of gravity on the muscle contraction.</p><p id="Par47">Before each test, there is one test trial at submaximal force to ensure that the patient understands the instructions. Testing involves three isometric contractions at maximal voluntary isometric force (MVIC) followed by a 1-min rest between each MVIC trial. Maximal torque is presented in Nm. The highest value from the three trials of each muscle group is used in data analysis. Following the third MVIC there is a 5-min rest period where the patient remains in the same position. Fatigue testing comprises a sustained 40-s isometric contraction at 50% of their best individual MVIC from the same day. A last MVIC is performed immediately after completing the fatigue exercise. Visual cues are provided to the patient via a computer screen to enable them to maintain the target level of force for the duration of the fatigue test. Strong verbal encouragement is provided by the evaluator for both force and fatigue testing. The details of the dynamometer position (chair position, height, depth, etc.) for each patient are noted for repeatability in successive testing. Measurements are performed on the right side only.

In this study, four aligned miniature, circular silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) surface electrodes of 4&#x000a0;mm in diameter, 11&#x000a0;mm inter-electrode distance are used. Three signals are derived from this bipolar configuration. The electrodes are connected to an amplifier (bandwidth&#x02009;=&#x02009;10&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;Hz). Where necessary, hair is gently removed with a shaver and the skin is abraded slightly and cleaned with an alcohol solution to reduce inter-electrode resistance. To improve conduction electrolytic gel is placed on the electrodes which are then placed on the biceps brachii (BB) for elbow flexion and on the vastus lateralis (VL) for knee extension, parallel to the estimated direction of muscles fibres according to the Surface EMG for Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Its handle can be adjusted to accommodate different hand sizes and the strength is displayed directly on the screen. Patients are seated on the edge of a plinth, their back in an upright position, hips and knees flexed to 90&#x000b0; and feet flat on the floor. The dominant arm hangs down the side of the body with the shoulder in neutral and the elbow extended. The patient is instructed to squeeze the handle as hard as possible; verbal encouragement is provided to motivate the patient to perform a maximal effort.

It is expected that patients in the experimental group may experience muscle soreness and fatigue in response to exercise, particularly for the more sedentary patients. However, this is not an AE as it is considered a normal response to exercise.</p><p id="Par65">A serious adverse event (SAE) includes: death; risk of death; necessity or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or any other undesirable event considered to be medically significant. MG exacerbation requiring modification of current therapeutic management during the intervention period is considered a possible AE. All suspected unexpected SAEs are to be notified without delay to the sponsor, as well as any worsening of the disease suspected to be related to the physical programme if a patients' treatment needs to be modified. In this case, unblinding can occur. Should a worsening occur without needing a change of the treatment, it is only to be recorded in the electronic database without mandating a direct report to the sponsor. The sponsor&#x02019;s vigilance unit is in charge of the causality assessment as well as of its regulatory duties with regard to reporting obligations to the French Medicines Agency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Data and statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data management</title><p id="Par66">Data are recorded and managed through a dedicated web-based software (Cleanweb Telemedicine) with secured and restricted access. Access to the system is controlled for each investigator by an individual login/password and using a secured https connection. Data are stored on a centralised server. Participants also have paper files which are anonymised and only contain the participant&#x02019;s unique identification code. These are stored in a dedicated storage unit in each centre. Access to the complete final trial dataset will be restricted to the Clinical Research Unit statistician who will analyse the study data for the purpose of report and publication. Subsets of the final dataset may be shared with investigators if needed for discussion or additional analyses. Should the need arise, advice from the steering Committee will be sought and provided to the sponsor APHP who will retain ownership of the data as well as the final decision on authorising further access to data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Monitoring</title><p id="Par67">Clinical research assistants from the sponsors research unit regularly visit all centres for on-site monitoring to ensure protocol compliance and monitor data quality according to the data management unit guidelines and clarification forms. Data entered into Cleanweb should be complete and consistent with source documents. Eligibility criteria and consent forms are checked as well as outcome measures and adverse events. No interim analyses are planned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par68">The statistical analysis will be performed once the planned number of patients will have completed the study, according to the intention-to-treat principle. Each participant is analysed according to the group in which he/she was randomised. For the primary outcome (<italic>MGQOL-15-F</italic> at three or six months<italic>)</italic>, missing values will be handled through multiple imputation by chained equations. No multiple imputation will be carried out for secondary outcomes. The main analysis of the primary and secondary outcome measures will not be adjusted. Adjusted analyses on the centre will be performed but considered as secondary analyses. As there are only two centres, the centre will be modelled as a fixed effect. Two-sided tests will be used with a 5% significance level.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Patient description and follow-up</title><p id="Par69">A descriptive analysis of inclusions and follow-up will be performed (graph of inclusions and theoretical and actual visits). All patients will be included in the analysis unless their consent is retracted and they are opposed to their data being analysed. Any drop-outs or patients having stopped the intervention early will be included in the analysis. A patient is considered a drop-out when he/she revokes his/her consent to participate in the study and thus all participation in the study will cease.</p><p id="Par70">Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients at baseline will be described by group without statistical tests. Any violation to the protocol and reasons for drop out will be described.</p><p id="Par71">The primary outcome measure, the changes in <italic>MGQOL-15-F</italic>, will be analysed via a Student&#x02019;s test and adjustment on the centre will use ANOVA. If the distribution of the changes in the <italic>MGQOL-15-F</italic> between the two groups is very asymmetrical, then a non-parametric approach based on the ranks will be used for statistical testing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Secondary outcome measure analysis</title><p id="Par72">For binary outcome measures a non-adjusted analysis will be carried out using Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. The analysis will then be adjusted according to the centre via a logistic regression model. The quantifiable outcome measures will be analysed using a Student&#x02019;s test for the non-adjusted analysis and an ANOVA model for the analysis adjusted for the centre. A transformation (for example a logarithm) will eventually be envisaged if the distribution of variables is not compatible with the normal distribution assumption. If the envisaged transformations do not enable a symmetrical distribution, a non-parametric analysis will be used (Wilcoxon test and ANOVA on ranks).</p><p id="Par73">The analysis will be performed using the R software (version 3.4.3 or later; The R foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Timeline</title><p id="Par74">Recruitment and final inclusions are anticipated to be completed in June 2017 with final subjects completing the study in February 2018.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Dissemination</title><p id="Par75">We will provide all participants with a summary of trial outcome once data analysis has been completed. The trial results will be widely disseminated to the scientific community and the general community via publications in international peer-reviewed journals and presentations in national and international conferences as well as disseminated to patients via patient groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par76">In this article, we describe the design and methods of MGEX, a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, randomised, controlled trial investigating the tolerance and potential benefits of a moderate-intensity, individualised, home-based physical exercise program in adults with generalised, stable, MG. This is the first study to explore physical exercise in this population with such a large sample size and rigorous methodological design.</p><p id="Par77">Another strength of this study is the comprehensive evaluation using robust outcome measures. Outcome measures are valid and reliable and explore the multiple facets of the disease including the psychological aspects, the various physical symptoms, from a clinical, functional and physiological perspective as well as the complex immunological aspects.</p><p id="Par78">Eligibility criterion are broad enabling the inclusion of multiple MG phenotypes which is important for the external validity of results, particularly as MG is a heterogeneous disease.</p><p id="Par79">Recommendations regarding the practice of physical exercise in this population are lacking. Both patients and clinicians are awaiting evidence-based guidelines. The results of this study have the potential to provide much awaited and needed insight into the feasibility, tolerability and potential beneficial effects of physical exercise for patients with stabilised MG. Another non-randomised trial evaluating multi-modal exercise in stable MG is underway (NCT01047761) and due for completion in 2020.</p><p id="Par80">If safe, participating in regular physical exercise may not only contribute to minimising deconditioning but may also improve QOL and daily function for patients and contribute to secondary prevention of various chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression. Moreover, the possible immunomodulatory effects of exercise which have been investigated in other auto-immune diseases, may also play an important role in the management of this auto-immune disease.</p><p id="Par81">As quantitative data will be collected from the physical exercise sessions in MGEX, there will be no recall bias problems in relation to adherence and tolerability evaluations. The exercise program is personalised and is carried out at home, unsupervised, which is also important for real-life transfer. Thus, patients can be more self-sufficient and autonomous in undertaking an active lifestyle.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par82">To date, 32 patients have been included. Recruitment began in October 2014 and remains open and we are optimistic that the required number of participants will be met. No AEs related to exercise have been reported at this stage. This is V3.0 of the protocol, last updated on 12 January 2017. Clinical research assistants are responsible for informing all necessary bodies of any protocol modifications.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec37"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par90">
