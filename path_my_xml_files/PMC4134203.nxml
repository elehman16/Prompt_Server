The objective of this double blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study was to evaluate in 14 post-menopausal women with an intermediate Nugent score, the effect of 3 days of vaginal administration of probiotic <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 and <italic>L. reuteri</italic> RC-14 (2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> CFU each) on the microbiota and host response. The probiotic treatment did not result in an improved Nugent score when compared to when placebo. Analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics profiling revealed that the relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> was increased following probiotic administration as compared to placebo, which was weakly associated with an increase in lactate levels. A decrease in <italic>Atopobium</italic> was also observed. Analysis of host responses by microarray showed the probiotics had an immune-modulatory response including effects on pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 while also affecting epithelial barrier function. This is the first study to use an interactomic approach for the study of vaginal probiotic administration in post-menopausal women. It shows that in some cases multifaceted approaches are required to detect the subtle molecular changes induced by the host to instillation of probiotic strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02139839">NCT02139839</ext-link>

The pre-menopausal vaginal microbiota and its constituents have been extensively studied using genome sequencing, 16S rRNA community profiling and RNA-seq based meta-transcriptomics <xref rid="pone.0104511-Macklaim1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104511-Macklaim2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, until recently, few studies have used similar in-depth methods to decipher the vaginal microbiome of post-menopausal women, despite its impact on quality of life <xref rid="pone.0104511-Santoro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104511-Nappi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In previous studies, we have shown using high-throughput sequencing methods that contrary to conventional knowledge <xref rid="pone.0104511-Cauci1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, the vaginal microbiome of post-menopausal women is not significantly different from that of pre-menopausal women <xref rid="pone.0104511-Hummelen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Our study showed that the post menopausal vagina appeared to have greater stability than the rapidly fluctuating pre-menopausal microbiome <xref rid="pone.0104511-Hummelen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104511-Gajer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> presumably due to a lack of hormone cycling. We found that similar to premenopausal women, the healthy post-menopausal vaginal microbiome is dominated by a combination of <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic> and <italic>L. crispatus</italic> while BV-associated organisms such as <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> are increased in states of dysbiosis <xref rid="pone.0104511-Hummelen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104511-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104511-Burton2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Despite some deficiencies, Nugent scoring is still the standard technique in most research and clinical settings to rapidly diagnose bacterial vaginosis <xref rid="pone.0104511-Nugent1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The score is calculated by microscopic examination of a Gram-stained vaginal smear and numeration of cell morphotypes to assign a score from 0 to 10 where 0&#x02013;3 is considered normal, 4&#x02013;6 is intermediate and 7&#x02013;10 is BV <xref rid="pone.0104511-Nugent1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The intermediate scores are particularly interesting as they indicate a risk of transition to BV, or they could be a state that reverts to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota.</p><p>Given vaginal contact with sanitary products by menstruating women and the large proportion of postmenopausal women whom suffer urinary incontinence requiring products such as incontinence pads, also in proximity to the vagina, these products may offer a vehicle to deliver a prophylactic probiotic to women that routinely suffer BV or urinary tract infections. We were interested to determine whether the microbiota and Nugent scores were altered by the administration of probiotics with the potential view of perhaps instilling these organisms in such products. <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> RC-14 used in this prospective study are well-characterized probiotic strains used in combination to prevent and treat BV <xref rid="pone.0104511-Anukam1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104511-Hummelen3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition to clinical and Nugent scoring, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to examine changes in the microbiota, GC-MS profiled metabolome changes, the host transcriptional responses were tested using an Affymetrix microarray and inflammatory mediators by multiplex cytokine analysis. This approach was designed to provide a holistic understanding of the probiotic-microbiota-host interactome <xref rid="pone.0104511-Bisanz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participant recruitment and demographics</title><p>A total of 22 subjects were screened and 14 participants were enrolled into a 129-day prospective double-blind, cross-over placebo controlled study (design in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104511.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Additionally, in some cases, such as participant 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104511-g005">Figure 5</xref>), it is not only the probiotics that increased in proportional abundance, but also indigenous lactobacillus such as <italic>L. gasseri/johnsonii</italic>, (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.011 across all samples) which is not significant in the placebo group if the case of participant 09 is excluded (where probiotic appears to have been received rather than placebo).

As the subjects under study had no symptoms of disease, not unexpectedly, the probiotic prophylaxis did not cause any clinical changes. There were no adverse effects of the probiotic therapy. The probiotic administration resulted in a temporary increase in the relative proportion of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in the vagina, which for women whose intermediate score tends to be a predecessor for BV, may help prevent or delay this transition. The near absence of <italic>L. crispatus</italic> (OTU_198), detected in only 1 of 15 women above a 1% threshold and throughout the study at maximum 1.4%, may indicate that the subjects were at a higher risk of BV, since <italic>L. crispatus</italic> is thought to play a protective role in maintaining the vaginal microbiota <xref rid="pone.0104511-Verstraelen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The increase in lactobacilli and potential decreases in BV-associated organisms such as <italic>Atopobium</italic> following probiotics could have been due to displacement of the host's microbes with the total bacterial load remaining the same; or the total bacterial load increased as a result of adding in exogenous lactobacilli. The observation that Shannon's diversity is not affected by probiotic instillation favors the second option. It is interesting to note the increased relative abundance of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> as a result of placebo treatment, which may be the result of the antimicrobial actions of titanium dioxide used in the preparation. It is important to note that the probiotics may create an environment conducive to indigenous lactobacilli such as <italic>L. gasseri</italic> and <italic>L. johnsonii</italic>, however this effect may be short lived. A longer treatment time and follow-up might have determined if there was an effect on diversity, but we were interested in whether a short term probiotic application that women might find easy to administer monthly, could increase the lactobacilli count.</p><p>In some individuals it was extremely clear when the probiotic strains had been applied. The reason for this not being universal is unclear, but could be due to a particularly resilient indigenous microbiota or women who were non-responders for unexplained reasons <xref rid="pone.0104511-Reid2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>We identified a positive correlation between lactate abundance and percentage of lactate producers present r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.43 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9.6&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). Although this correlation seems intuitive, to our knowledge it has never been directly shown. Only the relative abundance of bacterial taxa are measured, and therefore absolute changes affected lactate levels cannot be directly observed. Certain species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> have been associated with lower pH and may produce more lactate compared to others <xref rid="pone.0104511-Ravel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. There was a trend towards an increase in lactate after probiotic and decrease after placebo intervention, but as there were only four women whom responded to treatment and from whose samples enough material for metabolite analysis could be extracted, the sample size is likely too small to reach significance. Still, the observation that probiotics could potentially increase lactate levels is promising as lactate has been shown to have many beneficial properties in the vaginal tract such as HIV inactivation <xref rid="pone.0104511-Aldunate1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Overall, the administration of the two lactobacilli strains did not induce any more changes than placebo in the metabolome, but lack of material makes this result inconclusive. In our experience and that of others, the metabolomic patterns differ between health and BV, with the latter showing odorous compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine, but these trends were not clearly observed in this study <xref rid="pone.0104511-Yeoman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to looking at the bacterial communities, we sought to examine host responses to probiotic treatment. It has been well established that probiotic strains can affect host transcription in the gut in a strain specific manor <xref rid="pone.0104511-vanBaarlen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> but this is the first time similar studies have been carried out in the vagina. Our findings show that <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 and <italic>L. reuteri</italic> RC-14 had an immunomodulatory effect working on important central inflammatory mediators complement receptor 1, toll like receptor 2 and IL-18. Though limited in the number of subjects available for analysis, the strength of this analysis is the use a paired study design. Interleukin 18 is a proinflammatory cytokine inducing cell-mediated immunity via interferon gamma though it also has effects on B cells and IgE production <xref rid="pone.0104511-Biet1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the female reproductive tract it may be of relevance in preterm birth <xref rid="pone.0104511-Jacobsson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> indicating microbial invasion of the amnion, but it also has protective roles against genital herpes simplex 2 <xref rid="pone.0104511-Harandi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The effect of probiotic treatment on IL-18 expression may not be a direct interaction, but rather indicative of anti-viral actions of the probiotics resulting which has previously been hypothesized and shown <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0104511-Aldunate1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104511-Bolton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Alternatively it may reflect a general up-regulation of the innate immune system by the probiotic strains. Unfortunately, our cytokine/chemokine panel did not cover IL-18 to help support this finding. Alternatively the up-regulation, of complement receptors 1 and 3a, as well as TLR2 both are indicative of increased anti-bacterial innate immune system activity. TLR2 specifically is involved in detection of Gram-positive surface markers (including lactobacilli) <xref rid="pone.0104511-Schwandner1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> while the complement receptors are important for phagocytosis and inflammatory cascades in response to bacterial infections <xref rid="pone.0104511-Zipfel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> has previously been shown to modulate TLR2 expression which may play a role in modifying infection response <xref rid="pone.0104511-Rizzo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In addition, our cytokine/chemokine multiplex results may indicate the up-regulation of interleukin 5 which is most commonly associated with eosinophil activation <xref rid="pone.0104511-Molfino1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Though commonly associated with parasites, eosinophils have also been associated with <italic>Actinomyces</italic>-like organisms in the urogenital tract and may display some activity against bacterial infection <xref rid="pone.0104511-Kaya1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These seemingly pro-inflammatory responses may be beneficial in aiding the host immune system to help clear BV-associated pathogens to restore a more normal microbiota of symbionts. Microarray analysis failed to collaborate the finding that interleukin 5 was up-regulated, however the two individuals surveyed by microarray did not show up-regulation by cytokine analysis either. If all participants could have been surveyed this result may have been different.</p><p>Interestingly, caspase 14 plays a role in development and barrier function of the epidermis <xref rid="pone.0104511-Denecker1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and we had previously observed its differential regulation associated with vaginal dryness and dysbiosis in a subset of post-menopausal women. Its up-regulation following probiotic treatment may be evidence of improvement in strength and integrity of the vaginal epithelium, though further research is needed to verify this claim. Indeed probiotics are thought to positively act on barrier function <xref rid="pone.0104511-Sultana1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated the use of a systems-wide interactomics approach to examine how probiotic application might modulate the vagina in post-menopausal women. The short duration therapy increased the lactobacilli, as well as modulating inflammatory markers. As the transition from healthy to intermediate to BV is such a common occurrence, women may feel that a three day intravaginal probiotic may be beneficial. A larger study is needed to support this, but the present study showed no harm and the potential for such a benefit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Participant Recruiting and study design</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104511.s013">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104511.s012">Protocol S1</xref>.

The weight of each sample was divided by the weight of the lightest sample and this fraction was multiplied by 200 &#x000b5;L to determine the volume of methanol-water to add to each sample. This corresponded to a volume of 200&#x02013;382 &#x000b5;L, depending on the mass of vaginal fluid collected. A blank swab eluted in 200 &#x000b5;L methanol-water was included as a negative control. All samples were vortexed for 10 s to extract metabolites, centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic>, vortexed again for 10 s after which time the brushes were removed from tubes. Samples were centrifuged a final time to pellet cells and 150 &#x000b5;L of the supernatant was transferred to a GC-MS vial. Next, 2.5 &#x000b5;L of 2 mg/mL ribitol was added to each vial as an internal standard. Samples were then dried to completeness using a SpeedVac. After drying, 100 &#x000b5;L of 2% methoxyamine&#x02022;HCl in pyridine (MOX) was added to each for derivatization and incubated at 50&#x000b0;C for 90 min. 100 &#x000b5;L N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) was then added to each vial and incubated at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min, then transferred to micro inserts before running on GC-MS (Agilent 7890A GC, 5975 inert MSD with triple axis detector, 30 m DB5-MS column with 10 m duraguard column). Samples were analyzed once for untargeted whole metabolome analysis, and a second time on selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode specific for lactate using the reference ions 117, 147, 191 and 219. Solvent delay was 10 min and sample injection volume was 1 uL. All samples were run in random order and one was run multiple times throughout to ensure machine consistency.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Lactate relative abundance quantification</title><p>Chromatograms were deconvoluted in Chemstation (Agilent) and lactate relative abundance determined by peak area using the auto integration function. Lactate relative abundance was plotted against the percentage of lactate producers (<italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic>, <italic>Atopobium</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Weisella</italic>) present in each sample to determine the correlation between lactate levels and lactate producing bacteria. The correlation value was determined in R using a Pearson's correlation. Paired t-tests were used to determine if probiotic or placebo intervention had a significant effect on lactate levels using a significance threshold of p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Whole metabolome analysis</title><p>Chromatogram files were converted to ELU format using the AMDIS Mass Spectrometry software <xref rid="pone.0104511-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Chromatograms were then aligned and abundance of metabolites calculated using the Spectconnect software <xref rid="pone.0104511-Styczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, with the support threshold set to low. In order to determine changes in the metabolome due to probiotic or placebo, Principle component analysis (PCA) was conducted in SIMCA (Umetrics) using the relative abundance matrix (RA) output from Spectconnect. Data were mean centered and pareto scaled prior to PCA. A Mann- Whitney U test was then used to determine metabolites that were significantly altered by intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Cytokine/Chemokine Measurement</title><p>Swabs were resuspended in 200 &#x000b5;L extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl ph7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 uL/mL protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), vortexed, incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, swab removed and then 50 &#x000b5;L more extraction buffer was added before being stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The resulting samples were thawed on ice and loaded onto a Milliplex Human High Sensitivity Cytokine/Chemokine Panel (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Mass, USA) and analyzed for IL-1B, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFNg, GM-CSF, and TNFa. Results for IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IFNg were not displayed as they were consistently outside the assay range and there was limited material for reanalysis. The plate was analyzed using a Bio-Plex 200 System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) with cytokine/chemokine levels being generated automatically from standard curves using the Bio-Plex Manager software (v.4.1.1 Bio-Rad). In cases where the analyte was detected, but below the limit of detection, &#x000bd; the LOD was used for analysis. Results were normalized to total protein as determined with the Qubit Protein Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 Flourometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). Paired t-tests were used to make comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104511.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
