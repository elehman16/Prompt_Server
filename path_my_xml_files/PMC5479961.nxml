The primary purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether a behavioral intervention implemented in early pregnancy through 6&#x000a0;months postpartum could increase the proportion of African American women who were at or below their early pregnancy weights by 6&#x000a0;months postpartum. We additionally evaluated whether mothers' postpartum weight loss could be maintained at 12&#x000a0;months postpartum. Participants were 66 socioeconomically disadvantaged African American women (36% overweight, 64% obese) randomly assigned to a behavioral intervention or usual care group. The intervention, implemented from early pregnancy to 6&#x000a0;months postpartum, promoted weight control through: (1) empirically supported behavior change goals; (2) interactive self-monitoring text messages; (3) weekly to monthly health coach calls; and (4) skills training and support through Facebook. In modified intent-to-treat analyses, participants assigned to the intervention were significantly more likely to be at or below their early pregnancy weights by 6&#x000a0;months postpartum compared to usual care (56% vs. 29%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04). At 12&#x000a0;months postpartum, the maternal weight difference between intervention and usual care groups was not maintained (41% vs. 38% respectively at or below early pregnancy weights, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.83). Findings suggest that a combined pregnancy and postpartum weight control intervention improves 6&#x000a0;month weight outcomes in socioeconomically disadvantaged African American women with obesity. Longer interventions may be needed to overcome late postpartum weight gain among this high risk group.</p><p><bold>Clinical trial registration number</bold>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0005">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01530776" id="ir0010">NCT01530776</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>A combined pregnancy and postpartum intervention reduced 6&#x000a0;month weight retention.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>By12 months postpartum, the intervention's weight effect was not maintained.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Longer interventions may be needed to overcome late postpartum weight gain.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Postpartum</kwd><kwd>African American</kwd><kwd>Weight loss</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Returning to early pregnancy weight by 6&#x000a0;months postpartum is particularly challenging for African American women with obesity (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Headen et al., 2012</xref>).

Using Temple's electronic medical record (EMR), study staff identified potential participants by BMI, gestation length, and age, and then approached them in waiting rooms to assess trial interest. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;years; 2) self-identification as African American; 3) gestation length&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;weeks; 4) first trimester BMI 25&#x02013;45&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 5) Medicaid recipient (income proxy); 6) cell phone ownership with unlimited text messaging; and 7) Facebook member. Women that endorsed current tobacco use, were carrying multiples, or reported conditions that required specialized nutritional care were excluded. A baseline assessment was scheduled and completed at our research center (in a building separate from our obstetric practices) after which participants were randomly assigned by computer-generated numbers into the intervention or usual obstetric care. Additional assessments at 36&#x000a0;weeks' gestation, 6&#x000a0;months postpartum and 12&#x000a0;months postpartum were performed; participants who attended all visits received a total of $120 for time/travel. Pregnancy findings were published previously (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Herring et al., 2016</xref>). All subjects gave written informed consent for participation, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Temple University.</p><p>Participants randomized to the intervention arm received a behavioral lifestyle intervention designed to: 1) prevent excessive weight gain in pregnancy (delivered from baseline to 36&#x000a0;weeks' gestation); and 2) promote weight loss postpartum (delivered between 10&#x000a0;weeks' and 6&#x000a0;months after childbirth). During our formative work, we identified and prioritized a series of behavior change goals that were evidence based, relevant to the patient population, and could be easily self-monitored through text messaging. Examples included (as provided to participants): &#x0201c;Limit junk and high fat foods to no more than 1 per day&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;Limit sugary drinks like juice and soda to no more than 1 per day&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;Walk 5000 steps daily&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;Weigh yourself weekly&#x0201d;. While goals were nearly identical in pregnancy and the early postpartum period, framing of messages differed (e.g., pregnancy messages were framed around &#x0201c;being healthy for baby&#x0201d;, while postpartum messages were focused on &#x0201c;being a role model&#x0201d;). Skills training and support were delivered via three duplicate mechanisms during and after pregnancy: 1) daily skill-building text messages tailored to each behavioral goal; 2) weekly Facebook posts with links to websites and videos; and 3) weekly to monthly 15-minute scripted calls with a bachelor's level health coach so to problem solve barriers, provide support, and build participant self-efficacy for behavior change. We provided information about cost and community resources to heighten salience of materials. Self-monitoring texts were additionally sent to participants 3&#x02013;4 times weekly to probe about behavioral adherence. Text message prompts in the morning (e.g., &#x0201c;Please text us # cups of sugary drinks u had yesterday&#x0201d;) were followed by immediate automatic feedback to reinforce successes and/or offer support (e.g., &#x0201c;U had 2 sugary drinks. Ur almost at ur goal. Here's a tip: add sugar-free flavoring to ur water to give it more taste&#x0201d;). To aid in goal attainment, intervention participants received a digital scale for self-weighing, pedometer to track steps, water bottle, and portion plate to encourage smaller portions. A binder with print versions of program content was also provided for skills training if technology access was lost.</p><p>The primary outcome for this study was the proportion of women at (within 0.9&#x000a0;kg) or below their early pregnancy weights by 6&#x000a0;months postpartum (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Phelan et al., 2011</xref>). Secondary outcomes included proportion of women at or below their early pregnancy weights by 12&#x000a0;months postpartum, intervention engagement (e.g., the proportion of participants who responded to &#x02265;&#x000a0;50% of the self-monitoring text prompts and number of coach calls completed), and treatment acceptability assessed via survey at 6-month postpartum follow-up. Weights were assessed at Temple's obstetric practices in pregnancy and then abstracted from the EMR; we used earliest abstracted prenatal weight to define early pregnancy weight and additionally abstracted last measured weight prior to delivery to calculate total gestational weight gain. We and others have found that the absolute agreement between research and prenatal clinic measured weights is extremely high, providing strong support for exchangeability (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Vesco et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Leo et al., 2014</xref>). Six-month postpartum weights (end of treatment) and 12-month postpartum weights (6-month follow-up) were assessed via calibrated scales at our research center during in-person visits. Missing postpartum weights at 6&#x000a0;months (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) and 12-months (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) were additionally filled with EMR data (weights were accepted &#x000b1;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;days of planned 6-month and &#x000b1;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;days of planned 12-month postpartum assessments).</p><p>To compare baseline characteristics and outcome data between the intervention and usual care groups, we used Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, and <italic>t</italic>-tests or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests for continuous variables. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the effect of treatment group on our primary outcome, adjusting for potential confounders of postpartum weight retention, including early pregnancy BMI, parity, and maternal age. Our a priori analysis plan followed a modified intent-to-treat approach (ITT) that conservatively assumed participants who were lost to follow-up were treatment failures (e.g., were not at or below their early pregnancy weights), an approach that has been published elsewhere (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Phelan et al., 2011</xref>). We also explored whether gestational weight gain (last measured weight before delivery minus first measured weight in early pregnancy) was predictive of 6-month and 12-month postpartum weight change using multiple linear regression.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s0020"><label>3.1</label><title>Sample</title><p><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> summarizes the participant flow.

Given the dearth of efficacious postpartum weight loss studies in ethnic minority women, our findings suggest that including pregnancy in the intervention design may be an important strategy to prevent postpartum weight retention among this high risk population. Once treatment ended, however, the maternal weight differences between intervention and usual care groups were not maintained at 12&#x000a0;months postpartum.</p><p>The 6-month weight findings of our study are similar to Huang's findings in Taiwanese women (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2011</xref>), who also observed reductions in weight retention at 6-months postpartum following weight control treatment in pregnancy and the early postpartum periods. Additionally, both trials had significant reductions in pregnancy weight gains that likely mediated intervention effects (at least in part) at 6-months postpartum (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Herring et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). However, by 12-months postpartum, gestational weight gain no longer predicted weight retention in our study, and thus, African American women randomized to the intervention group were unable to maintain their weight loss. Longer interventions may be needed to overcome late postpartum weight gain among this high risk group.</p><p>Intervening in pregnancy alone, however, may be unlikely to produce the same magnitude of weight loss we found by 6&#x000a0;months postpartum. In one of the largest weight control interventions implemented solely in pregnancy, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Phelan et al. (2011)</xref> reported that 25.6% of participants with overweight or obesity returned to their preconception weights (within 0.9&#x000a0;kg) or below at 6&#x000a0;months postpartum. We observed more than double this proportion (56%) in our study. This finding highlights the need to intervene both during and after pregnancy if the goal is to substantially reduce postpartum weight retention.</p><p>Strengths of our study include its randomized design, treatment in pregnancy and the postpartum periods, focus on African American women with obesity (an understudied group at high risk for weight retention), use of mobile phone technologies for intervention delivery, and duration of participant follow-up. However, any conclusions must be tempered by study limitations including the pilot nature and small sample size. Our design did not allow for isolation of discrete intervention components, and thus, we were unable to determine which component attributed to the observed effects. We used clinic measured weights in calculations of some outcomes, and thus, cannot be certain these weights were collected with the same degree of quality (e.g., calibrated scales, no shoes) as weights collected by research staff. Clinic staff were blind to randomization assignment; however, so any measurement bias would likely be non-differential across treatment groups. Finally, while we recognize that the modified ITT approach has its limitations, analyses that used data of completers yielded near-identical results.</p><p>In conclusion, the implementation of a behavioral intervention during and after pregnancy was effective in increasing the proportion of obese African American women who were at or below their early pregnancy weights by 6&#x000a0;months postpartum. These promising findings should trigger a larger definitive study in this and potentially other populations.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the <funding-source id="gts0005">National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (NIH K23 HL106231) and the <funding-source id="gts0010">Health Resources and Services Administration</funding-source> (HRSA R40MC26818) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
