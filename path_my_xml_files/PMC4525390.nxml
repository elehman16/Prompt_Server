Transmembrane and peripheral proteins of various shapes, molecular masses and charges regulate important cellular functions; but their position, integration and functioning are all affected by membrane fluidity and thus fatty acid composition, especially the double bonds in PUFA, have strong influence and the replacement of even a single double bond in these PUFAs is sufficient to exert a profound effect on the physical properties of the membrane.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The primary n-3 PUFA in the brain is Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); it is involved in the regulation of neuronal function via several different mechanisms, like interaction with ion channels, modulation of membrane biophysical properties, regulation of neurotransmitter release, neurotransmitter signaling, and synthesis of biologically active oxygenated derivatives and nuclear-receptor-mediated transcription of genes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Other n-3 PUFA, such as &#x003b1;-linolenic acid (ALA) or Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), constitute a very small fraction of brain total fatty acids (&#x0003c;1% for ALA, and &#x0003c;0.1% for EPA).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The fundamental importance of DHA for brain development is beyond dispute. DHA is the most fluidizing element in cell membranes.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Diet is the important source of n-3 PUFA. The n-3 PUFA derived from marine animals primarily consist of EPA and DHA. The n-3 PUFAs derived from plants consists of ALA. Although DHA can be endogenously synthesized from ALA in the liver,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the conversion efficiency of ALA to DHA is very low, being only approximately 7% or less in humans.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Most DHA, therefore, must be obtained from marine dietary sources or fish-oil based nutraceutical supplements.</p><p>With respect to epilepsy, there is evidence suggesting that n-3 PUFAs may have a potential use in the treatment of epilepsy; recent studies in animal models have shown that they can raise the threshold of epileptic seizures.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In the following study, the effect of n-3 PUFAs in fish oil on epileptic seizures' frequency and severity was examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This single-blinded, randomized, pretest post-test controlled group study was conducted in the Neurology Department at Alexandria Pediatric Center from September 2013 to April 2014. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical committee of the High Institute of Public Health. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the participants. Children of both sexes, between 4 and 12 years of age, with average weight of 26.76 kg, suffering from medically resistant epilepsy,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] regardless of the type of seizure (partial or generalized) were randomly divided into 2 groups: 1) the intervention or fish oil-supplemented group and 2) the control or placebo assigned group. In both groups, children continued to take their anti-epileptic treatments. Evaluation of the frequency and severity of the epileptic seizures was done before starting the intervention, after one month, after two months and at the end of the third month of the study.</p><p>Seizure frequency was evaluated by recording the number of epileptic attack per month using a diary given to the parents who had to register the number of seizure attacks each day. Seizure severity was assessed by the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3),[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which was administered during an interview with the parents or a witness to the seizures; it contains seven seizure-related factors and generates a score from 1 to 27. Scores on the NHS3 in the intervention and control groups were compared before, and at one month, two months and three months after the start of intake of fish oil or placebo.</p><p>The intervention group received for three months a 3-milliliter daily dose of 1200 mg fish oil providing 240 mg DHA and 360 mg EPA. Supplements used in the present study also contained Vitamin E added to prevent oxidation of the fatty acids. The control group received daily 3 milliliters of corn oil as placebo. All children known to have hypersensitivity to fish oil, with bleeding disorders, treated with Warfarin for 30 days or less prior to enrollment, taking aspirin daily or enrolled any change in antiepileptic drugs for 30 days or less prior to enrollment were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were coded and analyzed with statistical software SPSS version 16.

This median decreased to 2 after one month and became 0 after two and three months of intervention with fish oil supplementation while it remained 4 in the control group. Therefore, there was a statistically significant decrease in the monthly number of seizures after three months of fish oil supplementation compared to the baseline before supplementation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

The attacks that occurred were as strong in the intervention group as in the control group.</p><p>As to the frequency, however, the number of epileptic attacks decreased dramatically: 20 of the 35 children in the intervention group became free of seizures after three months of fish oil supplementation, while10 patients were having only 1 to 3 epileptic attacks per month and finally, only 3 children continued to have 30 + attacks per month, although 12 patients had been in this category before starting the intervention.</p><p>Impressive researches demonstrated the importance of n-3 PUFAs in epilepsy treatment in both humans and animals, and some of them were in agreement with our work. A clinical trial by Khayat <italic>et al</italic>., studying the anticonvulsant effects of n-3 PUFAs on 20 patients with intractable seizure was published in 2010 and revealed a negative correlation between DHA and EPA plasma concentration and seizure frequency, duration and severity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This is similar to our successful results only regarding attacks frequency. In addition to that, the results of a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial, of low-dose and high-dose fish oil versus placebo (corn oil, linoleic acid) in 24 participants with drug-resistant epilepsy, by DeGiorgio <italic>et al</italic>., indicate that low-dose fish oil may reduce seizures and improve the health of people with epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The results of our studies are stronger than those of the two recent studies mentioned, and this may be due to the low intake of food containing n-3 PUFA in Egypt, which was deduced in a specific nutrition survey done in 2010 by the department of epidemiology in Harvard School of Public Health. This survey showed that North Africa/Middle East region, including Egypt, is considered to have very low mean consumption of sea food Omega 3 fats (&#x0003c;100 mg per day) and low mean consumption of plants Omega 3 food fats (&#x0003c;600 mg per day).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is an obvious decrease in the number of epileptic attacks per month in the children with medically resistant epilepsy taking fish oil containing long chain n-3 PUFAs (EPA + DHA), which agrees with the theories suggesting that n-3 PUFAs elevate the seizure threshold in epileptic patients and may help in achieving seizure control.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This project has been funded with support from Alexandria University, Faculty of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Special thanks for Dr. Shehata Farag Shehata Assistant Lecturer of Biostatistics In High Institute of Public Health, Alexandria University, for his precious help in the statistical studies.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>International League Against Epilepsy, World Health Organization, International Bureau for Epilepsy.
