plantar pressures when school children carried specific bag loads, and to determine
whether improved physical balance after an eight-week spinal stabilization exercise
program can influences plantar pressures. [Subjects] The subjects were 10 school students
with Cobb angles of 10&#x000b0; or greater. [Methods] Gait View Pro 1.0 (Alfoots, Korea) was were
based on to measure the pressure of the participants&#x02019; feet. Spinal stabilization exercises
used TOGU Multi-roll Functional (TOGU, Germany) training. Dynamic plantar pressures were
measured with bag loads of 0% no bag and 15% of subjects&#x02019; body weight. The independent t
test was performed to analyze changes in plantar pressures. [Results] The plantar pressure
measurements of bag load of 0% of subjects&#x02019; body weight before and after the spinal
stabilization exercise program were not significantly different, but those of two foot
areas with a 15% load were statistically significant (mt5, 67.32&#x000b1;24.25 and 51.77&#x000b1;25.52
kPa; lat heel, 126.00&#x000b1;20.46 and 102.08&#x000b1;23.87 kPa). [Conclusion] After performance of the
spinal stabilization exercises subjects&#x02019; overall plantar pressures were reduced, which may
suggest that physical balance improved.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Idiopathic scoliosis</kwd><kwd>Dynamic foot pressure</kwd><kwd>Backpack load</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Scoliosis refers to three-dimensional deformations in which a more than 10&#x000b0; lateral flexion
is formed in the spinal rotation in the coronal plane<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This disease is accompanied by several symptoms, such as back pain,
deformation of the thoracic cage, weakening of the respiratory muscles, and limited range of
motion. Therefore, scoliosis subsequently results in a reduced quality of life<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
While the causes of idiopathic scoliosis have not been identified, various hypotheses exist,
including genetic, biochemical, mechanical, neurological, myological, and hormonal
factors<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most common types of
idiopathic scoliosis are revealed during childhood and adolescence<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several complex problems result from this condition,
including reduced control of balance, muscle imbalances, and gait asymmetry, which can
exacerbate the symptoms during patients&#x02019; growth phase. A previous study emphasized the
importance of suppressing the progression of idiopathic scoliosis in adolescents through the
early detection of the condition based on regular diagnoses and immediate treatment after
diagnosis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An environmental factor that leads to scoliosis during childhood and adolescence is
habitually incorrect posture. Asymmetrical gait patterns further change posture by
influencing trunk balance and spinal movement. In addition, when school students carry a
school bag with a weight greater than 10&#x02013;15% of their body weight, they may experience
reduced lung capacity and exhibit postural and gait changes, such as leaning the upper body
forward and lowering the head. The continuation of these patterns puts pressure on the
spine, causing musculoskeletal pain and structural spinal changes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, when patients with idiopathic scoliosis
symmetrically carry a bag with a load weight of at least 10% of their body weight on each of
their shoulders while standing up, they experience changes in their physical balance and
stability. Moreover, when they carry bags asymmetrically, it is recommended that they avoid
carrying them on the convex surface of the shoulder<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In an individual&#x02019;s normal gait, the ground reaction force must equal the body weight<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, abnormal gait patterns lead to
the inappropriate distribution of force and pressure on the foot<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The distribution of pressure is influenced by several
factors, including age, gender, weight, and ankle range of motion<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The weight of bags that students carry when they travel
to and from school is added to their body weight, and the combined weight is likely to
change the distribution of plantar pressures while school students are standing or walking,
further exacerbating their abnormal gait patterns, back pain, foot deformations, or spinal
disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to measure and observe the changes in
dynamic plantar pressures when the subjects carried specific bag loads, and to determine
whether improved physical balance after an eight-week spinal stabilization exercise program
influences plantar pressures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted a gaining approval from the institutional review board (IRB) of
Kangwon University (Project No. 2014-08-002-001). This study sent information about
scoliosis to the fourth, fifth, and sixth graders of K Elementary School located in
Gangreung City. The Adam&#x02019;s Forward Bend Test was performed to identify the students who
showed rotational asymmetry. Then, X-ray images were obtained, and 10 students with Cobb
angles of 10&#x000b0; or greater were invited to participate in the experiment After the procedures
of the study had been explained, the consent of these individuals to participation in this
study was obtained in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Exclusion criteria included: severe foot deformation, abnormal gait, or muscular weakness
severe enough to prevent performance of the study&#x02019;s exercise program. The subjects were
(mean&#x000b1;SD) 10.20&#x000b1;0.92&#x02005;years of age, 144.58&#x000b1;7.52&#x02005;cm tall, and weighed 38.50&#x000b1;5.96&#x02005;kg. Most of

measure the pressure applied to the soles of the participants&#x02019; feet. For an accurate test,
the participants were provided with preliminary education about smooth, natural gaits and a
full explanation of the test&#x02019;s purpose. The test was performed when the subjects were
capable of adopting natural gaits and after repeating several rounds of practice.</p><p>Eight plantar areas of interest were established, and kPa was chosen as the unit of
measurement. After measuring the target areas, the analysis was conducted. The subjects&#x02019;
heights and body weights were measured using a GL-150 (G-Tech International, Korea) height
and weight measuring instrument, and a 15% calculation of the participants&#x02019; measured body
weights was performed. The weights of the bags that were used in the experiment were set
using the SH-999 (Shibata Korea, China) digital portable baggage scale. The average weight
of the subjects&#x02019; bags was 15% of their body weight, which was 5.76&#x000b1;0.90&#x02005;kg before the
exercise program, and 6.00&#x000b1;0.93&#x02005;kg after the exercise program (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The spinal stabilization training exercise model was performed after reorganizing the
exercise methods used in previous studies and basing them on the segmental stabilization
exercise model<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study&#x02019;s spinal stabilization exercises were based on TOGU
Multi-roll Functional (TOGU, Germany) training. Each subject performed upper- and
lower-extremity separation in the supine position on an unstable base of support, axial
rotation of the trunk while on their knees, and upper- and lower-extremity separation in the
prone position. The participants were instructed to perform three sets of each exercise, and
they maintained the position at the end of each motion for three seconds. They were then
given a 60-second break after each set, so they relaxed a total of 12 times.</p><p>The participants&#x02019; dynamic plantar pressures were measured with a bag load of 0% of their
body weight, i.e. not carrying a bag, and a bag load of 15% of their body weight, when
carrying a bag. This experiment used the bags the subjects carried when while they attended
school. The participants began walking at a specific distance from the plantar pressure
analysis plate. They were instructed to place their target foot on the plate with the fourth
step they took. The participants kept looking forward, as if they were walking naturally.
They were instructed to refrain from looking down at the plate as much as possible. After
the initial plantar pressure measurements, an eight-week spinal stabilization exercise
program was implemented. This program was conducted in three one-hour sessions each week.
After the exercise program ended, the dynamic plantar pressures of the participants were
again measured using the same method.</p><p>SPSS Statistics Version 18 was employed for statistical analyses, and all the data are
presented as averages and standard deviations. The independent t-test was performed to
analyze the changes in plantar pressures between the bag loads of 0% and 15% of the
subjects&#x02019; body weight before and after the spinal stabilization exercise program. The
statistical significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Pre- and post-intervention foot pressure comparisons (unit: kPa)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">0%</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">15%</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-EX</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-EX</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-EX</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-EX</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hallux</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.7&#x000b1;32.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.9&#x000b1;32.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.3&#x000b1;47.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.0&#x000b1;43.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02013;5 toe</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.9&#x000b1;12.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.3&#x000b1;9.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.5&#x000b1;19.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.0&#x000b1;16.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 mt</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.5&#x000b1;37.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.0&#x000b1;34.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.3&#x000b1;40.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">78.9&#x000b1;42.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02013;4 mt</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95.8&#x000b1;20.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">96.7&#x000b1;14.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">109.9&#x000b1;20.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.9&#x000b1;27.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 mt</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.2&#x000b1;20.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.8&#x000b1;21.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.3&#x000b1;24.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.8&#x000b1;25.5<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mid foot</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.9&#x000b1;14.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.8&#x000b1;15.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.9&#x000b1;16.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.9&#x000b1;16.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Med heel</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">110.8&#x000b1;19.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112.1&#x000b1;16.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">122.3&#x000b1;23.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">102.8&#x000b1;26.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lat heel</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">107.8&#x000b1;25.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">103.4&#x000b1;30.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">126.0&#x000b1;20.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">102.1&#x000b1;23.9<sup>*</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD, *p&#x0003c;0.05</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> presents the dynamic plantar pressure data of the participants&#x02019; left feet for

pressure measurements of the bag load of 0% of subjects&#x02019; body weight before and after the
spinal stabilization exercise program showed that three of the eight plantar areas of the
left foot exhibited decreases in dynamic plantar pressure; however, these differences were
not statistically significant (p&#x0003e;0.05). The plantar pressure measurements of the bag load
of 15% of the subjects&#x02019; body weight before and after the spinal stabilization exercise

dynamic plantar pressure, and the differences in two areas were statistically significant

(p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Human posture while standing upright is unstable by nature. Therefore, its balance is
maintained by continuous physical responses to integrated information gathered by the visual
proprioceptive senses, the vestibular system, and somatesthesia<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance in the standing position is affected by external
factors or carrying external loads, such as bags. As this effect maybe a pathological factor
for idiopathic scoliosis, it requires special attention<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The foot is the body region that has first contact with an external surface when an
individual is in the standing position. To control posture, sensory information is gathered
through the foot that contacts the ground<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The information gathered by the foot changes muscle activation
patterns, affecting human posture and spinal and pelvic alignment. In addition, this
information plays an important role in maintaining the mechanical functions of the lower
extremities and establishing physical balance and stability during walking<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measurement of plantar pressure is widely used in pathological
diagnoses of foot problems and can provide additional insight into various musculoskeletal
diseases in the lower extremities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A study reported that differences in the patterns of movement in the center of the plantar
pressure of both feet have a statistically significant correlation with the degree of
scoliosis, which influences foot imbalance<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study measured the foot pressures of elementary
school children with scoliosis when they carried bags weighing 0% and 15% of their body
weight and compared them with those taken after an eight-week spinal stabilization exercise
program had been performed.</p><p>A major function of exercise control is to maintain posture by minimizing disruptions to an
individual&#x02019;s balance. In other words, this function stabilizes the line of gravity in the
entire body by aligning the body based on its external environment<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Morphological changes and a damaged sense of movement,
which are related to idiopathic scoliosis, cause problems with balance control<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, exercises may be essential for improving neuromotor
control, the stability of physical balance, and respiratory functions<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After the spinal stabilization exercises had been completed in this study, the subjects&#x02019;
overall plantar pressure was reduced and their physical balance had improved. In addition,
certain plantar areas exhibited statistically significant declines in plantar pressure at a
bag load of 15% of the participants&#x02019; body weight, which suggests that physical balance was
improved by the spinal stabilization exercises eliciting effective spreading of the
distribution of plantar pressures that increase when a load is carried.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, it only compared the dynamic plantar pressures of
10 school children with idiopathic scoliosis; there was no control group. Moreover, it did
not perform a direct analysis of the correlation between Cobb angle and plantar pressure.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the study&#x02019;s results can be generalized. Future studies will
be required to classify the subjects&#x02019; major curvatures in detail, and to analyze the
relationship between improved Cobb angles and plantar pressures, the results of which may
contribute to the facilitation of spinal stabilization exercise programs for patients with
idiopathic scoliosis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Asher</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Burton</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: natural history and long
