Preterm birth complications lead to 35&#x000a0;% of world&#x02019;s 3.1 million annual neonatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A baby born with low birth weight (less than 2,500&#x000a0;g) had approximately 20 times risk to die than a baby with birth weight above 2,500&#x000a0;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Life course theory suggested negative birth outcomes including low birth weight and pre-term birth have lifelong effects, increasing the risk of chronic disease in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As one of the developing countries, China is ranked as having the second highest (after India) number of neonatal and infant deaths in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To tackle with and reduce the negative birth outcomes is an urgent task of achieving Millennium Development Goals and reducing susceptibility of adulthood chronic disease worldwide including China.</p><p>Systematic reviews have shown poor oral health, such as periodontal disease, is associated with an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight etc., especially in low- or middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. But, several randomized controlled trials failed to show a significant reduction in preterm birth and low birth weight as a result of standard periodontal treatment in pregnant women with periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>As the standard therapy of periodontal disease, the scaling and root planning (SRP) during pregnancy itself possibly causes bacteremia thereby triggering a systemic inflammatory response, which may lead to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Due to the safety reasons during pregnancy, the frequency of periodontal treatment are often restricted, with only one or two therapy courses, which might not sufficient to prevent the progression of periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it might be the SRP treatment itself that causes a failure of treating periodontal inflammations during pregnancy as well as preventing adverse birth outcomes.</p><p>In many poor and low-income areas, there is the universal shortage of qualified dental human resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The conventional SRP periodontal treatment is often unavailable for most of grass-roots. A simple, affordable and practical oral health care to prevent the progression of periodontal disease is needed. A recent clinical trial conducted in the U.S. has demonstrated that the use of non-alcohol antimicrobial mouth rinse containing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) results in a significantly reduced incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight in pregnant women with high risk, and that its use is safe to pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Antimicrobial mouth rinse containing CPC is an attractive approach for gestational oral health care as its inexpensive cost and the capability of reducing bacterial plaque, gingival inflammation and periodontal disease without additional periodontal intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, it is easy to be implemented without the requirement of the operation by dental professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, this mouth rinse intervention has not been tested to prevent adverse birth outcomes in low resource settings, like in rural regions of China. Therefore, we proposed to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine whether a &#x0201c;Mouth Rinse Intervention (MRI)&#x0201d; during pregnancy would reduce adverse birth outcomes in a rural area of China.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The objective of this study is to develop and test aMRI among pregnant women to prevent the progression of periodontal disease during pregnancy and reduce adverse birth and neonatal outcomes in a rural county of Jiangxi Province, China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>We hypothesize that the MRI will</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>increase birth weight and prolong gestational duration;</p></list-item><list-item><p>reduce progression of periodontal disease during pregnancy;</p></list-item><list-item><p>improve neonatal health; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>be acceptable and applicable in resource limited rural areas.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary outcomes are mean birth weight (grams) and mean gestational age (weeks).

PSR, developed by the American Academy of Periodontology, was a simple screening method for periodontal disease. In this method, the mouth is divided into sextants, using a ball tipped probe with a color-coded area 3.5 to 5.5 from the tip. The dentist inserts the probe into the periodontal pocket, walks around the circumference of each tooth, and observes the position of the color-coded band in relation to the gingival margin. Only the highest code obtained is recorded, representative for the code of the sextant it belongs to. Measurements are recorded in a special box chart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

As perinatal oral health care usually not available in rural China, our proposed intervention will be the first study aiming to explore a convenient, affordable, acceptable oral health care package in rural China. If the intervention is effective, it will be more acceptable than the conventional and standard periodontal therapy by women, and have potential generalizability to other similar poor areas, where childbearing aged or pregnant women have very limited access to oral health care.</p><p>The conventional periodontal therapy mainly includes &#x0201c;SRP,&#x0201d; which involves mechanically cleaning the teeth above and below the gum line by removing the etiologic agents that cause inflammation. However, due to the high cost, the demand for expensive dental equipment, and the need for professional dentists in order to perform periodontal therapy, as well as concerns regarding the safety of the therapy, this conventional periodontal therapy may not be feasible to apply in low resource settings. In addition, we use a rapid PSR for the screening periodontal disease. Compared to the conventional full-mouth dental examination, the PSR takes only a few minutes to conduct for each patient, does not require the use of expensive dental equipment, and can be performed by non-oral health professionals after receiving appropriate training, which is particularly applicable to economically poor regions. The proposed non-alcohol, 0.07&#x000a0;% CPC antimicrobial mouth rinse is commercially available and cheap; and it has been previously shown to be safe and to decrease the severity of periodontal disease and the rate of preterm birth and low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Due to limited the research funding and study period, the sample size of this study is relatively small, not allowing for the observation of the birth outcomes as proportions e.g. the rate of low birth weight and the rate of preterm birth. If there is evidence of effectiveness after this initial study, we will seek further funding to expand the trial, with birth outcomes in proportions as primary outcomes.</p><p>In summary, our proposed MRI could be a simple, cost-effective, and sustainable solution to improve both mother&#x02019;s oral health and neonate outcomes. If the mouth rinse is confirmed to be effective, it would demonstrate great potential for the application in other low- or middle-income countries to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight and to reduce neonatal and infant mortality.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CPC</term><def><p>cetylpyridinium chloride</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMB</term><def><p>data safety and monitoring board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>mouth rinse intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICU</term><def><p>neonatal intensive unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSR</term><def><p>periodontal screening and recording</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRP</term><def><p>scaling and root planning</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Co-first author: Xu Xiong</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HJ, XX, PB, and XQ conceptualized and designed the study, contributed to the development of the trial and obtaining the funding.
