manipulation on joint position sense (JPS) of normal adults. [Subjects] Thirty normal
adults were divided into a test group of 15 subjects and a control group of 15 subjects.
[Methods] The test group was treated with cervical joint manipulation and massage, whereas
the control group received only massage. Both groups were evaluated in terms of joint
position error (JPE) using a digital dual clinometer before and after the interventions.
[Results] The comparision of the pre- and post-test results revealed the test group
exhibited statistically significant changes in flexion, extension, left lateral flexion,
right lateral flexion, left rotation, and right rotation. On the other hand, the control
group showed no statistically significant changes in any of the variables.
[Conclusion]Cervical joint manipulation reduced JPE and improved joint position sence.
Therefore, we consider its application to the treatment of patients with cervical problems
in clinical practice is desirable.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cervical joint manipulation</kwd><kwd>Joint position sense</kwd><kwd>Joint position error</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neck pain is a frequent and disabling complaint in the general population, and joint
position sense (JPS) is an important function of the human body, recognizing the location of
joints, and an essential element in the maintenance of balance or kinesthetic sense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study, flexion, extension,
left lateral flexion (LLF) right lateral flexion (RLF), left rotation (LR), right rotation
(RR), and range of motion (ROM) of female office workers with neck pain were measured. That
study reported that their neck mobility had declined in all directions and that altered
muscle recruitment strategies were employed. Moreover, to help the office workers manage
their neck pain, exercise programs including motor re-education were considered
necessary<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, reduction in
cervical ROM may decrease JPS and alter muscle recruitment strategy. There are various
methods of increasing cervical ROM, but research has demonstrated that spinal manipulative
therapy has particularly beneficial effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the literature of JPS-related studies, one study reported that
conventional proprioceptive training improved JPS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another identified relations between JPS and dizziness. However,
most JPS-related studies have focused on patients with persistent neck pain or whiplash
injuries, and JPS was improved JPS through exercises. The present study aimed to identify
whether an increase in the ROM of the cervical joint, resulting from manipulation techniques
for joint mobility, improved cervical JPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 30 students attending N University in Chungcheongnam-do, Korea. The
subjects were divided into a test group of 15 subjects (1 male and 14 females) and a control
group of 15 subjects (1 male and 14 females). The test group was aged 21.9&#x000b1;0.2&#x02005;years,
163.3&#x000b1;5.8&#x02005;cm in height, and 55.2&#x000b1;7.0&#x02005;kg in weight. The control group was aged 21.0&#x000b1;0.3,
162.2&#x000b1;5.9&#x02005;cm in height, and 53.1&#x000b1;7.5&#x02005;kg in weight. The two groups showed no statistically
significant differences in their general characteristics. Subjects who had undergone
surgery, were undergoing hospital treatment, or had a ruptured cervical disk were excluded
from this study. All the subjects were given an explanation about the purpose of this study
and the entire process of the experiment and submitted their voluntary written consent
before participation.</p><p>The test group received cervical joint manipulation and massage for 25 minutes in a single
session. In the cervical joint manipulation for the rotation correction, the therapist
placed his thumb on the posterior articula pilla in the segment intended for rotation,
applied rotational pressure against the y-axis in the horizontal plane, and then applied a
short and quick thrust at the end range of rotation. For the correction of lateral flexion
(LF), the therapist placed his index finger on the exterior of the segment intended for
correction, generated LF against the z-axis in the coronal plane, and then applied a short
and quick thrust at the end range of LF. To increase the extension ROM, Gong&#x02019;s mobilization
was used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sternocleidomastoid, upper
trapezius, levator scapulae, and posterior cervical muscles were massaged. After each
subject lay supine on a table, the therapist sat down at the side of the subject&#x02019;s head. The
therapist supported the patient&#x02019;s head with the hand closest to the patient and placed the
other hand below the subject&#x02019;s neck and massaged the posterior cervical muscles along the
muscle fibers. Thereafter, the therapist turned the subject&#x02019;s head in the opposite direction
to the intended massaging direction, and then massaged the sternocleidomastoid, upper
trapezius, and levator scapulae muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The control group received only a single session of massage for 15 minutes.</p><p>JPS was evaluated through JPE, with a greater JPE denoting a lower JPS. The JPE was
measured using a digital dual clinometer (Dualer IQ, JTECH Medical, U.S.A.). To measure the
JPE, the subjects were shown twice how to adopt the exact positions of 35&#x000b0; flexion, 35&#x000b0;
extension, 30&#x000b0; LLF, 30&#x000b0; RLF, 45&#x000b0; LR, and 45&#x000b0; RR with passive cervical movements in a neutral
position under the measurer&#x02019;s instructions. Afterward, the subjects had to adopt these six
positions using their own active cervical movements without the measurer&#x02019;s instructions.
During the test, the difference between each position&#x02019;s measured and correct values was
recorded. The joint position was measured three times before and after the intervention, and
the averages were used for the evaluation.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
U.S.A.). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, the paired
t-test wsa used to compare the changes in the flexion, extension, LLF, RLF, LR, and RR
between pre-test and post-test in each group. The differences between the two groups were
tested using the independent t-test. The statistical significance level was chosen as
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of cervical joint position errors between pre-test and post-test of

flexion training increased deep cervical flexor electromyographic amplitudes and decreased
sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene electromyographic amplitudes across all stages of
cranio-cervical flexion training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
study related to JPS, Treleaven et al. measured JPE in 102 subjects with dizziness and
unsteadiness following whiplash injuries and in 44 normal adults. They reported that
compared to normal adults, those with dizziness and unsteadiness following whiplash injuries
showed larger declines in JPS. They further noted that cervical mechanoreceptor dysfunction
can give rise to dizziness in patients with whiplash injuries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jull et al. implemented conventional proprioceptive training and
craniocervical flexion training for 64 female subjects with a history of chronic neck pain
of either idiopathic (n=39) or traumatic (n=25) origin over a 6-month period. After the
training, they measured JPE in cervical extension and rotation. They reported that while
both groups exhibited declines in JPE, the proprioceptive training group showed a larger
decline. In their study, the degree of JPE decreased from 4&#x02013;5&#x000b0; before the intervention to
2&#x02013;3&#x000b0; after the intervention. In the present study, the degree of JPE declined from 2.5&#x02013;3.0&#x000b0;
before the intervention to 1.0&#x02013;1.2&#x000b0; after the intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This difference is likely due to the present study having only
included normal subjects.</p><p>In this study, the test group was treated with both cervical joint manipulation and
massage, and displayed larger declines in JPE than the massage-only control group. Although
no previous studies have reported an improvement in JPS through joint manipulation, mobility
in the present study was likely to have been generated in each segment through joint
mobilization, which, in turn, would have activated the proprioceptors in the joint capsules
and deep muscles, eventually leading to improvement in JPS. However, in the comparison of
the two group&#x02019;s of differences between the pre- and post-test values of flexion, extension,
LLF, RLF, LR, and RR, only LLF and LR exhibited statistical significance. This suggests that
while increase in cervical ROM leads to reduced JPE and improved JPS, JPE can also be
reduced and JPS can be improved through massage. However, the differences between the two
treatments were not statistically significant. In other words, while a single session of
massage can reduce JPE and improve JPS, the combined treatment of massage and cervical joint
manipulation was much more effective at increasing the ROM. Therefore, we recommend that
when treating patients with reduced JPS due to decreased ROM, persistent neck pain, or
whiplash injuries, the combined application of cervical joint manipulation and massage is
used.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Treleaven</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jull</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>LowChoy</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship of cervical joint position error to
