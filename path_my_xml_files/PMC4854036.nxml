However, the association between colonization and antibiotic-resistant cases is very complex, as there may be drug-resistant strains <italic>in vitro</italic>, but they may lead to clinical improvement for other reasons, such as its anti-inflammatory effect.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Topical tetracycline is used less than other topical antibiotics.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In the last 30 years, resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and cotrimoxazole has been increased. Furthermore, there are cross-resistance between antibiotic, e.g. erythromycin and clindamycin.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p><italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> sensitivity and drug-resistance patterns are different in different parts of the world. For example, a study in Egypt as <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed resistance to clindamycin as 65% and 48% resistance to erythromycin and it was almost above 2 times more than azithromycin.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] And in the North of Mexico, the resistance to azithromycin was reported as 82%, as 68% to cotrimoxazole, as 46% to erythromycin, and clindamycin was in the last place and this is despite the available information.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Very high resistance to clindamycin was reported in in Japanese patients with <italic>P. acnes</italic> carrying germ (x).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, this pattern has not been investigated in our region and background information is not available. Due to the development of drug-resistance, new strategies including the formulation of effective drugs with fewer side effects are needed.</p><p>Azithromycin is a more semisynthetic and newer macrolide with superior properties compared to tetracycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin. Azithromycin has no effect on hepatic cytochrome P450.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This drug is safe, even in pregnancy and lactation and children can also use it.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Azithromycin synthetic construction makes it unique and the level of this drug which reaches to tissues and cells and phagocytes appears to be significantly higher than plasma levels. Clindamycin side effects include gastrointestinal irritation, rash, neutropenia, liver disorders, and pseudomembrane colitis disorder.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Azithromycin gel 2% is currently available in several countries in acne treatment. However, scientific studies about its effects and side effects are not available in the resources.

Were prepared proportionate to the objective of maximum stability and proper pH with the desired concentration, and were given to patients in similar tubes labeled A and B, and they were asked of the two drug codes, choose one code for the right side of face and the other for the left side. In terms of patient selection, respective side was written on the tubes, so that the wrong conclusion is prevented. Furthermore, the patients were instructed regarding use of the gel and avoiding mixing the two drugs and the prevention of drug use on the opposite side. Dose of the drug was twice daily for 2 months.

Findings showed both combinations, that is, azithromycin gel 2% and clindamycin gel 1%, have acceptable medical impacts in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of occurrence of side effects and complications. Azithromycin is an effective antibiotic in acne treatment,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which is more effective especially in pulse therapy form and shows fewer complications compared to other common antibiotics.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, a few studies have been conducted on its topical formulation for acne treatment.
