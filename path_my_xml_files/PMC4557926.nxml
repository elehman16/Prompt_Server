To reduce this problem, different agents have been tested to minimize abdominal adhesions; however, the optimal adhesion prophylaxis has not been found so far. Therefore, the A-Part<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel was developed as a barrier to diminish postsurgical adhesions; the aim of this randomized controlled study was a first evaluation of its safety and efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this prospective, controlled, randomized, patient-blinded, monocenter phase I&#x02013;II study, 62 patients received either the hydrogel A-Part-Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as an anti-adhesive barrier or were untreated after primary elective median laparotomy. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of peritonitis and/or wound healing impairment 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days postoperatively. As secondary endpoints anastomotic leakage until 28&#x000a0;days after surgery, adverse events and adhesions were assessed until 3&#x000a0;months postoperatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A lower rate of wound healing impairment and/or peritonitis was observed in the A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group compared to the control group: (6.5 vs. 13.8&#x000a0;%). The difference between the two groups was &#x02212;7.3%, 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval [&#x02212;20.1, 5.4&#x000a0;%]. Both treatment groups showed similar frequency of anastomotic leakage but incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events were slightly lower in the A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group compared to the control.

Previous intra-abdominal surgical interventions are a common cause of peritoneal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most severe complications based on the occurrence of intra-abdominal adhesions are small bowel obstruction (60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;%), female infertility (20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;%), chronic abdominal pain and technical difficulties in the case of a reoperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A variety of adhesion barriers and strategies have been developed in order to prevent or at least to reduce postoperative adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These include films, viscous gels or intra-abdominal solutions, but so far no standard treatment has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The most common method in adhesion prevention is to apply a barrier between the wounded surfaces. Barrier materials should be easy to apply and should remain in place for several days to allow serosal re-epithelium formation and should be absorbed afterwards and excreted without systemic reactions or inappropriate accumulation. Materials that are non-inflammatory, non-reactive and not interfering with the healing process of incision wounds or anastomoses are well suitable. Until today, the problem of peritoneal adhesions remains in general largely unsolved and an effective prevention method is not routinely used in abdominal surgery leading to significant clinical and economical consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Annual costs of peritoneal adhesion related problems are estimated in Sweden to be &#x020ac;40&#x02013;60 million; and more than 300,000 patients are estimated to undergo treatment due to adhesion induced small bowel obstruction in the US annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the hydrogel A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> which is a bio-absorbable transparent gel composed of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was developed. Both components are used for various biomedical applications and their biocompatibility have been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is intended to operate as a physical barrier between injured surface to reduce post-surgical adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Purpose</title><p>A variety of experimental studies in different animal models have been conducted which showed that A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is efficacious in the reduction of post-surgical adhesions in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was clearly the evaluation of the safety and secondly an estimation of the efficacy of this hydrogel in the peritoneal adhesions prevention after primary elective laparotomy compared to an untreated control group in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To demonstrate transparency, the study protocol of the trial has already been registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) and published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The study is approved by the ethics committee of the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU), Munich, Germany. It was sponsored and conducted by Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany. The sponsor has taken out an insurance policy to cover all patients participating in the trial. The Clinical Trials Unit of the University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany, was responsible for project management, database maintenance, biometrics and data analysis. Monitoring was performed by authorized and qualified persons of LabConsult, Freiburg Germany. Patients were enrolled at one center in Germany (The Department of Surgery, University of Munich Gro&#x000df;hadern, Munich, Germany).</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study was conducted as a prospective, controlled, randomized, patient- and observer-blinded, monocenter phase I&#x02013;II study. Patients were intra-operatively randomly allocated to the treatment group receiving A-Part-Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> before the closure of the abdominal wall or to the untreated control group (parallel, ratio 1:1). Due to safety aspects a staggering of the treatment of the patients was performed at the beginning of the study. The first 20 randomized patients were subsequently included into the study, so that a time interval of at least 96&#x000a0;h had to be kept between the treatments of the first 10 patients, and a time interval of at least 48&#x000a0;h had to be kept between the treatments of the next 10 patients. In each group 31 patients were included and after discharge from the hospital the patients were examined after 28 (&#x000b1;10) days and after 3&#x000a0;months (&#x000b1;14&#x000a0;days) postoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The study design has not been changed, the study was performed as described in the published study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients undergoing an elective median primary laparotomy with an expected incision length of &#x02265;15&#x000a0;cm were eligible and were asked for their written informed consent after they had been informed about the purpose of the trial, the surgical modalities, data management and their benefits and risks. Patients with a previous median laparotomy and any other abdominal surgery were not included into the study (exceptions: previous laparoscopic appendectomy, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair, gynecological tube sterilization).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interventions</title><p>The closure of the abdominal wall was standardized. In each randomized patient the abdominal fascia was closed from the caudal and cranial end using a long-term absorbable monofilament suture loop in accordance to the continuous suture technique published in the INSECT Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the control group the incision was closed without the application of the prophylactic gel. In case of the treatment group up to 3&#x000a0;cm of the incision was left open in the middle. A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was applied without sight under the incision through the remaining opening of the fascia. The gel syringe was placed intra-abdominally to one end of the incision and blindly applied along the partly sutured incision while pressing out slowly the prophylactic gel. The same procedure was used for the other half of the sutured incision. Thereafter, the syringe was taken out from the incision and the closure of the abdominal wall was completed. Skin closure was performed by skin staples. It was recommended to use 1&#x000a0;ml of the prophylactic gel to cover 1&#x000a0;cm of the incision. Participating surgeons performing the intervention were instructed by detailed manuals and only trained surgeons applied the adhesion prophylaxis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study device</title><p>A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> consists of two unmodified water soluble biocompatible polymers: polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and CMC, mixture 25:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. PVA is biologically inert and is not degraded in mammal metabolism. As a water soluble polymer, PVA is mainly excreted by the kidneys, only small amounts are excreted via faeces. CMC is a cellulose derivative which is already widely used in pharmaceutical, nutritional and cosmetic products. CMC is classified in the group &#x0201c;substances that are generally regarded as safe&#x0201d;. Cellulose derivative like CMC are already used as barrier materials for adhesion protection with good results regarding efficacy and biocompatibility. To prepare A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> both substrates PVA and CMC are cross-linked by freeze-thawing cycles. PVA is the antiadhesion component while CMC promotes attachment to the wound site. The viscous gel is elastic, soft, translucent and absorbable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The gel operates as a physical barrier between injured peritoneal surfaces to prevent post operative adhesions. It is absorbed in approximately 6&#x000a0;weeks and excreted via the kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For this clinical study the gel was filled in syringes (10&#x000a0;ml) steam-sterilized. Physical properties such as viscosity and adherence to the wound have been tested with good results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In animal studies it has been shown that A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> operates as a physical barrier between injured peritoneal surfaces to prevent surgical postoperative adhesions in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary objective of this study was a first assessment of the safety of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> applied as an adhesion prophylaxis after major abdominal surgery. The primary endpoint was the specific observation of two major complications of abdominal surgery: wound healing impairment and/or peritonitis within 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days after surgery compared to an untreated control group. Patients were defined as experiencing this event, if one or more of the single events occurred within the first 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days postoperatively. The events were assessed at day 1, 4, 7 after surgery, at day of discharge and at day 28. In case of missing assessments, patients were defined as not experiencing the endpoint, if it had not been diagnosed at the complete assessments. As a sensitivity analysis, patients with at least one missing assessment or at least one assessment outside the requested time frame were excluded from the analysis. Impaired wound healing was defined as delayed wound healing (necrosis or dehiscence) or as the development of a surgical infection; further details and the definition of a peritonitis are described in the protocol publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Post-operative peritonitis was diagnosed according to the following criteria: Post-operative peritonitis must be always suspected if fever, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, muscular defence, absence of bowel sounds, metabolic disturbance or severe hypotension with multiple organ failure occur. At least one of the following diagnostic procedures must be used to confirm the suspected diagnosis:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Secret via drain or puncture.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sonography.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Computer tomography.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Re-operation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Impaired wound healing was defined as:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>A.</label><p>Delayed wound healing: delayed wound healing has to be diagnosed if at least one of the following criteria is fulfilled:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Necroses of wound edges occur or if</p></list-item><list-item><p>Primary or secondary dehiscence occurs (primary dehiscence is defined as retreating of wound edges immediately after surgery; secondary dehiscence is defined as retreating of wound edges after start of the wound healing).</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><label>B.</label><p>Development of surgical site infection: surgical site infection has to be assumed as present, if one of the following criteria is fulfilled:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Purulent secretion from the wound.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Germ organism isolated from an aseptic obtained culture of fluid or tissue from superficial incision.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Local signs of infection and/or systemic signs (e.g. fever, leukocytosis, rising CRP without other plausible causes (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosis of an abscess in deep soft tissue (an abscess in deep soft tissue is defined as microbiological verification of suspect specimen which is generally taken by means of ultra puncture).</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p><p>Secondary endpoints to evaluate the safety were the (a) incidence of anastomotic leakage until 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days postoperatively, (b) adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) occurring from the day of surgery until 3&#x000a0;months after operation and (c) laboratory assessments. All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 13.0). Laboratory tests included blood counts, including WBC, electrolytes, creatinine, urea, ASAT (GOT), ALAT (GPT), y-GT, total bilirubin, LDH, albumin and CRP. Laboratory tests were done before surgery, 1, 2, 4, 7&#x000a0;days postoperatively, at discharge, 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days and 3&#x000a0;months after surgery, respectively. These tests were performed in the local laboratory of the clinical site.</p><p>Additionally the peritoneal adhesions in percent along the scar, resulting from blinded ultrasonographic examinations at 14 (range 7&#x02013;14) days after surgery, as well as 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days and 3&#x000a0;months postoperatively were determined.</p><p>Sigel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] described a method for non-invasive ultrasound examination to detect and to map abdominal adhesions. Using this technique peritoneal adhesions are identified by the presence or restrictions of the ultrasonically observed movement of the abdominal viscera in reference to the abdominal wall. A sensitivity of over 90&#x000a0;% and a specificity between 86 and 93&#x000a0;% have been reported for this technique in different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To assess the incidence of postoperative abdominal adhesions the method of Sigel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] was employed using a linear array transducer. Here, the scar of the abdominal incision was divided into equal parts of 2.5&#x000a0;cm, starting 2&#x000a0;cm from the cranial entr&#x000e9;e of the scar. At each assessment point spontaneous visceral sliding was examined using ultrasound scanning. Sliding is the result of force applied by respiratory excursions or by manual ballottement of the abdominal wall and is referred to as viscera slide. In the case of reduced movement following respiration this was counted as a restricted visceral slide, i.e. adhesion. The documentation for each patient included the total assessment points as well as the number of assessment points with adhesions. Ultrasound assessment was done by a blinded clinician. Furthermore, a video of the ultrasound examination was prepared by the investigator and evaluated in addition by an external reviewer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size</title><p>This trial was conducted as a phase I&#x02013;II study with the goal to generate the first safety data for the A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in human beings compared to the control group. Sample size considerations were not based on statistical calculations, but more on feasibility of recruitment. It was planned to randomize a total of 60 patients between both treatment arms because it was expected that this patient number could be recruited by one center within 6&#x000a0;months. The power considerations were based on the primary endpoint &#x0201c;occurrence of wound healing impairment and/or peritonitis within 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days after surgery&#x0201d;. It was assumed that without the application of the prophylactic gel wound healing impairment will occur with a probability of about 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% and postoperative peritonitis with a probability of 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, it has been assumed that the primary endpoint will occur in the control group with a probability of about 7&#x02013;15&#x000a0;%. Under the assumption that application of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> will not increase this probability, this study can show at one-sided significance level &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 with a power of 80&#x000a0;% that the difference of the event probabilities between the two treatment groups is not larger than 20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomisation</title><p>To provide treatment groups of approximately equal sizes, block randomization with randomly varying block sizes and a ratio of 1:1 were used. To guarantee concealment of the randomization, the clinical investigator was unaware of the block length and the randomization list was generated and stored by the Clinical Trials Unit of the University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany. Numbered sealed opaque envelops prepared by the Clinical Trials Unit were used for randomization which took place intra-operatively before closing the abdominal wall. Patients were enrolled and assigned to the treatment groups by the clinical investigator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Blinding</title><p>Both patients and observers who performed the ultrasound examination and the video assessment were blinded in this study. None of the patients received any information about the allocation to the different treatment groups (single-blinded). In addition, the observer had no access to the randomization result, which was not visible in the patient file and case report form (CRF). Blinding of the surgeon was not possible, because no matching placebo was available. Emergency envelops were produced for unblinding if needed during the follow-up of the patients. In the case of an accidental unblinding of the examiner or the patient this was documented in the CRF and notified to the study coordinator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The statistical methods for analysis were described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). All analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.2. No interim analysis was planned and conducted in this study.</p><p>Analyses of safety endpoints were performed in the safety population, and analyses of efficacy endpoints were performed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. It was preplanned in the study protocol to include all randomised patients in both analysis populations. As it happened during study conduct, that the randomisation envelope was opened before the exclusion criteria are fulfilled, patients will be excluded from the SAF set, if an exclusion criterion to be checked during surgery or the planned surgery is violated. Group assignment in the safety population is by treatment received, i.e. patients are counted to the A-Part group if they receive the A-Part<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel, otherwise they are counted to the control group. Group assignment in the ITT population is strictly by randomisation; even if A Part<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel cannot be applied because of technical reasons, the patient is recorded in the A-Part group.</p><p>The aim of the study was to show that the application of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> will not lead to an unacceptable increase in the probability of occurrence of the primary endpoint &#x0201c;occurrence of wound healing impairment and/or peritonitis within 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days after surgery&#x0201d;, i.e. the non-inferiority of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as compared to control. For this first safety study, the non-inferiority margin was set to 0.25. The two-sided 90&#x000a0;%-confidence interval (CI) for the absolute difference (A-Part<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel minus control) of probability of occurrence of the primary endpoint will be calculated. If the upper bound of this CI is below 0.25, the hypothesis that the difference is 0.25 or larger will be rejected.</p><p>Rates of the secondary safety endpoints wound healing impairment, postoperative peritonitis, delayed wound healing, surgical site infection, anastomotic leakage, and AE were calculated with two-sided 90&#x000a0;% CIs. AEs were summarized by MedDRA preferred terms and by system organ classes.</p><p>For a first efficacy assessment of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel as compared to the control the adhesion rates along the scar were calculated per patient 14&#x000a0;days (range 7&#x02013;14&#x000a0;days), 28 (+10) days and 3&#x000a0;months (&#x000b1;14&#x000a0;days) after surgery as the number of assessment points with adhesions divided by the total number of assessment points. The arithmetic mean of the adhesion rates were calculated with two-sided 90&#x000a0;% CI. Additionally, the rate of patients experiencing an adhesion, i.e. patients with at least one assessment point with adhesion, were be calculated with two-sided 90&#x000a0;% CI. A separate analysis has been conducted for ultrasound assessment done by the clinician and for video assessment performed by an external reviewer 3&#x000a0;months after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Quality assurance</title><p>The study was monitored by LabConsult GmbH. On-site visits were performed before study initiation and on a regular basis during the study. The monitor was responsible for reviewing the progress of the ongoing study with the investigator in order to verify adherence to the study protocol. The investigator assisted the monitor in resolving any problems detected during monitoring visits.</p><p>Data entry, data management, data checks as well as query generation and resolution were done using the validated data management system DAMAST (V03-1) based on the program Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.2. Double data entry was performed by two different persons.

Therefore, a gel is considered to be a good option as an adhesion prophylaxis. Currently, no product is available which shows uniformly safety and efficacy in all surgical conditions. Therefore, none of these mentioned agents have become a standard to prevent postoperative adhesions and a safe and effective adhesion prophylaxis is still missing.</p><p>A-Part-Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> composed of CMC and PVA demonstrated good results in regard to biocompatibility and adhesion to the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Several animal models indicated the safety and efficacy of this new barrier gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The amount of adhesions was significantly decreased in the PVA/CMC hydrogel group compared to the untreated control in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ditzel et al. evaluated A-Part Gel versus Icodextrin 4&#x000a0;% in a rat model for the prevention of adhesions. Whereas the application of A-Part Gel significantly reduces the amount and the density of adhesions no effect was seen after treatment with Icodextrin 4&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These findings are in agreement to M&#x000fc;ller et al. who determined the anti-adhesion efficacy of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> versus Adept<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in a rabbit uterus model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To predict the prevalence of adhesion reformation after adhesiolysis and relaparotomy, abdominal ultrasound assessment was used in a rabbit sidewall model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Here, in contrast to an untreated control group a significantly reduction of the extent and quality of the abdominal adhesions was observed by the authors after the usage of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Accuracy of ultrasound assessment for adhesions was reported to be 86&#x000a0;%, specificity was 100&#x000a0;% and sensitivity was 81&#x000a0;%. Also the comparison between Icodextrin 4&#x000a0;% and A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as a adhesion barrier in a rabbit model showed high effectiveness of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in contrast to Icodextrin 4&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, anastomotic leakages and wound healing were not negatively influenced after its use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Material properties and preclinical results have established the promising possibility of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as a new device against postoperative adhesions and therefore, this clinical trial was primarily designed for a first assessment of its safety in humans. The primary endpoint of this randomized controlled study was the safety of the product assessed by the combined endpoint &#x0201c;the frequency of wound healing impairment and postoperative peritonitis within 28&#x000a0;days after surgery&#x0201d;. The rate of postoperative peritoneal adhesions judged by ultrasound assessment within 3&#x000a0;months and postoperative peritonitis and adverse effects were secondary endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Our data show that A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is safe as an anti-adhesive barrier, because its application did not lead to an increase of the occurrence of wound healing impairment and/or postoperative peritonitis within 28&#x000a0;days after operation. In addition, the incidence of anastomotic leakage was low and comparable with the control group. Therefore, A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment can be regarded as safe and not inferior to the untreated control. Postoperative adhesions detected by non-invasive abdominal ultrasound within 3&#x000a0;months postoperatively were similar between both treatment groups, but due to the small sample size CIs were large and no firm statistical conclusions on efficacy could be drawn. Because there was a small imbalance regarding the number of bowel anastomoses (slightly higher in the control group compared to the A-Part Gel group), an adjusted analysis was requested by one referee. For the primary safety endpoint wound healing impairment and/or peritonitis and the secondary safety endpoints the number of events was too small for this kind of analysis. For the efficacy endpoint adhesion an adjusted analysis was performed, which showed similar results as the unadjusted analysis.</p><p>Limitations of our trial are the monocenter design and the fact that it was not designed for an investigation of efficacy with sufficient statistical power. Furthermore, the non-invasive ultrasound technique was used to determine adhesion formation, because previous investigation using ultrasonography for peritoneal adhesions mapping indicated that this method is the standard technique to predict abdominal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is obvious that a second look operation which can be potentially performed in gynecologic patients would be more reliable; due to ethical aspects this was not an option in the current study population.</p><p>In contrast to most preclinical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] except one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] the data of this study do not support the strong adhesion prevention effect. According to preclinical dosage studies 1&#x000a0;ml gel per 1&#x000a0;cm incision should be sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] but next to the above mentioned study limitations the A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> might not have been stayed in place because of movement effects. Recently Slieker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] analysed the effect of A-Part Gel on the healing of colonic anastomoses using a rat model compared to an untreated control group. No significant difference was found regarding the incidence of anastomotic leakage and no reduction in the amount of adhesions was seen in rats treated with A-Part Gel in comparison to controls. Weaknesses of this animal study have been described by the authors. Pre-study power analysis have been performed for anastomotic leakage not for the prevention of adhesions and showed 16 animals per group to be sufficient but mainly based on theoretical supposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, to define A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as an effective adhesion prophylaxis, a larger randomized trial powered on an anti-adhesion endpoint with a second look procedure is mandatory to draw clinical relevant conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is safe for the application as an adhesion prophylaxis but our data could not support the adhesion prevention effects demonstrated in different animal studies. This may be due to the limitations of the sample size as well as to application gaps of the gel coverage along the abdominal wall incisions.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALAT (GPT)</term><def><p>alanine aminotransferase&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;GPT</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American Society of Anaestesiologists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASAT (GOT)</term><def><p>asparatate aminotransferase&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;GOT</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMC</term><def><p>carboxymethylcellulose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x003b3;-GT</term><def><p>gamma glutamyl transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INSECT</term><def><p>interrupted or continuous slowly absorbable sutures&#x02014;evaluation of abdominal closure techniques</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDH</term><def><p>lactate dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MedDRA</term><def><p>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PVA</term><def><p>polyvinylalcohol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAP</term><def><p>statistical analysis plan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAS</term><def><p>Statistical Analysis System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WBC</term><def><p>white blood count</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EO, RL and KWJ designed and wrote the study protocol together with the Clinical Trials Centre, Freiburg, Germany.
