Although most treatments for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) focus on the bladder outlet to either increase urethral resistance or reduce hypermobility with slings, sphincters, or bulking agents,<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> the balloon floats at the bladder dome, and away from the outlet, and produces its favorable effects via a novel mechanism.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Vesair Balloon.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="spv-24-222-g001"/></fig><p>In the &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; hydraulic system of a normal urinary bladder, external pressures transmit directly to urine within the bladder lumen. Urine in the bladder is relatively incompressible; therefore, the pressure within the bladder increases when the surrounding abdominal pressure increases. In a susceptible patient, this intravesical pressure increase subsequently results in urinary incontinence by overcoming urethral closure pressures.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Once indwelling, the Vesair Balloon acts in accordance with Boyle's law, which states that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In other words, the balloon will be compressed during transient increases in intravesical pressure, such as a cough or sneeze, thereby attenuating the pressure fluctuation similar to a &#x0201c;shock absorber.&#x0201d;</p><p>The Vesair Balloon has been evaluated previously in several studies. The mechanism of action was evaluated in an in vitro acrylic bladder model.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> An in vivo urodynamic study was performed, evaluating Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) in 5 women, both before and 24 hours after placing a balloon.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In all 5 participants, the required abdominal pressure for leakage to occur increased. Safety and efficacy of this novel intervention was then evaluated in a 166-patient randomized controlled study (RCT) of a smaller balloon at 6 months.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> After changes were made to the balloon, as well as delivery and removal instrumentation, the SOLECT trial evaluated the safety and efficacy in 63 participants in Europe at 3 months.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The current &#x0201c;Stress Incontinence Control, Efficacy and Safety Study&#x0201d; (SUCCESS) is a phase III trial of the Vesair Balloon for female SUI in a larger patient population in the United States, and 3-month data have been reported previously.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This article reports the safety and efficacy of the balloon for those participants who chose to continue with the therapy for 12 months.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The SUCCESS trial is a multicenter, prospective, single blinded, randomized, sham-controlled study of the investigational Vesair Balloon for the treatment of female SUI. This study received institutional review board approval and was conducted under a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x02013;approved Investigation Device Exemption (G110162). Participant enrollment occurred at 20 investigational sites across the United States. All participants signed a written informed consent before study enrollment.</p><p>To establish baseline characteristics and determine study eligibility, all potential participants completed comprehensive incontinence testing before enrollment, including the following: history and physical examination, urinalysis, 1-hour provocative pad weight test, urodynamic evaluation, 7-day voiding diary, questionnaires (Incontinence Quality of Life Scale [I-QOL], International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire: Female Sexual Matters associated with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTSsex); International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire: Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-SF); Medical, Epidemiologic, and Social Aspects of Aging [MESA]), and cystoscopy. The study population included female adults 18 years or older with SUI symptoms for at least 12 months in duration as evidenced by visual confirmation during stress maneuvers and self-report of incontinence on a voiding diary. Participants must have failed noninvasive incontinence treatments and lacked complicating factors, such as urge predominant symptoms, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), or urethral anatomic anomalies. In addition, all participants had incontinence severity sufficient to produce at least 5 g of leakage on an in-office provocative 1-hour pad weight test. Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Hypermobility and hypermobility with intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) were determined using the investigator's opinion after review of urodynamic results and patient-reported symptoms. Stress predominate mixed incontinence was determined using the investigator's opinion after evaluating the urodynamic results, MESA, and patient-reported symptoms.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="spv-24-222-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Vesair Balloon placement and removal in this study was performed in an identical manner to what has previously been described.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> After sterile prep and preprocedural antibiotics, a proprietary urethral access sheath was placed and the bladder surveyed using cystoscopy. The 19F catheter delivery system, preloaded with an uninflated balloon in the tip, was then placed through the sheath. Once within the bladder lumen, the balloon was inflated with 0.7 mL of liquid perfluorocarbon and 30 mL of air via 2 attached syringes and released into the bladder. Balloon removal, when indicated, was accomplished using optical forceps, a custom grasper similarly placed through the Guardian Urethral Sheath. The balloon was pierced with the grasper and removed intact under direct visualization. Sham balloon insertion procedures for participants in the control arm were identical, with the exception of actual balloon deployment.</p><p>Eligible and consenting participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment arm or the control arm, and randomization was stratified by clinical site. All participants were blinded to their randomization until the 3-month study visit. The investigator performing the procedure was necessarily unblinded to participant randomization; however, a blinded third-party evaluator performed all efficacy assessments through 3 months.</p><p>Participants randomized to the treatment arm received the Vesair Balloon on day 0 and were followed up for 12 months, with assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. All participants in the treatment arm had their balloons exchanged at 12 months or sooner if clinically indicated. Data collection at each scheduled follow-up visit included documentation of any adverse events (AEs) or change in medical history, a 7-day voiding diary, participant questionnaires (Patient Global Impression of Improvement [PGI-I], I-QOL, ICIQ-FLUTSsex, ICIQ-SF, MESA), and urinalysis if symptomatic. At the 3-month visit, participants also underwent cystoscopy to document appropriate balloon integrity and positioning, and lack of bladder pathology.</p><p>Participants in the control arm underwent a sham procedure on day 0 without a Vesair Balloon placed. After completion of efficacy evaluations through the initial 3 months without the Vesair Balloon, control group participants were unblinded and were offered a Vesair Balloon placement at the 3-month visit. Follow-up assessments for the control group were completed at 1, 3, 4, 6, and 12 months. Data collected at each study visit for control group patients were identical to that in the treatment group.

On the basis of previously published data,<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> conservative estimates for proportion of participants achieving the composite end point in the treatment and control groups were set at 36% and 15%, respectively. Using a 2-sided Fisher exact test between 2 independent proportions and a 2:1 randomization scheme, 174 participants (116 treatment, 58 control) were required to achieve an 80% power with a 0.05 level of significance. To offset for those lost to clinical follow-up, the goal sample size was increased to 220 participants, skewing the randomization scheme to 2.33:1 (157 treatment, 64 control) to account for a higher propensity of treatment participant withdrawal due to tolerability. One additional participant was enrolled beyond the sample size goal, because of a reporting error at one site, bringing the total to 221 participants in the study.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed on SAS software, version 9.4. For the 3-month end points, missing data were imputed on the basis of the last observation carried forward when the data were missing secondary to participant withdrawal due to a device-related AE. All other missing data were imputed using a multiple-imputation model with 20 imputations performed for each missing piece of data as is current standard practice. To evaluate the 12-month end points, only participants who chose to continue with the study beyond the 3-month primary end point and had evaluable data beyond 6 months were included in the intent-to-treat analysis with no imputation being performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Participant enrollment and randomization is depicted visually in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.

These efficacy results were negatively impacted by less than 50% of the participants remaining in each arm in the study at 12 months. In addition to the typical reasons participants withdrew from the study, participants had the balloon removed for reasons related to tolerability. Although some participants did not feel the balloon in place, others felt the balloon in the bladder, particularly when the bladder was empty at the end of voiding. Select participants accommodated the sensation, with the benefit from the therapy outweighing the sensation, whereas others could not and requested balloon removal. All symptoms were mitigated upon removal of the balloon. Balloon modifications may be needed to reduce or eliminate this sensation, and additional screening methods could be developed in future studies. Given the relative ease of balloon placement and removal, balloon insertion for 30 days as a screening method to determine which patients can tolerate the balloon should be considered.</p><p>No treatment-related serious AEs were reported in this study, and most of the reported AEs were transient rather than persistent symptoms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Growing clinical experience with this device led us to consider that there may be a proportion of patients who simply cannot tolerate an indwelling Vesair Balloon. Comparing the AE rates between the full-treatment arm and the 12-month cohort, the AE rates in this &#x0201c;balloon-tolerant&#x0201d; group of participants were noticeably less than those in the overall cohort. One of the unique features of the Vesair Balloon as a treatment modality, especially when interpreting AEs, is ease of reversibility. All AEs resolved upon balloon removal.</p><p>Compared with midurethral slings, the Vesair Balloon is a less invasive treatment option for female SUI. Similarly, urethral bulking agents have been suggested as an alternative to midurethral sling placement for those women who either cannot or choose not to undergo sling placement. However, the long-term results after bulking agent injection have been modest. A Cochrane Database review of bulking in 2012 failed to demonstrate any consistent improvement in urinary incontinence over placebo.<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition, some of the injectable agents seemed to have safety concerns either at the injection site or systemically leading to trial termination. A systemic review of polydimethylsiloxane injection for treating female SUI has also been completed.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> It found a relatively sparse number of RCTs, with most studies being small observational cohorts. In addition, measures of success were variable and often subjective rather than objective. The review found short-term &#x0201c;cure&#x0201d; rates of 43% declining to 37% with longer follow-up. Adverse events were primarily urinary retention (7%), dysuria (50%), and hematuria (45%).</p><p>The Vesair Balloon for female SUI is comparable to urethral bulking agents in both outcomes and AEs. It also has the advantage of a longer-lasting result, being easily reversible in those participants who do not derive a benefit or do not tolerate balloon placement. Although slings remain the surgical criterion standard in many centers, not all women desire one or are appropriate candidates for sling placement; the Vesair Balloon offers a safe alternative to these participants. Furthermore, it is possible that patients with residual stress incontinence after sling placement who desire further improvement may benefit from balloon placement rather than repeat surgery or injection of a bulking agent. In addition, the reversibility of the procedure allows the Vesair Balloon to be considered as a potential treatment option for women who wish to have children in the future.</p><p>The primary weakness of the study is the inability to blind the providers performing the study procedures. Efficacy evaluations are performed by a blinded third party to mitigate any potential bias. Additional weaknesses of the study include the lack of reproducibility of the pad weight test, the high placebo and Hawthorne effect inherent in the I-QOL questionnaire, and the inability to keep all treatment patients blinded because some patients &#x0201c;feel&#x0201d; the balloon in their bladder. The quantity of visits and evaluations were a burden for patients.</p><p>The trial has several strengths. It is the largest prospective RCT to date using the Vesair Balloon for female SUI. This trial documents significant improvements in subjective and objective measures of incontinence outcomes and follows current FDA guidance for SUI study methodology. The study included rigorous follow-up with several subjective and objective outcome end points, allowing for analysis to evaluate the appropriate clinically relevant end points in future studies.</p><p>The data reported herein were only from those participants in the treatment arm who remained in the study beyond 6 months&#x02014;it did not include all participants enrolled in the study. Additional studies of those participants who did not tolerate the balloon will help further screen out patients who are not appropriate candidates for this therapy. Additional studies are also warranted to evaluate the use of an intravesical balloon in combination with existing therapies directed at urethral function to better improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This randomized, sham-controlled trial evaluated efficacy and safety outcomes for a novel intravesical pressure-attenuation system designed to reduce or eliminate symptoms of SUI for participants who were not candidates for surgery, had failed surgery, or chose not to have surgery. In this trial, for those participants who tolerated the balloon and met 3-month primary and secondary end points both objectively and subjectively, symptom relief continued for the duration of treatment (12 months). For those participants who did not tolerate the therapy or had an unsatisfactory treatment effect, the balloon was simply removed, permitting the patient to pursue alternative treatment options. The pressure-attenuation system was safe and caused no urinary retention. Additional larger studies are warranted to better understand which patient populations better tolerate the balloon and to assess the efficacy and safety of its use beyond 12 months. Additional balloon development is needed to improve balloon tolerability, and additional screening methods are needed in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>In addition to the named authors, the following clinicians participated in the study: Jennifer Miles-Thomas, MD, and Jessica DeLong MD, of the Urology of Virginia, Virginia Beach, VA; Douglas Van Drie, MD, and Jason Bennett, MD, of Grand Rapids Women's Health, Grand Rapids, MI; Deborah Myers, MD; Sandra Carberry, MD; B.
