Whereas suture ligation is a time consuming procedure and carries the risk of knot slipping; electrocautery on the other hand is an unattractive alternative because it implies the potential risk of injuring surrounding tissues from dispersion of heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A technical advance in the early 1990s was the development of an ultrasonically activated device that includes shears and a scalpel, thus permitting the surgeon to cut tissues and control blood loss at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The FOCUS Harmonic Scalpel uses high-frequency mechanical energy to cut and coagulate tissues and vessels simultaneously without the need for knot tying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some reports on the use of the harmonic scalpel were encouraging, showing a significant reduction in surgical time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this prospective randomised study, we evaluated the efficiency, safety, and the impact on the surgical outcome of the utilisation of the FOCUS Harmonic Scalpel during CT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Between January 2009 and December 2012, 778 patients scheduled for open TT consented to be included in the study and were randomly assigned to TT with the use of FOCUS Harmonic Scalpel (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) (group I) or with the clamp-and-tie technique (group II). The protocol of this study have been submitted and approved by the ethical committee of our Institution.

Exclusion criteria were age &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years, previous neck surgery or irradiation, eligibility for minimal invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy, need for central and/or lateral lymph node dissection and concomitant parathyroid disorders.</p><p>Patients were informed about the study at time of hospitalization by a staff surgeon. They were enrolled after accepting to participate in the study and signing the informed consent. A specific questionnaire concerning demographic and preoperative clinical patient&#x02019;s characteristics was administered before surgery. At the time of recruitment, three additional questionnaires were consigned to patients for postoperative evaluation, to be fulfilled at discharge, 1 and 3&#x000a0;months after the operation, respectively.</p><p>At time of surgery, patients were randomly assigned to undergo TT with or without the utilisation of the FOCUS Harmonic Scalpel (group I and group II, respectively). All the patients were blinded about the technique used for hemostasis. Our medical staff was responsible for the collection of the clinical data, including preoperative diagnosis, operative time (from skin incision to skin closure), operative procedure, postoperative complications, hospital stay and final histology.</p><p>Laryngoscopy to check vocal cord motility was performed preoperatively only in symptomatic patients and postoperatively in all the cases. Postoperative calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were monitored in all the patients. Hypocalcemia was defined as a serum calcium level below 2.0&#x000a0;mmol/l. Hypocalcemic patients received supplementation therapy even if asymptomatic. Supplementation therapy included always oral calcium and/or vitamin D (calcitriol). Supplementation therapy was subsequently tapered on the basis of serum calcium measurements. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and hypoparathyroidism were defined definitive if they did not recover within 12&#x000a0;months after the operation.</p><p>Follow-up evaluation was obtained by outpatient consultation or telephone contact 1 and 3&#x000a0;months after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical technique</title><p>A TT for benign or malignant thyroid disease was performed under general anesthesia and with endotracheal intubation in all cases. All patients were positioned, monitored, and draped in the standard way. A 4 to 6&#x000a0;cm low collar incision was made (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Subplatysmal flaps were developed with high frequency electric knife and the strap muscles were separated at the midline (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Other common instruments available for thyroid surgery are mono or bipolar diathermy, which are unsafe in total thyroidectomy because of the risk of damaging the adjacent structures from lateral thermal spread.</p><p>FOCUS Harmonic scalpel is the first device specifically designed for every procedure where meticulous dissection and effective hemostasis is of paramount importance, particularly in a narrow operating field as in thyroid surgery. It is characterized by lesser weight and smaller size compared to other shears; the thin and curved tip, associated to the ergonomic shape and consequent handiness, guarantees precise and safe dissection. Its specifications permit the safe ligation of vessels less than 3&#x000a0;mm in diameter. However, some reports that suggested the use of the harmonic scalpel for larger vessels such as the superior thyroid artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Siperstein et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] suggested the use of the ultracision for all thyroid vessels and were the first to describe the double-ligation technique. The key point for hemostasis with the use of the double-ligation technique is that the vessels should be coagulated in 2 succeeding areas, which is similar to the one we used in group II.</p><p>In our study, the use of the FOCUS was associated to a statistically significant reduction in surgical time, with a mean advantage of 46&#x000a0;min for each surgery. Hemostasis with FOCUS is quick and effective, and we did not observe any post-operative hemorrhage in group II.</p><p>In addition, meticulous hemostasis is essential to ensure a clear surgical field and to avoid inadvertent damage to adjacent vital structures, e.g., to the superior and the recurrent laryngeal nerves and the parathyroid glands, as the two most significant complications with incidences regarding permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and hypoparathyroidism of up to 14 percent and 4 percent, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To enhance safety, the FOCUS hand piece ends in 2 jaws: an active stable jaw for the transmission of energy and a movable jaw that is used for tissue clamping. The energy is not transmitted to the movable part, which can therefore be used as a barrier against thermal transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To minimize this risk, we used cold-wet gauze absorb heat during coagulation near the nerve, reducing the local temperature and consequently potential thermal damages. In our group II, there was no recurrent nerve palsy occur.</p><p>In our series there were no statistically significant differences in PTH level and calcium level at first post-operative day between group I and group II, which were considered as effective parameters to evaluate parathyroid function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. But the symptomatic hypocalcemia of group II were lower than group I, which indicated that the FOCUS may be helpful in protecting parathyroid.</p><p>Moreover, an important factor for the accurate assessment of the surgical time is the composition of the surgical team. In thyroid surgery, the surgeon usually dissects or applies the scalpel, leaving various surgical maneuvers to the assistant. So a good cooperation in the surgical team would allow for a further decrease in the operative time for both techniques.</p><p>According the study, the post-operative hospital stay was decreased by the new surgical technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>According to our results, the FOCUS Harmonic Scalpel can shorten operative time and hospital stay, reduce incidence of symptomatic hypocalcaemia but not transient hypoparathyroidism, and show no significance on recurrent nerve injury.
