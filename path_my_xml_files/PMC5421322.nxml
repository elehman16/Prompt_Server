An AE is an untoward symptom or disease associated with (but not necessarily causally related to) a medical treatment or intervention AEs may lead to changes in drug dosage, cessation of treatment and can significantly compromise patients&#x02019; quality of life. Severe AEs can escalate to hospitalisation for potentially life-threatening toxicities: 18% of cancer patients present to emergency services within 14&#x000a0;days of a scheduled hospital visit for symptom management (infection, fever, nausea/vomiting, pain, breathlessness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patients with breast, gastrointestinal, colorectal cancers and those with metastatic disease are amongst those most likely to have emergency admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Many patients however, delay seeking care especially out of hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This concurs with the findings of a UK enquiry into patient outcome and death (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death, NCEPOD) which found that of patients dying within 30&#x000a0;days of systemic cancer therapy, 17% delayed seeking advice for over 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. AEs are documented consistently by physicians in clinical trials however in routine care recording of AEs by clinicians and reporting by patients is variable and often omitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It has been recognised for some time that a structured AEs reporting system would be useful to facilitate correct documentation and grading of AE severity to support tailored management. Consequently, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the US have developed the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 4.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] as a reporting and severity grading system for cancer clinical trials. These have recently been adapted for patients to self-report (NCI-PRO CTCAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and these items have concordance with nurse evaluated AE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and similar items created for self-report correlate with quality of life measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The need for routine monitoring of cancer treatment AE is at odds with a health care system relying increasingly on patient self-management and home based care. In order to bridge the gap in service provision to detect, identify and manage AE in cancer patients the Electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice (eRAPID): system was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)</title><p>PROMs have been used in clinical practice to support care of individual patients, recent reviews suggest they improve symptom/function monitoring, physician patient communication and decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], can save time during clinic visits and improve the accuracy of symptom reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the UK the 2008 Darzi report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] recommended that collection of PROMs data should be an essential component of health care evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the Department of Health (DOH) subsequently produced guidelines to aid their implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Following this, use of PROMs in the health service is most advanced in England (particularly for performance comparisons) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Two recently published reports by the Independent Cancer Taskforce and NHS England have continued to highlight the need to put PROMs at the centre of strategies to improve patient centred cancer care and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electronic and mobile reporting technology</title><p>Electronic reporting of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) has proven extremely acceptable to patients in the clinic setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Examples of successful implementation of electronic symptom reporting in oncology clinical practice include PatientViewpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the symptom tracking and reporting system (STAR) system for patients to report chemotherapy AE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the Tell Us&#x02122; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] system for advanced cancer patients in hospices undergoing palliative care (all in the U.S.). In Austria the Computer-based Health Evaluation System (CHES) software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] has been developed and an interactive online system (ISAAC) is in use in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the UK the ASyMS mobile phone system is currently being evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Electronic patient reported outcome systems have proven very acceptable even for patients coping with extreme symptom burden and reduced quality of life; indeed a mean monthly PROM completion rate of 83% at 34&#x000a0;weeks has been achieved with patients receiving cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>eRAPID development work</title><p>The eRAPID research programme was designed to develop and evaluate an online system to support the collection and clinical integration of patients&#x02019; symptom/AE reports during cancer treatment. It utilises a web-based questionnaire builder system called QTool. QTool Version 1 was originally used in a large prospective study of cancer survivors, recruiting 636 patients in 12&#x000a0;months, 81% of whom completed web-based questionnaires at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epocs.leeds.ac.uk">www.epocs.leeds.ac.uk</ext-link>), confirming the feasibility of web-based patient-reporting and QTool acceptability. Between 2010 and 2013 the eRAPID developmental work was conducted (funded by an National Institute of Health Research grant: Programme Development Grant scheme RP-DG-1209-10,031), which focused on:</p><p>

</p><p>The FACT-G Physical Wellbeing Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] (measured at 18&#x000a0;weeks) is the primary outcome. The main secondary outcome is cost effectiveness assessed via use of health care services (including hospital admissions, telephone contacts and consultations, medication and personal expenses). In addition participant records will be linked to costs held within the local pilot database of the National Patient-Level Information and Costing System (PLICS) scheme. This provides a cost for hospital based accident and emergency department visits, outpatient attendances and inpatient stays.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (now part of the Health Research Authority) Yorkshire &#x00026; The Humber Leeds East Committee in September 2014 (Reference 14/YH/1066).

We aimed to achieve (i) recruitment levels of &#x0003e;10 patients per month), (ii) 60% to consent to randomisation, and (iii) &#x0003c;30% attrition.</p><p>The pilot sample size was set at 30 participants per-arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] allowing for 30% overall attrition, the overall target was a minimum of 42 patients per-arm (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;84). Recruitment took place between January&#x02013;September 2015.134 patients were approached, 87 consented, 22 declined and 25 were excluded after further screening (no Internet access or not continuing on to chemotherapy). The consent rate when including those patients excluded post-screening was 65% (87 consented/134 approached). However the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; consent rate excluding the 25 patients was 80% (134 approached - 25 ineligible). Forty-four participants were allocated to the Intervention arm and 43 to Usual Care. Only 13 participants (15%) withdrew. No significant problems with the IT systems underpinning the eRAPID online intervention were encountered and the research team was able to develop robust methods of gathering information on clinical process data (e.g. hospital contacts, changes to treatment). Based on participant feedback some refinements were made to patient &#x0201c;use of resources forms&#x0201d; to aid comprehension of questions and ease of completion. The overall recruitment and attrition targets were met and the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) recommended progression to the main trial.

Participants are given a user manual to take home providing a step-by-step guide on how to log in and use the eRAPID system. Participants are asked to complete the remote eRAPID Adverse Events (AEs) questionnaire weekly (from home or during clinic visits) and at any time when they experience any side-effects/symptoms during the duration of their treatment. The questionnaire consists of 12&#x02013;15 items depending on the disease group assessing the severity of common symptoms such as: nausea, vomiting, pain, fatigue, diarrhoea, constipation, sore mouth/tongue, temperature, chills, performance status, fatigue, sleep, and appetite. Participants can also provide details about additional problems at the end of the standard questions. A weekly text message or email reminder are sent to the participants as a prompt to complete the eRAPID AE questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Staff training</title><p>Prior to study commencement the appropriate staff received training on eRAPID.

The analysis will compare usual care with the eRAPID-supported pathway. A secondary analysis will take a societal perspective. Analyses will use quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) outcome-measures. Estimation of QALYs requires the production of utility-weights for each health-state observed in the trial population. We will use the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] collected at baseline, 6, 12 &#x00026; 18&#x000a0;weeks. We will also use EORTC QLQ-C30 to derive utilities (EORTC QLQ-U10) to calculate QALYs in the same way. This will limit the need to interpolate quality of life between observation points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. NHS resource-use associated with each treatment modality will be collected using the process-of-care measures to contribute to a health-economics analysis of additional health financial costs related to treatment and the study. Use of outpatient and community-based health and social care (including, for example, home help or residential care) will be collected from the patient at baseline, 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;weeks with the Use of Resources questionnaire developed in the Programme Development Grant and tested in the pilot study. Unit financial costs for health services resources will be obtained from national source: the Personal Social Services Research Unit, the British National Formulary and NHS reference cost database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

A number of web based PROMs systems have been developed. Since the current trial began Basch and colleagues in the U.S. have published findings from an RCT using the STAR (Symptom Tracking and Reporting) web interface during chemotherapy indicating a positive impact on patients&#x02019; quality of life, treatment delivery, number of emergency room attendances and 1 year survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. We believe eRAPID is the first of its kind to allow remote monitoring of symptoms and side effects where patient reported data is accessible alongside standard clinical information in electronic patient records as well as providing patients with immediate symptom management advice. We hypothesise that these features along with alerts for severe symptoms will lead to improved clinical outcomes for participants allocated to the eRAPID intervention and will benefit health care services.</p><p>This study can be considered a complex intervention due to the number of active components involved. These include the new technology for patients completing symptom self-reports from home, automatic advice on managing mild symptoms and when to contact the hospital for severe problems, the availability of this patient data for staff to use in clinical practice, alert generation for severe problems and maintaining staff training and engagement. Consequently eRAPID&#x02019;s success relies on the investment of both staff and patient groups in the intervention and the robustness of the IT supporting the system. Although the eRAPID website and the online symptom reporting questionnaire have undergone extensive usability testing, the pilot phase of the RCT was considered vital in order to assess the intervention over a longer time frame and with all participating cancer groups as each differ in terms of the care pathways and staff involved. The decision to perform an internal pilot, rather than a separate pilot study, was motivated by our intention to avoid losing momentum and reduce the time between the end of the pilot and the start of the main trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This approach aimed to maintain continuity with the staff involved in the eRAPID intervention both in terms of recruitment and utilising the patient AE reports in clinical encounters.</p><p>The study is funded as part of 5&#x000a0;year programme, in parallel we are developing multi-centre eRAPID interventions for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and surgery which will be evaluated in separate pilot studies. If found to have a positive effect on patient wellbeing and use of health care resources, eRAPID has the potential to provide a cost effective enhancement to the standard care of cancer patients. Such an approach could also be extended to long-term survivorship beyond cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Lucy Ziegler, Ceri Hector, Andrea Gibson, Beverly Clayton, Marie Holmes, Zoe Rogers, Sarah Dickinson, Robert Carter, Colin Johnston and Gillian Santorelli for their contributions to developing and evaluating the eRAPID intervention.
