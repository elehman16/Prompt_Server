Tumour progression and subsequent dropout from waiting list have significant impact on the survival. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) controls tumour growth in the treated HCC nodule, however, the risk of tumour development in the untreated liver is increased by simultaneous release of neo-angiogenic factors. Due to its anti-angiogenic effects, Sorafenib delays the progression of HCC. Aim of this study was to determine whether combination of TACE and Sorafenib improves tumour control in HCC patients on waiting list for LT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio in double-blinded fashion at four centers in Germany and treated with TACE plus either Sorafenib (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;24) or placebo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26). The end of treatment was development of progressive disease according to mRECIST criteria or LT. The primary endpoint of the trial was the Time-to-Progression (TTP). Other efficacy endpoints were Tumour Response, Progression-free Survival (PFS), and Time-to-LT (TTLT).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median time of treatment was 125&#x000a0;days with Sorafenib and 171&#x000a0;days with the placebo. Fourteen patients (seven from each group) developed tumour progression during the course of the study period. The Hazard Ratio of TTP was 1.106 (95% CI: 0.387, 3.162). The results of the Objective Response Rate, Disease Control Rate, PFS, and TTLT were comparable in both groups. The incidence of AEs was comparable in the placebo group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23, 92%) and in the Sorafenib group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23, 96%). Twelve patients (50%) on Sorafenib and four patients (16%) on placebo experienced severe treatment-related AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TTP is similar after neo-adjuvant treatment with TACE and Sorafenib before LT compared to TACE and placebo. The Tumour Response, PFS, and TTLT were comparable. The safety profile of the Sorafenib group was similar to that of the placebo group.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

The implementation of effective surveillance programs for patients with Hepatitis B and C infection has significantly augmented the proportion of patients who are diagnosed at an early stage of the disease. Currently, 30-40% of patients are amenable to curative treatment options and the numbers are expected to increase to 60% within the coming decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Liver Transplantation (LT) is the only therapy that simultaneously cures the tumour and the underlying liver disease and the MILAN Criteria remains the benchmark for patient selection. Five-year survival rates of 60-70% have been achieved in high-volume centres with well-selected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, there remains a great disparity between organ availability and demand; of all the patients on the waiting list for LT, less than one third actually undergo liver transplantations, while most of the enlisted patients simply drop out due to tumour progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Progression of the disease during the waiting time is associated with poorer transplant outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the remaining, viable tumour in the explanted liver has been identified a risk factor for disease recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although locoregional bridging therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are known to improve the survival rates of HCC candidates awaiting LT, their impact on tumour progression and dropout risk is still uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Complete response is seldom achieved via TACE and the presence of residual vital tumour is extremely difficult to evaluate. Nevertheless, locoregional therapies are recommended for bridging before LT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Angiogenic factors are known to be released after locoregional therapy treatment and are believed to trigger tumour growth in untreated livers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, it might be possible to reduce these effects by using a treatment combination with an anti-angiogenic agent.</p><p>The oral multi-kinase inhibitor, Sorafenib, has shown significant efficacy in prolonging the Time-to-Progression for tumours in two large, Phase III trials and is the standard treatment for patients with advanced HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Unfortunately, data on the use of Sorafenib in a neo-adjuvant setting before liver transplantation are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Vitale <italic>et al.</italic> showed that a neo-adjuvant therapy with Sorafenib before LT may have beneficial effects on the survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The strategy of using combined locoregional and anti-angiogenic therapies has been proven in <italic>in vivo</italic> cases. Xu <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the administration of Sorafenib in conjunction with radiofrequency ablation reduced the VEGF and HIF-1&#x003b1; levels, decreased micro-vessel density, and inhibited tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, based on the experience with other VEGF-targeted therapies in a peri-operative setting, concerns have been raised regarding the anti-angiogenic effect of Sorafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Reports on the risk of post-transplantation complications are sparse and heterogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been speculated that the toxic effects of Sorafenib may be prevalent in the presence of vascular and biliary anastomoses, and might increase the risk of leakage or thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>To test the hypothesis of the beneficial effects of a combined locoregional and VEGF-targeted therapy on tumour progression before LT, we initiated a prospective, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial that investigates the neo-adjuvant treatment course with TACE and Sorafenib in HCC patients awaiting LT who have been categorized according to the MILAN criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Here, we report the results of fifty patients treated in this trial and demonstrate that the Time-to-Progression while on waiting list is independent of Sorafenib treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>This multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase III trial was performed in four centres in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The study was approved by the review boards and independent ethics committees of the participating institutions (EudraCT-Nr.: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/">2008-002269-29</ext-link>, ethics committee of Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg, Medical Faculty Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, University Medicine G&#x000f6;ttingen and Medical Faculty Eberhard-Karls-University T&#x000fc;bingen). The trial was done in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the applicable local regulatory requirements and laws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Patients over 18&#x000a0;years of age who had been diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma according to the MILAN Criteria were eligible, provided that they were diagnosed according to the guidelines of the European Association for the Study of Liver Disease (EASLD) and were found to be suitable for liver transplantation. All patients had measurable disease parameters that had been classified according to mRECIST (modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) with no evidence of radiologically definable major vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastases, a Karnofsky index greater than 80%, adequate liver function with bilirubin content of &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;mg/dl, a prothrombin time that was less than 1.5 times higher than the upper limit of the normal range, and adequate renal and haematological function, as well as, a negative pregnancy test . All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: prior systemic, anticancer therapy or local tumour therapy (i.e. LITT; PEI, cryotherapy, RFA, TACE), thrombotic or embolic events (including transient ischemic attacks within six months before study treatment), a haemorrhage/bleeding event of Grade III within four weeks of first dose of the study drug, any reported cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction six months prior to the start of trial, chronic heart failure (revised NYHA Grade III-IV) or unstable coronary artery disease, and uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical management. Patients with uncontrolled infections and HIV-seropositive patients were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study treatment and evaluation of adverse events</title><p>Patients were treated according to the HeiLivCa study protocol with either TACE plus Sorafenib (400&#x000a0;mg bid, orally) or TACE plus placebo until progression of disease was observed or liver transplantation was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Dose reductions of the study medication were allowed in patients with clinically significant toxicities. The study medication was interrupted three days before and continued three days after each TACE. TACE was performed using carboplatin as a chemotherapeutic drug and Lipiodol was used as the embolizing agent, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. TACE was performed every four weeks until complete devascularisation of the treated nodule. Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging was done four weeks after each TACE, followed by TACE every eight weeks until tumour progression or LT. Medical history, physical examination, assessment of the performance status, adverse events, and biochemical and haematological parameters were carried out at baseline of two weeks after the start of study treatment and then every four weeks during the course of the trial. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. LT was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Routine immuno-suppression included an initial, intraoperative, induction dose of prednisolone, followed by CNI-based immunosuppression with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus with MMF or prednisolone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the Time-to-Progression (TTP) while on the waiting list, assessed by the mRECIST Criteria. Other efficacy endpoints were Tumour Response, Progression-free Survival (PFS), and the Time-to-LT. The ORR (Objective Response Rate) was defined as either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). Patients with insufficient data for tumour assessment (e.g., no baseline or follow-up assessments) were considered as &#x0201c;Not meeting ORR criteria&#x0201d;. DCR (Disease Control Rate) was defined as CR, PR, or SD (Stable Disease). TTP was defined as the time between the first dose of the study medication and the first documentation of tumour progression. For patients with no documented tumour progression before the study cut-off point or for those who dropped out of the trial, the Censoring Date was defined as the last date on which the progression status was adequately assessed. PFS was defined as the time between the date of the first dose of the study medication and the date of the first indication of disease progression or death due to any cause, provided that the death occurred before tumour progression was documented. Patients without progression or death were censored on the date of the last tumour assessment during the study. The Time-to-LT was defined as the time from the date of first administration of the study medication to the date of LT.</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on the detection of significant differences in TTP, assuming that median TTP was 4.5&#x000a0;months for the placebo-arm and 7.5&#x000a0;months for the sorafenib-arm (delta of 3&#x000a0;months similar to delta in SHARP study as presented at ASCO 2007). Presupposed exponential survival curves, constant monthly hazard rates, an accrual period of 24&#x000a0;months and a total follow-up of 33 (=24&#x02009;+&#x02009;9) months, and testing for the above-mentioned difference at an overall one-sided significance level of 0.05 and power of 0.875 a total of 136 patients were required. From the experience gained at the surgery department it was anticipated that about 50% of the patients will drop-out after randomization. These patients do not contribute any information to the primary endpoint. In order to accommodate for a maximum drop-out rate of 50% the total sample size was therefore increased to 208 (104 per treatment group). Patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio in a blinded fashion to the sorafenib or placebo. A central computer-generated block-randomized list was prepared by an independent biostatistician of the KKS in Heidelberg and provided to the Pharmacy at University Hospital Heidelberg.</p><p>According to the study protocol, standard methods for survival analysis were to be used in the analysis of Time-to-Event endpoints, including Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survivor functions, Greenwood&#x02019;s formula for estimating the standard error of event rates, the Cox Proportional Hazards Model, and the log-rank test for comparing survival curves. However, the HeiLivCa trial was stopped prematurely after the inclusion of fifty patients and, for this reason, any confirmatory statistical analysis was unattainable. Therefore, the statistical analysis actually performed was in a strictly exploratory and mainly descriptive manner, and differed from the analyses outlined in the study protocol. Due to the presence of competing risk factors in regards to TTP, PFS, and the Time-to-LT, the Kaplan-Meier estimator could not be used and, therefore, an analysis of the Competing Risk data was performed using the SAS macro % Cumulative Incidence Functions (CIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The macro implements used for estimating Cumulative Incidence Functions in this study were appropriate for nonparametric methods. The cumulative incidence for a particular cause of failure is the probability of experiencing this cause of failure until time t, in the presence of all the other possible causes. The estimates of the CIF for each treatment group from the aforementioned Time-to-Event endpoints, the Standard Errors, and the 95% Confidence Intervals were displayed. Additionally, the test for equality of the CIF among the various treatment groups was performed using Gray&#x02019;s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. All data collected in regards to assessing the safety and efficacy of the trial are reported in the summary presentations, listings, or both. All statistical tests used in the exploratory analyses were two-tailed. The significance level was 0.05 and was calculated using SAS Version 9.3. The end of the study was defined when either the informed consent was withdrawn or the presence of disease progression or LT was reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Evaluation of response</title><p>All patients had chest and abdominal imaging (Computed Tomography using Siemens Somatom Definition and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Siemens, Symphony, 1.5&#x000a0;t) before the initiation of the Sorafenib therapy. Imaging was repeated during the trial as described in the study protocol to evaluate radiographic response within the tumour; this response was then classified using the mRECIST criteria. Densitometric measurement of intra-tumoural enhancement was performed using a modification of the Choi Criteria to evaluate the effect of the treatment course on tumour viability. Briefly, using axial source Computed Tomography images (3&#x000a0;mm thickness), a three-dimensional image of the liver was reconstructed with an imaging workstation (TeraRecon, USA). The largest dimensions of the HCC were outlined and a density measurement in Hounsfield units (HU) was obtained. The percental change in HU after treatment was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Role of the sponsor</title><p>The study was an investigator-initiated trial (IIT) that was designed by the principal investigators, Peter Schemmer and Katrin Hoffmann.

One patient from the placebo group eventually withdrew the informed consent. This patient did not receive any study treatment and, as such, was excluded from the safety analysis. On the other hand, all fifty randomized patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Ten patients withdrew their informed consent (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 from the Sorafenib group and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 from the placebo group) due to compliance issues, two patients died (one from each group) during the study (one from a motorcycle accident and the other from general status impairment), three patients were excluded from analysis due to protocol violation, and two patients from the placebo group discontinued participation due to adverse events (a hip fracture and the development of oesophageal cancer) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The concept of locoregional treatment for bridging while awaiting LT has been proven to be effective within the last decade and excellent outcomes have been reported for the TACE treatment option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A meta-analysis clearly showed the beneficial survival effect of TACE in comparison to the results obtained from untreated cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In recent years there was considerable effort made to find the optimal therapeutic regimen of transarterial chemoembolization. Most centers now use drug eluting beads for their TACE procedures and doxorubicin as chemotherapeutic drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>However, the effectiveness of TACE is hampered by tumour progression during the waiting time and subsequent drop-out rates of up to 53% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that neo-angiogenic reactions are induced after TACE, which in turn, potentially enhances the tumour growth of untreated nodules or accelerates the development of de-novo tumours within the cirrhotic liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, a high increment of VEGF after TACE has been recently identified as an independent, negative prognostic factor for both the progression-free and overall survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Sorafenib has direct inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and cell proliferation in HCC; and in two large, Phase III, randomized, controlled trials with demographically different study populations of patients with advanced HCC, Sorafenib has been shown to significantly improve the time to progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The HeiLivCa trial was designed to capture the potentially beneficial effects of a combined locoregional and systemic, molecular-targeted treatment course for HCC patients awaiting LT. The TTP was selected as the primary endpoint of the study because it is an efficient means of monitoring the effects associated with the stabilization of the disease for a clinically relevant period of time.</p><p>Previously, the use of Sorafenib in a post-transplantation setting was controversially discussed because of its toxicity. This was especially true when the occurrence of Grade III - IV adverse events in the majority of patients ultimately resulted in permanent dose reduction or treatment discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the overall experience with Sorafenib in HCC patients awaiting LT is actually even bleaker. Concerns regarding the potential negative side effects of Sorafenib have been raised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, the performance of the trial was encouraged by emerging reports about a near absence of liver toxicity or treatment-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>There are three points that are of major interest when discussing a neo-adjuvant Sorafenib treatment course before LT. The first is the safety when it is used in combination with locoregional treatment options. Data from studies that investigated the combined use of TACE and Sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC suggests that this treatment option has an acceptable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the HeiLivCa trial, 92% of patients in the Sorafenib group experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event. Of those, grade III or IV adverse events occurred in 50% of patients. The major side effects observed in this study were consistent with those reported in two previously conducted randomised controlled trials and a pooled safety analysis of a Sorafenib monotherapy trial for patients with advanced HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The most frequent adverse events in our trial were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and hand-foot-skin reactions, however, these events occurred less frequently in comparison to the safety reports from previous Sorafenib monotherapy trials. Furthermore, despite overlapping co-morbidities in Child-Pugh class B patients, the treatment was equally well tolerated in Child-Pugh class A and B patients. In this trial, only 24% of patients in the Sorafenib group had dose reductions or temporary discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events; a figure that is significantly lower than those values reported in other trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The occurrence of fewer dose adjustments in more recent trials could be attributed to the fact that physicians have gained more experience in handling molecular-targeted therapies, adverse events are monitored more aggressively, and the management strategies for side effects have been optimised over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. There has been growing concern about the increasing numbers of TACE-associated complications when the therapy is used in combination with an anti-angiogenic drug. In light of this, we decided to interrupt drug treatment three days before and after each TACE for this study. As a result of this strategy, no TACE-associated or bleeding complications were observed.</p><p>The second point of interest on this topic is the effect of Sorafenib on tumour growth during the waiting time. In this study, the TTP remained constant with the combined TACE plus Sorafenib therapy and the median TTP was similar in both treatment groups. However, TTP has previously been challenged as a surrogate endpoint in trials for advanced HCC because of the inconsistencies between the OS and the TTP that have been detected in other studies. ORR is currently being revisited as an alternative endpoint after the introduction of modified RECIST assessment in HCC. In our trial, the ORR and the Disease Control Rate were also comparable in groups. Truesdale <italic>et al.</italic> reported that there were no dropouts due to disease progression in the Sorafenib group of their study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Kulik <italic>et al.</italic> reported the occurrence of disease progression during the trial in one patient under Sorafenib and one patient of the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Frenette <italic>et al.</italic> gave no information on disease progression in their patients, however, this could have been influenced by the fact that both their study setting was different and that 93% of their patients were beyond the MILAN criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, all three groups reported that Sorafenib had no general impact on overall survival rates after LT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A potential explanation for a failure of Sorafenib treatment lies within the individual tumor biology of each patient. HCC can be seen as a prototypical therapy-resistant tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Most recently analysis of therapy-na&#x000ef;ve HCC tissue has shown that baseline tissue expression of pERK and VEGFR-2, both key molecules in the cancerogenic pathway of HCCs, is inversely correlated with the clinical outcome in advanced HCCs treated with Sorafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, a pooled shRNA screen conducted to identify target genes whose inhibition increases the therapeutic efficacy of Sorafenib identified MAPK14-dependent activation as a key mechanism of Sorafenib resistance in mouse and human liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, the incidence of severe adverse events in the Sorafenib treated patients and the combination with the lack of an impact on the study end-points discourage in our view the use of the drug in combination with TACE.</p><p>Lastly, the interaction of Sorafenib with the transplantation setting is of particular interest for transplant surgeons. Previous research with molecular-targeted therapies in a pre-operative setting has raised concerns about the risk of wound-healing complications, haemorrhage, and cardiac events. The current study did not identify an overall increased risk of delayed wound-healing, bowel perforation, or incisional hernia. The intraoperative blood loss was not higher in the Sorafenib group and this was in line with the data from Frenette&#x02019;s research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the other hand, Kulik <italic>et al.</italic> and Truesdale <italic>et al.</italic> described both a potentially increased risk for biliary complications and a higher rate of rejection after neo-adjuvant Sorafenib use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, the survival rates of two aforementioned trials were the same in both the Sorafenib and the placebo groups.</p><p>We are well aware of the limitations of the present study. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort reported to date. This study was designed under the assumption that Sorafenib provides a 40% reduction in the hazard ratio for TTP. However, the results showed no treatment difference between Sorafenib and placebo. The observed hazard ratio in TTP for Sorafenib compared to placebo was 1.106, 95% CI of 0.387 to 3.162, indicating a slight disadvantage for Sorafenib. Based on the data shown above, we calculated the conditional power according to Andersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Even if the accrual would be extended for another four years the conditional power (based on the initial assumptions regarding treatment effect) would be less than 10%. Consequently, we stopped the study due to futility. With that being said, we opted to report the results of the fifty patients treated in the trial because of the clinical relevance. Due to the low patient numbers, any confirmatory statistical analysis was unattainable inappropriate, therefore, the statistical analysis that was actually performed was in a strictly exploratory and mainly descriptive manner. It should also be emphasized that it is highly probable that a type 2 error, because of the small sample size, would make the differences in complications after LT difficult to detect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we believe that this trial gives no evidence on the indication of Sorafenib for HCC before LT. The Time-to-Progression, the Objective Response Rates, and the Disease Control Rates remained similar after the administration of the combined neo-adjuvant treatment with TACE and Sorafenib to HCC patients in our trial setting. In combination with the increased incidence of adverse events a recommendation for neo-adjuvant treatment with Sorafenib and TACE cannot be given.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CIF</term><def><p>Cumulative Incidence Functions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p>Complete Response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTCAE</term><def><p>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCR</term><def><p>Disease Control Rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EASLD</term><def><p>European Association for the Study of Liver Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCC</term><def><p>Hepatocellular Carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IIT</term><def><p>Investigator-initiated Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LT</term><def><p>Liver Transplantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mRECIST</term><def><p>Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ORR</term><def><p>Objective Response Rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFS</term><def><p>Progression-free Survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p>Partial Response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Stable Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TACE</term><def><p>Transarterial chemoembolization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTP</term><def><p>Time-to-Progression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTLT</term><def><p>Time-to-Liver-Transplantation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>KH and PS are the principal investigators, designed the trial, treated patients, coordinated the other trial centres, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript, CvK and DJ designed the trial and treated patients, IKS performed the biometrical design and data-analysis, TG, DG, BR, US, OK, SN and MWB treated patients and performed the trial in their trial centres.
