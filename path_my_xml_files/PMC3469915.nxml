Labour pain is excruciating and a significant contributor of stress and anxiety. Painful uterine contractions cause maternal hyperventilation and increased catecholamine concentration resulting in maternal and foetal hypoxaemia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] An effective analgesia takes away the disadvantages and results in better maternal and foetal outcome. Hence, the control of pain should form an integral part of labour management at any level.</p><p>An ideal labour analgesic technique should provide adequate and satisfactory analgesia without any motor blockade or adverse maternal and foetal effects. Among the variety of labour analgesia techniques ranging from parenteral and inhalational agents, regional analgesia has an edge over other methods in achieving the above goals. Combined spinal epidural (CSE) analgesia is increasingly used to provide pain relief during labour. It combines the advantage of rapid onset of spinal analgesia and the flexibility of the epidural catheter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Dose adjustments and frequency of administration of the drug according to parturients&#x02019; requirement is possible with the epidural route which can also be extended to provide anaesthesia for caesarean delivery if need arises.</p><p>The quality of analgesia is excellent when highly lipid-soluble opioids are added. Addition of opioids to local anaesthetics reduces its requirement by synergistic effect of opioid receptors in the spinal cord. This reduces the chances of motor blockade and the haemodynamic perturbation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Although fentanyl and sufentanil are the most commonly used opioids for epidural labour analgesia, studies comparing CSE technique employing sufentanil and fentanyl are very few and give conflicting results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] At the assumed equipotent doses of sufentanil to fentanyl ratio of 6:1, there is some evidence that sufentanil is clinically superior to fentanyl as an adjunct to bupivacaine in labour epidurals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Hence, we decided to compare the efficacy, quality and duration of analgesia and maternal and foetal effects of adding the two highly lipid-soluble opioids, sufentanil and fentanyl to low-concentration bupivacaine for CSE labour analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>A randomized, prospective, single-blinded study was carried out on 60 parturients over a period of 6 months after obtaining clearance from the institutional ethical committee. Parturients belonging to ASA grade I and II with singleton, term pregnancy in spontaneous labour with cervical dilatation of less than 4 cm, with normal foetal heart tracings requesting labour analgesia, were included in the study. Parturients with medical disorders, obstetric complications, malpresentation of foetus and those with contraindication for regional analgesia were excluded from the study. After obtaining informed written consent, parturients were randomly allocated by a computer-generated table of random numbers by a person blinded to the procedure to avoid selection bias into two groups of 30 each as group S (<italic>n</italic>=30) and group F (<italic>n</italic>=30).</p><p>Before institution of CSE, parturients were administered 1000 mL ringer lactate solution and monitors were connected and baseline readings recorded. Patients were placed in the left lateral position and, under aseptic precautions, CSE analgesia was administered through a midline approach (L2-L3 or L3-L4 level). Lumbar epidural space was identified with an 18G Tuohy needle using loss of resistance to saline technique. After negative aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid, the epidural catheter was threaded on through the Tuohy needle and the needle was carefully withdrawn. Spinal analgesia was instituted using a 25G Whitacre needle one space below. On identification of subarachnoid space, 1 mL of drug containing 0.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine heavy (2.5 mg) and 0.5 mL sufentanil (5 mcg) for group S or 0.5 mL fentanyl (25 mcg) for group F was injected intrathecally and the epidural catheter was fixed thereafter. The parturient was turned supine immediately after subarachnoid block and the uterus was displaced to the left using a wedge.</p><p>Pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and SPO<sub>2</sub> were monitored at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min and thereafter every 30 min until the women delivered. Motor block was assessed by modified bromage scale and the level of sensory block was recorded. Pain relief was assessed using visual analogue scores (VAS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] (0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain experienced). When the parturient experienced pain equivalent to a VAS score of 5, epidural top-up was administered. The time interval between initiation of intrathecal analgesia and patient developing pain equivalent to VAS score 5 was defined as the duration of intrathecal analgesia, and was noted. Parturients of group S received 10 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine with 0.30 mcg/mL of sufentanil and group F received 10 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.5 mcg/mL through an epidural catheter. Time of onset of epidural analgesia, total number of top-ups and duration between successive top-ups were recorded. Foetal heart rate (FHR) was continuously monitored using a cardiotocograph. Progress of labour was recorded in a partogram. The mode of delivery in the form of normal vaginal delivery, instrumental delivery or caesarean section was observed. Side-effects such as pruritis (rated as none, minimal, moderate and severe),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] hypotension (fall of &#x0003e;20% from baseline systolic reading), motor blockade of limbs, shivering, sedation (categorized as none, mild, moderate and severe for awake, drowsy, sleepy and unarousable)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and bradycardia (heart rate&#x0003c;60) were noted.</p><p>Neonatal outcome in the form of APGAR scores at 1 min and 5 min and need for intensive care were noted. All the data were recorded by a resident blinded to the drug administered during conduct of labour analgesia throughout the study period. The parturient was monitored for 2 h following delivery and the epidural catheter was removed. They were questioned after 24 h about their views on the procedure and the satisfaction. Enquiry about the symptoms related to post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) was made.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using software version SPSS 12.0.

None of the parturients from either group had symptoms suggestive of PDPH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Highly lipid-soluble synthetic opioids such as sufentanil and fentanyl are being increasingly used along with very low concentrations of local anaesthetic agents such as bupivacaine (0.0625&#x02013;0.125%) and ropivacaine (0.2&#x02013;0.25%) to provide excellent relief of pain during labour.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Unlike hydrophilic opiates (morphine) or intermediate lipid-soluble opioids (meperidine), lipophillic opioids do not spread rostrally in cerebrospinal fluid to any great extent, and they tend to have fairly segmental analgesic profiles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Quality of analgesia and overall satisfaction scores were found to be comparable in both groups in our study. In a dose response study, the analgesic potency of epidural sufentanil was reported to be approximately five-times that of fentanyl when it was administered as the sole analgesic after lidocaine anaesthesia for caesarean delivery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Addition of bupivacaine to intrathecal opioid prolongs duration of labour analgesia compared with either drug used alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Evidence suggests that bupivacaine potentiates the binding of morphine to opioid receptors, especially the highly dense kappa receptors, as the result of an associated conformational change in opioid receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] We observed that duration of analgesia provided by intrathecal sufentanil and bupivacaine was 109.70&#x000b1;6.37 min as compared with 73.63&#x000b1;15.76 min by group F. This difference was statistically significant. These are similar to previously reported results using sufentanil: 114&#x000b1;26 min[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and 99 min.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] This prolonged duration of analgesia with sufentanil could be attributed to the known superiority of sufentanil over fentanyl in terms of potency.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Parturients receiving sufentanil required less total dose of bupivacaine than those receiving fentanyl.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Similarly, the number of supplementary bupivacaine top-ups was comparatively less in the sufentanil group (group S 1.22&#x000b1;0.75 and group F 2.06&#x000b1;0.081).</p><p>Addition of bupivacaine 2.5 mg and sufentanil 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g for labour analgesia showed that the combination, although effective, was associated with a higher incidence of hypotension and impairment of muscle power of the lower limbs, although mild in some parturients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Another investigation by halving the total amount of intrathecal sufentanil and bupivacaine reduced the incidence of side-effects. However, this reduced dose regimen was associated with slower onset and shorter duration of labour analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] As 10 mcg sufentanil is associated with severe hypotension and 2.5 mcg sufentanil produces analgesia of shorter duration and slower onset, in our study, we added 5 mcg sufentanil to bupivacaine 2.5 mg intrathecal.</p><p>CSE has an added advantage of initiating labour analgesia even at the late stages of labour. We found that analgesia through intrathecal route resulted in immediate and predictable onset of analgesia enhancing the parturient's cooperation for the insertion of epidural catheter. The duration of first and second stage of labour and the mode of delivery between the groups did not differ significantly. The incidence of caesarean delivery was 20% and 16.66% between group S and F, respectively. 6.66% of group S and 10% of group F underwent instrumental delivery. These findings do not differ grossly with the earlier reports.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Higher concentration of bupivacaine (0.25%) was used in the past, which resulted in a fairly higher incidence of motor block causing pelvic muscle relaxation, foetal malposition and maternal inability to push and a higher incidence of instrumental delivery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Low concentration of local anaesthetic along with opioids has overcome this disadvantage. Incidence of motor blockade in our study groups was very minimal and was of bromage scale 1, which did not persist beyond the first hour. The incidence of cephalad extent of sensory block was identical in the two groups.</p><p>The pain relief during labour was assessed by VAS scoring and the pain scores were comparable between the groups. Maternal satisfaction was assessed based on subjective assessment on the following day of labour. It was graded as excellent in 93.33% parturients of group S and 90.0% parturients of group F, as in previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Use of sufentanil and fentanil was found to be safe among neonates. The dose of opioids administered did not adversely affect the APGAR scores or cause respiratory depression among newborns in our study.</p><p>The incidence of side-effects was comparable between the groups. Pruritus was the most common side-effect between the two groups, which was not of a serious nature. The incidence of sedation and nausea was similar in the two groups, with no parturient in either group requiring any intervention.</p><p>Continuous infusion of a dilute mixture of local anaesthetics and opioids offers the advantage of stable level of analgesia and increased maternal haemodynamic stability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However, automated regular bolus delivery of epidural analgesia when compared with continuous infusion is found to decrease the incidence of breakthrough pain and increased maternal satisfaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Because of logistic constraints, we used intermittent epidural dosing on demand by the parturients, which, we found, could be comparable to continuous and automated delivery system. The limitation in our study was to combine primiparous and multiparous parturients, which could have altered the results of mode of delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that CSE using sufentanil and fentanyl achieved high patient satisfaction and excellent labour analgesia without serious maternal or neonatal side-effects.
