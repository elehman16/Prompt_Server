Pain relief is not simply a humanitarian consideration but also an important means for reduction of morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Spinal anesthesia is the most commonly used technique for lower abdominal surgeries because of its reliability, cost effectiveness, effective analgesia, muscle relaxation, and prolonged postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The safety of well conducted spinal anesthesia is attested by reports of thousands of carefully followed up cases by recognized authorities.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Different drugs were tried for spinal anesthesia from time to time to find out an ideal drug which not only should provide excellent surgical anesthesia but also be free of inadvertent side-effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Bupivacaine, an amide group local anesthetic, is the most common drug being used intrathecally in lower abdominal surgeries. However, high doses of bupivacaine may lead to myocardial depression, heart blocks, and dysrhythmias. Cardiac arrest caused by higher doses of bupivacaine is more refractory to resuscitation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Ropivacaine, a newer local anesthetic, is gaining increased acceptance as it has consistently demonstrated an improved safety profile over bupivacaine with a reduced neurotoxic and cardiotoxic potential, together with a wide clinical utility at different doses and for a wide range of indications.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Ropivacaine was approved for the intrathecal route by the European Union in February 2004. Subarachnoid block with ropivacaine in lower abdominal surgeries provides adequate intraoperative anesthesia and effective pain relief in initial postoperative period, but when its effect wears off, patient starts experiencing pain. To prolong the postoperative analgesia, a number of adjuvants have been used. These adjuvants reduce the dose of local anesthetic required and still provide sufficient analgesia.</p><p>Administration of local anesthetics with opioids has become a widely accepted practice in the management of spinal anesthesia for surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] They produce a synergistic effect by acting directly on opioid receptors in the spinal cord. Fentanyl, a short-acting lipophilic opioid stimulates &#x000b5;1 and &#x000b5;2 receptors. It potentiates the afferent sensory blockade and facilitates reduction in the dose of local anesthetics without intensifying the motor block or prolonging recovery. Fentanyl provides good quality of intraoperative analgesia, hemodynamic stability, minimal side effects, and excellent quality of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Central neuraxial opioids are known for their side effects such as pruritus, urinary retention and potentially catastrophic delayed respiratory depression. This has prompted further research to develop nonopioid analgesics which can be used as adjuvants to local anesthetics. Clonidine is a centrally acting selective partial &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist (220:1 &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> to &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>) and provides dose-dependent analgesia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Clonidine is known for its synergism with local anesthetics but has side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess whether the effect of spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine could be enhanced by adjuvants such as clonidine and fentanyl while still maintaining the hemodynamic stability and central nervous system safety profile for which ropivacaine is increasingly being employed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee and written informed consent from the patients, a prospective randomized, double-blind study was carried out on 100 patients in the age group of 20&#x02013;65 years, of either sex, of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Grades I, II, and III, scheduled for elective lower abdominal surgeries of duration &#x0003c;90 min under spinal anesthesia. Patients having unwillingness for the procedure, neurological and coagulation disorders, allergy to amide local anesthetic, morbid obesity, abnormalities of the spine, and pregnant or lactating women were excluded from the study. A day before surgery, a detailed pre-anesthetic check-up was carried out and visual analog score for pain was explained to the patients. It is a 10-point scale in which &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; indicates no pain and &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; indicates severe pain.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In the operation theater, an intravenous (IV) line was secured and injection midazolam 0.04 mg/kg body weight was given IV. The patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg body weight of Ringer lactate solution over 15&#x02013;20 min. Multiparameter monitor were attached and baseline heart rate, respiratory rate, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiography was recorded. After ensuring sterile conditions, spinal anesthesia was performed by accessing the subarachnoid space with a 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle via the L2&#x02013;L3 or L3&#x02013;L4 inter-vertebral space in the lateral decubitus position. After ensuring the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, patients received one of the two study drugs.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 50 each:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group I: Fifty patients received 2.5 ml of 0.75% isobaric ropivacaine hydrochloride containing 18.75 mg and clonidine 30 &#x000b5;g diluted with normal saline to make the final volume 3 ml</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group II: Fifty patients received 2.5 ml of 0.75% isobaric ropivacaine hydrochloride containing 18.75 mg and fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g to make the final volume 3 ml.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The drug combinations were prepared by the first anesthesiologist. However, various observations were made by the second anesthesiologist who was blinded of the drug administered. In all cases, the level of sensory and motor block and the sedation score were evaluated at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, and 30 min intervals thereafter. The sensory block level was evaluated with the pin-prick test, the motor block level with a modified Bromage scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], and the sedation degree with the Ramsay sedation scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Modified Bromage scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-526-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Ramsay sedation scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-526-g002"/></table-wrap><p>During the tracking of the sensory block levels in patients, the mean time to onset of sensory block to T10 dermatome, the maximum sensory block level achieved, time to achieve maximum sensory block level, and time for regression of sensory block level to L5 level were monitored. While tracking the motor block, the maximum motor block level, time to achieve maximum motor block level, and total duration of motor block were assessed. The quality of surgical anesthesia was assessed and graded. In the postoperative period, the time of first analgesic demand was noted and injection diclofenac (75 mg) was administered. Patients were observed for any discomfort, nausea, vomiting, shivering, pruritus, bradycardia, and any other side effects. All patients were observed in the postanesthesia recovery room and later in the ward. Severe pruritus and nausea/vomiting were treated with injection chlorpheniramine maleate and injection ondansetron, respectively.</p><p>SPSS statistical package (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0.

These advantages are sometimes offset by a relatively short duration of action and complaints of postoperative pain when the effect wears off. The efficacy of local anesthetics can be enhanced using adjuvants such as opioids and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists.</p><p>Spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine hydrochloride is increasingly being used these days owing to its improved safety profile. In a study, forty patients were randomized to receive either 3 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine (15 mg) or 3 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine (22.5 mg) for spinal anesthesia. It showed that the durations of analgesia and motor block were longer in the 0.75% group, and the intensity of motor block was lower in 0.5% group. The study concluded that at concentrations of 0.5% and 0.75%, ropivacaine results in long-lasting spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The mean time to onset of sensory block to T10 dermatome, maximum sensory level achieved and the time to achieve maximum sensory block level was comparable in both the groups. Similar findings were seen in studies by Ogun <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] where 17.5 mg ropivacaine was compared with a combination of 15 mg ropivacaine and 30 &#x000b5;g clonidine in women undergoing cesarean deliveries; study by Chaudhary <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] where sixty male patients scheduled for elective transurethral resection were divided into two groups to receive an intrathecal injection of either ropivacaine 2 ml (0.75%) or ropivacaine 1.8 ml (0.75%) with fentanyl 10 &#x000b5;g. Similarly in another study, Yegin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] evaluated the effect of adding either 0.5 ml of fentanyl (25 &#x003bc;g) or 0.5 ml of normal saline to 3 ml of 6 mg/ml hyperbaric ropivacaine (18 mg) intrathecally for transurethral resection of prostate and found similar times of onset of sensory block, as did Seetharam and Bhat[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] when they administered 18.75 mg isobaric ropivacaine with 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl in patients scheduled for lower abdominal and lower limb surgeries.</p><p>The mean time for regression of sensory blockade to L5 dermatome was prolonged in the clonidine group (240.00 &#x000b1; 20.99 min) as compared to fentanyl group (196.80 &#x000b1; 18.34 min), which was highly significant, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. In a study by Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] when 12 mg 1% ropivacaine + clonidine (RC) 30 &#x000b5;g was administered to patients scheduled for elective lower extremity surgery, the time to regression of sensory block to S2 dermatome level was found to be 246.60 &#x000b1; 18.69 min, which is in accordance with Group I of our study. Another study by Jagtap <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] sixty patients were randomly allocated to receive intrathecally either when 15 mg 0.5% ropivacaine with 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl was administered to patients scheduled for major lower limb orthopedic surgeries, the time to regression of sensory block to L1 dermatome level was found to be 226 &#x000b1; 46.98 min, which is comparable to Group II of our study.</p><p>The maximum motor block level achieved and the time to achieve maximum motor block level was comparable in both the groups.
