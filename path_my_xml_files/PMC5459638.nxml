Soft-tissue support devices, egg, acellular dermal matrix (ADM) products are commonly used during reconstruction and can produce more complete coverage, higher fill volumes, and rapid expansion of tissue expanders.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In retrospective analyses, soft-tissue support devices were associated with complications such as seroma, infections, and reconstruction failure at higher rates versus traditional submuscular implant coverage.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Prospective controlled studies on the use of soft-tissue support devices would establish overall outcomes and the risk of such complications.</p><p>SERI Surgical Scaffold (SERI; Allergan plc; Dublin, Ireland) is a bioresorbable, silk-derived scaffold for soft-tissue support. Its biomechanical properties (i.e., load, stress, and stiffness) are similar to those of host tissue; SERI has demonstrated good biocompatibility and a mild, self-limited foreign-body response.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In an ovine model of 2-stage, implant-based breast reconstruction, histologic analysis showed bioresorption of SERI by 1 year. Most of the load-bearing responsibility and strength of SERI were transferred to newly generated tissue by this time.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The current prospective study obtained long-term clinical data following the implantation of SERI during stage 1 surgery in 2-stage breast reconstruction. Interim data for 71 subjects who completed 1 year of postsurgical assessments were previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Here, we report the final data for all subjects through 2 years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Institutional review boards at each site approved the protocol; all subjects provided written informed consent. Study design and eligibility criteria were previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Briefly, this prospective, multicenter, single-arm study enrolled women who received SERI during stage 1 of 2-stage breast reconstruction. Subjects included women undergoing breast reconstruction with subpectoral placement of a tissue expander (Natrelle Style 133V; Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) followed by exchange with a breast implant. Exclusion criteria included ongoing or planned breast radiation treatment. Any patient with a disease that might affect wound healing was excluded. These included patients with uncontrolled diabetes or an autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, or immunosuppressive drugs unrelated to breast cancer. Patients who smoked within the year before SERI implantation were also excluded. An abscess or infection at the time of surgery, or any condition that might interfere with a subject&#x02019;s participation in the study or confound study results also led to exclusion. Data were collected at the first postoperative visit, tissue expansion visits, stage 2 surgery (to replace tissue expanders with permanent implants), and follow-up visits at 6, 12, and 18 months and at 2 years after stage 1 surgery.</p><sec><title>Study Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was investigator satisfaction with SERI at 6 months after stage 1 surgery, as measured on an 11-point scale (0, very dissatisfied; 10, very satisfied). Secondary outcome measures included investigator assessment of ease of use with SERI at the time of stage 1 surgery, measured on a 5-point scale, (1, very difficult to use; 5, very easy to use). Ease of use was assessed for each of the following scaffold criteria: preparation before implantation, cutting and shaping before implantation, positioning/drapability during implantation, cutting and shaping after implantation, and suturing during implantation (including tension and stretch).</p><p>Additional measurements included subject satisfaction based on a 5-point scale (1, very dissatisfied; 5, very satisfied) for the question: &#x0201c;Overall, how satisfied are you with your breast(s)?&#x0201d;</p><p>Palpability of SERI was assessed by pressing firmly on the lower pole of the breast in upright subjects, scored using a 4-point scale (0, not palpable at all; 3, easily palpable). Visibility of SERI was evaluated as a yes/no determination while subjects were upright. Palpability and visibility were assessed at first visit after stage 1 surgery, immediately before stage 2 surgery, and at 6, 12, and 18 months and 2 years after stage 1 surgery.</p><p>Breast anatomy measurements were calculated from 3D photographs (Canfield Scientific, Inc; Fairfield, N.J.). Breast width, distance from sternal notch to apex, sternal notch to inframammary fold, and apex to inframammary fold were measured by Canfield technicians using the 3D images.</p><p>SERI integration was assessed by investigators as: (1) scaffold capsule adherence to the tissue expander surface using a 4-point scale [0, no adherence; 3, complete adherence (80&#x02013;100% of surface area)], (2) integration of the scaffold to the surrounding tissue using a 4-point scale [0, no integration; 3, complete integration (80&#x02013;100% of surface area)], and (3) vascularization of the area using a 3-point scale (0, no vascularization; 2, tissue is vascularized).</p><p>One small incisional biopsy was taken from approximately halfway between the scaffold/pectoralis margin and the inframammary fold within the lateral half of the load-bearing region from each breast during stage 2 surgery. All collected histologic samples were evaluated by a single pathologist.</p><p>Predefined adverse events (AEs) of interest, based on prior experience with common complications occurring with breast reconstruction surgery, were prospectively recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>This article presents data from the per-protocol (PP) population, which included subjects with no protocol deviations that could affect the primary measure throughout the study, such as postoperative radiation therapy after stage 1 surgery. The PP population was analyzed as the primary study group.</p><p>Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, range, and confidence intervals (CIs), as appropriate, were reported. For the primary analysis, the frequency distribution of satisfaction scores was categorized into discrete ranges, and deviation from normality of the distribution was analyzed using the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. Subgroup analyses explored the relationship of specific variables to investigator satisfaction with SERI and subject satisfaction with breasts. Race, baseline age, unilateral versus bilateral implantation, and presence or absence of radiation treatment were assessed with descriptive measures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 160 subjects enrolled, 21 (13.1%) were discontinued for not receiving an implant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Thirty-six of 139 subjects were excluded from the PP population, 28 of whom received unplanned radiation therapy after implantation.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The other 8 subjects were excluded for various reasons, including not receiving a breast implant, having another support device implanted, being involved in another clinical trial, and not meeting eligibility criteria.

Nine subjects underwent bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer, 9 underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, and 40 underwent unilateral mastectomy for breast cancer with prophylactic mastectomy on the contralateral breast. Thirty-eight subjects had unilateral mastectomy for breast cancer, and 7 subjects had unilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Mean (SD) procedure time for stage 1 surgery was 86.0 (41.0) minutes.

After reconstruction, breasts had shorter mean distances from the sternal notch to apex and sternal notch to inframammary fold versus baseline and larger mean distance from the apex to the inframammary fold. Mean breast widths were similar before and after reconstruction. Across all anatomical measurements, little change was seen from 6 months through 2 years, which represents the stability of the lower pole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In particular, the distance from the sternal notch to the inframammary fold (the best measure of lower breast mound stability) was a mean (95% CI) of 24.0&#x02009;cm (23.7&#x02013;24.2) at month 6, 24.5&#x02009;cm (24.3&#x02013;24.7) at month 12, 24.6&#x02009;cm (24.4&#x02013;24.8) at month 18, and 24.5&#x02009;cm (24.2&#x02013;24.7) at 2 years.

As evidenced by breast anatomy measurements, the lower pole remained highly stable over time. Our findings confirm the pre- and intraoperative ease of use and high satisfaction for up to 1 year reported by surgeons who have used SERI in procedures for soft-tissue support and repair.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Additionally, our findings of high subject satisfaction with breast reconstruction at all time points support those of a systematic review of 28 studies showing that, overall, subjects were satisfied with breast reconstruction, regardless of the technique used, and that age and procedure timing did not affect general satisfaction. That study identified factors that influence subject satisfaction, including breast symmetry, size, shape, and scars.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Investigators found SERI to be easy to use before and during implantation. Most SERI scaffolds were not palpable or visible at any point throughout the study; they had integrated with the surrounding tissue and become vascularized by the time of stage 2 surgery.</p><p>Compared with submuscular implantation without surgical support, use of SERI may provide some advantages in aspects of the surgical procedure for breast reconstruction, such as larger initial fill volumes and fewer fills required to complete the tissue expander fill.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Prior studies reported average initial fill volumes of approximately 130 cc for submuscular implantation without surgical support,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> whereas, in the current study, two-thirds of subjects had fill volumes greater than 200 cc. Similarly, previous studies report a mean of 4.3&#x02013;6 tissue expander fills needed to achieve final fill volume<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>; in this study, approximately 40% of subjects required only 1&#x02013;3 fills for final fill volume.</p><p>Histologic findings were consistent with an expected mild inflammatory response to a foreign body. Histologically normal samples were associated with resorption of the scaffold and replacement with well-vascularized tissue.</p><p>A number of AEs, such as capsular contracture, seroma, hematoma, and tissue or skin necrosis, have been commonly reported following breast reconstruction with surgical support devices.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A meta-analysis comparing rates of complications in 153 breasts that had ADM-based reconstruction with 2,910 breasts having traditional musculofascial surgical techniques found a 3-fold increase in rate of seroma and a greater than 2-fold increase in the rate of explantation with ADM-based reconstruction.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the current study, these and other AEs were prospectively collected as predefined AEs of interest. Most of the predefined AEs were not observed in this study. Of those that were observed, most occurred in fewer than 5% of subjects. These rates are within the range of previous reports for similar procedures. Meta-analyses of studies on ADM-based breast reconstruction have reported pooled complication rates up to 10.9% for skin necrosis, 6.9% for seroma, 5.7% for infection, 1.3% for hematoma, and 0.6% for capsular contracture.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A recent 15-year, single-center retrospective review of cases found similar incidences of complications such as seroma (3.5%), hematoma (3.6%), and surgical-site infection (12.7%).<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A recognized limitation of these previous studies is the retrospective nature of most data on complication rate analyses. Although these comparisons are useful to provide context for the results of our study, no studies have directly compared SERI and ADMs.</p><p>A prospective study of breast reconstruction surgery in 128 subjects using 2 different ADMs assessed surgical outcomes for 2 years after surgery.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The complication rates for AEs commonly observed with surgical support devices were skin necrosis (19.6%), infection (15.1%), seroma (4.5%), hematoma (1%), and poor integration (13.9%). In the current study, complication rates for SERI were lower or in line with rates shown for the ADMs. In the current study, skin necrosis occurred in 8.4%, breast infection in 2.3%, seroma in 7.5%, hematoma in 4.2%, and minimal or no integration in 3.9% of breasts.</p><p>Over the 2-year follow-up in this study, rates of surgical complications of reoperations with concurrent explantation of SERI were generally low. Of the 161 breasts, 2 (1.2%) required SERI explantation; thus, SERI was retained in 98.8% of breasts at 2 years. This is lower than reported in the literature and is probably related to the fact that patients with increased likelihood of wound healing problems (such as uncontrolled diabetes, smokers, and immunosuppressed patients) were excluded from the per-protocol group that are the subjects of this study. The low rate of surgical reoperation for ptosis (n = 1) and pocket looseness (n = 2) along with results from 3D anatomical measurements support the effectiveness of SERI in maintaining soft-tissue stability in the lower breast. Investigator and subject satisfaction were consistently high in both year 1 and 2, and scaffold palpability and visibility were low at all time points. Overall, the safety profile, as shown by explantation and the incidence and severity of AEs, demonstrated a low incidence of complications over 2 years of postsurgical follow-up.</p><p>In-depth data on investigator and subject satisfaction are limited by use of a 1-question survey to assess subject satisfaction compared with more complex and validated instruments. The single-arm design of this study did not allow for direct comparisons. The subjective nature of AE characterization and lack of consensus terminology limit, to some degree, comparison with other findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>SERI provided durable, long-term soft-tissue support in this 2-stage breast reconstruction study. Through 2 postoperative years, SERI was associated with consistently high satisfaction, breast mound stability, and low complication rates. Breast anatomy measurements with 3D images demonstrated long-term soft-tissue stability of the lower breast mound.</p><p>SERI is an effective and safe option, with consistent performance over time and with long-term benefit for soft-tissue support and repair in 2-stage breast reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Writing and editorial assistance was provided to the authors by Emily H.
