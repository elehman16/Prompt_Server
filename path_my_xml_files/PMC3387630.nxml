Patients were randomly assigned to a "routine MH group" (MH was performed within 30 minutes after admission to the ICU and every 6 hours thereafter, and before tracheal extubation), or a "control group" (MH was performed only if perceptible (audible) sputum was present in the larger airways causing problems with mechanical ventilation, or if oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) dropped below 92%). The primary endpoint was the reduction of FRC from the day before cardiac surgery to one, three, and five days after tracheal extubation.

Alterations in mechanical properties of the lung lead to reductions in pulmonary compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] as well as vital and functional residual capacity (FRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in the first days after surgery. In addition, these patients remain sedated and are nursed in a supine position for several hours, while they are re-warmed and weaned from mechanically ventilation. This may reduce mucociliary transport, and as such retention of sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]</p><p>In our setting, a frequently performed intervention as part of airway management of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients is manual hyperinflation (MH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. MH aims at mobilization of retained airway secretions in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, thereby preventing atelectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. With MH the patient is disconnected from the mechanical ventilator, after which the lungs are inflated via a resuscitation bag. The technique consists of several factors, including the application of a larger than normal breath (to 150% of the tidal volume delivered by the mechanical ventilator), the use of a slow inspiratory flow rate (achieved by a slow compression of the resuscitation bag), an inspiratory pause (allowing complete distribution of the inflated air among all the ventilated lung parts) and a high peak expiratory flow achieved by the rapid release of the resuscitation bag. It is imaginable that a higher expiratory than inspiratory flow promotes the outwardly directed motion of airway secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although mobilization of airway secretions and prevention of sputum plugging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and improved alveolar recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] are cited as potential benefits of bagging, the evidence supporting its efficacy is lacking.</p><p>We hypothesized MH to benefit cardiac surgery patients. Specifically, we hypothesized MH maneuvers to attenuate the reduction of FRC, to prevent hypoxemia and to prevent atelectasis after cardiac surgery. To test this hypothesis we designed a randomized controlled trial to compare a strategy using frequent MH maneuvers with a strategy only using MH if clinically indicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and setting</title><p>This trial was conducted from February 2009 to March 2010 at the 28-bed intensive care unit (ICU) of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

During the surgical procedure, sufentanil (150 to 250 micrograms) was used as an analgesic, and sevoflurane plus propofol were used to maintain anesthesia. Morphine (5 mg) and midazolam (5 mg) were given at the end of the procedure. The ventilatory protocol consisted of volume-controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml/kg, at an inspired oxygen fraction of 0.40, positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cmH20, inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:2, and a respiratory rate adjusted to achieve normocapnia. Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed under moderate hypothermia (32&#x000b0;C), using a membrane oxygenator and non-pulsatile blood flow. At the end of anesthesia, all patients were transferred to the ICU with tracheal intubation.</p><p>The post-operative ICU protocol involved fluid resuscitation with normal saline and starch solutions, blood transfusion to maintain hemoglobin concentration &#x02265; 5.0 mmol/L, dopamine and norepinephrine in continuous infusion to achieve mean arterial blood pressure &#x02265; 70 mmHg, and dobutamine and/or enoximone to achieve a cardiac index &#x02265; 2.5 L/minute/m<sup>2 </sup>or a mixed venous oxygenation &#x02265; 60%.</p><p>Sedation and analgesics were titrated according to the ICU protocol for cardiac surgery patients. Neuromuscular blocking drugs were never used in the ICU. Propofol was given for sedation via continuous infusion until the core temperature was &#x02265; 36.0&#x000b0;C. Acetaminophen (4 g/day) was started in all patients. Attending ICU nurses assessed requirement for analgesia during the entire ICU stay. Morphine was given in boluses of 1 to 2 mg, and repeated as needed.</p><p>The trachea was extubated after achieving general tracheal extubation criteria (that is, responsive and cooperative, hemodynamic stability, chest tube drainage &#x0003c; 100 mL last hour, having a rectal temperature &#x0003e; 36.0&#x000b0;C, a respiratory frequency of 10 to 20 breaths/minute without machine-controlled breaths, FiO<sub>2 </sub>of 40%, and a pressure support level of 5 to 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for 30 minutes). After extubation oxygen was administered to the nostrils, typically 3 to 5 L/minute. If PaO<sub>2 </sub>was &#x0003e; 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa), administration of oxygen was stepwise reduced to 1 L/minute.</p><p>All patients were mobilized early, and had daily routine chest physiotherapy.

SpO<sub>2 </sub>was measured for 10 minutes while the patient was breathing room air. Measurements were terminated when SpO<sub>2 </sub>dropped to a level &#x02264;90%. The latter was defined as hypoxemia, and supplemental oxygen therapy was continued with its occurrence.</p><p>Chest radiographs were obtained in a sitting position, both pre-operative and on the third post-operative day. An independent radiologist blinded for randomization groups interpreted the chest radiographs. Each radiograph was evaluated for the presence of atelectasis, pulmonary infiltrate, extra-vascular lung fluid, pleural fluid, and pneumothorax. The presence of atelectasis was graded as: no atelectasis ("0"); plate or sub-segmental atelectasis ("1"); segmental atelectasis ("2"); or lobair atelectasis ("3"); for the purpose of this study, extent of other abnormalities was graded as: not present ("0"); mild ("1"); moderate ("2"); or severe ("3").</p></sec><sec><title>Other data collected</title><p>These included the number of MH maneuvers per patient; demographics (age, gender, body weight, body height, type of surgery), duration of anesthesia, anesthetics given to the patient during surgery, duration until tracheal extubation and length of stay in ICU and hospital, propofol and morphine dose in the ICU.</p></sec><sec><title>Power calculation</title><p>This trial was designed to detect a 300 mL difference in the post-operative FRC between the two study groups (10).

Its findings are in line with the results of other studies suggesting that MH may benefit patients after surgery. A previous randomized controlled trial showed early MH to improve PaO<sub>2 </sub>and static compliance in patients after myocardial re-vascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Also, MH reduced duration of mechanical ventilation in that trial. Another randomized controlled trial confirmed MH to improve oxygenation after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The reduction of FRC and the presence of atelectasis after cardiac surgery in our trial are consistent with findings in previously published studies of cardiac surgery patients. In one study deterioration of pulmonary function was frequently seen after cardiac surgery, with FRC reductions of 40 to 50% during the first 24 hours after tracheal extubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Also, incidence of signs of atelectasis on chest radiographs occurred in up to 90% of patients after cardiac surgery, and its presence was associated with a larger decrement in pulmonary function. In another study, atelectasis persisted for several days after surgery, was likely to be a focus of infection and could have been a contributing factor to pulmonary complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Plugging of airway secretions may lead to airway obstructions, thereby causing gas resorption distal to the obstructions in patients who are mechanically ventilated. Beneficial effects of MH on clearance of airway secretion have been demonstrated before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Higher expiratory than inspiratory flows generated with MH is the proposed mechanisms that contribute to clearance of airway secretions in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. In accordance, in our study endotracheal suction was performed more often in patients in the routine group compared to patients who received on demand MH, suggesting improved clearance of secretions necessitating airway suctioning. Unfortunately, the amount and appearance of eliminated secretions were not compared between groups, which could be seen as a limitation of our trial.</p><p>Our data suggest that MH could contribute to the recovery of collapsed lung areas after cardiac surgery. Delivering increased tidal volumes with an inspiratory pause via MH could generate transpulmonary pressures that could overcome, at least in part, alveolar collapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Earlier studies concluded that for complete reopening of collapsed lung tissue inspirations are required that reach airway pressures of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O which are maintained for eight to nine seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Certainly, MH is not capable of providing such pressures for longer than a few seconds. However, short-lasting natural occurring maneuvers, such as coughing and sighs, also result in recruiting of lung tissue.</p><p>Hypoxemia occurred in 23% of patients at Day 1 after tracheal extubation. These findings were in contrast to previous studies, which report up to 60% of patients with hypoxic periods within the first two days after tracheal extubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. There are several possible explanations as to why MH in our trial did not result in a greater difference in the presence of hypoxemia. One reason could be that oxygenation not only results from changes in (regional) ventilation but also from changes in (regional) perfusion. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may be responsible for maintaining the ventilation-perfusion ratio during localized alveolar hypoxia. Thus, if hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction works, oxygenation is preserved even during atelectasis. This could, at least in part, explain our findings. Another reason could have been the use of the pulse-oximeter to detect hypoxemia. Although the pulse-oximeter is an device with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the performance of the pulse-oximeter can be disrupted by several, including poor peripheral perfusion and peripheral vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We cannot exclude the possibility that the pulse-oximeter was not discriminative enough. It may be more plausible that our trial was insufficiently powered to detect a difference in hypoxemia between groups.</p><p>The incidence of signs of atelectasis on chest radiographs differed between groups. Indeed, significantly fewer patients in the routine MH group had radiographic signs of atelectasis. Reasons for atelectasis after cardiac surgery are multiple and include higher levels of intra-operative FiO<sub>2</sub>, type of surgery, obesity and post-operative pain. Absorption atelectasis during mechanical ventilation is most likely to occur when levels of FiO<sub>2 </sub>are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Indeed, higher levels of FiO<sub>2 </sub>during mechanical ventilation because of general anesthesia during surgery are associated with atelectasis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Another causative factor could be the harvesting of the internal mammary artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Use of the internal mammary artery graft has been found to be associated with a greater occurrence of post-operative atelectasis. Finally, post-operative pain leads to impairment of deep breaths and, therefore, could enhance formation of atelectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The differences between groups could not be explained by the above-mentioned factors, since they affected both groups to the same extent.</p><p>MH may cause a short-term state of hyperinflation and as such it can be questioned if MH is a safe procedure. We, and others, have studied possible adverse effects of MH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These studies suggested that MH, when performed under controlled conditions and/or performed by experienced and trained nurses, has negligible side-effects. In our previous experiences we neither registered side-effects prospectively nor did we evaluate patient comfort in the present trial.</p><p>We excluded patients who required prolonged post-operative mechanical ventilation (&#x0003e; 36 hours) from analysis of the primary endpoint, since it was impossible to measure FRC in these patients on the predefined time points. We explicitly intended to study post-extubation changes in FRC, since FRC is affected by intubation and mechanically ventilation, especially when positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied (as was the case for all these patients). The patients, who were excluded from the analysis of the primary endpoint, were analyzed for secondary endpoints. The analysis of the secondary endpoints supports the analysis of the primary endpoint.</p><p>We recognize several other limitations of our study. First, the bedside FRC measurement is not the most optimal technique for quantifying lung aeration. Frequent computer tomography scanning, considered the gold standard for quantifying lung aeration, however, could not be performed for obvious reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, recently bedside FRC measurement techniques have been evaluated with acceptable accuracy and repeatability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In addition, in another study changes in FRC after alveolar de- and re-recruitment could be easily assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A second limitation is that we did not measure MH parameters considered important for its efficacy. However, we recently showed that the implementation of MH guidelines, guided by individual feedback and educational meetings led to consistent MH performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A third limitation considers generalizability of our findings. Our study was a single-center trial, and practice may differ elsewhere. For instance, tracheal intubation times in our cohort are different from those reported elsewhere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>MH partly prevents reduction of FRC in patients after cardiac surgery in the first post-operative days.
