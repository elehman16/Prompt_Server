Toothbrushes may become heavily contaminated with microorganisms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and these microorganisms may originate not only from the oral cavity but also from the environment where the toothbrushes are stored.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] This contamination implicates in the possibility of reinfection of a patient by toothbrushes harboring pathogenic microorganisms. As early as 1920, Cobb <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] reported the toothbrush to be a cause of repeated infections of the mouth. Svanberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] found that toothbrushes can be heavily infected by mutans streptococci after 24 h. According to Glass <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] microorganisms not only adhere to and reproduce on used toothbrushes but also have the ability to transmit organisms responsible for both local and systemic diseases.</p><p>Procedures for the decontamination of toothbrushes would prevent the risks of reinfection or infection by other pathogenic microorganisms from the environment. Several bactericidal agents have been promoted to reduce the possibility of toothbrush bacterial contamination between uses. These include the use of chlorhexidine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Brushtox,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and several dentifrices.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] While all these have shown varying degrees of efficacy, none are widely used as a home-based application. A possible reason for the noncompliance with these methods is that they are time consuming and may result in unwanted product residues.</p><p>Recently, few studies indicated that the use of microwave[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and ultraviolet (UV) light[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] is the most effective household method to sanitize the toothbrushes after contamination. Furthermore, due to the ease of use, these techniques may increase compliance in toothbrush bacterial decontamination. However, the extent of bacterial decontamination using the microwave and UV light has not been determined in a clinical setting. Therefore, the present study was designed as an investigator-blinded, controlled, microbiological study to compare the efficacy of microwave and UV light in decreasing toothbrush bacterial contamination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty male dental graduates residing in a common hostel (with a common source of water for daily use), with at least 28 teeth and age ranging from 22 to 28 years (mean age 25 &#x000b1; 2.6 years) were enrolled into this study. A prior written informed consent was taken from all included subjects. The study was approved by the ethical committee at JSS University, Mysore.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included subjects in good general health, who were able to give informed consent and comply with the study protocol, having at least 14 natural teeth per arch, and brushing their teeth twice daily. Exclusion criteria included the clinical evidence of gross caries or periodontal disease, the presence of systemic diseases or conditions that would affect the oral cavity such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, use of any medications associated with xerostomia or any antibiotic therapy within 90 days prior to the start of the study protocol.</p><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to either control (<italic>n</italic> = 10; group 3) or experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 20) groups. Experimental group comprised the microwave group (<italic>n</italic> = 10; group 1) and the UV group (<italic>n</italic> = 10; group 2). Before the start of the study, each subject was given a new, identical multitufted toothbrush with soft nylon tufts (Ajay Quest<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Toothbrush, Raghav Lifestyle Products, New Delhi, India) with a tube of toothpaste (Colgate TOTAL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Toothpaste, Colgate-Palmolive India Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India). Two unused toothbrushes (control) were cultured to check for any microbial growth in packed toothbrushes before starting the study. Furthermore, the toothbrush rinsing water from the common tank intended to be used was also subjected to a microbial check before the start of the study. The study was conducted in three phases that included contamination procedures including bacterial culture, sanitization procedures, and postsanitization evaluation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Contamination procedure</title><p>Subjects were trained and/or instructed to use the standardized &#x0201c;modified Bass technique&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] for brushing their teeth for 3 min, twice daily for 1 week. Each subject was instructed to rinse the used toothbrush under running tap water without mechanical manipulation for at least 30 s. Subjects were also instructed to keep their toothbrushes in their living room within the provided aerated box at room temperature. After 1 week of use, each toothbrush was collected in a sterile paper bag and sent to the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) laboratory, Mysore, within 4 h after collection in the morning. The toothbrushes were promptly delivered to the laboratory for bacterial extraction and cultivation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Bacterial culture</title><p>A standard bacterial culture method was followed in the study. Various selective and nonselective media used in the study included trypticase soy agar for total counts, Mitis Salivarius agar for total streptococci, Mitis Salivarius agar with 2 IU/ml of bacitracin for mutans streptococci, MacConkey agar with 1% lactosec for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other coliforms, and Rogosa SL agar for lactobacilli. For bacterial extraction, the toothbrushes were individually placed in prelabeled, sterile, 50-ml centrifuge tubes containing 10 ml of the trypticase soy broth (TSB) to immerse the bristles, then vortexed vigorously for 1 min, squeezed against the side of the tube to drain, rinsed with 5 ml TSB, and drained again. A series of undiluted and 10-fold dilutions of each sample were prepared and plated onto the surface of selective and nonselective media. A duplicate series of plates was then incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02013;4 days, until colony formation was visible. The number of colonies, measured as colony-forming units (CFUs), was counted using a colony counter.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sanitization procedure</title><p>A new set of standardized toothbrush was once again given to each subject and subjects were instructed to use it for one more week following the same instructions as given earlier. After 1-week usage, the toothbrushes were once again collected and subjected to sanitization procedures. The experimental group toothbrushes were randomly assigned to either the UV light or microwave group. Toothbrushes from the UV light group were sanitized by placing the brush in the UV light toothbrush sanitizer (Violight<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tooth brush sanitizer, Violight Inc., India). Sanitization was carried out by placing the brush in the receptacle and exposing the head for 12 min to UV radiation (manufacturer's recommendation, 6 min). Toothbrushes from the microwave group were sanitized by placing the brush in a microwave oven (2450 MHz; Kenstar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> microwave oven, Kenstar Kitchen Appliances India Limited, Mumbai). The wet brush was placed on the revolving table along with a glass of distilled water to protect the magnetron. The brush was subjected to microwave radiation at the maximum setting for 5 min. The toothbrushes from the control group were not sanitized.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Postsanitization evaluation</title><p>Once again each toothbrush belonging to different groups was collected in a sterile paper bag and sent to the laboratory for further microbial culture and colony count procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data obtained for all the microbial counts were log transformed to normalize their distributions prior to analysis. Logs of the total bacterial count (log CFU) after toothbrush contamination and decontamination were compared and analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey's <italic>post hoc</italic> procedure for multiple comparisons, and paired <italic>t</italic>-test for the effect of the pre and postsanitization procedure on the microbial count in specific groups. All values were expressed as means and standard deviations. Differences were considered significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty subjects with an age ranging from 22 to 28 years (mean age 25 &#x000b1; 2.6 years) were enrolled in this study. All the subjects were male and shared the common living environment (common hostel) for more than 4 years. No ethnic/race discrepancy was present between all the included subjects. All the subjects were able to return their toothbrushes on days 7 and 14 in sealed labeled bags as instructed. Bacteria were extracted from the toothbrushes and used to determine CFUs. Unused toothbrushes cultured before the start of the study resulted in negative culture. Moreover, no bacterial growth was observed on culturing the rinsing water obtained from the common tank.

The result outcome revealed that the contaminated toothbrushes harbored an increased number of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria species. This finding is in accordance with the results of previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] that indicated that an actual risk of recolonization exists after each brushing. In the recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the interrelationship between contaminated toothbrushes and systemic reinfections. Several studies have also stressed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] on the role of contaminated toothbrushes and its causation in systemic infections. In this regard, Brook and Gober suggested that contaminated toothbrushes contributed to the persistence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in the oropharynx and to the failure of penicillin therapy in some cases of pharyngotonsillitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In another study, Fischer pointed to a relationship between contaminated toothbrushes and pharyngitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Significant bacteremia has also been reported after tooth brushing, especially in patients with severe periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Therefore, a concern has been raised that the microbial load on toothbrushes might have a significant impact in periodontal patients under therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Discussions on the modern toothbrushes have suggested the problem of toothbrush construction as a factor of toothbrush contamination. The nylon, multitufted toothbrush has been cited for its design of tufts set too closely to accommodate easy cleaning. The filaments are collected into bundles, bent in half with a metal anchor in the center, and driven into premolded holes in the toothbrush head at a high speed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In toothbrushes, the bristles can harbor inherent microorganisms, further increasing the bacterial contamination.</p><p>Several studies have suggested the need for toothbrush disinfection to reduce the number of microorganisms on the bristles using different methods, including UV radiation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] microwave irradiation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] boiling water, and chemical agents,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] such as Listerine, Plax, Cepacol, and chlorhexidine. In addition, some authors have also attempted to incorporate antimicrobial agents, such as silver,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] chlorhexidine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] and others to the toothbrush bristles as a coating layer during the manufacturing process. Despite evidence demonstrating that chemical rinses and dentifrices can reduce the total bacterial load on a toothbrush, these methods are not widely used. Therefore, recently, Devine <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] raised a need of disinfection methods that are rapidly effective, cost-effective, nontoxic, and can be easily implemented.</p><p>The present study was mainly sought to compare two sanitization techniques used for the decontamination procedure. Our result showed that there was a significant reduction in microbial contamination in both microwave and UV groups compared to the control group. Furthermore, our results also showed a significant reduction in the microbial count in the microwave group when compared with the UV group. Our results confirm the findings of Chibebe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] where previously contaminated toothbrushes when exposed to microwave irradiation at 2450 MHz were reported to get inactivated by the action of microwave. A possible explanation for the effect of microwave irradiation upon formed microbial assemblage on brushes can be validated by the fact that many bacterial species are responsible for biofilm formation on different surfaces like toothbrushes, and microwave irradiation can disrupt the biofilm structure. Data suggest that the destruction of microorganisms by microwave is mainly due to a thermal effect of microwave exposure on the microorganism cellular content resulting in cell lysis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Another general indication for heat damage is the cell membrane rupture resulting in a leakage of nucleic acid and protein from cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In this context, some studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] have reported that microwave-injured cells often release ninhydrin-positive material, purines, and pyrimidines into a suspension. The presence of these materials in a suspension, in previous studies, has demonstrated the possibility of damage to cells by microwave at the membrane level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the UV radiation group showed a significant differential reduction in the microbial count compared to the control group. However, the microbial count did not significantly reduce as compared to the microwave irradiation group. Although we exposed toothbrushes for 12 min to UV radiation (6 min, manufacturer's specification), the result was not significant as compared to microwave irradiation. Previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] have revealed that the longer exposure to UV light is necessary to ensure a complete inactivation of all microorganisms. The long exposure of UV light inactivates microorganisms by damaging the DNA and disrupting the chemical bonds that hold the atoms of DNA together in the microorganism. If the damage is severe enough, the bacteria cannot repair the damage and are inactivated. However, despite long exposure, a previous literature review[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] has questioned the potential of low-intensity UV radiation in microbial deactivation, and the authors concluded that low-intensity UV rays are not effective against certain microbes and molds. Furthermore, tightly packed bristles and other areas are not in direct exposure and have no chance of disinfection. In the present study, these factors might be the reason for the UV radiation to be less efficient in toothbrush sanitization compared to microwave irradiation.</p><p>In contrast to our results, Boylan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] have reported that a UV light toothbrush holder can effectively reduce an average of 86% total cultivatable bacteria on a toothbrush compared to controls. Our result is not in agreement with this result as our result showed only 42% reduction in the microbial count after the UV sanitization procedure. Therefore, further microbial studies are required to verify the efficacy of the UV light toothbrush holder in the reduction of the microbial content from contaminated toothbrushes.</p><p>In the present study, we instructed all the subjects to store their toothbrushes at room temperature in the provided aerated box when not in use. Data suggest that storage conditions of toothbrushes are an important factor for bacterial survival. Dayoub <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] and Meier <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] reported that the number of microorganisms in the toothbrushes kept under aerated conditions was lower than that in toothbrushes stored in plastic bags. Several authors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] have reported that bacterial contamination can be reduced by washing toothbrushes after use, and drying under aerated conditions. Likewise Caudry <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and Mehta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] have also reported that a wet environment increases bacterial growth and cross-contamination. Therefore, as time increases between one tooth brushing and another, more microorganism development can occur in the toothbrushes stored in a wet/moisture environment.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that significant microbial colonization was present after 1 week of repeated use of toothbrushes. However, data suggest that the time necessary for colonization is contradictory varying from 1 to 30 days.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] According to Cesco <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] the colonization on toothbrushes by mutans streptococci occurs in a short time period, since after a single tooth brushing, they found the development of the microorganism in 24% of the cases. Svanberg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] reported the presence of mutans streptococci on toothbrushes after 3 days and colonization by mutans streptococci was observed on bristles after five consecutive days of toothbrush use. Our study also showed similar findings where cultivatable microorganisms were present on the bristles after a short-term (1 week) usage with aerated storage conditions.</p><p>Our results suggested that microwave irradiation is the better option for the sanitization of tooth brushes as compared to UV radiation. However, further studies are required for determining the optimum temperature and duration for the complete eradication of the organisms and spores, thereby achieving sterilization instead of sanitization. Moreover, the duration of UV sanitization also needs to be reassessed to achieve optimum results. Our results clearly suggest that there is a definite contamination of the toothbrushes after use; hence need arises for either improving sanitization measures or frequent changes of toothbrushes especially after any infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The evidence presented in this study suggests that microwave irradiation is an effective disinfectant agent for the microbiota present on the toothbrushes.
