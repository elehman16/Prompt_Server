These interventions should take place early in childhood. In fact, the need for early intervention to promote cardiovascular health in children is recognized(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>) because children exhibit risk factors for CVD that often persist into adulthood. Many researchers recommend a population approach to improve cardiovascular health behaviors in children.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>) This can be done through teaching and other interventions provided to all children in a variety of settings such as schools and other community locations.</p><p>Many school-based interventions to promote healthy lifestyles were implemented all over the world. However, currently, there are limited quality data on the effectiveness of such programs. Thus, generalizable conclusions cannot be drawn.</p><p>At the inception of this study, there had been no school-based preventive work undertaken in Tunisia and even in North Africa, which made it an important pilot study.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a school cardiovascular disease risk factors prevention program on the knowledge and intentions of pupils aged 12-16 in Sousse, Tunisia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>This study adopted a pre-post quasi-experimental design, and divided the subjects into two groups. The intervention group was subject to classroom-based cardiovascular disease risk factors prevention curriculum, while the control group received no intervention. One month before the intervention began, and, separately, a month after it ended, the intervention group and the control group were tested, so that effects of the intervention could be ascertained.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Population</title><p>The study concerned pupils of secondary public schools in Sousse, Tunisia, aged 12-16. Two districts from the city of Sousse (Sousse Jawhara, Sousse Riadh) served, respectively, for the intervention and control groups. The intervention was implemented in two public schools: Ezzahra and Khzema Ouest and concerned the totality of the pupils (total number = 1965). Two control public schools were selected: Ezzouhour and Essalem (total number = 1737). The selection of schools was based on age, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics. It was also based on the students' number in each school.</p><p>The pre- and post-evaluations were applied to a representative sample in each secondary school, which was based on these parameters:</p><p>&#x003b1; = 5%;</p><p>&#x003b2;= 20% so the power of the study was 80%.</p><p>An increase of 10% in the knowledge of the schoolchildren after the intervention study about the healthy nutrition, the benefit of physical activity, and the consequences of smoking habit.</p><p>The calculated minimal sample size was 958 students in each group. We majored this number by 10%, considering the possible dropped out, so we obtained 1054 students in each group, i.e. 30 classes of 35 students in each group. As some classes contained less than 35 students, we included more than 30 classes per group (intervention: 39, control: 37) through a stratified and proportional sampling in each secondary school.</p><p>Thus, the final number of students who participated to the first evaluation was 2338.</p><p>At the second evaluation at the end of the year, 138 students were dropped out (intervention: 58, control: 80). They either changed from one class to another, one college to another, or were absent from class during the final evaluation. So, 2200 students participated effectively to the pre- and post-evaluations [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>School-based intervention sample to promote healthy lifestyles in Sousse, Tunisia, 2007</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCM-35-94-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>The overall intervention program lasted for a school year and incorporated educative actions concerning the main CVD risk factors: Tobacco use, physical activity, and healthy diet.</p><p>Interventions were delivered by team of the project with the collaboration of teachers and school doctors.

This is a valuable pilot study for Tunisia and North Africa that has used the school setting in an innovative way to promote healthy lifestyles and to prevent cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p>After 1 year of intervention, the program was found to be acceptable to school administrators, teachers, parents, and children.</p><p>The findings of this study suggest that school-based intervention can change lifestyle knowledge and intention in a short period, but the behavior effect would be more difficult to change particularly in smoking behavior. Small net changes in the favorable direction were observed for physical activity and smoking. So, intervention programs in schools may, after sufficient duration, prove to be effective in reducing the population risk for the future development of chronic disease.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>) In fact, the primary prevention of chronic disease should begin in childhood, but the effect of such programs on knowledge precedes behaviors.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>) Kreuter and <italic>et al.</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>) think that attempts to establish immediate behavior change as goals of school programs would be naive. Federal and state initiatives are needed to support the necessary cost-benefit studies and the long-term evaluations required for policy decisions concerning school health education programs. Local support is adequate to perform short-term studies of impact on knowledge and skills of specific health education programs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>)</p><p>In the San Diego Family Health Project for example(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>) diet changed somewhat, but activity changed only minimally.</p><p>An improvement concerning knowledge, behaviors, and intentions was also seen in the control group but was less than in the intervention one. Other studies with significant effects have involved parents in the intervention.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>) We chose to test a simpler and more practical model and thus limited the interventions to the school day and to children only.</p><p>A true experimental design would have a number of communities allocated randomly into intervention and control ones. This is seldom possible, as it may not comply with the basic idea of comprehensive community interventions. Instead, quasi-experimental designs have been often used with a reference community or with the national change as the comparator.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>)</p><p>If these findings can be replicated, the widespread implementation of such programs has the potential to reduce the population risk for the future development of the nation's leading causes of premature mortality.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>)</p><p>An evaluative study concluded that school-based health education programs have three important roles in community health promotion. First, the provision of a fundamental understanding of health and disease concepts to large segments of the population. Secondly, the reinforcement of positive health attitudes, and thirdly, the alteration of concurrent health behaviors for significant health problems.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>)</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study resulted in substantial improvements concerning knowledge, behaviors, and intentions in the intervention group. Because there is evidence that risk factors continue into adulthood, it is logical to assume that an intervention that reduces mean levels of risk factors in a majority of the children, if carried out for a longer period of time, could eventually have an impact on mortality rates and morbidity. A more elaborate level of action consists in realizing an integrated community-based program of non-communicable disease prevention.
