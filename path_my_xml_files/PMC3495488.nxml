Infections of the lower respiratory tract and peritoneal cavity predominated accounting for 133 (62.7%) and 58 (27.4%) cases respectively. sepsis/ bacteraemia/ FUO accounted for 21 (9.9%) cases.</p><p>Patients were clinically evaluated as satisfactory (completely cured or improved) or unsatisfactory (unchanged or worse).</p><p>In an intention-to-treat analysis overall, satisfactory response rates were 84.0% (84 of 100 patients) in the MEM group and 76.8% (76 of 99 patients) in the IMI group. The difference (MEM-IMI) is 7.23%, the 95% CI is -3.76% to 18.22% and the corresponding <italic>P</italic>-value is 0.199. The satisfactory bacteriological responses were 72.8% (67 of 92 patients) in the MEM group and 69.3% (61 of 88 patients) in the IM1 group. The difference (MEM-IMI) is 3.51%, the 95% CI is -9.74 to 16.75 and the corresponding <italic>P</italic>-value is 0.604. The causative organisms were mainly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 45) and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 28). The clinically satisfactory response rates for the specific sites were 79.4% (MEM) and 75.0% (IMI) for the lower respiratory tract infections, 96.0% (MEM) and 83.9% (IMI) for the intra-abdominal infections and 85.7% (MEM) and 66.7% (IMI) for the systemic infections. </p><p>Both drugs were well tolerated with adverse events considered to be related to the study drug reported for four (3.7%) of 107 patients in the MEM group and for three (2.9%) of 105 patients in the IMI group. No drug-related nausea and vomiting were reported in either group but one drug-related seizure was reported in the IMI group.</p><p>In conclusion MEM is clinically and bacteriologically at least as effective as IMI for the treatment of serious bacterial infections in ICU patients and is well tolerated.</p></sec></body></article>
