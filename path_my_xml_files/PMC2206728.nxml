AIs reduce the plasma estrogen concentration by suppressing peripheral estrogen synthesis and might also suppress estrogen synthesized locally by aromatase in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Because osteoporosis and the concomitant fracture risk are potentially serious adverse effects of AIs, a better understanding of their effects on bone is necessary.</p><p>Two classes of AIs, nonsteroidal and steroidal, are currently used in the treatment of breast cancer patients. After 1 year of treatment, the nonsteroidal AI anastrozole was reported to increase markers of bone turnover by 12.2&#x02013;20.8% in postmenopausal women who had early breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the same study, after 1 and 2 years, anastrozole induced decreases of 2.6% and 4.0%, respectively, in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and 1.7% and 3.2%, respectively, in total hip BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The nonsteroidal AI letrozole has similar effects. In a study in healthy late-postmenopausal women, letrozole increased markers of bone turnover by 15% after 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and in a similar study, there was a 25% increase in a marker of bone resorption after 3 months of letrozole treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Preliminary results from a large, multicenter, open-label trial demonstrated that after 1 year of treatment with letrozole, lumbar spine and total hip BMDs decreased by 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In a preclinical model, the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane showed no detrimental effects on markers of bone turnover or BMD. Moreover, exemestane was protective against bone loss that occurred following ovariectomy in rats, whereas letrozole was not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the clinical setting, postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated using exemestane (25 mg daily) or placebo for 2 years experienced a mean annual bone loss of 2.2% vs 1.8% (<italic>P </italic>= 0.57), respectively, in the lumbar spine and 2.7% vs 1.5% (<italic>P </italic>= 0.024), respectively, in the femoral neck. Exemestane also significantly increased levels of biomarkers for bone resorption and formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Because of the lack of any significant difference in the change in BMD in the lumbar spine, an area with frequent compression fractures, the clinical implication of a 1.2% (90% confidence interval (CI), 0.3&#x02013;2.1%) difference in femoral neck BMD between the exemestane-treated group and the placebo group has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although these data support the possibility that exemestane might be associated with an attenuation of bone loss, they do not fully resolve questions regarding the role or mechanism of exemestane in bone turnover.</p><p>Other clinical studies have also reported unfavorable bone effects of exemestane, anastrozole, and letrozole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], including an increased risk of fractures using anastrozole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and exemestane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] compared with tamoxifen. However, the prior administration of tamoxifen &#x02013; which is bone protective &#x02013; in several of these studies makes interpretation of these findings difficult.</p><p>To date, there are no comparative data on the effects of the different AIs on bone. This study was conducted to compare the effects of the steroidal AI exemestane with the nonsteroidal AIs anastrozole and letrozole or placebo on serum and urine levels of biomarkers of bone turnover in healthy postmenopausal women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory study investigated the effect of low plasma estrogen levels, induced by AIs, on markers of bone turnover in 80 healthy postmenopausal women during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment using exemestane, letrozole, anastrozole, or placebo. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was conducted at two sites in Germany in accordance with the ethical principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><sec><title>Patient selection and treatment</title><p>Healthy postmenopausal volunteers between 50 and 75 years of age were enrolled.

All subjects had a normal BMD for their age, as confirmed by quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS).</p><p>Exclusion criteria included current or previous use of bisphosphonates or any other drug known to affect bone metabolism (including hormone-replacement therapy and statins) within 1 month before study entry, use of any medication within 2 weeks or five half-lives of the medication (whichever was longer) before study entry, subclinical hyperthyroidism or other metabolic disorder, any form of osteoporosis (as measured by BMD or QUS testing), and a history of bilateral oophorectomy.</p><p>Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 24 weeks of treatment with anastrozole (1 mg), exemestane (25 mg), letrozole (2.5 mg), or placebo. Placebo tablets were identical in appearance to exemestane. Each treatment was administered orally, once daily after breakfast.

Subjects were instructed to consume nothing by mouth after midnight on the day before scheduled visits.</p><p>Serum was harvested from blood samples, which were drawn in the morning before drug dosing and after an overnight fast. Second-void urine samples were collected in the morning before dosing and after an overnight fast. Serum, plasma, and urine samples were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until processed.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>All assays were performed in centralized laboratories under blinded conditions.

U-CTx and U-NTx levels were adjusted for renal function according to the level of urinary creatinine. Concentrations of BAP, CTx, PINP, and lipids were measured in serum samples. Estrogen levels were measured in plasma. The levels of bone-turnover markers, lipids, and estrogens were evaluated by radioimmunoassay, ELISA, or automated tests using commercially available kits as specified by the manufacturers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The sample size was calculated according to an effect size, defined as the expected difference in group means to the within-group standard deviation. A sample size of 20 within each of the four treatment groups was calculated to have an 80% power to detect an approximate effect size of 0.9 at the 0.05 level. The current analysis was performed in the evaluable population, which included all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication, had evaluable data from the baseline and week 12 assessments at least, and maintained suppression of estrogen throughout the study.</p><p>Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, median, and range for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variables, were used for all demographics, baseline characteristics, and pretreatment conditions, as appropriate. Percentage change from baseline in bone-turnover markers and lipid profiles and percentage of baseline estrogen concentrations were also summarized by assessment time and treatment arm using descriptive statistics. A one-way analysis of variance model was used to test baseline and demographic characteristics for homogeneity of the populations in each of the four treatment groups. The Kruskall&#x02013;Wallis test was used to exclude differences in the baseline values of bone-turnover markers, plasma estrogen concentrations, and lipid profiles between the three active treatment groups and compare the percentage change in these parameters from baseline. Values reported as below the limit of quantification for markers of bone turnover (&#x0003c;2 for creatinine and &#x02264;28 for U-NTx) were treated as missing data.</p><p>The baseline-adjusted AUC (henceforth referred to as AUC for weeks 0&#x02013;12 and 0&#x02013;24 was calculated for all bone-turnover markers to evaluate accumulated changes in bone turnover over time, rather than at discrete time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The AUC was calculated as follows, using BAP as an example: the baseline-adjusted AUC<sub>0-t week </sub>was calculated as the AUC<sub>BAP-<italic>t</italic>* </sub>baseline concentration of BAP, where <italic>t </italic>= 12 or 24 weeks. The AUC<sub>BAP(0-t) </sub>was then calculated by summing the partial AUCs using the trapezoidal rule.

A total of 84 subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups and included in the safety evaluation. All randomized subjects received at least one dose of study medication. Estrogen and lipid levels were reported in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (<italic>n </italic>= 79), which excluded five subjects who discontinued treatment early owing to withdrawal of consent (one anastrozole- and two exemestane-treated subjects) and adverse events (one placebo- and one anastrozole-treated subject). Estrogen levels were not suppressed in five subjects (one exemestane-, one letrozole-, and three anastrozole-treated subjects). Estrogen levels returned to baseline values after initial suppression to below the limit of quantification in two additional subjects who were presumed to be noncompliant. Because the intent of the study was to assess differences among AIs in the presence of low plasma levels of estrogen, these subjects were excluded from the bone-marker analyses; therefore, the evaluable population for bone-marker data from baseline comprised 74 subjects. Bone-marker data for the two additional subjects were excluded from the analysis from the time the estrogen levels increased (weeks 16 and 20, respectively).

Despite these encouraging results, the long-term clinical impact of AIs must be established because the aromatase enzyme has an important role in numerous normal physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A key role of aromatase is local production of estrogens, which are essential for the maintenance of bone integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. There are, therefore, two important questions that must be addressed, as follows: will AIs accelerate the negative skeletal balance associated with the menopause; and if so, to what extent? Although several relatively short-term clinical studies suggest that AIs accelerate bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], to date there have been no comparative clinical studies. Because preclinical data suggest that the steroidal AI exemestane might have different effects on bone compared with the nonsteroidal AIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], this study was designed to assess the effects of the different AIs by evaluating changes in bone biomarkers after short-term treatment (24 weeks).</p><p>This short-term study demonstrates differential effects of the AIs evaluated on bone-turnover markers. For the primary end point of the effect on markers of bone turnover at 24 weeks, markers of bone resorption were increased in all treatment groups, including placebo, but the magnitude of increase was noticeably lower for anastrozole compared with the other groups. Measures of bone resorption (that is to say, S-CTx and U-CTx) were increased to the greatest extent by letrozole; however, the 95% CIs overlapped between all groups. By contrast, exemestane was the only AI to increase the median percentage change from baseline to week 24 for both PINP and BAP concentrations. Although the PINP concentration was increased from baseline by approximately 6% in all other groups, the BAP concentration decreased from baseline or remained essentially unchanged. A retrospective statistical comparison of the changes in PINP levels showed a statistically greater increase for exemestane treatment compared with the other AIs or placebo at week 24, but this statistical comparison must be interpreted in light of its retrospective nature and the potential lack of sufficient power of this small study.</p><p>Following discontinuation of treatment at 24 weeks, the levels of markers of bone resorption (S-CTx and U-CTx) remained elevated or continued to increase from baseline to week 36 in patients receiving letrozole, anastrozole, or placebo; by contrast, the levels of markers of bone resorption tended to decline towards baseline at week 36 following discontinuation of exemestane at week 24. The effect of exemestane withdrawal for 3 and 6 months has been studied in postmenopausal women following 2 years' treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. After exemestane withdrawal, bone-resorption markers returned to, or below, baseline values within 6 months, with the exception of the S-CTx concentration. For markers of bone formation (for example, BAP, PINP, and osteocalcin), a successive decrease in values at 3 and 6 months after terminating therapy was recorded; however, the levels of all markers of bone formation remained elevated at 6 months compared with the baseline value. The results of the current study, described after 12 weeks of exemestane withdrawal, are consistent with these observations. These findings could be further assessed by correlating BMD measurements and fracture data to changes in bone biomarkers in a large confirmatory trial.</p><p>The primary benefit of the use of biochemical markers is their ability to reflect small changes in bone formation or resorption before such changes are detectable radiologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although bone-turnover data are typically reported at discrete time points, we suggest that assessing data over time using the AUC method might be more illustrative of the true impact of interventions. This technique avoids the oversimplification associated with reporting a value at a single point in time, which might lead to incorrect inferences. Instead, the AUC provides a view of the whole spectrum of values because results are depicted over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the data gathered by the AUC analysis demonstrate that exemestane might have a greater effect on bone formation compared with the nonsteroidal AIs, particularly PINP levels. By contrast, letrozole, the more potent of the two nonsteroidal agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], demonstrated the greatest impact on bone resorption, which continued to be significantly elevated 3 months after discontinuation of treatment. Thus, this short-term study suggests there are differences between steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs; however, the results from this exploratory, short-term study must be replicated by a larger controlled trial of longer duration.</p><p>The basis for the hypothesized difference in the effects of nonsteroidal AIs and the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane is the steroidal structure of exemestane and the androgenic activity of its primary metabolite, 17-hydroexemestane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both androgens and estrogens have a role in skeletal development and maintenance in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, estrogens reduce bone resorption, whereas androgens stimulate bone formation and are thought to be effective in reducing fracture risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In fact, regardless of estrogen status, perimenopausal women with higher androgen concentrations have a slower rate of bone loss compared with women who have lower concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and administration of low doses of oral androgen in combination with estrogen results in higher concentrations of bone-formation markers than treatment with estrogen alone in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. On the basis of its pharmacologic characteristics, these findings support the hypothesis that exemestane might have differential effects on bone compared with nonsteroidal AIs.</p><p>When the bone-marker data were analyzed for the mITT population (data not shown), the results were similar to those observed in the evaluable population. The mITT population included all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had baseline and week 12 assessments at least. Therefore, unlike the evaluable population, the mITT population included the five patients who did not demonstrate estrogen suppression following treatment with an AI. Because third-generation AIs provide consistent suppression of estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women, it is our impression that these five subjects had poor or inconsistent compliance and were, therefore, not evaluable for the purpose of our study because our analysis was designed to demonstrate the potentially unique response of bone biomarkers to AIs in the presence of effective suppression of estrogens.</p><p>We did not report the BMD or fracture rate because of the relatively short duration of our study. BMD is directly related to fracture risk and, therefore, often used to diagnose osteoporosis. However, the BMD must be monitored for several years, not months, to be useful for determination of fracture risk, and changes in BMD do not correlate linearly to fracture risk reduction. Moreover, BMD is only one factor contributing to bone strength and fracture risk. Bone strength is determined by bone quantity (that is to say, density and size) and bone quality (that is to say, microarchitecture and macroarchitecture, material properties, and turnover) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In mechanical terms, the load-bearing capacity or quality of bone is determined by ultimate force (strength), resilience, stiffness, and toughness, and the overall quality of bone is affected by the rate of bone turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although BMD is considered a good diagnostic tool for identifying osteoporosis in untreated patients, emerging data suggest that biochemical markers of bone turnover might also be accurate predictors of treatment-induced bone changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Ultimately, adverse effects on bone metabolism are among the most serious concerns when considering the long-term use of AIs in postmenopausal women. Although measures such as exercise, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonate administration are being used to alleviate this risk, a finding that exemestane might be superior to other third-generation AIs, in terms of its effects on bone metabolism, could have clinical significance. For this reason, two large ongoing trials are of particular interest: the CAN-NCIC-MA27 study and its companion study, evaluating BMD in postmenopausal women who have primary breast cancer that is treated using exemestane or anastrozole, and the Femara Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation study, a comparison of letrozole with anastrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive and node-positive breast cancer. These studies should help determine the relative differences in the risk of bone loss with long-term use of the different AIs.</p><p>Our data support the hypothesis that a mild androgenic effect on bone can be exerted by the steroidal AI exemestane. Our study shows a qualitative difference in the concentration of the bone-formation marker PINP in a short-term, 24-week treatment period, but it involved a small number of women and these findings need confirmation by a larger trial. It is also important to note that all AIs are associated with bone loss, and only long-term comparative clinical studies monitoring fracture outcome will determine the relative effects of the different AIs on fracture risk. Changes in the levels of bone-resorption markers are more sensitive in predicting subsequent fracture risk than changes in the levels of bone-formation markers, thus limiting the interpretation of our short-term findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>However, because androgens affect bone quality and quantity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the use of surrogate markers, such as BMD, to assess bone effects of AIs might not provide a clear indication of comparative fracture risk. Bone-quality studies using bone biopsies and histomorphometry might prove valuable for assessing the early effects of exemestane on bone quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In recent years, use of the third-generation AIs anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane has resulted in improved clinical outcomes for postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer. However, because of their estrogen-lowering effect, AIs might increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in some patients. Preclinical studies have suggested that exemestane (a steroidal aromatase inactivator) might have differential effects on bone compared with the nonsteroidal AIs anastrozole and letrozole. In our study, exemestane was the only AI that significantly increased serum levels of PINP, a marker of bone formation, at 24 weeks in healthy postmenopausal women. These data need confirmation by a larger comparative trial. Whether these observations correlate to a decreased relative risk of osteoporosis and fractures compared with nonsteroidal AIs in patients receiving long-term adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer requires further study.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>AI = aromatase inhibitor; AUC = area under the curve; BAP = bone alkaline phosphatase; BMD = bone mineral density; CI = confidence interval; CTx = C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I; E<sub>1 </sub>= estrone; E<sub>1</sub>S = estrone sulfate; E<sub>2 </sub>= estradiol; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HPLC = high-performance liquid chromatography; mITT = modified intent to treat; NCI CTC = National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria; NTx = N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; PINP = procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide; QUS = quantitative ultrasonometry; S-CTx = serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; U-CTx = urine-adjusted urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; U-NTx = urine-adjusted urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>PEG has served as a speaker for, and received advisory honoraria from, Novartis, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca.
