Here, we report 2 post hoc pooled analyses assessing the antihypertensive effect of amlodipine in patients who had not responded to 5 mg and were uptitrated to 10 mg. The first analysis assessed subgroups of patients aged either younger than 55 years or 55 years or older and the second analysis pooled all patients irrespective of age. Of 706 patients in the age-related analysis, a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure from baseline was observed {for younger than 55 years [N = 253]: systolic blood pressure = &#x02212;12.8 [standard error (SE) = 0.90] mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure = &#x02212;8.0 [SE = 0.55] mm Hg; for 55 years or older [N = 453]: systolic blood pressure = &#x02212;12.1 [SE = 0.66] mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure = &#x02212;6.7 [SE = 0.39] mm Hg; all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001}. In total, 45.8% and 39.3% of patients aged younger than 55 and 55 years or older, respectively, achieved their blood pressure goals. Adverse events were experienced by 62 (24.5%) patients aged younger than 55 years and 136 (30.0%) patients aged 55 years or older. Similar efficacy and safety results were seen in the all patient pooled analysis. Titration of amlodipine from 5 mg to 10 mg significantly decreased blood pressure in older hypertensive patients, which is clinically relevant because increased age is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular events.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>amlodipine</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>blood pressure</kwd><kwd>blood pressure variability</kwd><kwd>age</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>High blood pressure (&#x02265;140/90 mm Hg) is a serious public health care problem and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The incidence of hypertension increases with age affecting approximately 30%&#x02013;45% of adults worldwide, and by age 60 approximately two-thirds of the population will develop the disease.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the Framingham Heart Study, 90% of adults who had normal blood pressure at age 55 years then went on to develop hypertension.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Current clinical practice guidelines from the Joint National Committee (JNC) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 8), published in December 2013, advocate general sitting blood pressure goals of 140/90 mm Hg for hypertensive patients younger than 60 years of age and 150/90 mm Hg for patients aged 60 years or older.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Small changes in blood pressure are known to reduce the risk and mortality from cardiovascular events and stroke.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Small decreases in blood pressure (10 mm Hg systolic; 5 mm Hg diastolic) are known to lower the risk of stroke and heart failure by up to 50% and myocardial infarction by up to 25%.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, the risk of mortality associated with stroke and ischemic heart disease has been estimated to double with each 20 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure or with each 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure from normotensive readings.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Recent post hoc analyses have also emphasized the importance of an increased visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure in predicting cardiovascular events.

When the studies vary in size, the larger studies can have a greater influence on the pooled results. Three of the trials included (accounting for 342 of the 706 participants in the analysis) were open-label and could be subject to types of bias commonly associated with such designs. Finally, it should be noted that the trials used in this analysis may have had differences in characteristics of participants (ie, receiving monotherapy or combination therapy&#x02014;although any background therapy was kept constant during the assessment period, treated blood pressure or treatment naive, comorbidities, etc.).</p><p>These results are similar to another post hoc analysis, where the titration of amlodipine from 5 to 10 mg daily significantly decreased both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in Asian patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Amlodipine 10 mg lowered systolic blood pressure by &#x02212;13.3 mm Hg (95% CI: &#x02212;15.5 to &#x02212;11.0) and diastolic blood pressure by &#x02212;9.2 mm Hg (95% CI: &#x02212;10.6 to &#x02212;7.8) at the final visit (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 for both).</p><p>The results also support those of large-scale clinical studies in patients with hypertension where amlodipine uptitrated to 10 mg once daily controlled blood pressure and suppressed cardiovascular events.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The wealth of studies reporting not only the dangers of sustained hypertension in older patients on the risk of cardiovascular events but also the benefits of uptitration to amlodipine 10 mg in reducing elevated blood pressure highlights the importance of encouraging this strategy in prescribing patterns.</p><p>Increasing amlodipine from 5 to 10 mg could also provide an alternative to initiate combination therapy, especially in patients with very high blood pressure and those at greater cardiovascular risk. Indeed, recent guidelines, such as NICE, still advocate the use of monotherapy with a calcium channel blocker in the older patient population (55 years or older) before initiating combination therapy.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Our results showed that not only will this result in clinically meaningful incremental blood pressure lowering but that a significant portion of the patents will also achieve their blood pressure targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Titration of amlodipine from 5 to 10 mg once daily significantly decreased both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension across both age subgroups (younger than 55 years vs. 55 years or older). Blood pressure goals were achieved safely in &#x0223c;40% of patients. This is clinically relevant as advancing age is associated with hypertension and an increased risk of nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events and stroke.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>The studies included in these analyses were funded by Pfizer Inc.
