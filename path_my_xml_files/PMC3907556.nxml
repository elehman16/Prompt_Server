Twenty-two TKD athletes performed a 2-hr TKD training session. After training, participants ingested green tea (T, caffeine 6 mg/kg and catechins 22 mg/kg) or an equal volume of water (W). Saliva samples were collected at three time points: before training (BT-T; BT-W), immediately after training (AT-T; AT-W), and 30 min after drinking green tea or water (Rec-T; Rec-W). Salivary total protein, immunoglobulin A (SIgA), lactoferrin, &#x003b1;-amylase activity, free radical scavenger activity (FRSA) and antibacterial capacity were measured. Salivary total protein, lactoferrin, SIgA concentrations and &#x003b1;-amylase activity increased significantly immediately after intensive TKD training. After tea drinking and 30 min rest, &#x003b1;-amylase activity and the ratio of &#x003b1;-amylase to total protein were significantly higher than before and after training. In addition, salivary antibacterial capacity was not affected by intense training, but green tea consumption after training enhanced salivary antibacterial capacity. Additionally, we observed that salivary FRSA was markedly suppressed immediately after training and quickly returned to pre-exercise values, regardless of which fluid was consumed. Our results show that green tea consumption significantly enhances the activity of &#x003b1;-amylase and salivary antibacterial capacity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by NSC 101-2628-H-028-002-MY3 granted by National Science Council, R.

Salivary IgA (SIgA) contributes to mucosal immunity by preventing adherence of microbes to the mucosal surface <xref rid="pone.0087580-Marcotte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Amylase functions as an antibacterial protein inhibiting bacterial growth and colonization in the oral cavity <xref rid="pone.0087580-Bortner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Jespersgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Lactoferrin, one of the most abundant salivary AMPs, exerts an antibacterial effect by sequestering iron, an essential nutrient for bacterial growth, as well as directly interacting with, and damaging, bacterial membranes <xref rid="pone.0087580-Ellison1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Jenssen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Additionally, saliva contains various kinds of anti-oxidative systems that guard against oxidative damage induced by free radical-mediated oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0087580-Battino1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Salivary total antioxidant capacity can be evaluated by measuring the free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) <xref rid="pone.0087580-Atsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, salivary exertion of these defense factors can be affected by high intensity exercise <xref rid="pone.0087580-Chicharro1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Prolonged, strenuous exercise has been implicated in immunosuppression, induction of inflammatory response and increased production of free radicals <xref rid="pone.0087580-He1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087580-Sjodin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, development of nutritional strategies to alleviate the negative effects of intensive exercise would seem particularly desirable.</p><p>Green tea is a non-fermented/oxidized tea that contains various polyphenolic flavonoids, including epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin gallate <xref rid="pone.0087580-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Consumption of green tea has been reported as beneficial for health given its anti-angiogenic, anti-carcinogenic and anti-diabetic activities <xref rid="pone.0087580-Cabrera1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087580-Sabu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It has been suggested that the pharmacological properties of green tea may be mediated, at least partially, by its potent anti-oxidative activity, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects <xref rid="pone.0087580-Katiyar1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087580-Tipoe1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the detrimental effects caused by intensive exercise may be alleviated by consumption of green tea. In recent years, there is a growing interest to understand the potential beneficial role of green tea in exercise performance and recovery from high intensity exercise. Studies have revealed that habitual consumption of green tea improves endurance capacity and exercise performance in both mice and humans <xref rid="pone.0087580-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087580-Murase2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Recently, it was demonstrated that oral supplementation of theanine, abundant in green tea, and cystine can significantly attenuate exercise-induced peripheral neutrophilia and lymphopenia <xref rid="pone.0087580-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Although previous research has indicated that consumption of green tea can effectively alleviate some of the negative effects caused by high-intensity exercise, its effects on salivary defense proteins, antibacterial capacity and total antioxidant activity are still unclear.</p><p>Taekwondo (TKD) is a high speed, high tension, full-contact combat sport, and the training program for TKD athletes includes a series of intensified, vigorous physical exercises. Our previous results suggested that the cumulative effects of prolonged, strenuous TKD training in combination with rapid weight loss can significantly suppress the mucosal immunity of male and female TKD athletes <xref rid="pone.0087580-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Tsai2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, short-term effects of high intensity TKD training on individual mucosa immunity following green tea consumption are still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acute green tea consumption following intensive TKD training on salivary defense factors and antibacterial capacity of male and female athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-two TKD athletes (13 males and 9 females) from the National Taiwan University of Physical Education and Sport TKD team volunteered to participate in this study.

Additionally, green tea consumption following intensive training exerts short-term effects on salivary antibacterial capacity, &#x003b1;-amylase activities and total protein concentrations. In this study, no significant differences between male and female athletes were observed regarding the responses of the above salivary factors to TKD training and/or green tea consumption.</p><p>Intensive TKD training did not affect the antibacterial capacity of participants. Our results are similar to those of a recent study by Davison et al. <xref rid="pone.0087580-Atsumi2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> who reported that although salivary defense factors were increased following prolonged exercise, salivary antibacterial capacity was not changed. While actue exercise did not affect antibacterial capacity green tea consumption significantly elevated antibacterial capacity compared to water. In this study all the athletes ingested fresh green tea at the same training session to ensure the green tea composition was uniform as different preparations may differ in caffeine and catechins content and for this reason a possible order effect cannot be ruled out. However, green tea and its major components have been previously shown to exhibit antibacterial effects <xref rid="pone.0087580-Davison1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. There were no detectable levels of tea catechins in collected saliva (data not shown) and therefore, the increased salivary antibacterial capacity is most probably due to salivary defense factors affected by green tea consumption. Prolonged, intense exercise may alter salivary total protein, lactoferrin, SIgA and &#x003b1;-amylase activity, but not salivary antibacterial capacity suggesting that there may exist a complex interaction between salivary defense factors.</p><p>In addition, our results show that &#x003b1;-amylase activity was stimulated by TKD training and further increased 30 minutes after the ingestion of green tea. Previous studies have reported that &#x003b1;-amylase activity was stimulated following psychological stress or physical exercise <xref rid="pone.0087580-Allgrove1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Nater1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Besides starch hydrolysis activity, &#x003b1;-amylase has been shown to function as an antibacterial protein by inhibiting bacterial growth and colonization in the oral cavity <xref rid="pone.0087580-Bortner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Jespersgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, we suggest that the increased salivary antibacterial capacity after green tea consumption could be at least partially explained by the elevated &#x003b1;-amylase activity. However, complex interactions between host defense factors make it difficult to evaluate the influence of individual components to host antibacterial capacity <xref rid="pone.0087580-Bals1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and as such. Therefore, further experiments are required to elucidate the role of &#x003b1;-amylase in salivary antibacterial capacity.</p><p>Total protein levels increased significantly immediately after TKD training while concentrations returned to pre-exercise levels 30 minutes following water ingestion. The immediate post-exercise increase in total protein concentration is most likely attributable to acute dehydration induced by intense exercise <xref rid="pone.0087580-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. While protein levels were reduced to pre-exercise levels following the ingestion of water post-exercise, total protein concentrations remained relatively high 30 min after consumption of green tea. However, it is well known that &#x003b1;-amylase is one of the most abundant proteins in saliva <xref rid="pone.0087580-Zakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our results showed that levels of &#x003b1;-amylase were markedly stimulated by consumption of green tea. Therefore, elevated total protein concentration may be due to the marked increases of &#x003b1;-amylase stimulated by green tea ingestion.</p><p>Levels of SIgA and lactoferrin were elevated by TKD training and returned to pre-exercise levels after 30 min of rest, regardless of which fluid was consumed. Although absolute concentrations of SIgA and lactoferrin were increased after intense exercise, the ratio of SIgA or lactoferrin to total protein was not significantly changed suggesting that changes in absolute concentration were attributable to acute dehydration caused by intense exercise <xref rid="pone.0087580-Walsh2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In addition, our results indicate that the changes in lactoferrin and SIgA concentrations were not correlated with salivary anti-<italic>E. coli</italic> capacity. Therefore, these salivary AMPs may exert different antibacterial capacities against different strains of pathogens. The basal levels of SIgA detected in this study were similar to those of basketball players <xref rid="pone.0087580-He1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and TKD athletes without performing rapid weight reduction <xref rid="pone.0087580-Tsai2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Besides the differences caused by experimental design, the basal levels of SIgA and lactoferrin measured in this study were modestly different from those of our previous studies <xref rid="pone.0087580-He1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Tsai2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This may be accounted for by the individual variances between different participants.</p><p>Studies investigating the antioxidant activity of green tea in response to exercise have typically had participants ingest green tea prior to exercise <xref rid="pone.0087580-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087580-Panza1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In this study, we measured FRSA to investigate the short-term effect of green tea on the recovery of exercise-induced changes in antioxidant activity. Our results indicated that total salivary antioxidant activity was significantly decreased immediately following intense TKD training and returned to pre-exercise levels after 30 min of rest. Ingestion of green tea did not significantly affect total salivary antioxidant activity. Our previous study found no accumulative effects were observed in total salivary antioxidant activity on elite TKD athletes during a period of intense training and competition if saliva samples were collected after at least 12 hour of rest <xref rid="pone.0087580-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this study, we have demonstrated that total salivary antioxidant activity was acutely reduced by intense exercise and then returned to its pre-exercise level. Atsumi et al. reported that immediately following moderate exercises, total salivary antioxidant activity was significantly decreased <xref rid="pone.0087580-Atsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, the transitory decrease in total salivary antioxidant activity observed here may be due to the relatively higher exercise intensity used in this study and/or more intense psychological stress. Detailed mechanisms underlying the effects of green tea ingestion on total salivary antioxidant activity are still unclear and require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our experiment demonstrated that salivary antibacterial capacity during the post-exercise recovery period was significantly enhanced by ingestion of green tea. This enhanced antibacterial capacity might be partially mediated by increased &#x003b1;-amylase activity. Therefore, our results suggest that green tea consumption exerts beneficial effects on athletes following intense exercise by enhancing salivary defense against microbial pathogens.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We warmly thank the coaches, Yong-Sung Ha, Li-Wen Su, and all the TKD athletes for their patience and participation in this study.
