However, non-adherence and partial adherence to antipsychotic medication treatment is common and long-acting injectable &#x0201c;depot&#x0201d; preparations of antipsychotic medications have been used as an alternative to oral medication therapy for patients for whom adherence is a clinically significant problem, as well as for the sake of convenience and in response to patient preference. Olanzapine long-acting injection (OLAI) is a new treatment option and has been approved by several regulatory agencies for the treatment of schizophrenia. OLAI is a crystalline salt formulation of olanzapine and pamoic acid. Efficacy was established in 2 double-blind randomized clinical trials of OLAI for the treatment of acute schizophrenia and for the maintenance of response. The therapeutic OLAI dosages are 150 mg q2 weeks, 210 mg q2 weeks, 300 mg q2 weeks or q4 weeks, and 405 mg q4 weeks, administered by deep intramuscular gluteal injection with a 19-gauge needle. Injection volume ranges from 1 to 2.7 mL. OLAI has essentially the same general tolerability as that of oral olanzapine; however with the depot there is the additional risk of a post-injection delirium sedation syndrome occurring at a rate of 0.07% of injections, requiring a risk management plan that includes observing the patient for 3 hours post injection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adherence</kwd><kwd>antipsychotic</kwd><kwd>depot</kwd><kwd>long-acting</kwd><kwd>olanzapine pamoate</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder generally treated with antipsychotic medication.

In addition, depot injections can be considerably more convenient for the patient and caregiver, and may be preferred over oral options by all the parties concerned.</p><p>The purpose of this review is to summarize key issues related to non-adherence and its management and to introduce information on a new medication option &#x02013; olanzapine long-acting injection (OLAI) &#x02013; together with data on patient-focused perspectives and OLAI&#x02019;s potential place in the treatment of schizophrenia.

In the inpatient setting, using a q2 week or monthly medication administration schedule can save staff time and avoid daily medication administration struggles. Although the acquisition cost of newer depot medication products can be relatively high, these costs may be small when compared with the time saved by staff (when administering medication biweekly or monthly rather than up to 4 times per day) and by shortening hospital stays and improving patient outcomes. During the important inpatient to outpatient transition period, long-acting injectable antipsychotics may be advantageous in getting patients to attend outpatient clinic programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-3-345">4</xref></p><p>In the US, depot neuroleptics have been in use since 1963, when fluphenazine enanthate was approved for marketing.

The primary outcome measure was change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and this change was significantly greater for all olanzapine doses tested relative to placebo. Acute efficacy was established by demonstrating separation from placebo as early as 3 days (the first time point where the PANSS was measured after starting double-blinded treatment) for the 300 mg q2 weeks and 405 mg q4 weeks treatment arms, and as early as 7 days for the subjects receiving 210 mg q2 weeks. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-3-345">Table 1</xref> summarizes several of the clinically relevant categorical outcomes, together with the effect size measure of number needed to treat (NNT).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ppa-3-345">48</xref></p><p>A 24-week maintenance study enrolled 1205 outpatients and although the study was randomized and double-blind, it was not placebo-controlled.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> Patients were eligible to be randomized to OLAI or oral olanzapine provided they had maintained stability on open-label oral olanzapine (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) for 4 to 8 weeks. There were 5 treatment groups: OLAI 405 mg q4 weeks, 300 mg q2 weeks, 150 mg q2 weeks, 45 mg q4 weeks, or 10, 15, or 20 mg/day oral olanzapine (whichever oral dose they had been stabilized on prior to randomization). The low-dose treatment arm of OLAI (45 mg q4 weeks) was included to serve as a comparator for the superiority analysis to therapeutic doses of OLAI, and can be considered as a placebo-equivalent. No supplementation with oral antipsychotic therapy was permitted after randomization. At randomization, the mean PANSS total score was 56, indicating a low level of psychopathology. The primary outcome studied was time to exacerbation of illness, defined by worsening of positive symptoms (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, unusual thought content) since randomization, or hospitalization due to worsening of positive psychotic symptoms. Each of the therapeutic OLAI doses was statistically superior to the 45 mg q4 weeks dose with respect to time to exacerbation of symptoms. In a non-inferiority analysis, subjects receiving OLAI 150 or 300 mg q2 week had a similar non-exacerbation rate compared to the oral olanzapine group (90% versus 93% for depot and oral respectively) and was thus was non-inferior to the oral olanzapine treatment group. In addition, OLAI 405 mg q4 weeks was non-inferior to the oral olanzapine and the pooled q2 weeks depot dosing groups. Categorical outcomes are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ppa-3-345">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>The general safety and tolerability profile for OLAI is similar to that for oral olanzapine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ppa-3-345">45</xref> However, during the OLAI clinical trial program a small number of adverse events termed post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) was observed in a small proportion of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> PDSS appears to be related to potential intravascular injection of a portion of the OLAI dose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> As of May 30, 2008, a total of 29 PDSS events have been identified in 28 patients during OLAI clinical trials. Based on more than 40,000 OLAI injections given to 2054 patients in clinical trials through May 30, 2008, PDSS events have occurred in approximately 0.07% of injections, or 1.4% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ppa-3-345">49</xref> Signs and symptoms in PDSS events appear consistent with olanzapine overdose and include dizziness, confusion, disorientation, slurred speech, altered gait, weakness, and a reduced level of consciousness ranging from mild sedation to coma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ppa-3-345">49</xref> When plasma levels for olanzapine were available immediately after a PDSS event, a much higher olanzapine plasma concentration was observed than would have been expected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> Onset of signs and symptoms may be between 5 minutes and &#x0003c;5 hours (1 case occurred 3 to 5 hours after injection; median time to onset is 20 minutes; approximately 80% of patients had onset &#x0003c;60 minutes). None of the PDSS events involved sudden onset of profound sedation or incapacitation; instead, all began with milder symptoms, which progressed to more severe symptoms in some events. In general, the later the onset of symptoms, the slower their progression. All patients fully recovered from the events within 24 to 72 hours after injection, and the majority continued to receive further injections of OLAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ppa-3-345">49</xref> One patient experienced two PDSS events. He is the only patient to have experienced the event more than once, and these events occurred approximately 6 months apart.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> On average, PDSS events occurred after the patient had received several months of injections (median number of injections was 17) and ranged in occurrence from 1 event at the first injection to 1 event at the 40th injection. The mean number of days (from starting treatment with OLAI) to an event was 278 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> The cumulative risk of a PDSS event occurring in an individual is estimated to be 0.7% to 1.2% after 1 year, 2.1% to 2.9% after 5 years, and 3.8% to 4.8% after 20 years of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> Potential risk factors include a higher dose (related to an increased injection volume), greater age, and low body mass index (BMI), however risk remains low even for patients with these specific risk factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> For example, a logistic regression model predicted that a 50-year-old patient with a BMI of 22 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who received a 405 mg injection would have a probability of 0.0032 for experiencing a PDSS event.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref></p><p>One possible explanation for why PDSS can occur is that OLAI is more soluble in blood or plasma than in muscle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> Partial injection into vasculature, vessel injury associated with the intramuscular injection such as with a nick or puncture of the blood vessel, or substantial bleeding at the injection site may result in a rapid release of a portion of the OLAI dose.</p><p>Because of PDSS, risk management plans have been put into place.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ppa-3-345">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ppa-3-345">50</xref> Elements of the plan adopted by the European Medicines Agency are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ppa-3-345">Table 3</xref>. The central feature is that after each injection, patients should be observed in a healthcare facility by appropriately qualified personnel for at least 3 hours and that they should not drive or operate machinery for the remainder of the day of the injection. In New Zealand, product labeling further specifies that OLAI be administered in a healthcare facility with access to emergency services for management of olanzapine overdose and that active monitoring for alertness take place every 30 minutes during the 3 hour post-injection observation period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ppa-3-345">38</xref></p><p>In addition to routine post-marketing surveillance, OLAI&#x02019;s manufacturer plans to undertake a multinational Phase IV, non-interventional, prospective cohort study, focusing on PDSS risk in approximately 5000 patients. The study will estimate the crude incidence of PDSS events over a 2-year period in patients treated with OLAI in clinical practice and identify potential risk factors associated with the occurrence of PDSS events and further characterize the clinical presentation of these events in a naturalistic setting. It will also provide the opportunity to compare the incidence, severity, and outcomes of PDSS events in clinical trials with normal clinical practice to determine if there are any clinically meaningful differences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Dosing and administration</title><p>New information is available on the optimal dose for oral olanzapine that may have implications on what dose of OLAI would be best. The optimal dose of oral olanzapine for most patients is likely 10 to 20 mg/day, as evidenced by a fixed-dose randomized clinical trial comparing olanzapine 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, and 40 mg/day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ppa-3-345">51</xref> Over the 8 weeks of the study, non-treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder responded to all 3 doses of olanzapine, without a statistically significant dose-response relationship, suggesting that for many patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, particularly those who are mildly or moderately ill, 10 mg/day should be the initial dose of choice. In terms of tolerability, the 40 mg/day group demonstrated greater weight gain and change in plasma prolactin than the 10 mg/day group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ppa-3-345">51</xref> See Citrome and Kantrowitz<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ppa-3-345">52</xref> for a review of dose response for olanzapine.</p><p>The therapeutic OLAI dosages are 150 mg q2 weeks, 210 mg q2 weeks, 300 mg q2 weeks or q4 weeks, and 405 mg q4 weeks. Three vial strengths are available (210 mg, 300 mg, 405 mg) and are reconstituted to a fixed concentration of 150 mg/mL, for a volume of injection of 1 to 2.7 mL, for deep intramuscular gluteal injection with a 19-gauge needle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ppa-3-345">38</xref> Systemic olanzapine exposures with OLAI at these doses are at levels that are comparable to those associated with once-daily oral administration of olanzapine within the range of 10 to 20 mg/day. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ppa-3-345">Table 4</xref> provides the dose correspondence between OLAI and oral olanzapine at steady state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> Based on analyses of the pivotal 24-week maintenance study at 2 months, in order to minimize the risk for exacerbation at the start of treatment, the recommended start dose of OLAI for the first 2 months of treatment (in effect a &#x0201c;loading dose&#x0201d;) differs from the maintenance dose, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-ppa-3-345">Table 5</xref>. Although OLAI has not been systematically studied in patients 65 years and over, product labeling in New Zealand suggests a low starting dose of 150 mg q4 weeks if used in this population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ppa-3-345">38</xref> As noted in a commentary, a further complicating factor is that each OLAI vial strength requires a different volume of the supplied diluent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ppa-3-345">53</xref> There is more diluent in the vial than is needed to reconstitute.

The PSMQ-Modified as such is unpublished but the original scale has been described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ppa-3-345">56</xref> and consists of 10 questions, including a likert-type question on satisfaction with current medication and another on perception of frequency of side-effects with the current medication. There are also narrative questions such as &#x0201c;Overall do you prefer your current medication or your previous medication?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Has any caretaker made any comments on any differences between you being on your current medication and previous medications?&#x0201d; The majority of patients (70.6%) reported satisfaction with OLAI; 69% reported that they preferred OLAI over previous oral medications; and 71.6% reported experiencing less impact from side-effects on OLAI compared with previous oral medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> Of interest, 16 of the 24 patients experiencing a PDSS event weighed the benefits against the risks of OLAI treatment and continued to receive OLAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Place in therapy</title><p>Long-acting injectable depot preparations of antipsychotics offer a guaranteed delivery system that eliminates the possibility of covert non-adherence. By not coming to the clinic for the next injection, non-adherence becomes readily identifiable and further outreach can be done expeditiously. By providing a steady amount of a therapeutic dose of an antipsychotic, maintenance of response is enhanced and relapse can be prevented or delayed. However, despite these advantages, the use of depot antipsychotics faces several obstacles among psychiatrists, nurses, and patients. These will be required to be addressed in order for OLAI to be used successfully.</p><p>There is a belief among psychiatrists that their patients are sufficiently compliant with oral antipsychotic medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ppa-3-345">57</xref> Moreover there are concerns that first-generation depots ought to be avoided because of the risk for extrapyramidal side-effects, and that second-generation long-acting injectable drugs are expensive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ppa-3-345">57</xref> In a survey of psychiatrists in the UK,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-ppa-3-345">58</xref> 40% believed that depots are old fashioned and 48% thought they were stigmatizing. Although almost all (91%) thought that depots are as efficacious as oral medication, there was a belief among 69% that depots would be less acceptable to patients. However, respondents did endorse advantages: 81% considered depots being able to enhance patient compliance; 94% endorsed the belief that depots prevent relapse. The authors note that psychiatrists would be persuaded to prescribe depots if they were associated with fewer side-effects, in patients where compliance is an issue, and if second-generation antipsychotics were available, presumably because they would have a lower incidence of side-effects.</p><p>Nursing obstacles have also been identified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ppa-3-345">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ppa-3-345">60</xref> Negative views include the thought that depots are old fashioned, stigmatizing, and the perception that most patients always prefer to have oral medication and that force is sometimes required when administering a depot. However, familiarity with depots and knowledge of side-effects were positively associated with favorable attitudes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ppa-3-345">60</xref></p><p>Although depot antipsychotics can be perceived as more coercive than oral medications by some patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ppa-3-345">61</xref> it appears that many patients would be willing to take depot antipsychotics if they were made available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-ppa-3-345">62</xref> Patient preferences for a depot formulation versus on oral tablet are likely related to current and past experiences with depot.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-ppa-3-345">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-ppa-3-345">63</xref> Thus, when a new depot formulation becomes available, differences from past injectables needs to be emphasized when offering the new choice.</p><p>OLAI was demonstrated to be efficacious in acutely ill patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ppa-3-345">47</xref> and in the maintenance of response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-345">13</xref> OLAI shares the same general safety profile as oral olanzapine. This includes both favorable aspects (low potential for extrapyramidal effects) and an unfavorable metabolic profile (high potential for weight gain, lipid abnormalities, and insulin resistance).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ppa-3-345">45</xref> A risk unique to the depot formulation of olanzapine is that of PDSS, requiring the implementation of a risk management plan. This requirement may limit access to OLAI.</p><p>When assessing potential benefit and risk, OLAI may be best suited for patients who have a clear history of response to olanzapine and for whom a depot may enhance their ability to remain adherent. Alternatives include first-generation depot antipsychotics, risperidone microspheres, and paliperidone palmitate. Studies directly comparing these options would be desirable to discern whether or not there are any differences in terms of prevention of exacerbation, relapse and/or hospitalizations among the different choices.</p><p>Practical considerations for the three commercially available second-generation antipsychotics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t6-ppa-3-345">Table 6</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ppa-3-345">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ppa-3-345">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-ppa-3-345">65</xref> Needle gauge is largest for OLAI and smallest for paliperidone palmitate. The latter agent is unique in that it comes in prefilled syringes. In contrast to risperidone microspheres, OLAI and paliperidone palmitate do not require refrigeration, can be given monthly, and do not require oral supplementation when initiating therapy. Both OLAI and paliperidone palmitate require different doses for initiation and for maintenance. OLAI must be administered in the gluteal muscle but risperidone micro-spheres and paliperidone palmitate may also be administered in the deltoid muscle. OLAI is unique in requiring a 3-hour post-injection monitoring period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Depot antipsychotics are an important treatment option for patients with schizophrenia who are nonadherent or partially adherent to their medication treatment. They also represent a convenient option for patients who prefer a monthly injection over a more complicated regimen. Up to now, choices for a second-generation depot antipsychotic have been limited. Newly available is OLAI. Treatment with OLAI 210 mg q2 weeks, 405 mg q4 weeks, and 300 mg q2 weeks appears efficacious in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. OLAI was also demonstrated to be efficacious in the maintenance of response with either the q2 weeks or q4 weeks dosing options. The general safety profile for OLAI is similar to that for oral olanzapine however there is a small additional risk of PDSS, occurring at a rate of 0.07% of injections or 1.4% of patients. This risk requires that patients be supervised by health care personnel for 3 hours post injection. OLAI appears to be best suited for the patient who responds well to olanzapine but who is having difficulties remaining adherent to oral antipsychotic medication.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>No writing assistance or external financial support was utilized in the production of this review article.
