With increased access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), prolonged survival and increasingly chronic nature of their illness, it is essential to better understand the various mechanisms that affect the course and management of perinatally acquired HIV infection. Following initiation of cART in perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV+) children, there is a recovery of immune function, including significant increase of CD4+ T-cell count and percentage, decrease in CD8+ T-cell percentage, decrease in count and percentage of activated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ T-cells and increase in percentage of na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ and CD8+CD62L+CD45RA+ T-cells [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Yet, immune activation levels remain elevated and many important immunologic parameters do not return to normal levels, prompting questions about residual mechanisms affecting normalization of T-cell compartments even in the circumstance of successful suppression of HIV replication [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a potent activator of CD8+ T cells in the general population, including HIV-co-infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PHIV+ infants co-infected with CMV have higher CD8+ and lower CD4+ T-cell counts than HIV mono-infected children [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In a small cohort of HIV+ adults, valganciclovir was efficacious in suppressing CMV DNA to undetectable levels and reducing CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+% [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a sensitive marker of T-cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120474.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], suggesting not only that CMV replication contributes to immune activation in co-infected individuals, but also that pharmacologic suppression of CMV may help reverse this process [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Yet, these data may not be generalizable to PHIV+ children, whose patterns of immune reconstitution differ from those of adults. Thus, it is critically important to evaluate the impact of CMV co-infection on the recovery of a normal T-cell distribution of PHIV+ children in response to cART. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CMV may accelerate immunologic aging leading to early onset of diseases related to the aging process [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>We evaluated longitudinal trends in percentages of selected T-cell phenotypes in a cohort of PHIV+ children with severe disease following a switch in ART regimen. We focused on activated (CD38+HLA-DR+); na&#x000ef;ve (CD62L+CD45RA+; CD95-CD28+); and terminally differentiated (CD62L-CD45RA+; CD95+CD28-) [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] compartments of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. We hypothesized that CMV co-infection and active CMV viremia would impact T-cell activation and percentages of na&#x000ef;ve and memory T cell populations. Additional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes were included for explorative purposes, and a post-hoc sub-analysis was conducted to explore the potential effect of CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on T-cell reconstitution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study Design</title><p>This research was approved by the University of Southern California Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.

The monoclonal antibody (mAb) panel included 3 reagent combinations of CD3/CD4/CD45, CD3/CD8/CD45, and CD3/CD19/CD45 for identification of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Extended phenotyping was performed with the mAb combinations CD45RA/CD62L/CD4; CD45RA/CD62L/CD8; HLA-DR/CD38/CD4; HLA/DR/CD38/CD8; CD28/CD95/CD4; CD28/CD95/CD8 using green (FITC), orange(PE) and red (ECD or perCP or PE-Cy5) fluorochromes depending on instrument configuration. This panel was designed to identify the following CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets: Na&#x000ef;ve (CD45RA+CD62L+) or (CD28+CD95-); effector (CD45RA+CD62L-) or (CD28-CD95+); and activated (HLADR+CD38+). For gating, we ensured 98% to 99% of all events in the Isotype control cursor settings were in the lower left quadrant of the flow plot.

The general effect of CMV co-infection status was most notable in the CD8+ population of T-cells with little impact on the CD4+ T-cell populations. CMV co-infection was significantly associated with lower percentages of na&#x000ef;ve CD8+CD62L+CD45RA+ and CD8+CD95-CD28+ T-cells and higher percentage of terminally differentiated CD8+CD95+CD28- T-cells both at baseline and in their longitudinal trends. These associations were independent from the HIV VL response at week 16 and remained significant after adjusting for other important covariates, including treatment arm, baseline VL and baseline CD4% suggesting an independent role of CMV co-infection on the normalization of CD8+ T-cell population in PHIV+ children. Additionally, these data may help explain the noted increase in the development of opportunistic infections previously reported in children co-infected with CMV and HIV [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to studies in adults, our study did not find a significant impact of CMV status on activated CD8+ T-cells, as baseline CMV status was not associated with longitudinal trends in CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+%. This may be because PHIV+ infants and children acquire primary CMV infection while they have an immature immune system that is already suppressed by HIV and thus not allowing for the normal immune response of T-cell activation and other immunologic responses necessary to combat this primary infection whereas HIV infected adults in general are CMV-infected prior to their HIV infection. Alternatively, as implied by previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] CD38+HLA-DR+% may not be a sensitive activation marker in children.</p><p>CD62L+CD45RA+ T-cells are na&#x000ef;ve T-cells with high affinity for entry into secondary lymphoid tissues [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120474.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The CD8+CD62L+CD45RA+% is dramatically reduced early in the course of HIV infection, resulting in undermined ability of the immune system to respond to novel antigens [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the present study, the mean CD8+CD62L+CD45RA+% (na&#x000ef;ve) increased over time in response to cART in the overall cohort, but was persistently higher in the CMV-na&#x000ef;ve than in CMV+ groups, and increased at a slower rate in CMV+ compared to CMV-na&#x000ef;ve group. This finding is consistent with previous reports of increased CD8+CD62L+CD45RA+% (na&#x000ef;ve) following cART initiation in PHIV+ children [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and suggests that the recovery of the na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ subset may be derailed by CMV co-infection. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical implications of this CMV-associated effect in PHIV+ children on suppressive cART, including overall morbidity and susceptibility to novel pathogens.</p><p>The CD95 molecule mediates activation-induced T-cell apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The CD28 molecule, expressed on peripheral T cells and thymocytes, mediates an essential costimulatory signal following engagement of the T-cell receptor [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Increased proportions of CD28- effector memory T-cells are observed during normal aging and chronic immune stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The overall decrease in mean CD8+CD95+CD28-% (terminally differentiated) over the course of ACTG 366 trial tended to be less pronounced among CMV+ participants; an opposite trend was observed in the na&#x000ef;ve CD8+CD95-CD28+%. Studies with adult populations [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] suggest that CMV infection is associated with accelerated immunosenescence. The present findings suggest that this may also be the case in PHIV+ infants, children and adolescents.</p><p>The observed impact of CMV infection on longitudinal trends was independent of treatment arm and inclusion of nelfinavir in the ART regimens, in spite of the in vitro activity of nelfinavir against CMV [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the differential effects of cART regimens on immune recovery were not the primary focus of this analysis and ACTG 366 randomization protocol was not based on inclusion of nelfinavir in cART regimens, so these results should not be considered definitive.</p><p>The loss of CMV-specific CMI commonly seen in patients with advanced HIV disease is deemed to contribute to CMV reactivation culminating in end-organ disease. We hypothesized that CMV-specific CMI, through its protective effect against CMV reactivation, may be associated with decreased CD8+ T-cell differentiation in our CMV and HIV co-infected subjects. However, the results of our sub-analysis imply that CMV-specific CMI may have significant adverse impact on the recovery of na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T-cell subsets. This finding may indicate that the CMI response to CMV is accompanied by CD8+ T-cell activation and consequent depletion of CD8+ na&#x000ef;ve T cells. Future studies with adequate sample sizes should follow up on this preliminary finding, in order to better understand its mechanistic underpinnings, including the potential role of active CMV viremia vs. aviremic CMV positivity and the effect of CMV antivirals.</p><p>The present findings may have therapeutic implications. Similar to the valganciclovir trial in adults [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], adjunctive pharmacological suppression of CMV DNA may help optimize immune recovery in co-infected PHIV+ children as well. Yet, our findings suggest that, unlike HIV+ adults, in whom valganciclovir-induced CMV suppression was marked by decrease in CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+% (activated), in PHIV+ children the changes in CD8+CD62L+CD45RA+% (na&#x000ef;ve), CD8+CD95-CD28+% (na&#x000ef;ve) and CD8+CD95+CD28-% (terminally differentiated) may be more sensitive biomarkers of treatment response. Furthermore, the fact that CMV infection status, rather than CMV viremia status, was the factor that influenced normalization of selected CD8+ T-cell subsets in the present study suggests that treatments that simply decrease CMV viremia may have limited effect. This may be especially important to prevent the ongoing effect of CMV and HIV together on immunologic aging and long-term consequences such as diseases of aging and opportunistic infections.</p><p>This study has limitations. First, the cART regimens provided in ACTG 366 were not as potent as the ones available today and all participants had severe disease at study entry. Nevertheless, the findings do contribute in our understanding of the impact of two viral infections on immune changes and immunologic aging; and this is relevant to the very many PHIV+ children who are now young adults and may be impacted by their early CMV infection and potentially ongoing reactivation leading to premature senescence and diseases of aging. Furthermore, the findings are relevant to low-resource settings where most of the new perinatal HIV infections occur today, ART formularies are often limited, and infant CMV infection is highly prevalent. [<xref rid="pone.0120474.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120474.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] It would, thus, be important to replicate this analysis in a population of PHIV+ infants who have never had severe disease. Second, due to the exploratory nature of this analysis, there were no adjustments made for multiple testing, and thus we reported p-values less than 5% as significant. This allows maximum sensitivity in identifying potential effects of CMV co-infection on immune reconstitution. The reported p-values can provide readers an idea of strength of evidence for associations. Future adequately powered studies focused on the identified important markers are needed to confirm these results. Finally, the duration of follow-up was 40 weeks. There could be later discernable effects of CMV beyond 40 weeks following more sustained ART HIV VL suppression and decreases in HIV-related immune activation.</p><p>We conclude that longitudinal trends in percentages of CD8+CD62L+CD45RA+ (na&#x000ef;ve), CD8+CD95-CD28+ (na&#x000ef;ve), and CD8+CD95+CD28- (terminally differentiated) T-cells, following switch in cART, were significantly adversely affected by CMV co-infection in this cohort of PHIV+ children. Certain aspects of immune recovery in cART-treated PHIV+ children, specifically restoration of na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T-cell compartment and decrease of terminally differentiated CD8+ T-cell compartment might be derailed by CMV co-infection even after successful suppression of HIV viremia. These findings may have implications for adjunctive treatment strategies targeting CMV co-infection in PHIV+ children, especially those that are now adults or reaching young adulthood and may have accelerated immunologic aging and associated diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120474.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Selected CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell Percentages by CMV Status.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120474.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>
