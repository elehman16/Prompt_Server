The response rate of chemotherapy is only at the level of 20&#x02013;35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], effective in a minority of patients with poorly differentiated NETs and is completely ineffective in the majority of well-differentiated NETs. &#x0201c;Cold&#x0201d; somatostatin analogues exert a good clinical effect, decreasing flushing, diarrhoea and other symptoms of carcinoid syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Worth mentioning is the fact that a prospective randomized study of the effect of octreotide LAR in the control of tumour growth in patients with metastatic midgut NETs (PROMID study) showed that octreotide LAR inhibits tumour growth in patients with well-differentiated metastatic midgut NETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues has become an established method of treatment of disseminated NET. [<sup>111</sup>In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)<sup>0</sup>]octreotide firstly was used in some clinical trials, with regression observed in 8% of patients. Because of the physical characteristics and short range of the Auger electrons of <sup>111</sup>In, the best results were observed in patients with small tumours and relatively high tumour uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recently, new somatostatin analogues that can be labelled with beta-emitting radionuclides have been developed. Currently <sup>90</sup>Y and <sup>177</sup>Lu are used. <sup>90</sup>Y emits beta particles with a high maximum energy (E<sub>max</sub> 2.27&#x000a0;MeV) and long maximum particle range in tissues (10&#x000a0;mm), whereas <sup>177</sup>Lu has lower energy (E<sub>max</sub> 0.497&#x000a0;MeV) and a shorter particle range in tissues (maximum 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mm).</p><p>This isotope has a small &#x003b3;-emission which makes it suitable for post-therapeutic scintigraphic imaging [133&#x000a0;keV (6.5%); 208&#x000a0;keV (11%)]. Studies that evaluated the efficacy of total doses of 7.4&#x02013;20.2&#x000a0;GBq [<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotide treatment have demonstrated a good response in 10&#x02013;34% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another large trial (MAURITIUS) which evaluated response post <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-(<sc>D</sc>)Na<sup>1</sup>-lanreotide (<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTALAN) in 154 patients has shown a partial response (PR) and disease stabilization in 14 and 41% of patients, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recent advances in somatostatin analogues have paved the way to the development of octreotate, which can be labelled with both <sup>177</sup>Lu and <sup>90</sup>Y radionuclides and is characterized by a higher affinity for somatostatin receptor type 2 leading to high tumour uptake.</p><p>The first clinical results of [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>,Thr<sup>8</sup>]octreotate (DOTATATE) therapy with a cumulative dose of 22.2&#x02013;29.6&#x000a0;GBq were described in 34 patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NET. The patients were followed up 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months after receiving the final dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At 3&#x000a0;months after the final administration, complete response (CR) was found in 1 patient (3%), PR in 12 patients (35%), stable disease (SD) in 14 patients (41%) and progressive disease (PD) in 7 patients (21%). The side effects of PRRT were few and mostly transient, with mild bone marrow suppression and nephrotoxicity, which were the most common finding.</p><p>de Jong et al. were the first to have described the use of combination treatment consisting of 50% <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE and 50% <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC in rats, demonstrating that survival rates were three times longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature that evaluated the use of this combination treatment in human subjects.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate combined <sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE therapy in patients with tumours of various sizes and non-homogeneous receptor distribution in comparison to <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE alone, using overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as primary clinical end points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw.

Clinical trials and radiochemistry examinations have demonstrated that both <sup>177</sup>Lu and <sup>90</sup>Y are suitable beta-emitting radionuclides for PRRT. It is speculated in the literature that <sup>90</sup>Y emits beta particles with longer path lengths and higher energies which may be preferable for larger tumours, while <sup>177</sup>Lu with shorter beta particle range and longer half-life may be preferable for small tumours. In our study we did not observe an influence of beta particle energy on size response of tumours (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Based on the fact that <sup>177</sup>Lu has a longer half-life, it will take longer to deliver the same dose as <sup>90</sup>Y. Therefore, in patients with tumours of various sizes and non-homogeneous receptor distribution, a possible solution might be the use of a combination of radionuclides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Another option is a sequential administration of these analogues, e.g. initial administration of <sup>90</sup>Y-labelled analogue to treat the larger tumours, followed by <sup>177</sup>Lu-labelled analogue in the next treatment cycle(s) for treatment of smaller metastases.</p><p>In our study we used OS and EFS as primary end points to assess the effect of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE only in comparison to combined <sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE therapy. As we know, this the first study in the literature that evaluated the role of combined PRRT in disseminated NETs. The OS after treatment in our patients was longer in the patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE in comparison to treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE only and longer than has previously been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>We observed longer EFS in the group treated with <sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE compared to treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE alone, but this was not statistically significant. This difference might be significant if the period of follow-up is longer. In addition, patients were not randomized, as group A was treated first and then group B at a later date.</p><p>A study by Kwekkeboom et al. about treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that median PFS was 33&#x000a0;months and median OS was 46&#x000a0;months. This may be related to a longer period of follow-up.</p><p>No serious adverse events occurred after treatment with either <sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE or <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE. The toxicity as assessed according to the WHO criteria was limited and without clinical manifestations in both groups of patients. Therefore, we conclude that treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE in disseminated or inoperable patients with NETs is feasible and safe. Clinical improvement could be observed and most patients have benefited from the treatment. We have demonstrated that this therapy is superior to <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE alone with a longer period of OS.</p><p>In addition the labelling and administration of DOTATATE in combined therapy was straightforward, and its application was safe.</p><p>The major limitation of this analysis, like other published PRRT studies, is the lack of randomization. CT treatment response is limited to anatomical changes and it is not sensitive enough to depict functional changes. That is why, for better inclusion and evaluation of therapy response, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT techniques with <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE should be used, which was not available in our department during the study.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results indicate that therapy with tandem radioisotopes (<sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE) provides longer OS than with a single radioisotope (<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE) and the safety of both methods is comparable. It seems that OS time and EFS time rather than WHO criteria for determining tumour burden should be used to assess the response to therapy.</p><p>However, more extensive studies with a larger number of patients are required both to establish the proportion of each isotope to be used in this dual therapy and to evaluate EFS over a longer period of follow-up.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Research Grant (6 P05 2004&#x000a0;C/6453 and 4/85195/1210/529) from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education.
