clinical diseases without being detected. However,
parasite may be transmitted to the fetus after pregnant
women are infected with the Toxoplasma gondii, so
the fetus may be aborted or affected with severe neurological impairment and corioretinitis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Evaluation of IgG, IgA, and IgM in order to diagnose the pending Toxoplasmosis may confront some
problems. Serum IgG is valuable when the first test
is negative, but the second one, after a few weeks,
is positive. On the other hand, serum IgM remains
positive for several months. Also, Rheumatoid factor
(RF) causes false positive IgM. When the pregnant
woman has high Toxo IgG and positive IgM, different
tests must be perform for clarifying between a new
infection or an old infection of Toxoplasma. In the
cases with high levels of positive IgG and IgM before pregnancy, the embryo would be protected against
Toxoplasma gondii infection, but in those cases with
positive test result after pregnancy, the embryo is subjected to a serious risk. Initially, IgG avidity test has
been applied through denaturalization technique for
diagnosis of the congenital Rubellosis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In 1989, Hedman introduced a new method, named
avidity test, which was based on the tendency of connecting immunoglobulin to Toxoplasma gondii polyvalent antigens using high density of urea to differentiate the high tendency of immunoglobulin. This test
is recently used for detecting Toxoplasma IgG avidity
(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). IgG avidity in initial steps of Toxoplasmosis infection is low, but the avidity of IgG from an old infection is very high. According to the recent researches, when the avidity is lower than 40%, it indicats
initial infection or active steps, but when it is higher
than 50%, it shows an old infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In other studies, avidity titers lower than 30% has been reported as
low avidity (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Increased titer of Toxoplasma IgG
can also be used in recognition of recent Toxoplasmosis infection, but its monitoring requires a longer time
that might be harmful to the embryo (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Several researches have been shown that Toxo IgG
avidity can be useful in the recent active Toxoplasmosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>- <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The timely diagnosis and treatment
of Toxoplasmosis during pregnancy may protect the
embryo from infection and consequent damages (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
Nowadays, regardless of high concentration of serum
IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in avidity
tests with commercial kits, a single sample of patient&#x02019;s
blood with high concentrations of urea is tested (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>It seems that interference of high serum levels of
IgG against Toxoplasma test results causes the negative outcomes. Our pilot research study showed both
IgG Toxo concentration of 100 u /mL to 600 u /mL
rise, the test problem is that it can have false negative
results (Percent of avidity remains high). Therefore, if
patient&#x02019;s serum is diluted to different ratios before testing, appropriate dilution of the serum antibodies will
be implemented and better results will be obtained.</p><p>In a comparative study of four commericaly available toxo avidity kits, one in three different dilutions
of serum, while the other with single sample dilution
were used, but it did not accurately determine that
what dilutions of serum was the appropriate sample
with no false negative result (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In current study,
modification and importance of improved Toxoplasma Avidity IgG testing has been evlauated for differentiating of Toxoplasma gondii infection in early
stage of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and population</title><p>
This experimental study included 300 pregnant
women in their initial months of pregnancy with
risk of Toxoplasmosis between August, 2010 and
August, 2012. We randomly divided 300 serum
samples into A group (n=60) with high avidity and
B group (n=40) with borderline avidity.</p><p>The women were referred to a reference Toxo avidity laboratory (Dr. Bonyadi&#x02019;s lab, Tabriz, Iran). The
result showed that both serum levels of Toxo IgG
and IgM were positive. The avidity Toxo testing in
patients was performed with single serum samples.
The samples with Toxo IgG levels were classified to
the following four subgroups: subgroup 1.100-199
Iu/ml, subgroup 2.200-299 Iu/mL, subgroup 3. 300-
399 Iu/mL, and subgroup 4.&#x0003e;400 Iu/mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test</title><p>
The levels of anti-toxoplasma IgG and IgM were
measured at the beginning of pregnancy according
to manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction (Vircell Microbiology
Co, Granada, Spain). The measurement of Toxo-IgG
was quantitative, but that of Toxo-IgM was conducted
through an index report by computing the cutoff point.</p></sec><sec><title>Avidity test using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay</title><p>Serial dilution from samples were prepared in the
four series, including 1/3x, 1/6x, 1/9x, and 1/18x,
which the "x" is the base dilution according to the kit
instructions (In Vircel and Acone kit: x=20, while in
Radim: x=100). For example, serial dilutions for Vircell and Acone kit are as follows: 1/60, 1/120, 1/180,
and 1/360, while those for Radim Kit are as follows:
1/300, 1/600, 1/900, and 1/1800. A total of 400 tests
were carried out according to Headmen&#x02019;s method.
Headmen&#x02019;s method includes urea with concentration
of 6 Mol placed in an incubation for 10 minutes, while
one sample with urea and other sample without urea
following the formula. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Patient&#x02019;s diluted sera were
added to micro plates coated with Toxoplasma antigen. In the second step, concentrated (8M) urea solution was added to the antigen-antibody mixture. After
washing excess antibody, labeled anti-IgG antibody
was added to the test micro plates. After 30 minute
of incubation and re-washing, substrate solution was added, and in the final step, the reaction was stopped
by adding sulfuric acid. The optical density (OD) was
measured at 450 nm against the differential wavelength of 600 nm. The avidity was calculated by the
following formula: Avidity Index (%)=(OD sample
treatment with urea-OD blank)/(OD sample treatment
without urea)&#x000d7;100.</p><p>The average light absorption of 100 samples with

Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software package version 16.0 for windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, USA). Quantitative data were presented as
mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD), while qualitative
data were demonstrated as frequency and percent (%).
For statistical analysis, collected data were studied using descriptive statistical methods. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tabriz
University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), which was

by Hedman in 1989. Varios companies then produced commercial kits in order to routinize the
test. Almost in all kits, the avidity test is used on
a single serum sample, and if a good method is
not be selected, false toxoplasmosis results followed by low avidity value may occure during
the first months of pregnancy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Serological
diagnosis of toxo IgG and IgM from a single
sample can not clearly identify acute infection
from chronic one. The resaon is that IgM antibodies tend to remain for years after a primary
infection (which emerge early infection), even
with high titers (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Toxo IgM may be stable
from six months to 12 years (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), so applying an avidity test is the best way to differentiate
acute infection from a chronic one. If the characteristics of avidity test reduce, a challenge in
diagnosis and treatment of toxoplasmosis may
occur. Terefore, by improing avidity method at
different concentrations of 100 to 600 iu/ml, we
can elevate its sensitivity and specifity.</p><p>The exact time of occurance of Toxoplasmic infection is a frequent and difficult challeng in laboratories handling sample from pregnant women,
particularly the treatment must start as early as
possible to protect the fetus (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In this study,
we investigated the changes for improving the
methods of avidity testing to obtain an appropriate
serum dilution and to get actual results far from the
false negative.</p><p>As it was described in method, serum of patients
were prepared in different dilutions, and were tested by various commercial kits . The study showed
that a proper index of avidity occurred at a certain
point of dilution, at which it would have a high
specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>). Some of theses commercial kits have been predicted two limiting dilutions for
avidity index (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>These kits are prior to those in which only a single sample is used, but the present study showed
that two dilutions of serum samples are not sufficient. The ranges of low avidity and borderline are
important, so different studies showed the following wide ranges for them: platelia kit &#x0003c;40% (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) ,
DIESSE and TESTLINE kit &#x0003c;30% (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>),Vidas kit
&#x0003c;20 % (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and liesenfeld study &#x0003c;50% (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).
It is because of performance of avidity test on a
single sample.</p><p>The mesurement of IgG avidity has shown its
power in various clinical settings, especialy in
situations where timing and differentiation of primary and secoundary infections are crucial (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).
However, by improving the method of measuring IgG avidity in mean and high concentrations,
the power of differentiation of this test may be
increased.</p><p>Nowadays, several commercial kits are available for measuring of toxo IgG avidity. There
are not many available published cross-evaluations of their diagnostic performances. A high
assay modified in-house for avidity determination was observed with immunocompromised
patients and healthy adults (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In another
study, a poor correlation has been shown among
three commercial IgG-avidity assays (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The
following reports, however, have criticized important points (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>High concenteration of Toxo IgG affects the
results of avidity. In our study, the best point of
dilution for a good avidity, in both high and borderline avidities, is marked with arrows in figures
1-8. This study revealed that improved methods
of measuring Toxo avidity IgG has got a great
