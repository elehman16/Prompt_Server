Early research focused on comparisons of ionic (e.g. ioxaglate) and non-ionic (e.g. iohexol; Omnipaque<sup>&#x02122;</sup>) CAs; iohexol was found to have a moderately better haemodynamic profile than ioxaglate [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thrombogenicity is considered to be a risk of CA use, but the data are contradictory: non-ionic iopamidol was found to generate more thrombus than ionic diatrizoate in patients undergoing intervention procedures, but use of non-ionic iohexol during high risk percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was associated with reduced incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; 5.4%), compared to ioxaglate (9.5%) [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The notion that modulation of thrombotic potential is central to differential risk associated with CA [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] gave rise to a number of in vitro studies to determine the impact of CA on platelet function. However, the direct inhibitory effects of CA on platelet activation in vitro [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147196.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] do not reflect the clinical data. Indeed, ioxaglate has been shown to have a powerful inhibitory effect on thrombus formation in vitro, while non-ionic CA actively induce formation of thrombus that is particularly resistant to thrombolysis [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Iohexol-induced resistance to thrombolysis might be compounded in vivo because iohexol, but not ioxaglate, increases plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], with the potential to reduce fibrinolysis and increase thrombotic risk&#x02014;a finding that contradicts clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>More recently, another category of CA has emerged&#x02014;the non-ionic dimers (e.g. iodixanol; Visipaque<sup>&#x02122;</sup>). Evidence suggests that iodixanol has a favourable outcome profile in coronary angiography, not only compared to ionic ioxaglate in high-risk patients undergoing coronary angioplasty [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but also compared to the non-ionic monomer, iohexol, especially in patients with unstable angina [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In vitro platelet studies do not provide a clear answer as to how the benefits of iodixanol are realised: thrombus formation has been found to be more substantial with this CA than with either iohexol or ioxaglate, but iohexol had the additional disadvantage of enhanced platelet degranulation [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, other studies have shown a reduced impact of iodixanol on platelet activation than iohexol or diatrizoate [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and a less detrimental effect in cultured endothelial cells than either iohexol or ioxaglate [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. An impact of CA on the endothelium provides a particularly interesting route to thrombosis because endothelial cells can influence platelet function both through release of pro- and anti-platelet mediators (e.g. nitric oxide, prostacyclin, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and through generation of pro- and anti-fibrinolytic factors&#x02014;tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], respectively. Endothelial function is also highly responsive to oxygen-centred free radicals (oxidative stress) and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], both of which have been implicated in the aetiology of CA-induced nephrotoxicity.</p><p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that iodixanol, but not iohexol, influences the release of t-PA and PAI-1 to favour increased fibrinolysis in patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. In addition, we measured platelet-monocyte conjugates as a recognised surrogate for cardiovascular risk [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Given the well-recognised sensitivity of both the endothelium and platelets to oxidative stress, oxygen-centred free radical generation from iodixanol and iohexol was measured <italic>in vitro</italic> to assess the potential for oxidative stress to play a role in CA-induced thrombosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical approval from the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (REC: 11/S0802/14, IRAS ID: 70700) was obtained in advance of the study (approval date 24/3/2011), which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments.

This in vitro assay involved dilution of CA to 80% v/v using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to facilitate uptake into capillary tubes (50 &#x003bc;l) prior to incubation with an oxygen-centred radical-specific spin trap (Tempone-H; 1 mM) at 37&#x000b0;C. Parallel experiments with and without vitamin C (200 &#x003bc;M) were conducted to examine the impact of an antioxidant on the signals generated. Samples were measured at 15 min intervals for 1 h in an EPR spectrometer (MS200 miniscope spectrometer; Magnettech, Germany; parameter settings: B0-field, 335.6mT; sweep width, 5 mT; sweep time, 30 sec; modulation amplitude, 0.15 mT; microwave power, 20 mW; microwave frequency, 9.3 GHz). The principle of the assay is that oxygen-centred radicals react with the spin trap to generate a spin-adduct (4-oxo-tempo), which is a stable free radical that generates a characteristic EPR spectrum [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] when excited with microwaves.

This study examined the differences between two of the most commonly used CA, iohexol and iodixanol, on factors central to the fibrinolytic process and on platelet-monocyte conjugation as a marker of thrombotic risk, with a view to informing the debate over CA choice.</p><p>The key findings were that t-PA activity was reduced in patients receiving iohexol, but remained unchanged in those receiving iodixanol. Platelet-monocyte conjugation was substantially reduced following angiography, but there was no difference between the extent of conjugate reduction in the groups receiving different CAs. Iohexol also generated oxygen-centred free radicals at a substantially faster rate than iodixanol <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>t-PA is a crucial endothelium-derived fibrinolytic factor that activates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Activity of t-PA is modulated by PAI-1, a factor that is also generated by the endothelium as well as by activated platelets. PAI-1 conjugates with t-PA to inactivate it; the balance of these two factors is central to determining the extent of fibrinolysis. Ionic and non-ionic CAs differentially affect PAI-1; iohexol has been found to have a detrimental effect with respect to PAI-1 release compared to ioxaglate [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The current study investigated the newer non-ionic dimeric CA, iodixanol, to establish if it behaved in the same way as iohexol with respect to PAI-1 generation. Our findings indicate that iodixanol has little impact on the balance of t-PA to PAI-1, whereas iohexol causes a net reduction in t-PA activity. Although both iohexol and iodixanol reduce t-PA antigen, t-PA activity remains unchanged in the iodixanol group on account of equivalent modulation of PAI-1 release. Iohexol, on the other hand, induces a larger reduction in t-PA antigen than PAI-1 antigen, resulting in the measurable loss in t-PA activity. The effects seen were not confounded by circadian fluctuations [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147196.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] because all angiograms were conducted in the morning and the pre- and post-angiogram samples were drawn only 20&#x02013;30 min apart. That non-ionic iodixanol more closely aligns with ionic ioxaglate [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] than with non-ionic iohexolin in this regard suggests that the effects of CAs on fibrinolytic factors are not related to their ionic characteristics. Nor does it appear that the effects are mediated by a dilution effect of CA administration, given that plasma protein was not significantly affected by either CA. Instead, it seems that chemical characteristics specific to iohexol drive a net loss in t-PA activity on account of a mis-match between loss of t-PA antigen and PAI-1 antigen. The reduced PAI-1 activity in our study was at odds with the findings of a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], in which PAI-1 activity was found to increase with iohexol; the major difference between the two studies was the patient group (suspected pulmonary embolism as opposed to coronary artery disease) and it is plausible that fibrinoloyic factors could be differentially affected in these quite diverse patient groups. The impact of reduced t-PA activity with iodixanol <italic>in vivo</italic> would compound the recognised resistance of thrombi formed with non-ionic CA to thrombolysis <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These characteristics, coupled with a reduced propensity to platelet degranulation [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], might help to explain the improved outcome in patients receiving iodixanol compared to those receiving iohexol.</p><p>Platelet function has long been known to be affected by CAs, but this is the first study to measure platelet-monocyte conjugation as a marker of thrombotic potential. Exposure to both CAs reduced platelet-monocyte conjugates, suggesting an antithrombotic effect, although statistical significance was only reached for iodixanol in this small study. There was no significant difference between the extents of reduced platelet-monocyte conjugation between the two CAs tested. These findings are in agreement with previous data suggesting that CAs have antiplatelet effects <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147196.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Taking into account both the platelet-monocyte conjugation and the fibrinolytic factor data, it can be surmised that CAs might reduce risk of thrombosis in the short term but that, should a thrombotic event occur, patients receiving iohexol might suffer more severe effects on account of depressed fibrinolytic defence. The findings shift the emphasis of CA-induced dysfunction away from platelets and towards the endothelium, as the principal source of t-PA and PAI-1, and the vasoactive factors that it generates.</p><p>Endothelial activity is highly sensitive to oxidative stress, so we explored whether there were differences in oxygen-centred free radicals generation from iohexol and iodixanol that might contribute to the effects seen. Previous findings suggest that CAs have an antioxidant effect overall and that iodixanol is more potent in this regard than iohexol [<xref rid="pone.0147196.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but the current study indicates that iohexol induces substantial spontaneous oxygen-centred free radical formation compared to iodixanol; the radical production is partially quenched by a moderate concentration of the antioxidant, vitamin C, confirming that the signal is mediated by oxygen-centred radical generation.</p><p>At present, we have no evidence to link the free radical generation seen with iohexol to endothelial dysfunction or to the impact on PAI-1 and t-PA. However, the current data could provide an explanation as to why there are differential effects of these CAs on release of fibrinolytic factors. The hypothesis that oxygen-centred radical generation from iohexol drives endothelial dysfunction with respect to release of fibrinolytic factors is worthy of further investigation.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This was a small, but adequately powered study for the primary outcomes. In addition, the study was only conducted in men undergoing elective angiography. A large, multi-centre trial is justified to determine whether the results are reproduced at scale.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Iohexol and iodixanol both induced an inhibitory effect on platelet-monocyte conjugation, suggestive of an anti-thrombotic effect of both CAs. However, iohexol also induced a significant reduction in t-PA activity compared to iodixanol, implying that fibrinolytic capability is impaired after use of this agent. These findings contribute to the debate over which CA to use and justify a larger outcome study to establish whether the physiological changes reflect in major adverse coronary events, which could help cardiologists to make fully informed decisions regarding which CA to use in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147196.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Ethics Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147196.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147196.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Consort checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147196.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147196.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Data for Pre- and post-angioplasty measures, absolute change and % baseline change for all parameters measured (mean&#x000b1;SE for pre-and&#x02013;post angioplasty data and absolute change; all normally distributed, as assess by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; median (interquartile range) for % change, which was not consistently normally distributed).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147196.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147196.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistical analyses associated with <xref rid="pone.0147196.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147196.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147196.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistical analyses associated with <xref rid="pone.0147196.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147196.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147196.s006"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistical analyses associated with <xref rid="pone.0147196.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147196.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147196.s007"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistical analyses associated with <xref rid="pone.0147196.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147196.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Coronary Thrombosis Trust and NHS Highland R&#x00026;D Endowments.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CA</term><def><p>contrast agent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPR</term><def><p>electron paramagnetic resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MACE</term><def><p>major adverse cardiac events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAI-1</term><def><p>plasminogen activator inhibitor-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SE</term><def><p>standard error of the mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>t-PA</term><def><p>tissue-type plasminogen activator</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0147196.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bettmann</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name>. <article-title>Comparison of an ionic with a nonionic contrast agent for cardiac angiography.
