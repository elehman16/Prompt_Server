These are including central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular complication.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Emergence from anesthesia is associated with sympathetic stimulation and, therefore, may result in tachycardia, hypertension, and arrhythmia.</p><p>Closed control of blood pressure is very important during craniotomy. It is assumed that the brief periods of hypertension during emergence from anesthesia may result in the occurrence of postoperative bleeding and cerebral edema. It is generally preferable to avoid the occurrence of hypertension by preemptive therapy. There are many drugs that can be used to control emergence hypertension such as diltiazem, lidocaine, labetalol, esmolol, and intravenous opiates such as morphine, alfentanil, and remifentanil are used. But there is no single or commonly accepted method.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Kross <italic>et al</italic>. compared the efficacy of the combination of enalapril/labetalol with that of enalapril/nicardipine to prevent emergence postcraniotomy hypertension and reported that systolic blood pressure was similarly controlled in both groups. There was a marginally smaller incidence of failures and adverse effects with labetalol. Blood pressure profiles were similar for both groups.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Goma and Ali, also compared the anti-hypertensive effects of both remifentanil and esmolol infusion in control of emergence hypertension after craniotomy for brain tumor surgery, they concluded that remifentanil can be used to control blood pressure during emergence of anesthesia after craniotomy for brain tumors. It has higher rapid recovery score than esmolol and other narcotics.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, there have been no studies concerning the comparison of the effect of labetalol and morphine on blood pressure and pulse rate in patients undergoing craniotomy.</p><p>Labetalol is an adrenergic receptor blocking agent that has an effect on both selective alpha-1 and nonselective beta receptors, with the ratio of alpha to beta of 1/7 which is used for hypertension treatment and control. It has a rapid onset of action. Its maximum action begins within 5 min and has the duration of 5 h. Its initial dose is 10&#x02013;20 mg in 2 min and then 40&#x02013;80 mg in 10 min until the total dose of 300 mg, and then the infusion of 2 mg/min.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This drug does not increase intracranial pressure and improves cerebral perfusion pressure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Morphine is an opioid analgesic drug, a recreational drug and the main psychoactive chemical in opium. In clinical medicine, morphine is regarded as the gold standard, or benchmark, of analgesics used to relieve intense pain and suffering. Relative contraindications of morphine are acute respiratory depression, raised intracranial pressure, including head injury, renal failure, chemical toxicity, biliary colic.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, in case of preventing unintentional complications, there is controversy over using the type of drug after craniotomy surgery.</p><p>The aim of this study was conducted to compare the efficacy and preventative effects of morphine and labetalol in controlling blood pressure and pulse during emergence from anesthesia in craniotomy for brain tumors as well as postoperative complications in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This is a double-blind clinical trial which was conducted at Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan - Iran in 2013. The study population consists of patients suffering from brain tumor who were candidated for craniotomy surgery in this hospital. After approval by our local ethic committee and obtaining informed written consent, 60 patients aged between 18 and 64 years old, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (1 and 2) undergoing craniotomy that were randomized with the use of randomization tables, included in this study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included sensitivity to labetalol and morphine, smoking, alcoholism, opium addiction, asthma and history of arrhythmia, contraindications of consumption of labetalol and morphine, and brain stem tumors.</p><p>Sample size was calculated through the formula of sample size estimation to compare averages, and with respect to 95% confidence level and 80% test power. The postoperative variance of blood pressure was estimated 1.1, and the least significant difference between two groups was estimated 0.8, based on 30 patients in each group.</p><p>We studied 60 patients undergoing craniotomy, who were randomly allocated into two groups of 30. All patients had presurgery visit and after receiving premedication (All patients received midazolam 0.1 mg/kg 1 h before induction of anesthesia) were dispatched to the operating room. In order to start the induction of anesthesia, fentanyl (1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg), midazolam (5 mg), and propofol (2 mg/kg) and then atracurium (0.15 mg/kg) and lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) were used. The maintenance of anesthesia was conducted using propofol (100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min). In case of fluid therapy, in addition to maintenance fluid which were NaCl 0.9% and ringer's lactate in alternate order, normal saline with 3 times the volume of blood was compensated for low bleeding and real blood was compensated for high bleeding. Diuretic fluid was compensated by 5 ml/kg of 5% NaCl and urine of patients was balanced by isotonic NaCl with an equivalent volume of urine. Furthermore, insensible water-loss was balanced using isotonic NaCl in each patient. If hypotension or bradycardia occurred, we administered Phenylephrine (100 &#x003bc;g) and atropine (0.5&#x02013;1 mg), respectively. Nitroglycerin (5 &#x003bc;cg/min) was used to treat hypertension and if tachycardia occurred fentanyl 100 &#x003bc;g was administered. Hypotension and bradycardia are defined as more than 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure and heart rate, respectively, from the basic values.</p><p>Labetalol with dose of 10 mg over 10 min was injected into patients of the first group at 45 min before finishing dressing and then 0.75 mg/min until 35 min later. Morphine with bolus dose of 0.1 mg/kg was injected into the second group. The studied drugs were administered by the second anesthetist who was not aware of injected drugs. The extubation time (the time from discontinuation of anesthetic drugs till the tracheal extubation), blood pressure and pulse of the patients were measured at the beginning and then every 10 min up to 40 min, and then it was measured every 5 min up to 15 min after surgery. The results along with patient's demographic data were recorded by the second anesthetist in a special questionnaire which had been designed for this purpose. We did not find any side effects of labetalol and morphine in patients.</p><p>Our data were analyzed by using repeated measured design analysis of variance (ANOVA), <italic>t</italic>-test and chi-square test by applying SPSS version 22 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

In labetalol group, 6 patients were excluded from the study, due to arrhythmia (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and hypertension (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Patients in two groups were similar in demographic variables including age, sex, weight, and also according to anesthesia duration and type of surgery. Since these factors can affect the results, their confounding effect was neutralized in this study, and the results are most likely related to the difference in the effects of morphine and labetalol.</p><p>By evaluating hemodynamic parameters of patients during surgery and recovery, it was found that patients receiving labetalol had lower systolic pressure at the time of extubation and had lower diastolic pressure during 45 min before dressing as well as at the time of extubation. Patients receiving labetalol had better hemodynamic stability, but in morphine group, some fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate were observed.</p><p>In both groups, the duration of staying in recovery were similar, but extubation time was significantly shorter in labetalol group in comparison with morphine group. This difference may be due to the sedative effect of morphine which results in delayed awareness for extubation.</p><p>On the other hand, during the study, no postoperative complications were seen in both groups in terms of hemodynamic parameters. Other studies have revealed that using labetalol in craniotomy surgeries makes a better hemodynamic stability in patients after extubation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>For example, Kross <italic>et al</italic>. compared the efficacy of the combination of enalapril/labetalol with that of enalapril/nicardipine to prevent emergence postcraniotomy hypertension and reported that systolic blood pressure was similarly controlled in both groups. There was a marginally smaller incidence of failures and adverse effects with labetalol. Blood pressure profiles were similar for both groups.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In a study which was carried out in 2012, Do <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of intravenous labetalol administration on hemodynamic responses during desflurane inhalation. They reported that administration of intravenous labetalol is effective in attenuating tracheal intubation and desflurane-induced hemodynamic responses.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Moreover, in 2012, Owens studied the control of blood pressure in acute cerebrovascular disease. He recommended that nicardipine and labetalol are appropriate for rapidly treating hypertension during cerebrovascular emergencies.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The results of these studies were almost similar to our findings that in patients receiving labetalol, blood pressure was lower during emergence from anesthesia.</p><p>In our study, in labetalol group, complications of this drug were rare; it may be explained by the rapid distribution of labetalol in the body. In addition, the extubation time and the emergence from anesthesia were shorter, and the awareness of patients was rapider in this group. These findings are valuable for postoperative evaluation of neurological functions in patients undergoing craniotomy.</p><p>Moreover, labetalol reduces blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, but keeps the cardiac output, therefore, cerebral blood flow is not endangered by this drug and it may be an appropriate drug in treating uncontrolled blood pressure during craniotomy.</p></sec><sec
