We designed a community-based intervention called &#x0201c;Health Scouts&#x0201d; to promote uptake and adherence to HIV services in a highly HIV-prevalent fishing community in Rakai, Uganda. Using a situated Information, Motivation, and Behavioral skills theory framework, the intervention consists of community health workers, called Health Scouts, who use motivational interviewing strategies and mobile health tools to promote engagement in HIV treatment and prevention services.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The Health Scout intervention is being evaluated through a pragmatic, parallel, cluster-randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The study setting is a single high-HIV-prevalence fishing community in Rakai, Uganda divided into 40 contiguous neighborhood clusters each containing about 65 households. Twenty clusters received the Health Scout Intervention; 20 clusters received standard of care. The Health Scout intervention is delivered within the community at the household level, targeting all residents aged 15&#x000a0;years or older. The primary programmatic outcomes are self-reported HIV care, antiretroviral therapy, and male circumcision coverage; the primary biologic outcome is population-level HIV viremia prevalence. Follow-up is planned for about 3&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">HIV treatment and prevention service engagement remains suboptimal in HIV hotspots.

Treatment and prevention service cascades&#x02014;which depict engagement and loss of service users and people living with HIV along the continuum of service delivery&#x02014;have fostered skepticism about whether high CHP coverage goals are realistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and highlight the need for effective and sustainable implementation strategies that are not primarily facility-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Current studies to evaluate CHP mostly involve well-resourced approaches, limiting reproducibility and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Empirical testing of CHP implementation approaches that are practical and community-based are, therefore, needed.</p><p id="Par19">HIV hotspots are geographically defined areas of extremely high HIV transmission and prevalence. Hotspots are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., certain mining and fishing communities), and may compromise national and regional HIV prevention efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Joint United National Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have made HIV hotspots a central focus of their HIV response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, rigorous evidence on comprehensive and effective CHP strategies for hotspots is limited and, therefore, a priority research need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many Lake Victoria fishing communities, the setting for this trial, are hotspots due to a number of factors increasing HIV risk, including high rates of condomless sex, multiple sex partners, prominent sex work, and prevalent alcohol misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Fishing communities represent a critical challenge to HIV prevention in Uganda and the wider region. The fishing community hosting this research has the highest HIV prevalence, approximately 40%, ever reported from the Lake Victoria region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is a place where HIV prevention and service needs are great, yet resources and health system infrastructure are modest. A community-based approach offers an opportunity to work with the community to devise potential solutions to HIV-related challenges. Successful HIV efforts in this setting may provide a model for similar settings.</p><p id="Par21">Community health workers (CHWs), using mobile health technologies (mHealth) and motivational interviewing (MI) strategies to tailor intervention messaging, may represent a high-impact and sustainable CHP implementation strategy, particularly in HIV hotspots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. CHW impact could be optimized by mHealth tools as sub-Saharan Africa has some of the fastest mobile phone growth rates in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. CHW effectiveness could be further enhanced using evidence-based, MI counseling techniques that emphasize a client-centered approach. We therefore designed the &#x0201c;Health Scouts&#x0201d; mLAKE trial (mHealth Lakefolk Actively Keeping Engaged) which is a CHW-based, mHealth-supported, MI-informed, theory-based CHP implementation intervention being evaluated in an HIV hotspot fishing community in Rakai, Uganda. MI was chosen as the foundation of the CHW counseling strategy because of its cross-cultural robustness, and effectiveness with heterogeneous populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. HIV hotspots may particularly benefit from the MI techniques which emphasize taking into consideration complex contextual factors influencing client behaviors. mHealth could be of particular benefit in this setting in assisting CHWs through complicated counseling algorithms for individuals with multiple areas of HIV risk.</p><p id="Par22">Here, we present the study protocol for the mLAKE trial which began recruitment in September 2015 with follow-up planned until at least 2018. The objective of the study is to determine the impact of the CHW intervention on important HIV-related treatment and prevention outcomes, i.e,. HIV service uptake and population prevalence of viremia. This study is being conducted in a hotspot fishing community because of the need for more effective interventions to improve treatment and prevention in high-HIV-burden, high-HIV-risk settings. The protocol format is guided by the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Checklist (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension to cluster-randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par23">The intervention setting is a fishing community (area approximately 2&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>, adolescent/adult population approximately 4400) on Lake Victoria in Rakai District in south-central Uganda. Rakai District is bordered to the south by Tanzania and to the east by Lake Victoria. The fishing community is approximately 235&#x000a0;km from Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Since 2011, the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) has been the primary provider of CHP services in this fishing community. These services include community-based demand generation (e.g., mass media such as radio-talk shows, community meetings, and drama shows), an HIV clinic which provides free pre-ART and ART care, community-based HIV testing, and mobile MC camps. In this community, ART is initiated at time of diagnosis, irrespective of CD4 count (i.e., test and start strategy) as fisherfolk have been designated a key population by the Ugandan Ministry of Health. The HIV prevalence in this community is approximately 40%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design overview</title><p id="Par24">The impact of the Health Scout intervention will be assessed through a pragmatic, parallel, cluster-randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1 and superiority framework (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The cluster-randomized design was chosen over other study designs as individual and household randomized designs were logistically difficult to implement and increased contamination risks; quasi-experimental designs were deemed less rigorous.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The mHealth Lakefolk Actively Keeping Engaged (mLAKE) study flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2243_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cluster design</title><p id="Par25">The largest of the fishing communities in the region was selected for the mLAKE trial and 40 was chosen as the number of randomization units. There were several reasons for choosing 40 units or clusters. First, we anticipated 10 Health Scouts being deployed, each of whom would initially be allocated the same number of clusters. Some variation in the type of clusters Health Scouts were assigned was desirable to enable more robust analytic inferences on Health Scout effects. Thus, each Health Scout needed to have at least two assigned clusters. As progressively larger number of clusters increased implementation complexity and risk of contamination, we selected 40 clusters, the minimum number needed to assign each Health Scout two clusters.</p><p id="Par26">The 40 clusters were then defined with consideration of implementation logistics, minimizing contamination, and geographic features such as roads, buildings, and the lake shoreline. Specifically, high-resolution satellite images of the community were digitized in ArcGIS 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Household GPS locations from a baseline community census conducted in mid-2015 were overlaid on the digitized map and the community was divided into 40 contiguous clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) each containing roughly the same number of eligible households and participants. Each cluster was estimated, using census data, to contain approximately 65 households with approximately 1.65 persons aged over 15&#x000a0;years (target population) in each household or approximately 107 potential eligible clients per cluster. Community-based participatory walks with the Health Scouts were conducted to confirm and refine cluster boundaries prior to participant enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>mHealth Lakefolk Actively Keeping Engaged (mLAKE) trial cluster map (intervention: clear, control; grayed)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2243_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

To explicitly describe the pragmatic characteristics of the trial, we used the PRECIS-2 tool (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

That is, a framework for Health Scout recruitment, training, tasks, quality assurance, and monitoring was developed, but the intervention is designed with flexibility to adapt to the needs, constraints, and secular changes during implementation. The framework included the following core components: (1) CHW (Health Scout)-based delivery; (2) counseling using MI strategies; (3) household-based delivery; and (4) mHealth-support. A situated Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (sIMB) theory-based conceptual framework was developed wherein Health Scouts would promote relevant tailored information, motivation, and behavioral skills to improve clients&#x02019; engagement in HIV treatment and prevention services, ultimately leading to improved HIV-related outcomes, including decreased HIV incidence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Health Scout intervention conceptual framework</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2243_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>

Residential training focused on mHealth application/smartphone use, confidentiality, disclosure, and CHP- and HIV-related knowledge. Field-based training focused on mock counseling role play, cluster boundary walk-throughs, and filling out Home Visit Forms. MI skills, a communication strategy that emphasizes a non-judgmental and non-confrontational approach to behavior change, were integrated into Health Scout training. After demonstrating basic competency with their assigned tasks, Health Scouts attempted to visit all &#x0201c;clients&#x0201d; (i.e., residents aged 15&#x000a0;years and older, any gender) within their clusters within 3&#x000a0;months of study initiation and follow-up each eligible client within their cluster every 3&#x000a0;months for approximately 3&#x000a0;years. During each visit, Health Scouts counsel clients with assistance from a smartphone application. Visits are anticipated to take approximately 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;min. Each Health Scout was assigned two clusters containing approximately 215 total eligible clients. Health Scouts were provided compensation for their activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Health Scout smartphone application</title><p id="Par31">The Health Scout smartphone application (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) functions as a decision and counseling support tool to guide Health Scouts through the sIMB- informed counseling session (emocha Mobile Health Inc., Baltimore, MD, USA). Using simple forms, the application takes the Health Scout through three steps: (1) household screening-household members are screened for age eligibility; (2) individualized counseling triage &#x02013; residents who are age-eligible are then individually asked a series of triage screening questions, e.g., age, gender, HIV status, to determine which counseling modules should be activated; and, (3) MI counseling-tailored counseling modules with MI-informed prompts and messages are provided for the Health Scout to review with the client.

The RCCS is an open, population-based cohort established in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The RCCS currently surveys individuals aged 15&#x02013;49 years in 40 agrarian, trading, and fishing communities in and near Rakai District, including the community where the mLAKE trial is being implemented. For all communities, the RCCS conducts a census of households with GPS coordinates recorded and all resident household members enumerated by gender, age, and duration of residence, regardless of whether they are present or absent. After census, the RCCS conducts interviews with consenting participants to assess demographics, sexual behaviors, and HIV service uptake. Data are directly entered using ultra-mobile PCs with pre-coded files and edited in the field for range and consistency checks to allow onsite correction of errors. Blood samples are collected for HIV-related tests and HIV viral load assays of HIV-positive persons. Following the interview, free HIV testing services using a three-rapid-test algorithm and post-test counseling are offered to consenting participants. The RCCS currently conducts its survey of the trial community approximately every 18&#x000a0;months. The existing RCCS research infrastructure allows for efficient assessment of all mLAKE trial outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Consent (adults)</title><p id="Par35">As this is an additive counseling service being offered only to community residents randomized to the intervention arm, consent to receive the counseling service will be obtained orally by the Health Scouts.

First, we defined a priori that we would accept up to 7.5% difference in baseline cluster level characteristics (including percentage of residents aged 20&#x02013;29 years in the cluster, percentage of women) and in primary study outcomes (including cluster level percentage of men circumcised, percentage of HIV-positive persons in care, percentage of HIV-positive persons taking ART, percentage HIV PVP). The 7.5% threshold was chosen for simplicity, consistency, and face validity. Second, we conducted 2500 independent, simple, computer-generated randomizations, assigning 20 clusters to one arm (coded as 0) and 20 clusters to a second arm (coded as 1). Third, among the 2500 randomizations, those who did not satisfy the above comparability criteria were removed, resulting in 455 eligible randomizations. Fourth, from the 455 randomizations, one randomization sequence was randomly drawn for allocation of intervention. Final assignment of arms (0 and 1) to intervention and control was done in a public coin-flip ceremony witnessed by study staff and the Health Scouts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par42">By nature of the intervention, Health Scouts and participants will not be blinded to intervention assignment.

Therefore, the relevant study power-related question was to estimate whether the trial had reasonable chance to detect public health-relevant differences in primary study outcomes, i.e., minimum detectable differences (MDD).

We then used prior data from 9&#x02013;10/2013 (approximately 18&#x000a0;months prior to the mid-2015 data) to project the expected prevalence of the primary outcomes expected for the control arm at the end of the trial (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The mLAKE trial is planned for approximately 36&#x000a0;months of follow-up, i.e., two RCCS rounds after the baseline 2015 round.

The mLAKE trial seeks to assess the impact of the Health Scout intervention in a pragmatic trial as one strategy for improving CHP implementation.</p><p id="Par58">The Health Scout intervention has several notable features. The Health Scout intervention is theory-based, using the sIMB model for care engagement, providing grounding for its application and evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It incorporates a motivational interviewing approach which has only been used in a small number of programs in sub-Saharan Africa despite evidence on its effectiveness in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The intervention also incorporates a novel mHealth application which acts as a counseling and decision support tool.

The cluster design is unusual as typically clusters are more geographically separate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the chosen cluster design was a pragmatic decision to allow a reasonable design for obtaining rigorous data on intervention impact. Close monitoring and reporting of intervention reach and control arm contamination will be critical to assessing the validity of study results. Additionally, the nature of the Health Scout intervention is complex and pragmatic. Secular and deliberate changes to the intervention, participants, and setting may occur over the course of the follow-up period. Thus, the planned process and mixed-methods evaluations will be helpful in providing a more comprehensive assessment of the implementation and impact of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">This study has a number of potential limitations. Contamination of control clusters may decrease study power to detect any true intervention effects. Secular changes, such as greater than anticipated scale-up of CHP services in control arms, may also decrease study power. Finally, findings from this study may not be easily generalizable outside of this particular HIV hotspot setting.</p><p id="Par61">In summary, the mLAKE trial seeks to test the impact of the Health Scout intervention on CHP implementation.
