We included a total number of 44 patients who suffered from knee pain and diagnosed as knee OA with radiological Grade II to III (based on Kellgren&#x02013;Lawrence grading scale) that referred to our center for management. All the patients were diagnosed to have OA according to the American Colleague of Rheumatology for diagnosis of knee OA.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] We excluded those with allergic reaction to tape or any skin problem that prevents the tape (based on the history and clinical signs of dermatologic allergic reaction), presence of any inflammatory arthritis, history of any injection at knee or any surgical intervention in this part within the last 6-month, suspicion to other pathologies in the knee, severe obesity (body mass index &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), OA Grade IV, the instability of the knee joint (determined by physical examination and radiology), cardiovascular disorders (due to cardiovascular side-effect of celecoxib), trauma to the knee during the study, no following the treatment by patients, and performing physiotherapy within treatment schedule. The study protocol was approved by Institutional Review Board and Medical Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.

Taping was performed bilaterally. In our taping method, we used three tape straps: The first Y-shaped tape was placed from top to bottom of the knee, the second Y-shaped tape was placed from the lateral to the medial of the knee, and the third I-shaped tape was placed over the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Knee taping method in the current study.

These exercises were taught to all the participants in three consecutive sessions. These included stretching the hamstring and calf muscles (holding stretch for 30 s, repeating the stretch throughout the session at least 5 times, three sessions per day) and strengthening quadriceps muscles (holding contraction of muscle for 10 s, repeating it throughout the session at least 5 times, three sessions per day). The volume and frequency of the exercise was checked by self-reported diary. Drug therapy in both groups performed also equally including similar doses of celecoxib (100 mg, 1&#x02013;3 capsules per day according to the pain severity that might be reduced by lowering the pain). Patients were prohibited taking other analgesics during treatment schedule. In addition to exercise therapy and medical therapy, the taping group received taping in three consecutive weeks. Tapes were replaced at each session and remained retained during the week. In case with the separation of the tape (which is very rare occurrence), the patient was referred to renew it. For all participants, pain severity was assessed using 100 mm visual analog scaling (VAS) method. To ensure that decrease in VAS score is not due to increase of analgesics, weekly amount of celecoxib capsules consumption was assessed. Furthermore, for measurement of taping effect on disability, timed get up and go test (TUG)[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and step tests[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were scheduled. These are validated and reliable functional test in knee OA.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In brief, the primary endpoint of the study was the pain intensity measured by VAS scale, results of TUG and step tests after 3 and 6 weeks of therapy. The secondary endpoints were the weekly amount of analgesic use after 3 and 6 weeks of therapy. All scores were assessed blindly by different physiatrist before the beginning of treatment as well as 3 and 6 weeks after the initial assessment. The patient and those applying the tapes were informed of the study group. Thus, it is a single-blinded study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To have 85% power to detect 5% difference in mean VAS scores between two study groups, with the perception of &#x003b1; = 0.05, a total number of 18 patients were required for each study group.

A systematic review claimed that there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of taping in knee OA.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] But another one, emphasize that knee taping effectively relieves knee pain.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Arora <italic>et al</italic>. studied immediate effect of taping in patients with knee OA and concluded significant pain relief and improvement in disability.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Hinman <italic>et al</italic>. had also shown that therapeutic tape reduces pain and disability (assessed by SF-36) in people with OA of knee 3&#x02013;6 weeks after taping.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we showed that the use of taping concurrently with other protocols not only can relieve knee pain even 3 weeks after tape removal but also can significantly improve knee function in a mid-time period. One advantage of our study was that we concurrently measured amount of analgesics consumption to be sure that change in VAS score is not caused by increasing amount of analgesic consumption. Another advantage was measurement of disability with two validated tests (step test and TUG). Arora <italic>et al</italic>. studied effect of taping in disability by functional test, just immediately after taping.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] However, we measured it during 6 weeks (3 weeks with tape and 3 weeks after tape removal). Hinman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] had also shown that therapeutic tape reduces disability by self-reported questionnaires (SF-36). However, we used performance base functional tests, and our study confirmed their result. In applying taping method, it should be considered that despite beneficial effects of this technique it has negligible side effects (only one case showed mild allergic reaction to tape) and low cost. Especially in old patients, diabetic and renal insufficient patients with knee OA, that have limitations in analgesics consumption, taping is a safe and effective methods for pain relief.</p><p>Based on previous research,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] applying McConnell taping and elastic bandage can reduce pain in patients with patellofemoral pain. Another study presented criteria for successful taping and standard bandage which was pain reduction on VAS scale. Therefore, increased reach distances after taping might occur due to the following reasons: (1) Pain reduction, (2) VMO muscle activity enhancement. It has been previously shown that in healthy subjects, vastus medialis activation is associated with anterior direction excursions.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] It has also been reported that knee taping is associated with improved onset of VMO activity.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This revealed that VMO insufficiency might have caused functional deficits in anterior directions in patients with patellofemoral pain. Consequently, dynamic postural control improvement, especially in anterior and anterolateral reach distances, has been due to VMO facilitation. (3) Knee joint stability improvement. It is possible that medial and lateral stabilities are the most sensitive measures of postural control.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Therefore, improvement in lateral and medial excursions following taping and standard bandage respectively can be attributed to magnitude enhancement of VMO activation.</p><p>We note some limitation to our study. First, the number of patients included in the current study was less than that of calculated as a sample size in control group. We required 18 patients in each group while the control group had 16 (due to the exclusion of the patients during the study). Thus, the study might be underpowered to detect significant differences between corresponding variables. However, final power calculation revealed 80% power for this study. The other limitation is that the follow-up period was just 6 weeks which can be less than expected. Thus, longer follow-up periods are required for the next studies to determine the long-term effects of knee taping on knee OA. The other limitation was that the exercise protocol was focused on strengthening the hamstring and calf muscles, and we did not focus on hip muscles and VMO strengthening. Overall this is among the first studies determining the effects of knee taping on disability and pain of the patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate more lowering knee pain, more improvement in knee function, and also less need for medication following use of taping in combination with other common treatment techniques such as exercise and anti-inflammatory medication in patients with knee OA.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of medical sciences</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all the patients and their families who participated in the study.
