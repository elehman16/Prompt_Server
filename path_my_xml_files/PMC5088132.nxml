resulted in the improvement in life environment and the extension of the average lifespan,
accelerating increase in the aged population. The population of those aged 65 or older has
continuously increased since 1990 and the population is 12.7% as of 2014 and expected to be
24.3% in 2030, and 40.1% in 2060. At this point when society is entering a super-aging
society resulting from an increase in average lifespan, elderly people&#x02019;s health has emerged
as a serious issue<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. To look at health
problems of the elderly, the rate of hypertension is highest at 54.8%, followed by
rheumatism and arthritis at 40.4%, and low back pain and ischialgia at 19.9%. Decrease in
physical activities in accordance with the industrialization of the society and degraded
physical functions caused by sedentary life increased the occurrence frequency of low back
pain and triggered an economic problem resulting from increases in treatment costs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low back pain is a pain in the lumbar region from the second lumbar vertebrae where the
nerves end to the sacroiliac articulation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a pain resulting from humans&#x02019; walking erect unlike other
animals and 80% of the whole population experiences low back pain during their lifetime. Ten
to twenty percent of acute low back pain becomes chronic due to pain and disability for
longer than three months<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The causes of
low back pain are diverse. Low back pain is divided into: spinal low back pain triggered by
direct vertebral legions such as herniation of intervertebral disc and lumbosacral sprain,
which are the most common causes, trauma, degeneration, inflammation, tumors, and congenital
deformity; low back pain brought about by different relevant diseases such as urolithiasis,
cystitis, all kinds of obstetric and gynecological diseases, and systemic diseases such as
diabetes; and psychogenic low back pain caused by mental tension and stress<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of elderly people, as they grow
older, they undergo degenerative changes of their vertebra, and gradual atrophy and decrease
in muscle strength around the vertebra lead to damage to their trunk soft tissues and the
weakening of muscle strength, which act as a main cause of low back pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Abdominal drawing-in method, which is effective for improving stability and balance senses
among different exercise methods effective for low back pain, pulls the abdominal wall
inward, contracting the internal oblique abdominal muscle and transversus abdominis muscle
and increasing intra-abdominal pressure. Abdominal drawing-in is an exercise method
effective for stabilization of the transversus abdominis muscle and the multifidus muscle.
The exercise also acts in activating the abdominal muscles and having hip joint muscles
stabilize the pelvis and as a result force is effectively delivered to the hip joint and the
lower limbs<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Myofascial release (MFR), one of the treatment methods for low back pain, is largely used
for adjusting pain in the musculoskeletal system lesions such as muscle fibers and
myofascial trigger points. In order to heighten treatment effects, muscular relaxation is
maximized. When MFR was applied to the iliopsoas muscle of chronic low back pain patients,
their low back pain decreased and their lumbar flexion increased. MFR is one of the
therapeutic exercises that may heighten flexibility of the muscles and mobility of the
joints<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, most hospitals apply basic physical therapy to the elderly in order to treat their
low back pain but do not provide a program using abdominal drawing-in or MFR. Accordingly,
this study compares the effects of abdominal drawing-in exercise and MFR programs on pain,
flexibility, and balance of the elderly females.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were elderly females aged 65 or older who consented to
participate in this study and signed an agreement for the experiment. This study was
approved by the research agency, and all participants provided written informed consent.
Those who were not able to perform the exercise due to spondylolysis, malignant tumor,
neurological lesion, or severe pain were excluded from this study. Forty elderly females who
had complained of low back pain for at least three months were randomly and equally divided
into an abdominal drawing-in group (n=20) and an MFR group (n=20). The age, height, and
weight of the abdominal drawing-in group were 69.4 &#x000b1; 4.1&#x02005;years old, 158.1 &#x000b1; 4.5&#x02005;cm, and 59.2
&#x000b1; 10.1&#x02005;kg, respectively. The age, height, and weight of the MFR group were 70.4 &#x000b1; 3.2&#x02005;years
old, 156.3 &#x000b1; 4.9&#x02005;cm, and 58.3 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x02005;kg.</p><p>The subjects conducted the exercises three times per week, for 40 minutes each time, for a
total of eight weeks. They conducted warm-up exercises for 10 minutes, main exercises for 20
minutes, and cool-down exercises for 10 minutes. The abdominal drawing-in group received
training using a pressure biofeedback device (Stabilizer, Chattanooga Group Inc., USA)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pressure biofeedback device is a
simple device providing feedback about the qualitative aspect and preciseness of exercises.
It is largely used for exercises to heighten stability of the neck, waist, and pelvis. The
subjects lied comfortably, flexed their knee joints at 90 degrees, and conducted the
exercise. The pressure biofeedback device was located at the waist of the subjects. The
subjects were instructed to pull the naval up and down so that the abdomen was slightly
hollow after the pressure of the device was increased a little. Each time the subjects
conducted the exercise for 10 seconds and took a rest for five seconds. Ten times were
considered as one set. They conducted the exercises for five to seven sets for 20
minutes<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For MFR, diverse techniques
for the waist were employed: shaking the ilium, relaxing one anterior superior iliac spine,
putting pressure on and relaxing the inguinal region of abdomen, putting pressure on the
iliopsoas muscle with both hands&#x02019; fingertips, putting pressure on the iliopsoas muscle with
both thumbs, putting pressure on the iliopsoas muscle with the palms after erecting the
knees, putting pressure on the iliopsoas muscle after flexing the hip joint, and putting
pressure on the iliopsoas muscle while flexing the hip joint and extending the knees<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to evaluate the subjects&#x02019; pain, a visual analogue scale was employed. Zero points
were given for no pain and 10 points were given for the severest pain. The subjects were
instructed to give a mark according to their degree of pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the testing of flexibility, a remodified schober test (RST)
was used to separate and measure movement of the lumbar region. The center of the line
connecting the subjects&#x02019; posterior superior iliac spine and a spot at 15&#x02005;cm above it was
marked. The distance change was measured when the subjects stood and flexed their spine
maximally<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tetrax (Tetrax Ltd.,
Ranmat Gan, Israel) was utilized to measure balance. Tetrax measures changes in pressure
applied to each force plate and shows the stability of the center of the gravity. This
equipment receives weight load and movement degree from four pressure sensing points and
shows weight distribution to the monitor, exhibiting balance distribution while standing.
Measurements were taken under the conditions of normal eye open (NO), normal eye closed
(NC), pillow with eye open (PO), and pillow with eye closed (PC)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Window SPSS 18.0 was used for the statistical analysis. A paired t-test was used for before
and after comparisons, and an independent t-test was used for between group comparisons with
a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Pain after the eight weeks of exercise was significantly different in both groups compared

resulted in improvement in life environment and an extension of the average lifespan. This
has led to an accelerating increase in the elderly population. As a result, health problems
for the elderly have emerged as a serious issue. Among them is the frequent and long lasting
occurrence of low back pain which gives a great deal of discomfort to their life. Elderly
people undergo restrictions to their activities due to pain and may experience joint
deformity and loss of agility, flexibility, and muscle strength. In addition, an increase in
pain and a decrease in flexibility can lead to a weakening of their balance ability. The
reason why balance is important is because loss of your sense of balance exposes elderly
people to the risk of falling, heightening the probability of injuries as a result<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Abdominal-drawing in exercise may stabilize the abdomen through training on consecutive
motor controls. According to a study, an abdominal drawing-in exercise group among low back
pain patients saw significant improvement in respiratory patterns and expiratory volume of
the abdomen<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study as well, the abdominal drawing-in exercise
group experienced a decrease in pain, which is considered to be the case because the
patients performed exercise for themselves and their muscle strength improved, decreasing
their pain. According to another study, after conducting tai chi exercise, elderly females
saw improvements in balance and gait and Korean dancing led to increases in their balance
ability, flexibility, and muscle strength. In addition, after muscle strengthening
exercises, their muscle strength and balance ability improved and after conducting health
physical exercises, their balance was enhanced<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study as well,
elderly females&#x02019; balance ability significantly improved after abdominal drawing-in
exercises. Abdominal drawing-in exercises may be simply performed anywhere. It is also
considered to change elderly people&#x02019;s slightly stooped posture and improve their balance.
Nonetheless, previous research on abdominal drawing-in exercises is lacking and a lot of
research is needed.</p><p>MFR is a treatment technique that induces imbalance of the body into a balanced condition
and into a stable and comfortable state. It is applied in order to maximally promote
relaxation of tense tissues that trigger pain<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a study, when MFR was applied to whiplash syndrome
patients, their pain decreased. MFR was effective for the treatment of neck pain
patients<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to another study,
when MFR was applied to neck pain patients, their extension angle significantly increased
and when it was applied to patients with a shortened iliopsoas muscle, their waist flexion
angle increased<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study as well, when MFR was applied to elderly
females with low back pain, their pain significantly decreased and their flexibility
significantly improved. It is considered that MFR decreased pain, which in turn increased
movement and flexibility. When elderly people with chronic low back pain relax the iliopsoas
muscle, their gait and lumbar flexion may be improved. Relaxation of the iliopsoas muscle
should be applied in a way of preventing secondary damages and giving help to their ordinary
life.</p><p>The present study showed that abdominal drawing-in exercise affected pain and balance and
MFR influenced pain and flexibility. Accordingly, based on the present study, objective and
efficient exercise should be applied when planning a rehabilitation program for elderly
females. A follow up study should consider pain, flexibility and balance in a comprehensive
manner to reduce elderly people&#x02019;s secondary injuries.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Statistics Korea: Elderly
