On day 7, a 10-h testing day was completed that included appetite and satiety questionnaires, blood sampling, predinner food cue&#x02013;stimulated functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, ad libitum dinner, and evening snacking.</p><p><bold>Results</bold>: The consumption of breakfast reduced daily hunger compared with BS with no differences between meals. Breakfast increased daily fullness compared with BS, with the HP breakfast eliciting greater increases than did the NP breakfast. HP, but not NP, reduced daily ghrelin and increased daily peptide YY concentrations compared with BS. Both meals reduced predinner amygdala, hippocampal, and midfrontal corticolimbic activation compared with BS. HP led to additional reductions in hippocampal and parahippocampal activation compared with NP. HP, but not NP, reduced evening snacking of high-fat foods compared with BS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Breakfast led to beneficial alterations in the appetitive, hormonal, and neural signals that control food intake regulation. Only the HP breakfast led to further alterations in these signals and reduced evening snacking compared with BS, although no differences in daily energy intake were observed. These data suggest that the addition of breakfast, particularly one rich in protein, might be a useful strategy to improve satiety, reduce food motivation and reward, and improve diet quality in overweight or obese teenage girls.

Recent evidence has isolated several key factors that play a critical role in the etiology of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). One in particular is the common, unhealthy dietary habit of breakfast skipping (BS)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2"><sup>4</sup></xref>, which is strongly associated with an increased prevalence of weight gain, increased BMI, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In addition, breakfast skippers have poor diet quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) and make poor food choices (eg, snacking on nutrient-poor, high-fat, and/or high-sugar foods and beverages) compared with breakfast consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). These data lend support for the addition of breakfast to combat obesity in young people.</p><p>Breakfast studies over the past 10 y have primarily examined the effects of ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) consumption on childhood and adolescent obesity and its associated risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In general, increased RTEC consumption is associated with lower BMI, lower percentage body fat, and a decreased prevalence of overweight/obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In a 10-y longitudinal observational study, girls who frequently ate RTEC during childhood exhibited a lower percentage body fat compared with those who skipped breakfast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Although there is clear evidence showing the benefits of an RTEC breakfast, limited data exist in comparing RTEC with other breakfast foods.</p><p>A diet rich in high-quality protein is gaining scientific support as a successful strategy to promote weight loss and/or prevent weight gain or regain in adults [<italic>see</italic> review by Westerterp-Plantenga et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>)]. One key factor in the effectiveness of higher protein meals/diets includes the improvement in appetite control and satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In our pilot studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), we showed that a protein-rich breakfast meal led to decreased appetite and increased satiety throughout the morning compared with skipping breakfast or consuming a normal-protein (NP) breakfast. We also showed that a protein-rich breakfast reduces prelunch neural activation in brain regions that control food motivation/reward compared with skipping breakfast or consuming an NP RTEC breakfast. Last, when assessing energy content consumed at an ad libitum lunch, we found that the consumption of a protein-rich breakfast led to fewer kilocalories consumed at lunch compared with BS or after the NP breakfast. Collectively, these data support the role for the daily consumption of protein-rich breakfast meals in young people who skip breakfast.</p><p>The current study extends the previous findings by examining the previous responses over the course of an entire day, not just throughout the morning. We also incorporated a novel approach of assessing evening energy intake through an ad libitum snack assessment. The objective of the current study was to examine whether a high-protein (HP) breakfast leads to daily improvements in appetite control, satiety, food motivation/reward, and evening snacking compared with NP RTEC breakfast meals in overweight/obese BS teenage girls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>Twenty overweight or obese BS teenage girls participated in this randomized crossover-design study. The participants randomly completed the following breakfast patterns at home for 6 d: <italic>1</italic>) BS, <italic>2</italic>) consumption of NP breakfast meals, or <italic>3</italic>) consumption of HP breakfast meals. On the seventh day of each pattern, the participants reported to the University of Missouri's Brain Imaging Center (MU-BIC) in the morning to complete the respective 10-h testing day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The participants began the day by either skipping breakfast or consuming their respective breakfast meal. Blood samples and assessments of perceived appetite and satiety were completed at specific times throughout the day. A standardized NP lunch was provided 4 h after breakfast. Before dinner, a brain scan was completed by using fMRI to identify brain activation patterns in response to food stimuli. After the fMRI, an ad libitum dinner was provided. The participants were then given evening snacks to consume ad libitum, at home, throughout the remainder of the day. There was a washout period of at least 7 d between each pattern.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p>Diagram of the 10-h testing day procedures.

This scan lasted &#x0223c;10 min. During the fMRI phase, the participants focused on a set of photographs that were projected onto a screen and easily viewed through a mirror. The fMRI paradigm, used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), incorporated stimuli from 3 categories of pictures, including food, nonfood (animals), and blurred baseline images. The pictures from each category were presented in blocks of images. Ten photographs (of the same type of stimuli) were presented per block. The scan involved 3 repetitions of each block of stimulus-producing images (ie, food, animals), alternated with blocks of randomized blurred images. Each photograph was projected for 2.5 s, with an interstimulus interval of 0.5 s. There was a total of 13 blocks of stimuli presented. Individual pictures were randomly assigned to appropriate blocks and were never repeated. Animal pictures were used to control for visual richness and general interest (ie, appealing but not appetizing). The functional scan lasted &#x0223c;7 min and was performed in duplicate. Scanning was performed at the MU-BIC on a 3-Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions).</p></sec><sec><title>Ad libitum dinner</title><p>The ad libitum dinner occurred 5 h after lunch and consisted of microwavable chicken parmesan pizza pockets. A single pocket contained 290 kcal (14% protein, 64% carbohydrate, and 22% fat). The participants were presented with 4 pockets cut into sections to blind them to the quantity being consumed. They were instructed to eat as much as they desired until feeling &#x0201c;comfortably full&#x0201d; within a 30-min timeframe. Additional pocket sections were provided as needed.

The cooler contained a total of 4000 kcal. All food items were initially recorded and weighed. The participants were instructed to return all uneaten foods as well as all wrappers and containers from the snacks that were consumed. Any partially eaten, returned items were weighed accordingly. The foods were then retrospectively grouped according to the following food categories: desserts, candy, salty foods, chocolate, high fat (ie, &#x0003e;5 g/serving), and healthy (ie, fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy and meat).</p></sec><sec><title>Data and statistical analysis</title><p>Power analyses were performed before the start of the study to identify appropriate sample size. The effect size (ES) of the protein-related changes after the breakfast treatments from our pilot studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) were determined for the following outcomes: postbreakfast perceived hunger (ES = 1.48), postbreakfast PYY (ES =1.50), subsequent meal energy intake (ES = 0.58), and prelunch neural activation in the amygdala (ES = 0.91). These ESs indicated that a sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 20, &#x003b1; = 0.05, would provide &#x0003e;80% power to detect differences between breakfast treatments.</p><p>To assess the perceived appetite, satiety, and hormonal responses over a total of 8 h, AUC was calculated from the fasting (baseline) time point and the postbreakfast time points for each outcome. We further divided the testing days into 4 time segments to represent early and late morning (ie, 0&#x02013;120 min postbreakfast and 120&#x02013;240 min, respectively) as well as early and later afternoon (ie, 240&#x02013;360 min postbreakfast and 360&#x02013;480 min postbreakfast, respectively). With all AUC measurements, the trapezoidal rule was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). With regard to the ad libitum evening snacks, total energy content, macronutrient composition, and types of foods consumed were determined.</p><p>A repeated-measures ANOVA was then used to compare main effects of treatment, time, and treatment &#x000d7; time interactions for the perceived sensations and hormonal responses. When main effects were detected, pairwise comparisons using the least significant difference test were applied to compare differences between treatments, time segments, and interactions. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare main effects of treatment of the energy content, macronutrient composition, and/or food categories from the ad libitum dinner and evening snacking. When main effects were detected pairwise comparisons using the least significant difference test were applied.</p><p>The brain activation responses were analyzed by using the Brain Voyager QX (version 2.2) statistical package and random effects (Brain Innovation). Preprocessing steps included trilinear three-dimensional motion correction, sync-interpolated slice scan-time correction, two-dimensional spatial smoothing with 4-mm Gaussian filter, and high-pass filter temporal smoothing. Functional images were realigned to the anatomic images obtained within each session and standardized by using Brain Voyager Talairach transformation, which conforms to the space defined by the Talairach and Tournoux's stereotaxic atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Functional scans were discarded if head movement was &#x0003e;3 mm along any axis (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, or <italic>z</italic>). To determine the effects of breakfast on neural activity associated with food motivation, a repeated-measures ANOVA was performed on the brain activation maps within the Brain Voyager software with the use of stimulus [food (ie, appetizing and appealing) compared with nonfood (ie, animal, nonappetizing but appealing] &#x000d7; breakfast (BS compared with NP; BS compared with HP) comparisons. To identify whether the macronutrient composition of the breakfast meal would differentially affect the neural responses, a repeated-measures ANOVA was again performed with the use of a stimulus (ie, food compared with nonfood) &#x000d7; breakfast (NP compared with HP) comparison. Variables representing the experimental conditions were modeled with a hemodynamic response filter and entered into the model with the use of random effects. Contrast between conditions was assessed with <italic>t</italic>-statistics with the use of random effects. On the basis of previous research with this paradigm, a priori regions of interest included the amygdala, hippocampal formation (hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex), cingulate, insula, striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). To identify significant activations in a priori regions, a cluster-level statistical threshold was applied to correct for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). By using this approach, significance was set at <italic>P</italic> = 0.01, with a cluster-level false-positive rate of &#x003b1; = 0.05.

Additional benefits were observed with the consumption of the HP beef- and egg-based breakfast compared with the NP cereal-based version. Specifically, the HP breakfast led to greater increases in daily perceived fullness and greater reductions in corticolimbic activation compared with the NP breakfast. Furthermore, only the HP breakfast led to daily reductions in the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin, increases in the satiety hormone PYY, and reductions in evening snacking, particularly of high fat foods, compared with skipping breakfast. Thus, the addition of breakfast, particularly one rich in protein, might be an important dietary strategy to improve satiety, reduce food motivation/reward, and improve diet quality in overweight/obese teen girls.</p><p>One of the key contributors to the adolescent obesity epidemic is the evidence showing that overweight/obese teens are highly sensitive to the modern food environment, which provides overexposure and easy access to highly palatable, energy-dense foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). This sensitivity is supported by the fact that young people consume nearly half of their daily calories between 1600 and 2400 h; the snack foods often craved and consumed consist of highly palatable, but calorically dense foods with little nutritional value (eg, desserts, candy, chips) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). These habits contribute substantially to the shift away from eating according to physiologic need toward reward-driven eating, the latter of which leads to positive energy balance and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Skipping breakfast exacerbates the desire to snack. Adolescents who skip breakfast typically snack on more desserts, high-fat salty foods, and sodas compared with breakfast consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Data from the current study support these findings by showing that skipping breakfast compared with eating breakfast leads to greater evening snacking on high-fat foods. However, the reduction in unhealthy snacking was evident only after the HP breakfast meal.</p><p>The consumption of dietary protein appears to modulate key gastrointestinal hormones, which, in turn, provide signals to the central, homeostatic, neuronal pathways of the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to alter appetite, satiety, and ultimately regulate energy intake (<italic>see</italic> reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref> and references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Data from our laboratory and others indicate that the consumption of HP meals (containing 28&#x02013;92 g of protein) leads to postmeal reductions in the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin and/or increases in the satiety-stimulating hormone PYY, which are accompanied by reductions in perceived hunger and increases in satiety compared with NP meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Unfortunately, many of these studies incorporate a breakfast preload design, which only assesses 4-h postmeal responses. The current study design allowed us to examine sustained effects over the course of an 8-h day. By using this approach, we found that both breakfast meals equivalently led to reductions in perceived hunger, desire to eat, prospective food consumption, and plasma ghrelin along with increases in perceived fullness throughout the early and/or late morning periods. However, only the HP breakfast led to sustained alterations in perceived desire to eat, prospective food consumption, fullness, and plasma ghrelin into the afternoon periods. Last, plasma PYY was elevated throughout the morning and afternoon periods but only after the HP breakfast. These data support the role of increased dietary protein at the morning meal to provide immediate and/or sustained improvements in the appetitive and hormonal signals that control food intake regulation.</p><p>Although substantial evidence exists documenting the effects of dietary protein on the homeostatic control of energy intake, less is known with respect to hedonic, reward-driven control. Neuroimaging with the use of fMRI has led to the identification of key corticolimbic brain regions involved with food motivation/reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In our previous study, we showed reductions in hippocampal, amygdala, cingulate, and insular activations before lunch after an HP breakfast compared with BS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Reductions in insular and middle prefrontal cortex activations were also observed when comparing the HP and NP breakfasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Our current study extends these findings to identify whether the effects of an HP breakfast persist and alter the neural responses to food stimuli before dinner, which is the time in which most Americans begin to overeat. The HP breakfast led to reduced amygdala, hippocampus, and midfrontal activation compared with skipping breakfast and reduced hippocampus and parahippocampal activation compared with the NP breakfast. These findings suggest that an HP breakfast affects both homeostatic and nonhomeostatic reward signals that control food intake regulation in teen girls.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite the appetitive, hormonal, and neural alterations with the addition of a 350-kcal HP breakfast, daily intake, albeit nonsignificant, was greater (&#x0223c;120 kcal) compared with when breakfast was skipped. Thus, the HP breakfast was only partially compensated for by the end of the day. Because this was an acute study with only 6 acclimation days, it is plausible that habitual consumption of an HP breakfast might lead to complete compensation or overcompensation of the breakfast meal. Over the longer term, this may lead to reductions in daily energy intake and weight loss. This hypothesis is supported by cross-sectional data showing that BS is strongly associated with overeating, weight gain, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Furthermore, although daily intake was not reduced after the HP breakfast, fewer high-fat evening snacks were consumed. These data suggest that eating an HP breakfast might improve diet quality by replacing unhealthy foods (consumed in the evening) with healthier, nutrient-rich foods at breakfast. Further work to identify chronic effects, feasibility, and the effectiveness of a long-term breakfast intervention is warranted.</p><p>Although differences in the neural responses to the breakfast treatments were detected in the current study, several activation clusters were much smaller (ie, 10&#x02013;140 voxels) compared with those in our previous study (ie, 32&#x02013;260 voxels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). These differences are likely due to the time differential from when the fMRI was performed (ie, 8 h postbreakfast in our current study compared with 4 h postbreakfast in our previous study).</p><p>A key factor that may have partially blunted the protein and/or breakfast responses includes the incorporation of a high-carbohydrate/low-protein lunch meal provided during each testing day. Although we found improvements in satiety throughout the day, along with reduced reward-driven eating behavior and snacking in the evening, some of the protein effects of breakfast may have been blunted due to the lunch meal. Thus, a potential next step is to assess whether an HP breakfast, alone or in combination with an HP lunch, leads to synergistic and more robust effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared with skipping breakfast or consuming an NP cereal-based breakfast, an HP breakfast, containing 35 g of high-quality beef and egg protein, beneficially altered key physiologic (energy-driven) and nonphysiologic (reward-driven) signals that control food intake regulation. Although daily intake was not reduced after the HP breakfast, fewer high-fat evening snacks were consumed. Collectively, these data suggest that the daily addition of breakfast, particularly one rich in protein, appears to be an appropriate strategy to improve satiety, reduce food motivation/reward, and improve diet quality by replacing unhealthy evening snacking with nutrient-rich foods at breakfast in overweight/obese teen girls.</p></sec></sec>
