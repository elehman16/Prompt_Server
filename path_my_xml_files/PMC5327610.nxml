DH can arise through the improper bushing, receding gums, inappropriate diet, and because of various other factors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Varying hypothesis has been put forward for explaining the cause of DH but most accepted being Brannstrom's hydrodynamics theory of DH in 1962, according to which sensitivity results when stimulus is applied to dentine displaces the fluid inside the tubule inwardly and outwardly,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] leading to deformation of nerve endings at the pulp/dentine interface, which is transmitted as a painful sensation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Any treatment modality which can block or reduce the movement of fluid,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] blocks the pain transmission, or occludes the dentinal tubule and precipitates the proteins can prove beneficial in the treatment of DH.</p><p>Various methods such as traditional therapeutic toothpaste containing fluorides and nitrates, desensitizing topical agents (fluoride salts, potassium nitrate [KNO<sub>3</sub> ], oxalate, calcium phosphate, and arginine), iontophoresis, adhesives, resins, and lasers have been tried to block the DH with varying success rates.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>KNO<sub>3</sub> was introduced for treating DH by Hodosh in 1974[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and accepted by the American Dental Association (1986), the mechanism is still unexplained but it seems to be of a neural type.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Potassium ion tends to accumulate in dentinal tubules leading to depolarization of cellular membrane of terminal nerve endings leading to the refractory period with decreased sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Laser technology has been studied widely for treating DH since the mid-1980s though results were divergent.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Different lasers He-Ne, neodymium or erbium doped yttrium-aluminum garnet, CO<sub>2</sub>, and diodes (GaAlAs) have been tested for treating DH though the results mostly depended on the action of lasers on dentinal tubules.</p><p>Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been explored widely in treating DH. Its action is due to its analgesic, biostimulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties also regulates the cellular metabolism which makes it effective.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] LLLT has also been further used in treating aphthous, endodontic intervention, and after surgeries.</p><p>In this study, LLLT, KNO<sub>3</sub> 5% toothpaste, and combination of 5% KNO<sub>3</sub> along with LLLT have been used in treating DH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The study is three armed parallel, single-blinded, and randomized trial. The total of 45 patients (23 males and 22 females) with a mean age of 35 years from the outpatient department were selected using randomized selection. Patients who matched the study criteria and complained of sensitivity were allocated to three different groups (15 patients in each group). Allocation of patients into each group was done using computerized generated randomization, 15 each. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee review board 557/sscds/IRB-E/OS/2015.</p><p>Subjects with minimum one tooth having DH due to gingival recession with visual analog scale (VAS) score of &#x02265;2, no previous history of flap surgery for minimum 6 months, no usage of analgesic, anticonvulsants, sedatives, tranquilizers, and anti-inflammatory drugs within 72 h, desensitizing toothpaste, or mouthwash for at least 3 months were included in the study. Pregnant or lactating mothers, smokers, systemically unhealthy, subjects whose teeth had evidence of carious, wear facets, cracked teeth, and mobile teeth were excluded from the study.</p><p>Group A was given paste containing 5% KNO<sub>3</sub> (Sensodyne K<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) to be used twice daily. Group B was treated using paste which was applied for 1 min on hypersensitive area, LLLT was given using diode laser (Picassa 810 nm) at 0.5 watts and tip of diameter 300 &#x003bc; in non contact mode starting at a distance of 5&#x02013;6 mm away from the hypersensitive tooth area and slowly approaching within a distance of 2&#x02013;3mm in a scanning motion covering the entire hypersensitive tooth area for a period of 30 seconds to 1 minute [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Group C was treated using LLLT in the same way as mentioned above without any paste application. Group B and C subjects were given DH treatment at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> week as well and were instructed to continue the same toothpaste which they were using before treatment.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Laser application in cervical abrasion in relation to 14</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJABMR-7-63-g001"/></fig><p>DH for all study groups was recorded at different time intervals 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> week using VAS scores ranging between 0 and 10.
