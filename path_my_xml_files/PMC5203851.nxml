Therefore, assessment and evaluation of patients&#x02019; symptom severity and QoL prior to and after an intervention are essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A number of self-assessment questionnaires have been recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but simplicity and brevity are important features in designing patient self-assessment questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire &#x02013; Short Form (ICIQ-SF) is a validated subjective measure of severity and impact of UI on the QoL in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The ICIQ-SF is formed of six items of which four main items ask for rating of UI symptoms in the past 4&#x000a0;weeks. The scores for items 3, 4 and 5 are taken for the final ICIQ-SF score. Items 1 and 2 are demographic and the final item is a self-diagnostic item for the type of UI. The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) is a seven-point scale instrument of patient reported outcome measures (PROM) which is validated to assess PROM following treatment of stress UI (SUI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of evidence as to what represents a successful postintervention ICIQ-SF score, and this is further complicated when the baseline score is not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is a significant drive to conduct and compare the long-term follow-up results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to UI interventions; however, some of these RCTs do not have baseline ICIQ-SF scores simply because the ICIQ-SF was developed only in 2004.</p><p>The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between the postoperative ICIQ-SF scores and the PGI-I outcome. The latter is considered the standard PROM following surgical treatment for SUI. If we did indeed find a significant correlation, we intended to determine, and if appropriate validate, a postoperative ICIQ-SF cut-off score that could predict a successful PROM as determined by PGI-I. Such a score would facilitate the comparison of results among clinical trials using different tools to asses PROM and especially those in which long-term follow-up is feasible. Such a score could also be a valuable aid in the counselling of patients and facilitating their postoperative follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Two PROM assessment tools were assessed: ICIQ-SF and PGI-I. ICIQ-SF has a maximum score of 21; the higher the score, the more severe is the UI, but there is no normal score (<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>). The PGI-I is a seven-point transition scale that comprises a single question asking patients to rate their urinary tract condition now as compared with how it was before treatment on a scale from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). Outcomes of &#x0201c;much improved&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very much improved&#x0201d; are globally accepted as successful outcomes, and were therefore used in this study to indicate a successful surgical outcome.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methodology for assessing the correlation between the two instruments and generation of ICIQ-SF cut-off score for success</title><p>We used two long-term follow-up datasets (3 and 8&#x000a0;years) from a RCT (the E-TOT study; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) performed between April 2005 and April 2007 with follow-up until 2015 in a tertiary urogynaecology centre in Scotland, UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. All patients had urodynamic SUI or mixed UI (MUI, with predominant SUI) and were randomized to treatment with either inside-out TVT-O (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) or Aris outside-in TOT (Coloplast, Peterborough, UK) as a sole procedure. The datasets yielded 432 complete ICIQ-SF score/PGI-I outcome data pairs. These datasets were from patients who responded to follow-up postal questionnaire packs which also included symptom severity, QoL and sexual function questionnaires. We used the usual convention for the PGI-I transition scale from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). We determined the correlation between absolute scores. We did not stratify the ICIQ-SF scores into mild, moderate and severe, as this procedure has been shown to have limited validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Datasets</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Dataset</th><th>Study</th><th>Follow-up (years)</th><th>Number of data pairs</th><th>Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Correlation and generation of cut-off score</td><td rowspan="2">E-TOT RCT</td><td>3</td><td>238</td><td rowspan="2">432</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>194</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Validation</td><td rowspan="2">SIMS RCT</td><td>1</td><td>131</td><td rowspan="2">242</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>111</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Despite being widely used in clinics and research settings and the wealth of information about ICIQ-SF and PGI-I separately, there has been a longstanding and ongoing effort to robustly correlate these two valuable instruments so that results from different authors/research groups can be compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The PGI-I is a global index that is widely used to rate the response of a condition to a therapy (transition scale). It is a simple, direct, easy to use scale that is intuitively understandable by clinicians and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The PGI-I has been found to have excellent construct validity when compared with various assessment variables: incontinence episode frequency, the Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the fixed volume (400&#x000a0;mL) stress pad test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such global ratings can be precise when used to assess the same person over time, but they have a degree of imprecision across the spectrum of different people in whom they might be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PGI-I has recently been found by Hossack and Woo to be a valid assessment tool even following prostatectomy, and PGI-I is now being looked at with great interest in urology research. It has shown excellent correlation with the symptom score and QoL index in urology research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Most recently PGI-I was used in the Bladder Ultrasound Study (BUS trial) funded by the Health Technology Assessment Programme with a follow-up of up to 20&#x000a0;months in women with overactive bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The ICIQ-SF is a subjective measure of severity of urinary loss and QoL for those with UI. This PROM tool takes 5 min or less time to administer and no training, and hence is widely used in both clinical and research settings. ICIQ-SF has been tested and validated in men and women with primary SUI. Cut-off scores for severity of UI in women have been reported by Klovning et al. in a cohort of 1,812 women responding to a general health questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Score ranges were 1 &#x02013; 5 (slight), 6 &#x02013; 12 (moderate), 13 &#x02013; 18 (severe) and 19 &#x02013; 21 (very severe).</p><p>ICIQ-SF has the ability to detect changes after both conservative and surgical treatment. The minimal detectable change (MDC) and minimally clinically important difference (MCID) after intervention for UI are not yet established, but there has been initial investigation in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Sirls et al. assessed 597 women in the TOMUS RCT and found that the minimum important difference (MID) for the ICIQ-SF in a population of women with stress-predominant UI is &#x02212;5 for assessment at 12&#x000a0;months and &#x02212;4 for assessment at 24&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. They concluded that MID may be overestimated in surgical cohorts because of uniformly high preoperative scores without significant variability that show a large improvement after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nystr&#x000f6;m et al. also found that the changes in ICIQ-SF and ICIQ-LUTS QoL scores in women with SUI after pelvic floor muscle training reflected clinically relevant improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. They included 218 women with a 4-month follow-up. The MID was defined as the mean change in score in women who experienced a small improvement. Similar to our results, Nystr&#x000f6;m et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found that PGI-I outcome correlated significantly with the ICIQ-SF score (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.547, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) while the MID was &#x02212;2.52. The clear discrepancy between MCID in the above studies shows that more research is needed in this area. Nystr&#x000f6;m et al. hypothesized that PGI-I outcome may be better correlated with postoperative ICIQ-SF score than the change in the score over time which was clearly lower than that found by Sirls et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we analysed the results from two large datasets representing the PROM up to 8&#x000a0;years following treatment with a midurethral sling (MUS). In this RCT which was started in 2005, a baseline ICIQ-SF score was not available. A clear strong correlation between PGI-I outcome and ICIQ-SF score was shown, and we identified a postoperative ICIQ-SF score of 6 as a marker of successful outcome according to PGI-I with reasonable specificity (85&#x000a0;%) and sensitivity (90&#x000a0;%). The score was then validated in two datasets representing follow-up periods of up to 4&#x000a0;years in a separate RCT also assessing outcomes following treatment with a MUS, but where the baseline ICIQ-SF scores were known. This demonstrated that the results are fully validated for the majority of women undergoing treatment with a MUS.</p><p>NICE (National Institute for Care and Health Excellence) guidelines on UI (CG171) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], a Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and most recently a SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks) report all encourage authors to undertake RCTs with long-term follow-up and to compare the results with those of relatively old RCT. Many studies, like ours, will not have had the chance to use the ICIQ-SF at baseline given the timeline of trials and the publication of ICIQ-SF in 2004. Our results showing the correlation between the ICIQ-SF score and PGI-I outcome and the validity of the ICIQ-SF cut-off score would enable the ICIQ-SF to be administered postoperatively in these trials and enable their results to be compared with those of other RCTs in a meta-analysis. This would allow the clinical community to fill the gap in the evidence for the long-term outcomes following surgical treatment of SUI. Unlike MCID, our highlighted ICIQ-SF cut-off score was not affected by the length of follow-up up to 8&#x000a0;years. In-addition, this novel validated ICIQ-SF cut-off score will be a valuable aid in counselling patients during their follow-up after surgery for incontinence. A postoperative ICIQ-SF score of &#x02264;6 is likely to translate to a patient-reported successful outcome according to the PGI-I.</p><p>Recently, Larsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] compared the PGI-I and the ICIQ-SF score in women undergoing surgery for UI or pelvic organ prolapse and found that the PGI-I score correlates better with the postoperative ICIQ score than the change in score after surgery. They concluded that this may be due to patients&#x02019; recall bias, and warned that PGI-I tends to overestimate patient-reported success compared with the change in ICIQ score after treatment.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methodology</title><p>In the accompanying editorial, Cartwright et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] questioned their methodology of converting the individual scores for both questionnaires to the same scale as the numerical values assigned to each category in the underlying items are somewhat arbitrary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The use of four large datasets assessing different follow-up times after treatment with a MUS (1, 3, 4 and 8&#x000a0;years) is a major strength of our study. The fact that the cut-off score did not seem to be affected by the length of follow-up or the type of MUS used is important for both clinical and research use. A potential limitation is that correlating two questionnaires that measure the same clinical intervention may be inappropriate. Cartwright et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] argue that the differences between the PGI-I and the ICIQ reflect true differences in what they measure. PGI-I provides a more global overview of treatment success that is more likely to fully encompass the range of benefits and harms of surgery compared to a disease-specific questionnaire such as ICIQ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This two-stage study provided a robust well-validated postoperative ICIQ-SF cut-off score (of 6/21) that is likely to translate to a patient-reported successful outcome on PGI-I following surgical treatment with a MUS in women at different stages of follow-up from 1 to 8 years. Such a cut-off score may enable comparison of results between various studies and serve as a valuable guide for surgeons to counsel patients before and/or after surgical treatment.
