Chicago area participants were recruited via flyers and transit advertisements between July, 2011 and February, 2012. Eligible participants were between 18 and 60 years old, with body mass index (BMI) between 30&#x02013;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, no weight gain or loss exceeding 11.3 kg for the past 6 months, and not participating in another weight loss program.

Half of the groups within each cohort were constructed to include only women (homogenous); half included both men and women (heterogeneous), with the latter with the latter including at least 2 men to prevent marginalization. Group assignments were based on when participants were available for in-person treatment. Randomization, stratified by group type (homogenous/heterogeneous) occurred at the group level. Once all eligible participants of a cohort were assigned to a group, the 3 groups within each stratum were randomized by a statistician using a randomly permuted block with 3 cells. The statistician notified the project staff who then revealed the treatment assignment [STND, TECH, or SELF] to participants during the first in-person group session. Although treatment condition was evident to participants and interventionists, outcome assessment and data analysis were blinded.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Intervention</title><p id="P12">All study participants had a 7% weight loss goal and were encouraged to lose approximately 0.5&#x02013;1.0 kg/week.

Physical activity goals progressed from 45 to 175 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> depicts the timeline of events for each intervention condition.</p><p id="P13">Those randomized to SELF attended one 60 minute group session at which treatment assignment was revealed and participants received their weight loss target, a calorie and fat gram counting book (<italic>The Complete Book of Food Counts</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>), and 6 months of daily paper self-monitoring diaries. They also received Group Lifestyle Balance<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> DVDs presenting 12 mock group treatment sessions adapted from the original DPP curriculum.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> SELF participants received no additional in-person sessions or coaching calls.</p><p id="P14">In contrast, for the first 8 weeks, those assigned to STND or TECH treatment attended weekly 90-minute group sessions led by a psychologist or exercise physiologist and focused on nutrition, MVPA, and behavior change strategies. A 30-minute guided walking exercise was offered after group sessions. STND and SELF participants received the same calorie counting book and paper diaries.</p><p id="P15">TECH participants were lent an Android smartphone with study-designed ENGAGED app and accelerometer for 6 months. They used the app to self-monitor dietary intake and body weight and wore the accelerometer to objectively measure MVPA; these data transmitted wirelessly to their coach. The app&#x02019;s dietary intake &#x0201c;fans&#x0201d; showed traffic light colors depicting calorie and fat gram allowances remaining for that day. MVPA data, transmitted by the accelerometer, automatically populated an app display, visualizing the remaining MVPA needed to reach the weekly goal. TECH participants used the app&#x02019;s team tab to track their group members&#x02019; self-monitoring adherence, post messages to the team, or message individual group members directly. Additionally, TECH participants received 2&#x02013;4 personalized messages/week for 6 months.</p><p id="P16">Weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly from months 3&#x02013;6, TECH and STND participants received 10&#x02013;15 minutes calls during which trained coaches with at least a bachelor&#x02019;s degree reviewed self-monitoring and goal attainment, and helped participants solve problems.

Fidelity was assessed biweekly during weeks 1&#x02013;8 and then monthly until month 6. A 10% sample of each coach&#x02019;s sessions was randomly selected and rated. If fidelity fell below 90%, the coach was retrained by a doctoral level staff member.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="P19">Primary outcomes were weight loss and behavioral adherence. Weight loss was measured both continuously and as the attainment of clinically meaningful &#x02265;5% weight loss.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The time that coaches spent administering the intervention was an exploratory outcome. Body weight was measured without shoes on a calibrated balance beam scale at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months. Behavioral adherence, operationalized by self-monitoring of diet, physical activity, and weight, was examined during months 1&#x02013;6. Diet self-monitoring adherence was measured as the percent of days reporting energy intake of &#x02265; 1000 calories in the paper diary (STND and SELF) or on the ENGAGED smartphone application (TECH). Physical activity monitoring adherence was assessed as the percent of days when any activity was reported in the paper diary (STND and SELF) or when any physical activity was detected on the accelerometer (TECH). Weight self-monitoring was assessed as the percent of days when a body weight was recorded in the paper diaries (STND and SELF) or on the ENGAGED smartphone application (TECH).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P20">Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Linear mixed models for longitudinal data were used to test for differences between treatments on weight loss measured continuously over time; mixed effects logistic models were used to test for differences in the percent achieving 5% weight loss.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> This class of models does not assume that subjects are measured at all time points, and therefore can include subjects with missing data across time. Changes across time were examined by treating time as a factor variable with baseline as the reference cell. In addition to the effect of time, the main independent variable is treatment condition, a between-subjects factor with 3 levels: standard care, technology-assisted, and self-guided. Helmert contrasts were used to test two comparisons; H1: the experimental conditions (STND &#x00026; TECH) vs. the self-guided condition, and H2: the standard care condition vs technology-assisted. Condition by time interactions were examined at 3, 6, and 12 months to test whether change in outcomes across time differed by condition, in terms of these two contrasts. Finally, since subjects were nested within groups and groups were randomized to treatment conditions, a random group effect was included in the model to account for any cluster effects attributable to groups (though this group variance was estimated to be zero).</p><p id="P21">Power analyses were based on data from our previous +Mobile Trial,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> where standard deviations of 3.8 and 4.9 kg. were seen at months 3 and 6, respectively, with a correlation of 0.86 between the two time points. With 80% power and n=30 at the final endpoint in both the STND and TECH groups, a difference of 3 kg. between these two groups is expected to be able to be detected. The power calculations were based on the second Helmert contrast: TECH vs. STND because this contrast contains the fewest number of subjects (30 in each group) and it is expected that this contrast will have the smallest effect sizes. The first Helmert contrast: STND and TECH vs. SELF has a larger sample size (60 vs. 30) and larger effects sizes were expected in this contrast due to the limited intensity of the SELF intervention. Therefore, by powering the study based on the second contrast, it is expected that there will be more than adequate power for the first contrast.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S12"><title>Results</title><sec id="S13"><title>Study Participants</title><p id="P22">At baseline, participants had a mean (SD) age of 39.3 (11.7) years and BMI of 34.6 (3.0) kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

The time needed to deliver the ENGAGED hybrid in-person group plus telephone intervention was less than 4 hours per participant, as compared to 8&#x02013;16 hours needed to deliver the DPP in-person curriculum. This reduction in needed interventionist time should make ENGAGED less burdensome than the DPP program whose first year of intervention costs approximately $1,400.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The interventionist time needed to deliver the ENGAGED treatment over 6 months is similar to that needed to deliver the POWER intervention, a version of the DPP provided entirely remotely by telephone and internet.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Likewise, ENGAGED, POWER, and a recent remotely delivered DPP translation providing equivalent interventionist contact<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> all produced approximately 6 kg weight loss in 6 months.

Once self-monitoring tools were no longer provided and coach contact ceased at month 7, weight loss halted in all three treatment conditions. Individuals in all intervention conditions regained some weight, but those in TECH appeared most affected, regaining on average nearly 2% of initial body weight. Presumably, a trigger for the TECH group&#x02019;s regain was loss of the study-owned smartphone, an implementation challenge that could be avoided now that the majority of adults own a smartphone and can access many available weight loss apps. Given this and other evidence<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> that withdrawing intervention components at 6 months can undermine behavioral gains, ongoing treatment provision beyond 6 months appears warranted because weight regain after weight loss is normative, and continued lifestyle intervention is moderately effective for weight loss maintenance.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p id="P30">The current findings, like those from another recent trial,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> contradict the premise that technology-supported weight loss interventions always outstrip standard treatment.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Although weight loss did not differ as a function of whether self-monitoring was performed on an app or on paper, the percent of individuals achieving at least 5% weight loss was greater among those recording on paper. TECH not only tended to lose less weight than STND but they also regained more, dispelling differences between the abbreviated in-person treatments and SELF at 12 months.</p><p id="P31">Unlike differences between TECH and STND in the magnitude of weight loss, self-monitoring adherence differed across treatments in the manner predicted: i.e., greater for TECH than STND and greater for STND than SELF.

Notably a recent review found that only 53% of studies comparing technology-supported to standard weight loss interventions reported differences in weight outcomes, with even fewer smartphone studies detecting differences.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Like the present study, two others showed enhanced self-monitoring with mobile technology compared to paper, but no treatment difference in weight loss.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> It is possible that a level of self-monitoring adherence between 30&#x02013;50% represents a functional ceiling, beyond which no further enhancement of weight loss is discernable. An alternative explanation we consider more plausible is that the mobile technologies used in these ground breaking, early studies presented a perfect storm of attractive and frustrating features.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> On the positive side, they were engaging enough to reinforce participants for self-monitoring and generate an attachment to the devices. On the negative side they had technical glitches that are to be expected with first generation technologies. For example, the accelerometer used in ENGAGED was, at the time, the only one available with wireless transmission capabilities. However, the device sometimes lost power without warning and was difficult to restart, as is reflected by the greater coaching time utilized by participants in TECH as compared to STND. Additionally, digital dialogue among the 8 members of each weight loss group was difficult to sustain.</p><p id="P32">Weight loss in SELF was slightly less than in a prior study by Ma et al<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> that utilized the DPP-based Group Lifestyle Balance DVD&#x02019;s. SELF participants in that study showed a decrease in body weight of &#x02212;4.7% at 6 months, in contrast to &#x02212;2.7% in the current study. The smaller weight loss in the present study may be because our SELF intervention was less intensive, involving a single in-person session and DVDs that participants were to view on their own. In contrast, Ma et al.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> gave participants a scale and pedometer, trained them to use an online portal, and emailed them biweekly reminder messages to self-monitor. Even though the weight loss produced by SELF did not reach the recommended 5% weight loss, intervention burden was low which may make this a scalable way to reach more of the overweight and obese population.</p><p id="P33">Although highly innovative, the study is not without limitations. Enrollees were highly motivated. Retention in TECH may have benefited from the fact that participants were provided with a smartphone with an unlimited calling, text, and data package. Despite this benefit, retention was comparable for the TECH and STND conditions. Drop-out was increased for SELF, which may have biased comparisons between the experimental treatments and control. However, it is unlikely that drop-outs in SELF lost more weight than SELF participants who remained in the study. Thus, if our reported treatment effects involving the control group are in fact biased, the direction of the bias is that the treatment effect may have been underestimated. Finally, the control condition in the study was not inert, which also may have led to underestimation of treatment effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S20"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p id="P34">The ENGAGED study was a highly innovative randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of three abbreviated versions of the DPP. Two abbreviated interventions combining face-to-face and telephone treatment but differing on whether self-monitoring was done via smartphone versus paper, yielded more weight loss than a self-guided intervention at 3 and 6 months. Results suggest that, in a weight loss intervention including other evidence based components, use of either technology or paper tracking holds potential to provide lower burden alternatives to the full DPP lifestyle intervention. The findings also accord with other results indicating that mobile technologies can enhance self-monitoring and engagement with a weight loss intervention. Finally, the results raise a provocative question about boundary conditions affecting whether or not enhanced technology-facilitated self-monitoring translates into greater weight loss.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><p>The authors express our appreciation to Harold Snyder and Tom McTavish for design and programming of the ENGAGED application.</p><p><underline>Funding Agencies</underline>: Supported in part by grants RC1DK087126 and R01DK097364 from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and by the Robert Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant (P30CA60553) and the Northwestern University Clinical Translational Science Award (UL1TR001422).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p><bold>Trial Registration:</bold>
