The fresh celery leaves were washed and dried at room temperature for as long as 3 days. The weight of the celery leaves after drying decreased to 2 kg. The dried celery leaves were mashed with a blender and extraction was accomplished via maceration. The maceration was carried out using as much as 40 liters of ethanol (EtOH) 96%. The dried celery leaves were mixed with ethanol 96% and then mixed well for about 30 minutes and allowed to stand for 24 hours. The maceration was conducted 3 times until the resulting solution became relatively clear and dilute. The macerated celery was filtered using flannel and filter paper to produce a celery filtrate. The celery filtrate was then evaporated using a rotary evaporator at a temperature of 40&#x000b0;C to produce a condensed extract of celery leaves. 2) Preparation of powder and granule celery: A total of 30 grams of the condensed celery leaf extract was added to 5 g of aerosil and mixed until homogeneous. The extract was then dried in an oven at a temperature of 50&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. This process yielded a celery powder. A total of 15 g of celery powder was mixed with 10 g of Avicel PH 102, 0.15 g of Na benzoate, and 0.9 g of Polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 (PVP K-30) to produce granules of celery extract. The granules were sieved using a sieve with 1.19 mm in size. The sieve was dried in the oven at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. The celery extract was tested for water content and weight uniformity using thin layer chromatography. 3) Preparation of the celery capsules. Celery capsules contain as much as 30% (75 mg) fillers, such as lactose, magnesium stearate, and aerosil. A total of 72,000 mg of celery leaf extract were inserted into the capsule (size 00) with a dose of 250 mg/capsule. The total number of capsules was 288. The capsules were stored in clean, dry, air tight, sealed bottles. The capsules were immediately administered and not stored for long periods of time.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Placebo capsules</title><p>The control group was treated with placebo capsules (size 00) at a dose of 250 mg containing lactose &#x000b1; 30% (75 mg), magnesium stearate and aerosil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Patients</title><p>The experimental research was conducted in this study by a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest with a control group. Research subjects were obtained from the elder care facility &#x0201c;Rumoh Seujahtera Geunaseh Sayang&#x0201d; in Ulee Kareng, Banda Aceh, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The total population was 62 elderly individuals (22 males and 40 females). Forty-eight elderly people volunteered to participate. We examined the blood glucose levels of these 48 elderly people and found that 22 of the subjects had hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes). However, 6 of these subjects did not satisfy our inclusion criteria, and the final sample was accordingly 16 people. The research subjects were elderly pre-diabetics with an age of at least 60 (6 males and 10 females).</p><p>All participants provided written informed consent to participate in our study. We divided the research subjects into 2 groups: a control group (n=8; 5 females and 3 males) and a treatment group (n=8; 5 females and 3 males). The subjects in each group were selected using a simple random sampling method with a lottery system. The control group was an untreated group (given a placebo). The treatment group was a treated group (given a capsule of celery leaf extracts).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Treatment and laboratory procedures</title><p>The treatment was celery extract capsules at a dose of 250 mg, given 3 times a day (morning, afternoon and evening), 30 minutes before meals and for the duration of 12 days. The dose of 250 mg of celery extract was chosen based on the conversion of an animal&#x02019;s celery dose (a mouse) to a human dose. The calculation was as follows: the dose for mice is 100 mg/kg body weight (BW). The absolute dose is 100 mg/kg BW&#x000d7;0.02 kg=2 mg (the weight of mice is 20 g). Using the conversion factor 0.0026, the required dose for humans is 2 mg&#x000d7;387.9 = 775.8 mg (the dose for humans with an estimated BW of 70 kg). The dose was divided into 3 administration times: morning (250 mg), afternoon (250 mg) and evening (250 mg), and was given 30 minutes before meals (according to the treatment schedule of anti-diabetic drugs).</p><p>All of the participants were treated with the celery and the placebo for 12 days. We chose this duration based on the results of our preliminary study with hyperglycemic male rats. That study revealed that the administration of celery with a dose of 50 mg/kg BW daily for 10 days significantly decreased blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic male rats. Measurements of blood glucose levels (pre-prandial plasma glucose levels and post-prandial plasma glucose levels) and insulin were obtained twice, before and after treatment. The glucose oxidase method (GOD-PAP) was used to measure the level of the subjects&#x02019; blood glucose. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the level of insulin in the subjects&#x02019; plasma.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Ethical clearance</title><p>The use of patients and protocols in this research was adapted to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The difference was caused by the fact that there were some patients who had very high levels of blood glucose in the celery group despite their not being aware of this situation. However, because of the limited number of patients in our cohort, we did not exclude elderly with very high blood sugar from this study. There was a different response to therapy in both groups. The results showed that plasma insulin levels decreased after therapy in the placebo group, whereas the opposite occurred in the celery group. The results of this study showed that plasma insulin levels slightly increase (1.16 &#x000b5;g; 0.08%) after treatment in the celery group. There was a significant decrease in insulin level after treatment (21.67 &#x000b5;g; 7.8%) in the placebo group, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref></bold>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Description of plasma insulin levels before and after treatment in both groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SaudiMedJ-39-154-g002"/></fig><p><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref></bold> shows that the levels of pre-prandial blood glucose increased after treatment in the placebo group.

The results of this study indicate that celery can lower pre-prandial blood glucose levels in elderly patients with pre-diabetes.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The decreasing of pre-prandial blood glucose levels in both groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SaudiMedJ-39-154-g003"/></fig><p><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref></bold> shows an increase in post-prandial blood glucose levels after therapy in the placebo group. Patients in the celery group exhibited the opposite effect. Post-prandial blood glucose levels decreased by 19.5% after treatment in the celery group. These results indicate that celery can lower pre-prandial blood glucose and may also decrease post-prandial blood glucose levels in elderly people with pre-diabetes. The results also show that celery therapy has a better effect on decreased post-prandial blood glucose levels compared with decreased pre-prandial blood glucose levels in elderly pre-diabetics. The results of this study indicate that celery consumption as a pre-diabetic therapy in the elderly should be coupled with the provision of anti-diabetic drugs that have the effect of decreasing pre-prandial blood glucose levels.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The reduction of postprandial blood glucose levels in both groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SaudiMedJ-39-154-g004"/></fig><p>The results of homogeneity tests (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) of insulin and blood glucose levels before treatment (pretest) revealed that the data were homogenous.

The results of this study indicate that celery decreased pre-prandial blood glucose levels and post-prandial blood glucose levels but only slightly increased plasma insulin levels among elderly pre-diabetics. These findings may be due to several factors, namely: 1) The celery extract used was a pure extract rather than a synthesis of the chemical components of celery with anti-diabetic activity, such as flavonoids (kaempferol, quercetin, triterpenes and luteolin), 2) The duration of celery therapy, which needs to be considered for long-term administration, 3) Subjects were elderly people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study show that after treatment with celery, elderly pre-diabetics exhibited a significant decrease in pre-prandial and post-prandial blood glucose levels. However, there was no significant increase in plasma insulin levels. These results may be influenced by the fact that celery works at lowering blood glucose levels by affecting the absorption of glucose in the intestine, not by stimulating the production of insulin by the pancreas.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Other possible explanations pertain to the duration of celery leaf extract treatment and the fact that the subjects were not specifically type 1 DM patients (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus/IDDM) or type 2 DM (Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus/NIDDM).

This antioxidant increases insulin secretion via the NF-kB and iNOS-NO signaling pathway.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>The literature review and the results of this study have shown that DM pathogenesis and diabetic complications are associated with oxidative stress.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The formation and accumulation of free radicals in DM patients occur due to increased glucose oxidation, non-enzymatic glycation of proteins, and oxidative degradation of proteins.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Abnormalities of free radicals and chronic declines in endogenous antioxidants result in damage to cell organelles and oxidative enzymes.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> That study showed that celery can act as an exogenous antioxidant in elderly pre-diabetics.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Based on our results, the fact that this study did not exhibit an increase in plasma insulin levels was probably also caused by the method of treatment with a pure extract of celery leaf, which contains a variety of active substances. The use of a flavonoid extract of celery leaf is likely to have had different effects on plasma insulin levels.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Study limitations</title><p>A limitation of this study was its small sample size. It was therefore very weak as a clinical trial study. In addition, celery leaf extract was administered as a pure extract. The study should have been conducted using a comparison of the roots, stems, and seeds of the celery plant. This study was preliminary and is the basis for our continued research. The study can be expanded to adult diabetic patients, using a specific extract of celery such as flavonoids or other active chemical components of celery.</p><p>In conclusion, celery leaf extract reduced pre-prandial blood glucose levels and post-prandial blood glucose levels, but it slightly increased plasma insulin levels in elderly pre-diabetics. These findings indicate a lack of association between blood glucose levels and insulin plasma in elderly pre-diabetics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
