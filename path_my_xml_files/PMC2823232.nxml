The dynamic Dynawrist fixator with the distal pins in metacarpal bone may avoid fixation problems in comminuted fractures and may reduce the risk of nerve injury. We compared anatomical and functional outcome for the well-established Hoffmann compact II non-bridging fixator and for the Dynawrist fixator.</p><p><bold>Patients and methods</bold> 75 patients with unstable distal radius fractures were randomized to treatment with either the Hoffman compact II fixator (the H-group) or the Dynawrist fixator (the D-group). Anatomical and functional variables were recorded preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks. Pain was assessed using the VAS score and function was assessed using DASH score.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Postoperatively, radial tilt, inclination, and radial length all improved statistically significantly in both groups. At time of removal of the fixators, the H group had superior volar radial tilt. At the 52-week follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding anatomical variables. At 6 weeks, flexion was greater in the D group but at 12, 24, and 52 weeks flexion was similar in the two groups, as were the other wrist and forearm movements. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups according to VAS and DASH scores. 3 nerve injuries occurred in the H group and 1 in the D group (p = 0.4), all of which were transient.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold> The Dynawrist bridging but dynamic fixator gives radiographic and functional outcome similar to that of the Hoffman II compact non-bridging fixator.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Different types of external fixation are used for fractures of the distal radius.

All patients had an AO-type A3 fracture, with an intact volar cortex of the distal fragment of at least 1 cm. The patients were treated at one of 2 hospitals between January 2004 and December 2005.</p><p>Patients who were included were at least 18 years old, and had one or more of the following fracture deformities: more than 10 degrees of dorsal angulation and/or radial shortening of more than 2 mm compared to the uninjured wrist at the initial radiography. Patients treated with closed reduction and cast were included if they had radiocarpal malalignment of more than 5 mm, a dorsal angulation of more than 5 degrees, or a shortening of the radius of more than 2 mm at the 10-day follow-up. 32 patients were initially treated with plaster cast, which failed to maintain the reduction and required surgery. If surgery was delayed for more the 14 days after the fracture, the patient was not included. Patients who were suffering from dementia or psychiatric diseases, or who had a history of previous fracture in one of the wrists were also excluded.</p><p>75 patients (64 women) were included. Their mean age, which was similar in both groups, was 62 (20&#x02013;92) years. 39 patients had fractures of the non-dominant wrist. Mean time from injury to surgery was 4 (0&#x02013;14) days. All patients were treated with closed reduction; after randomization, 37 patients were treated with the Hoffman II fixator (the H group) and 38 patients were treated with the Dynawrist fixator (the D group).</p><p>The Regional Ethics Committee approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><sec id="S2001"><title>Operative technique</title><p>In the H group, 2 longitudinal incisions (1 cm long) were made on the dorsum of the wrist, one on either side of Lister&#x02019;s tubercle. 2 longitudinal incisions were made in the extensor retinaculum, taking precautions to avoid injury to the extensor pollicis longus tendon. 2 Apex pins were then placed parallel to the joint surface in the distal radial fragment, from dorsal to volar, engaging the volar cortex. 2 pins were placed in the radial shaft with open technique. The fracture was reduced using the distal pins as levers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Hoffman II compact non-bridging external fixator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ORT-1745-3674-80-104-g001"/></fig><p>In the D group, 2 Apex pins were placed in the second metacarpal bone parallel to the palm. By open placement technique and with the use of a guide, 2 pins were placed in the radial shaft, parallel to the palm with the forearm in neutral rotation.

The surgery was performed in plexus anesthesia. Postoperative radiographs were taken within 24 h of surgery. The operated arm was kept elevated for the first 48 h. All patients had compression bandages around the Apex pins, covering the incisions.

It was assumed to reduce the disability associated with unstable fractures of the distal radius by allowing early joint movement. He used an external, wrist-bridging fixator with a ball-joint design. Today, a similar principle is used in an external fixator produced by Orthofix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Frykman et al. 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Sommerkamp et al. (1994)</xref> showed, however, that such ball-joint fixators are inferior to static fixators because the ball joint is not situated in the anatomical center of rotation; thus, joint movement will dislocate the fracture.</p><p>Some years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">McQueen (1998)</xref> introduced the &#x0201c;non-bridging&#x0201d; concept. She concluded in her randomized study that non-bridging external fixation was superior to bridging external fixation, regarding both anatomical and functional outcome. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Atroshi et al. (2006)</xref> could not confirm these findings. Furthermore, the non-bridging technique has some limitations; a minimum of 1 cm of the volar cortex in the distal fragment must be intact, the operative technique is more demanding, and there is a risk of damaging the extensor tendons. There is also possibly increased risk of infection in the tendon sheets, the fracture zone, or the wrist joint as compared to the situation with bridging fixators.</p><p>In the bridging but dynamic Dynawrist fixator, the center of joint rotation is not disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Hove et al. 1999</xref>). Like the non-bridging external fixators, it has the advantage of allowing early joint mobilization despite the fact that the distal pins are placed distal to the joint, the fracture zone, the extensor tendons, and tendon sheets. This reduces the risk of the abovementioned complications associated with non-bridging external fixation, as described above. Furthermore, Dynawrist can be used in more comminuted fractures, as it does not rely on a distal intact volar cortex of a certain size.</p><p>In recent years, the popularity of volar fixed-angle plates has increased&#x02014;with promising early results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Rozental et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Musgrave and Idler 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Chung et al. 2006</xref>). This open technique may introduce a new set of surgical complications. The current literature offers no evidence to support the use of internal rather than external fixation in the treatment of unstable fractures of the distal radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Margaliot et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Ochman et al. 2006</xref>). Until studies with a high level of evidence to the contrary are published, external fixators retain their place in the treatment of fractures of the distal radius.</p><p>We found the same anatomic and functional outcome in patients treated with the Dynawrist bridging but dynamic fixator and in patients treated with the non-bridging Hoffman II fixator. Since the surgical technique is simpler and the indications for application are wider, the Dynawrist fixator seems to be a good alternative to the Hoffman II fixator.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>YK: study design, coordination, writing of manuscript.
