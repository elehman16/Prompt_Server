Prior to initiating a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT), we examined the safety and feasibility of asking adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to increase their water intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Design, setting, participants and measurements</title><p>Beginning in October 2012, we randomly assigned 29 adults with stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;mL/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup> and albuminuria) to one of the two groups of water intake: hydration (n=18) or standard (n=11). We asked the hydration group to increase their water intake by 1.0&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;L/day (in addition to usual intake, depending on sex and weight) for 6&#x02005;weeks, while the control group carried on with their usual intake. Participants collected a 24&#x02005;h urine sample at baseline and at 2 and 6&#x02005;weeks after randomisation. Our primary outcome was the between-group difference in change in 24&#x02005;h urine volume from baseline to 6&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>(63%)of participants were men, 81% were Caucasians and the average age was 61&#x02005;years (SD 14 years).

Between baseline and 6-week follow-up, the hydration group's average 24&#x02005;h urine volume increased by 0.7&#x02005;L/day (from 2.3 to 3.0&#x02005;L/day) and the control group's 24&#x02005;h urine decreased by 0.3&#x02005;L/day (from 2.0 to 1.7&#x02005;L/day; between-group difference in change: 0.9&#x02005;L/day (95% CI 0.4 to 1.5; p=0.002)).

The clinical trials of increased fluid intake in other patient groups (eg, overweight adults, elderly men and patients with polycystic kidney disease or kidney stones) demonstrate no adverse effects. These studies instructed participants to increase water intake by 1&#x02013;3&#x02005;L/day. In particular, Spigt <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25 R26 R27">25&#x02013;27</xref> conducted several studies of healthy elderly men, and showed that an increased fluid intake of 1&#x02005;L/day, on an average, was safe in terms of serum sodium, eGFR and quality of life (n=142), and can be sustained over a 6-month period. Furthermore, in a subset of 44 elderly men, a 2&#x02005;L increase in fluid intake for up to 2&#x02005;months was associated with improvement in lower bladder function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25 R26 R27">25&#x02013;27</xref> Similar to the Spigt's study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> the participants in the hydration group experienced a significant increase in nocturia; however, this was not associated with any measurable changes in HRQL. Although increased water intake is known to be the most effective therapeutic measure to prevent kidney stones, surveys of patients with recurrent kidney stones show poor compliance with prescriptions for increased water intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Wang <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> recently reported results of a water prescription study in eight patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who were asked to drink 0.4&#x02013;1.4&#x02005;L/day of water for 5&#x02005;days, in addition to usual fluid intake. Three 24&#x02005;h urine samples were collected in the week preceding the intervention and again during the week of the intervention and participants were able to achieve their targets (mean 24&#x02005;h urine volume increased by about 0.8&#x02005;L/day), albeit for a brief period of study. In contrast, our pilot study of patients with CKD (eGFR 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;mL/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup>) was 6&#x02005;weeks in duration. The hydration group increased their 24&#x02005;h urine volume by 0.7&#x02005;L/day, and the between-group difference at the final follow-up was 1.3&#x02005;L/day, which we attribute to the coaching skills and frequency of telephone follow-up with participants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29 R30 R31">29&#x02013;31</xref> Urine osmolality decreased to a greater extent in the hydration group compared with the control group (by 19% vs 5%, respectively); however, this difference was not statistically significant. Although other studies have demonstrated that acute water loading can significantly reduce urine osmolality,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> these studies evaluated hydration regimens that were much greater (eg, &#x02265;3&#x02005;L/day compared with 1&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;L/day in our study).</p><p>Our trial has some limitations that merit discussion. Because it was not possible to blind the participants in this pilot trial (nor in the main trial), both groups were fully informed of the main trial's hypothesis/research question: Does increased hydration reduce progression of CKD? To counteract any potential contamination of our control group being informed about the trial's objectives and potential benefit, we coached controls to not increase their hydration beyond normal intake or thirst. One explanation for the high refusal rate in this pilot phase is that the participants were asked to collect a total of three 24&#x02005;h urine samples: one every 2&#x02005;weeks. However, despite this onerous task, only one patient withdrew from the study after a flare-up of Crohn's disease. Although neither participants nor assessors were blinded, our primary outcome of change in 24&#x02005;h urine volume is an objective laboratory measure and therefore less subject to self-report or assessor bias, and 24&#x02005;h urine creatinine concentrations remained within 10% of baseline values for the hydration and control groups. We acknowledge that a 24&#x02005;h urine collection may not accurately capture a long-term fluid intake; however, because our primary outcome required participants to collect several 24&#x02005;h urine collections in a short period of time, we did not wish to increase respondent burden by requiring a detailed dietary history as well. Nonetheless, we observed a strong (r=0.84), statistically significant correlation between self-reported fluid intake from a 3-day diet record and 24&#x02005;h urine output. As well, despite the small sample size of this pilot trial, the between-group difference in 24&#x02005;h urine volumes was statistically significant over follow-up.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that increased water intake for 6&#x02005;weeks in patients with CKD is feasible and safe with no negative impact on quality of life; however, with only 18 patients randomised to the hydration regimen, long-term safety and generalisability are less clear. These are inevitable weaknesses of a pilot study, and we will be monitoring these variables closely in our 12-month randomised controlled trial. We will randomise 700 adults with CKD to the hydration regimen described here, or a control group (1:1). In the main trial, three 24&#x02005;h urine collections will be separated over 12&#x02005;months. We will measure participants&#x02019; eGFR every 3&#x02005;months for 12&#x02005;months, and compare the rate of renal decline between the intervention and control groups. We anticipate that this novel trial will generate important new knowledge about the effect of water intake on kidney function in patients with CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this 6-week pilot study demonstrate that patients with CKD are willing and able to increase water intake by up to 0.7&#x02005;L/day (in addition to usual consumed beverages, depending on sex and weight) with no safety concerns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e199" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003666.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e200" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003666.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was funded by Danone Research and the Programme of Experimental Medicine, Western University, Canada.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> WFC received speaking honoraria from and a recently initiated randomised controlled trial funded by Danone Research and the Programme of Experimental Medicine, Western University, Canada.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> Ethics approval was obtained from the Western University Research Ethics Board for Health Sciences (Board number is 102787) on 16 August 2012 (registered with the US Department of Health and Human Services IRB 00000940).
