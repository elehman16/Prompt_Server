To date, few pain-relieving drugs have been tested in infants. Morphine is a potent analgesic that provides effective pain relief in adults, but there is inconclusive evidence for its effectiveness in infants. The purpose of this study is to establish whether oral morphine provides effective analgesia for procedural pain in infants.</p><p id="P5"> A blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized, phase II, clinical trial will be undertaken to determine whether morphine sulphate administered orally prior to clinically-required retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening and heel lancing provides effective analgesia. &#x02028;156 infants between 34 and 42 weeks&#x02019; gestational age who require a clinical heel lance and ROP screening on the same test occasion will be included in the trial. Infants will be randomised to receive either a single dose of morphine sulphate (100 &#x003bc;g/kg) or placebo. Each infant will be monitored for 48 hours and safety data will be collected during the 24 hours following drug administration.</p><p id="P6"> The primary outcome will be the Premature Infant Pain Profile&#x02013;revised (PIPP-R) score 30 seconds after ROP screening. The co-primary outcome will be the magnitude of nociceptive-specific brain activity evoked by a clinically-required heel lance. Infant clinical stability will be assessed by comparing the number of episodes of bradycardia, tachycardia, desaturation and apnoea, and changes in respiratory support requirements in the 24-hour periods before and after the clinical intervention. In addition, drug safety will be assessed by considering the occurrence of apnoeic and hypotensive episodes requiring intervention in the 24-hour period following drug administration.

<italic>Accepted Protocol Summary</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The full Protocol was reviewed by The Lancet Editorial Board and three external reviewers, with a view to publishing the results once data collection is complete
<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Following
<italic>The Lancet</italic> review process key changes were made to the Protocol (Amendment 1) and prior to the recruitment further amendments were made following review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) (Amendment 2) and following a change in the drug manufacturer (Amendment 3 &#x00026; 4).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Background</title><p id="P9">Pain in infancy is a serious clinical issue. While infant pain is recognised to have both immediate and long-term consequences, it is still drastically under-treated in this population. Although an infant receiving intensive care will experience an average of 10 painful procedures per day, specific analgesia is provided less than 25% of the time
<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, this provision of analgesia includes &#x02018;comfort techniques&#x02019; (such as skin-to-skin maternal contact) and does not specifically refer to pharmacological analgesia, which would be routinely used in older children and adults
<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Despite the high burden of pain in the neonatal population, less than 40% of UK neonatal units have a Pain Management Protocol
<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The historical misconception that infants do not &#x02018;feel&#x02019; pain has led to the predisposition to under-treat pain in clinical practice
<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. For example, surveys of neonatal practice demonstrate that 50% of neonatal units in the UK and US do not routinely provide premedication for highly invasive elective intubation, despite evidence of clinical benefit
<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. If infants are to receive the best possible care a change in clinical practice is needed whereby there is an expectation to recognise and effectively treat infant pain. As such, it is essential that clinical trials that test the efficacy of analgesic medication be conducted using specific and sensitive measures of infant pain.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening</title><p id="P11">The most vulnerable infants, with the highest burden of pain, are those born prematurely who require intensive neonatal care. In the UK, newborn infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) will be hospitalised for an average of 56 days, and the youngest and sickest infants will experience up to 50 painful procedures per day
<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) screening is an example of a highly invasive medical procedure that is repeatedly performed on premature infants. ROP is a condition of the retinal vascular system that affects premature infants, which if untreated, can lead to permanent blindness. As such there is a national ROP screening programme, which involves regular ophthalmic screening of premature infants to identify whether ROP treatment is necessary. Unfortunately, ROP screening is considered to be painful
<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and is stressful for both infants and parents
<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Infants are extremely unsettled both during and after the procedure, and increased pain scores
<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, increased salivary cortisol
<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and an increased likelihood of apnoeic episodes in the 24 hour period after screening have been reported
<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Pain management strategies that have been used for ROP screening include the use of topical local anaesthetic, sucrose and breast milk, but they have all been shown to be inadequate for reducing pain
<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Indeed, a recent Cochrane review examining the use of local anaesthetic concluded that &#x0201c;screening remains a painful procedure and the role of non-pharmacological and pharmacological intervention including different local anaesthetic agents should be ascertained in future randomised trials&#x0201d;
<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The level of clinical distress caused by this procedure is exemplified in a recent study, which reports that in the 24-hour period following ROP screening 41% of infants have apnoeic episodes compared to only 19% after the examination
<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">It is plausible that the immediate distress caused to an infant during ROP screening and the resultant physiological instability that follows the examination may be alleviated if effective pain relief is provided during the procedure.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Morphine analgesia</title><p id="P14">Morphine is a potent analgesic that provides effective pain relief for procedural pain in adults
<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> but evidence for its effectiveness in infants is less clear. Morphine is commonly used on neonatal units as a sedative. For example, during mechanical ventilation intravenous morphine has been shown to reduce physiological instability; reduce behavioural and hormonal stress responses; and improve ventilator synchrony
<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Although morphine clearly provides effective sedation in infants, the efficacy of morphine as an analgesic remains controversial
<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine clinical use of morphine for procedural pain relief in mechanically ventilated infants
<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. To date, no randomised controlled trials have been completed whereby morphine has been administered to healthy non-ventilated infants prior to acute painful procedures. Given the need for analgesics in the neonatal population and the limited availability of other analgesic drugs, it is essential that the efficacy of morphine analgesia be properly tested. It is plausible that administration of morphine prior to ROP screening may provide effective pain relief and consequently reduce the resultant physiological instability caused by the procedure.</p><p id="P15">To date only one trial has attempted to test whether morphine analgesia can reduce pain during ROP screening
<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. While the results of this study suggested that morphine may provide effective pain relief, unfortunately, the trial was stopped prematurely due to changes to research regulations of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) and the need to obtain new approval to continue the study. The authors determined a sample size of 63 infants was needed, but were only able to recruit 18 infants in the study period and so did not reach the sample size necessary to detect whether morphine caused a significant reduction in pain scores
<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Clinical measures of pain in infants</title><p id="P16">Measures of pain in infants primarily rely on measuring changes in infant behaviour in response to noxious events. In premature infants the most validated clinical pain tool is the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP)
<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. The PIPP primarily relies on the quantification of behavioural and physiological responses that are evoked by noxious stimulation. As PIPP is a composite multimodal measure, incorporating measures of heart rate, oxygen saturation and facial expression change, it allows for different aspects of the infant pain experience to be captured. It is well-validated for pain assessment in premature infants and has been widely used as the primary outcome measure for infant pain in many clinical trials
<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. If administration of morphine prior to ROP screening significantly reduced subsequent pain scores, there would be a strong rationale for its use in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Measures of nociceptive-specific brain activity and reflex withdrawal activity</title><p id="P17">While behavioural measures are presently the gold standard for the assessment of pain, new electrophysiological techniques have more recently been developed to identify patterns of nociceptive brain and spinal cord activity in infants
<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. These objective and quantifiable neurophysiological measures have been used as the primary outcome measure in a recent clinical trial published in
<italic>The Lancet,</italic> providing evidence to suggest that sucrose may not provide analgesia during clinical heel lancing
<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. It would be highly advantageous to use these electrophysiological measures of nociceptive brain and spinal cord activity in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of morphine analgesia. This will provide a unique opportunity to gain a mechanistic insight into how morphine alters nociceptive activity in the immature infant central nervous system.</p><p id="P18">Measures of nociceptive brain activity evoked by ROP screening cannot be easily recorded due to difficulties in identifying the precise time when the nociceptive stimulus is applied. However, nociceptive-specific patterns of brain activity have been extremely well-characterised following clinical heel lancing
<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Heel lancing is a clinical procedure frequently performed in neonates to provide blood samples for the monitoring of jaundice, blood sugar, electrolytes and other haematological parameters. Due to the frequency of this procedure (which can be performed multiple times a day in some premature infants) it is feasible to arrange that ROP screening occurs immediately after a clinical blood sample is taken. The opportunity to perform ROP screening and a clinical heel lance on the same occasion means it is possible to administer morphine or a placebo in advance of both procedures. Therefore it is feasible to not only test whether morphine effectively reduces clinical pain scores during ROP screening but also to establish whether morphine reduces nociceptive brain and spinal cord activity evoked by a noxious heel lance.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Benefits and risks</title><p id="P19">The benefit of this trial is that we will determine whether pre-emptive administration of morphine provides effective pain relief for acute procedural pain in infants. Not only would effective pain relief make the infants more comfortable during these procedures but it may also improve the physiological stability of the infants in the 24-hour period after the procedure. Furthermore, the provision of effective pain relief may reduce not prevent the long-term structural white matter damage and deficits in cognitive ability that have been directly linked to the number of painful experiences that hospitalised infants receive during their neonatal care
<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">There are risks associated with the administration of morphine, which include increased hypotension and respiratory depression
<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. However, in studies in ventilated infants where approximately double the dose of morphine proposed in this trial was used, there was no difference in blood pressure during the first hour after infusion, the fraction of inspired oxygen during the 12 hours after infusion, or the number of infants with hypotension requiring treatment, between the morphine-treated and control not control-treated infants
<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. The authors do, however, report a trend towards increased hypotension and ventilator requirements, which they considered is likely to be driven by the administration of the morphine. In a separate retrospective study, where safety of morphine administration in non-intubated infants was investigated, significant differences in hypotension were not observed, although there was a suggestion that increased ventilator support was required when 2 infants were included who had been accidentally overdosed &#x02013; the difference between the groups was not significant when the overdosed infants were excluded
<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. While there are side effects associated with the administration of morphine &#x02013; which will be further investigated as part of this study &#x02013; the benefit of providing adequate pain relief is likely to outweigh the possible adverse consequences. Given that morphine is commonly administered to hospitalised infants the importance of investigating the efficacy and safety of morphine for procedural pain is clear.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Justification for trial</title><p id="P21">ROP screening is a clinically-essential procedure which is known to cause pain and distress in infants, and often results in an extended period of clinical instability
<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Numerous pain management strategies have been shown to be ineffective for ROP screening, including the use of sucrose, breast milk and local anaesthetic eye drops
<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. It is highly beneficial to test whether morphine administration reduces acute pain caused by ROP screening and whether it improves clinical stability during the subsequent 24 hours. While the primary objective of this study is to look at the effect of morphine analgesia on well-validated clinical pain scores calculated 30 seconds after ROP screening, this study also provides an opportunity to gain a mechanistic insight into how morphine alters nociceptive brain and spinal cord activity evoked by an acute noxious heel lance. If a bolus dose of oral morphine is proven to be a safe and effective analgesic for procedural pain that results in improved clinical stability, this would result in a significant change to current clinical practice for ROP screening and, potentially, provide an analgesic which can be used for other acutely painful procedures in infants, such as laser eye surgery.</p><p id="P22">A single dose of 200 &#x003bc;g/kg oral morphine sulphate (which is double the dose proposed in this study) has been used in a previous study testing analgesic efficacy for ROP screening and the authors reported, in the paper and through personal communication, that there were no adverse effects of morphine administration at this dose
<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Morphine analgesia will be administered in addition to current pain management strategies, which, in the John Radcliffe Hospital, include the use of local anaesthetic eye drops prior to the ROP screening and comfort techniques (such as swaddling) during heel lancing. Other than the administration of the trial medication and some extra physiological monitoring, current clinical practice will not be altered for trial participants.</p><p id="P24">In this trial we will use a standardised comfort technique. Trial participants will be swaddled using methods that we have successfully implemented in previous electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies. We will lay the infant supine on a cotton cloth and cross the infant&#x02019;s arms over their chest in a relaxed position. The ends of the cloth will then be crossed over the infant&#x02019;s body and arms, and tucked beneath the opposing side. The swaddling cloth will not cover the infant&#x02019;s feet, in order to allow access for monitoring leads and blood sampling. The cloth will only restrict gross upper body movements and hold the infant securely and comfortingly in a flexed position.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Outline of trial proposal</title><p id="P25">In this study we aim to determine whether a single dose of morphine sulphate (100 &#x003bc;g/kg) administered orally prior to painful clinical procedures provides effective analgesia. The dosage, route of administration and time course have been selected based on previous literature
<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and based on recommendations in the British National Formulary for children (BNFc) (2015).</p><p id="P26">The primary objective is to determine whether morphine analgesia reduces clinical pain scores following ROP screening. In addition, to provide a better mechanistic understanding of how morphine affects nociceptive brain and spinal cord activity we will investigate the effect of morphine on electrophysiological measures of nociceptive brain and spinal cord activity evoked by a heel lance. Infants will be randomised to receive either morphine or a placebo prior to a clinically required heel lance and ROP screening, which will be performed on the same test occasion. The effect of morphine on clinical pain scores (evoked by the heel lance and ROP screening), nociceptive-specific brain activity and spinal cord activity (evoked by clinical heel lance), clinical stability, and drug safety will be investigated (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Trial design</title><sec id="S12"><title>Trial description</title><p id="P28">This study is a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (IMP).

Participants will have a roughly equal chance of receiving morphine sulphate or placebo (inactive solution). The randomisation program will use a minimisation algorithm to ensure approximate balance between the groups with respect to gestational age at the time of study, gestational age at birth, number of days on a ventilator, presence of gastric tube at time of study, number of days since morphine has been given, intra-uterine growth restriction and previous surgery. The users of the system will have no insight into the next allocation. Balance between the groups for each of the minimisation variables will be reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and reported in trial publications.</p><p id="P52">Participants will be randomised shortly before the 48-hour period of clinical stability monitoring commences.

Once recruited, we will establish when the ROP screening is to be conducted and the studies will be timed to fit in with the Ophthalmology schedule. The Consultant Ophthalmologist is fully informed about this study and has agreed to liaise with the research team regarding timing of the ROP screening.

An Ophthalmologist or suitably experienced Ophthalmology Trainee will carry out screening as per standard practice. Both pupils will be dilated with mydriatic eye drops (Tropicamide 1% and Phenylephrine 2.5%) approximately 1 hour prior to screening. At the time of screening, an assistant will support the infant&#x02019;s head. Topical local anaesthetic (proxymetacaine 0.5%) instillation will be followed 10 seconds later by insertion of an eyelid speculum, which will be used to hold the eyelid open during the exam. The eye will be intermittently lubricated using sterile saline drops. A Flynn style indenter will be used to stabilise the eye allowing for a standardised intensity light beam to enter the eye through a condensing lens as part of the binocular ophthalmoscopic fundus examination.

The co-primary objective is to determine whether morphine administration reduces nociceptive-specific brain activity in response to a heel lance, compared with administration of a placebo. A 2-point reduction in PIPP scores is considered to be a clinically-meaningful reduction in pain
<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and scores below 7 are considered to reflect minimal pain
<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Three studies have used PIPP scores to assess analgesic efficacy following ROP screening
<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Using the most conservative data, where the mean PIPP score post ROP screening was 8.3 (standard deviation [SD] 3.5), we would require 66 infants per group to observe a 2-point reduction in PIPP-R scores, with a power of 90% at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.</p><p id="P142">We also considered the sample size required to see a significant difference between the groups in the co-primary outcome measure (i.e. the nociceptive-specific brain activity evoked by a heel lance). In previous analysis
<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> the nociceptive-specific brain activity evoked by a heel lance had a mean amplitude of 0.2 (SD 0.14). In this study the amplitude of the nociceptive-specific brain activity will be calculated and compared between the two groups. Studies in adults with chronic pain indicate that morphine treatment attenuates the amplitude of laser-evoked potentials by 33.1%
<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, adults administered Tramadol (an opioid treatment) show up to a 50% reduction in the amplitude of laser-evoked potentials
<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. This reduction in nociceptive brain activity is coupled with the verbal report that tramadol is providing effective pain relief. Tramadol is a widely used as an analgesic in adults and trials have shown that it effectively reduces pain in patients with neuropathic pain
<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P143">In this study we will assume that a 40% reduction in the magnitude of the nociceptive-specific brain activity represents a clinically meaningful reduction in brain activity, which in adults would be concomitant with a significant reduction in verbally reported pain scores. A 40% reduction would lead to the noxious components having a post-treatment amplitude of approximately 0.12 (SD 0.14) down from a mean of 0.20. Coincidentally, we would require 66 infants per group for a power of 90% at a two-sided significance level of 5%. Allowing for a loss to follow-up rate of approximately 10% (i.e. due to technical difficulties during physiological monitoring), a total of 148 infants will need to be included in the study.</p><p id="P144">We anticipate the proportion of twins eligible for the trial to be around 25% based on past studies (e.g. NPEU-run BOOST-II UK, I2S2, PiPS and SIFT trials). There is evidence that the correlation in pain outcomes between twins is 0.5
<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Hence the effect of clustering (technically the design effect) is calculated to be 1.06. This will inflate the total sample size required (90% power, 5% two-sided significance level, 10% loss to follow-up and accounting for multiple births) from 148 to 156 (78 per group).</p></sec><sec id="S47"><title>Significance levels</title><p id="P145">For the analysis of the primary outcome measure and co-primary outcome measure, a P-value of 0.05 (two-sided 5% significance level) will be used to indicate statistical significance. We will address the multiplicity issue by using Hochberg&#x02019;s procedures for multiple testing to control the family-wise error rate
<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Therefore, we will reject the null hypothesis for both outcomes if P&#x0003c;0.05 for both outcomes. If P&#x0003e;0.05 for one of the outcomes then the other outcome will be tested at 2.5% significance level. This method is less stringent than the Bonferroni adjustment while preserving the original power of the study.</p><p id="P146">Comparisons of all other outcomes will be reported in full for completeness and transparency. For all other analyses, a P-value of 0.01 (two-sided 1% significance level) will be used to indicate statistical significance, in order to take account of the number of comparisons. Two-sided statistical tests and corresponding P-values will be presented throughout; however for the purposes of interpretation of results, confidence intervals will dominate, rather than P-values.</p></sec><sec id="S48"><title>Missing data</title><p id="P147">Missing data may occur in our trial. For example, this could be due to equipment failure, artefacts within the EEG recording, or the infant being withdrawn if morphine administration is deemed clinically inappropriate after a participant has been randomised. If missing data does exist we expect it will occur at random, and so the collected data will be representative of the population. To account for missing data we have inflated our sample size by 10%.

A total of 156 infants between 34 and 42 weeks&#x02019; corrected gestational age who require a clinical heel lance and ROP screening on the same test occasion will be included in the trial. Infants will be randomised to receive either a single dose of morphine sulphate (100 &#x003bc;g/kg) or placebo. Each infant will be monitored for 48 hours and safety data will be collected during the 24 hours following drug administration. The primary outcome will be the Premature Infant Pain Profile&#x02013;revised (PIPP-R) score during the 30-seconds period after ROP screening. The co-primary outcome will be the magnitude of nociceptive-specific brain activity evoked by a clinically-required heel lance.</p><p id="P207"> This is a very relevant study because it aims at finding an effective analgesic strategy to reduce pain during ROP screening since no analgesic approach so far published seems adequate. Furthermore, it will contribute to obtain evidence of the analgesic efficacy of morphine in the neonate for procedural pain. Conflicting evidence exists about the efficacy of continuous morphine to relieve pain from routine procedures in ventilated preterm neonates. Two studies investigated their responses to tracheal suctioning
<sup>1,2</sup>;&#x000a0;in one of them, Anand
<italic>et al </italic>found a reduction in pain scores
<sup>2</sup>,&#x000a0;whereas Simons
<italic>et al</italic>, judging from pain scores obtained with three validated scales, found no difference between morphine and placebo groups
<sup>1</sup>.&#x000a0;Pain measured by facial expression was diminished by morphine infusions during heel stick in preterm and term neonates, but pain measures did not correlate with plasma morphine concentrations
<sup>3</sup>.&#x000a0;In another study, morphine given as a loading dose followed by continuous intravenous infusions to less than 48-hours old ventilated neonates under 33 weeks gestation did not appear to provide adequate analgesia for the acute pain caused by a heel stick
<sup>4</sup>.&#x000a0;Thus, the use of two different procedures as well as the use of two different ways of assessing pain in the current study will contribute to a better understanding of the analgesic efficacy of morphine in neonates. Of note, at the time of the study intervention, neonates will be at least two weeks old and between 34 and 42 corrected gestational age. The close follow-up during 48 hours after the painful procedure is a major asset.</p><p id="P208"> The protocol is very well written and interventions are very clearly and repeatedly explained. The background section provides enough information to understand the importance of this study and the rationale of using these two procedures. The trial design section shows in the text and in the corresponding figure a clear outline of planned interventions. The safety monitoring section is complete and gives clear indications of the assessments and reporting of adverse effects. The statistical analyses are well presented and data management procedures seem very relevant.</p><p id="P209">

</p><p id="P213"> Page 3. The explanation of the distress caused by ROP needs, in my opinion, to be clarified. When citing Mitchell
<italic> et al </italic>(Ref 14), it is said that the level of clinical distress caused by this procedure is exemplified in a recent study, which reports that in the 24-hour period following ROP screening 41% of infants have apneic episodes compared to only 19% after the examination. In fact, this information does not seem to correspond to what is mentioned in the article which indicates an apnea frequency of 12.8% before eye examination, 23.07% within the first 24 hours after eye examination (p=0.13) and 30.7% from 25-48 hours after eye examination (p=0.04).</p><p id="P215"> Page 3. If the described plausibility that the administration of morphine prior to ROP screening may provide effective pain relief and consequently reduce the resultant physiological instability caused by the procedure is true, one interpretation would be that this procedure elicits a long lasting pain because of the tissue damage or inflammation that may be created by the long lasting insertion of a speculum that pulls apart the eyelids.</p><p id="P217"> Page 4. While the use of nociceptive-specific brain activity may allow identifying patterns of nociceptive brain activity, it should be kept in mind during the discussion and interpretation of results that pain is a very complex phenomenon that could not be reduced to a very short lasting electrical activity. In a previous paper of the authors, this brain activity that lasted less than 100 milliseconds was used as a primary outcome to assess the analgesic efficacy of an oral sweet solution. In the current study, the authors will use again an immediate nociceptive electrical signal during a heel lance but also measure pain with a pain scale after the end of ROP screening. These two types of assessments seem complementary.</p><p id="P219"> Page 4. In the justification of the trial, the statement on the use of a dose of 200 &#x000b5;g/kg of oral morphine does not correspond to the cited reference (Ref 37).</p><p id="P220">

</p><p id="P222"> Page 5. In box 1 and throughout the text, the description of the moment of the pain assessment for ROP screening is a bit confusing. It is said that pain will be assessed with the PIPP-R score 30 seconds after ROP screening. It would be more appropriate to say that pain will be assessed during the 30-seconds period after ROP screening.</p><p id="P224"> Page 5. Box 1, secondary outcome measures. The measurement of the incidence of apnea is only relevant for non-intubated infants. This should be clarified because nowhere in the protocol it is indicated that intubated infants will not be included. The use of an inotrope as a marker of hypotension requiring intervention is in my opinion insufficient because in many occasions the first intervention for morphine-induced hypotension will be volume replacement. Thus, this volume replacement should also be monitored and reported.</p><p id="P226"> Page 6. Inclusion-exclusion criteria. It should be clarified that intubated and non-intubated infants will be included.</p><p id="P228"> Page 7. Figure 2. In the exclusion criteria box, correct &#x0201c;&#x02026;born to mothers who regularly used opiates&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p id="P230"> Page 11. Reflex withdrawal. Reference 38 does not correspond to this statement; it should be reference numbered 37.</p><p id="P232"> Page 11. Safety of administration of oral morphine. As indicated above the incidence of apnea is only relevant to non-intubated infants.</p><p id="P234"> Page 12. Concomitant medications. The assertion &#x0201c;At present infants do not receive any pain medication prior to heel lancing so it is acceptable that the control group receive a placebo (inactive solution) with no medicinal effects.&#x0201d; Is not true everywhere. Indeed, the opposite is becoming true. Guidelines for managing painful procedures in different countries indicate the use of sucrose for heel lance. For instance a joint position statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that a combination of oral sucrose/glucose and other nonpharmacological pain reduction methods (nonnutritive sucking, kangaroo care, facilitated tuck, swaddling and developmental care) should be used for minor, routine procedures
<sup>5</sup>;&#x000a0;this recommendation was ratified in 2016
<sup>6</sup>.&#x000a0;In the UK, The Royal College of Anaesthetists recommends, in its Core standards for pain management services in the UK, the use of sucrose for painful procedures in infants.</p><p id="P235"> In conclusion, this is a very interesting and relevant protocol that addresses an important issue in neonatal pain management. It should contribute to the improvement of analgesic practices in this vulnerable population.</p><p id="P237">

Also the additional procedures (how the screening and lancing will be performed, additional interventions like swaddling, dilatation eye drops and local anaesthetics) are well described. This study design has the potential to provide an answer on the potential relevance of morphine for both procedural interventions after these &#x02018;conventional interventions&#x02019; but alternative approaches (eg. venepuncture instead of heel lancing, or using less painful procedures of ROP screening or not considered).</p><p id="P248">I have read this submission.
