Here, we present 52-week results from the MEASURE 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 and 150 mg subcutaneous maintenance dosing, following an intravenous loading regimen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A total of 226 patients were randomized to intravenous secukinumab 10 mg/kg (baseline, weeks 2 and 4) followed by subcutaneous secukinumab 300 mg (IV-300 mg) or 150 mg (IV-150 mg) every 4 weeks, or matched placebo. Patients in the placebo group were re-randomized to subcutaneous secukinumab at a dose of 300 or 150 mg at week 16. The primary endpoint was the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for 20% improvement (ASAS20) response rate at week 16 in the IV-300 mg or IV-150 mg versus placebo. Other endpoints assessed through week 52 included improvements in ASAS40, ASAS 5/6, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, and ASAS partial remission responses, as well as the change from baseline in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Statistical analyses followed a predefined hierarchical hypothesis testing strategy to adjust for multiplicity of testing, with non-responder imputation used for binary variables and mixed-model repeated measures for continuous variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The primary efficacy endpoint was met; the ASAS20 response rate was significantly greater at week 16 in the IV-300 mg (60.5%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and IV-150 mg (58.1%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) groups versus placebo (36.8%). All secondary endpoints were met at week 16, except ASAS partial remission in the IV-150 mg group. Improvements achieved with secukinumab in all clinical endpoints at week 16 were also sustained at week 52. Infections, including candidiasis, were more common with secukinumab than with placebo during the placebo-controlled period.

AS is often associated with inflammatory back pain and stiffness, which can lead to functional impairment and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">AS affects up to 1.4% of the population worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As per the treatment recommendations of the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria (ASAS)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first-line treatment for patients with active, predominantly axial manifestations of spondyloarthritis. Patients with peripheral disease who do not respond to NSAIDs may be treated with conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); nonetheless, DMARDs are not recommended in patients with axial manifestations, due to lack of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Although, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are the first-line biologic therapy for AS, up to 40% of patients do not respond to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], collectively due to primary or secondary treatment failure or intolerance.

Previous use of DMARDs and anti-TNF agents was allowed. Washout periods for these agents, other than sulfasalazine and methotrexate, were required before the initiation of study treatment. Patients previously treated with not more than one anti-TNF agent could participate if they had an inadequate response to an approved dose for 3 months or more or had unacceptable side effects following at least one dose (hereafter, collectively referred to as patients with an inadequate response to anti-TNF agents).

After a 10-week screening period, eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1) using an interactive response technology (IRT) system to one of two secukinumab dose groups (300 mg or 150 mg) or a placebo group. Patients in the secukinumab groups received an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg body weight (delivered as a 125 mg/5 mL liquid-in-vial formulation) at baseline and weeks 2 and 4, followed by subcutaneous secukinumab in the form of prefilled syringes (PFS) at a dose of either 300 mg (IV-300 mg) or 150 mg (IV-150 mg) every 4 weeks starting at week 8. Patients in the placebo group were treated according to the same intravenous-to-subcutaneous administration schedule (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At week 16, all patients in the placebo group were re-randomized to receive either secukinumab 300 mg or 150 mg (1:1) subcutaneously every 4 weeks.</p><p id="Par35">The randomization of patients was stratified according to previous anti-TNF therapy (patients who were na&#x000ef;ve to anti-TNF therapy (anti-TNF-na&#x000ef;ve) or those with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to these agents (anti-TNF-IR)).</p><p id="Par36">The institutional review board at each participating center approved the protocol. The trial was conducted by the study investigators in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and was analyzed by the Sponsor. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Based on the rejection of one or both of these hypotheses, secondary endpoint analysis was completed according to a pre-specified hierarchy sequence.</p><p id="Par43">The primary and other binary endpoints were evaluated by means of logistic regression with treatment and anti-TNF response status as factors and weight as a covariate. Missing values, including those due to discontinuation of the study treatment, were imputed as failure to achieve the given response (non-responses).</p><p id="Par44">Between-group differences in continuous variables were evaluated using the mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) approach, with missing data assumed to be missing at random and with study group, assessment visit, and anti-TNF response status as factors. Weight and baseline values of the endpoints were included in the model as continuous covariates. Interaction terms included study group and baseline value according to the assessment visit. For changes in hsCRP, the log ratio of the post-baseline value to the baseline value was used to normalize the distribution of hsCRP at each assessment.</p><p id="Par45">Safety endpoints were evaluated in the safety set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug; these endpoints were summarized descriptively. Safety results are presented for the placebo-controlled period (i.e., first 16 weeks of treatment) to reflect the time point at which the primary objective was defined and the entire safety reporting period, which included all safety data up to the date cutoff of the last patient&#x02019;s week 52 clinic visit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par46">Of 278 patients screened, 226 (81.3%) underwent randomization to receive an intravenous loading regimen of secukinumab 10 mg/kg body weight at baseline and weeks 2 and 4, followed by subcutaneous secukinumab at a dose of 300 mg (IV-300 mg; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;76), or 150 mg (IV-150 mg; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;74) starting from week 8.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of non-fatal SAEs was low and was similar between both secukinumab groups (4.8 events per 100 patient-years in the any secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg groups).</p><p id="Par55">No cases of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events, Crohn&#x02019;s disease, or ulcerative colitis were reported. Two patients (one case each in the any secukinumab 150 mg and any secukinumab 300 mg) group reported grade 3 neutropenia; grade 4 neutropenia was reported in two patients from the any secukinumab 150 mg group. These findings resolved, did not lead to discontinuation of study treatment, and no concomitant infections or infestations were reported. <italic>Candida</italic> infection was reported in two patients each in the any secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg dose groups. These included one case each of esophageal candidiasis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, genital candidiasis and oral candidiasis. All these cases were mild to moderate in severity and resolved with standard antifungal treatment, without leading to study discontinuation. Uveitis was reported in one patient in the any secukinumab 300 mg group and in two patients in the any secukinumab 150 mg group (with one new-onset mild event leading to treatment discontinuation, while the other two cases were in patients with a prior history of uveitis). Benign tumor was reported in one patient each in the any secukinumab 300 mg (skin papilloma) and 150 mg (enchondroma) groups.</p><p id="Par56">No other clinically relevant changes were observed in laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG findings over the entire safety reporting period. No dose dependence was observed in any safety risk. Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies were reported in only one patient in the secukinumab IV-300 mg group, which were not neutralizing to secukinumab and did not lead to loss of efficacy, pharmacokinetic abnormalities, or associated immunogenicity-related AEs. No deaths were reported during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par57">Both secukinumab groups (300 mg and 150 mg subcutaneous maintenance dosing, preceded by an intravenous loading regimen) had rapidly reduced signs and symptoms of active AS, further confirming the results from two previous phase 3 studies that used either intravenous or subcutaneous loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Placebo-treated patients re-randomized to secukinumab at week 16 (no loading regimen) also showed improvements across all efficacy endpoints through 52 weeks of treatment.</p><p id="Par58">As in previous studies, the current trial met the primary endpoint with approximately 60% of patients achieving an ASAS20 response in each secukinumab group, with an early onset of action by week 1 and sustained treatment responses through week 52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The bulk of the data collection in MEASURE 3 occurred following regulatory approval of secukinumab for the treatment of AS, which could potentially have contributed to increased placebo responses on patient-reported outcome measures (due to patient expectations). If this was the case, changes in objective markers of inflammation, such as hsCRP levels, would not be subject to this same placebo response, which was confirmed by the lack of decrease in hsCRP in the placebo group.</p><p id="Par59">Improvements observed in more stringent ASAS40 and ASAS5/6 response criteria were more than 40% across both secukinumab groups up to 52 weeks of treatment, which provides further evidence of clinically meaningful long-term improvements in AS with secukinumab. Although MEASURE 3 is the first study to assess the efficacy and safety of a 300 mg dose of secukinumab in AS, the intravenous loading regimen used in both the 300 mg and 150 mg dose groups may have obscured dose-dependent differences in efficacy at week 16, although dose-dependent drug exposure was observed by week 24, with the IV-300 mg dose group demonstrating a median secukinumab concentration that was double that in the IV-150 mg group by this time point. Some differences in efficacy responses were evident by week 52, particularly for higher-hurdle efficacy endpoints such as ASAS40 (IV-300 mg, 53.9%; IV-150 mg, 40.5%) and ASAS partial remission (IV-300 mg, 22.4%; IV-150 mg, 16.2%).</p><p id="Par60">Although TNF inhibitors have shown efficacy in patients with AS, an unmet medical need persists due to primary and secondary treatment failure and intolerance, which has been well-documented in a substantial proportion of patients with AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Addressing this need, secukinumab has demonstrated efficacy in patients with AS with an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-TNF therapy in this and previous studies in AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, in patients who were na&#x000ef;ve to anti-TNF therapy for whom secukinumab was their first biologic treatment, ASAS20 response rates were approximately 5% higher with secukinumab IV-300 mg and IV-150 mg after 16 weeks of treatment, compared to the overall study population.</p><p id="Par61">The safety profile of secukinumab in this study was consistent with that observed in previous trials of secukinumab in patients with active AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and other indications, including psoriatic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. No new or unexpected safety findings were reported in this study, with lower AE and SAE rates observed than previously reported in the MEASURE 1 or MEASURE 2 studies, despite the use of a higher secukinumab dose (300 mg subcutaneous monthly dosing following three weight-based 10 mg/kg intravenous loading doses), suggesting that secukinumab 300 mg is as well-tolerated as the currently approved 150 mg dose.</p><p id="Par62">The use of immunomodulatory biologics has been associated with an elevated risk of AEs including <italic>Candida</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], uveitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and neutropenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. TNF inhibitors, in particular, have been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, including reactivation tuberculosis, bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to opportunistic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the current study, for the any secukinumab 300-mg and 150-mg dose groups, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates for serious infections were 1.6 and 0.8 per 100 patient-years, respectively, over the entire safety reporting period. Absolute rates of serious infection were also comparable to placebo (secukinumab IV-300 mg, 3.9%; secukinumab IV-150 mg, 5.4%; placebo, 8%) over the first 16 weeks of treatment (placebo-controlled period). Rates of other AEs of clinical interest were similarly reassuring and comparable to placebo, including <italic>Candida</italic> infection, uveitis, malignancy, and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, with no cases of Crohn&#x02019;s disease or ulcerative colitis reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par63">In conclusion, this study reinforces the observation that secukinumab provides rapid, significant, and sustained improvement over 52 weeks in the signs and symptoms of active AS, regardless of prior experience with TNF inhibitors, with response rates that were highest in patients na&#x000ef;ve to anti-TNF therapy. Also, the usability of the PFS and acceptability of a liquid-in-vial formulation to deliver intravenous loading doses was confirmed. These 52-week results demonstrate that both the 300 mg and 150 mg doses of secukinumab are efficacious and well-tolerated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
