All patients received adjuvant cancer treatment--premenopausal patients chemotherapy and post-menopausal patients anti-oestrogens. In addition, the patients were also randomized to receive oral clodronate 1600 mg daily for 3 years. BMD was measured at baseline and at 1 and 2 years, the collagen metabolites at baseline and at 1 year. There was a highly significant negative correlation between the changes in PINP and BMD in lumbar spine and femoral neck from baseline to 12 months in all patients (r(s) = -0.68, P &#x0003c; 0.0001, and -0.45, P &#x0003c; 0.0001, respectively), and in pre- and post-menopausal patients separately. The changes in PINP levels at 12 months predict further changes in BMD at 24 months (r = -0.70, P &#x0003c; 0.0001, and -0.51, P &#x0003c; 0.0001, respectively). ICTP and BMD changes correlated significantly only in lumbar spine of premenopausal patients who developed rapid bone loss due to chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea (r(s) = -0.34, P = 0.0003). The PINP levels at 12 months were significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the control group (P &#x0003c; 0.0001). Our results indicate that PINP is a sensitive marker of bone turnover rate. Changes in PINP levels significantly predicted changes in BMD and correlated with the antiresorptive efficacy of clodronate treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00002-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="240" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00002-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="241" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00002-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="242" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00002-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="243" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00002-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="244" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00002-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="245" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
