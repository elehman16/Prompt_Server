Incisional hernia, which develops in 9 to 20% of patients, remains the major complication of abdominal wall closure. Current clinical data indicate that the incidence of incisional hernias increases by 60% between the first and the third year after median laparotomy, implicating that a follow-up period of 1&#x000a0;year postoperatively is too short with regard to this common complication. Trauma to the abdominal wall can be reduced by improvements in suture technique as well as suture material. Several factors, such as stitch length, suture tension, elasticity, and tensile strength of the suture material are discussed and currently under investigation. A Swedish randomized controlled trial showed a significant reduction in the incisional hernia rate by shortening the stitch length. However, a non-elastic thread was used and follow-up ended after 12&#x000a0;months. Therefore, we designed a multicenter, international, double-blinded, randomized trial to analyze the influence of stitch length, using an elastic, extra-long term absorbable monofilament suture, on the long term clinical outcome of abdominal wall closure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In total, 468 patients undergoing an elective, median laparotomy will be randomly allocated to either the short stitch or the long stitch suture technique for abdominal wall closure in a 1:1 ratio. Centers located in Germany and Austria will participate. The primary endpoint measure is the incisional hernia rate 1&#x000a0;year postoperatively, as verified by ultrasound. The frequency of short term and long term complications as well as costs, length of hospital stay and patients&#x02019; quality of life (EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L) will be considered as secondary parameters. Following hospital discharge, patients will be examined after 30&#x000a0;days and 1, 3, and 5&#x000a0;years after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide further evidence on whether a short stitch suture technique in combination with an elastic, extra-long term absorbable monofilament suture can prevent incisional hernias in the long term, compared with the long stitch suture technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">NCT01965249</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Abdominal wall closure</kwd><kwd>Incisional hernia</kwd><kwd>Laparotomy</kwd><kwd>Large bites</kwd><kwd>Small bites</kwd><kwd>Suture technique</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The risk of developing an incisional hernia after primary elective median laparotomy is reported in the literature as being between 9 and 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among multiple risk factors, the malfunction or delay of collagen synthesis appears to be of utmost relevance. Friedman <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] showed direct correlation between a reduced collagen I/III quotient and the development of an unstable scar, based on immature, less mechanically stable, collagen 1. Obesity, steroid therapy, malnutrition, nicotine use, and connective tissue diseases are undeniably further main risk factors. But how should other factors, such as closure technique, suture material, or surgical experience, be interpreted in this context? Despite the paradigm shift in hernia surgery triggered in the beginning of the 1980s, which was initiated with the first documented use of plastic meshes by Usher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the problem of ensuring appropriate closure of the median laparotomy has not yet been satisfactorily solved. This issue still remains a topic of controversial discussion.</p><p>Since the publications of the Swedish group of Leif Israelsson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in 1993, the continuous closure technique with a defined suture/wound length ratio of 4:1 has increasingly been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For a long time, discussions regarding the ideal suture revolved around whether it should be &#x02018;non- or slowly absorbable&#x02019;. After numerous studies and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], conducted most recently by Diener <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the evidence for the ideal primary abdominal closure seem to have been adequately established. Based on the most recent meta-analysis of primary laparotomy closure, the continuous suture technique with a suture to wound length ratio of at least 4:1, using a monofilament, slowly absorbable suture can be considered state of the art.</p><p>Minimization of trauma to the abdominal wall is the most important consideration in terms of improvement of surgical technique and suture material used. According to the biomechanical principles of abdominal wall tension, the distribution of suture tension over small tissue bridges using the appropriate needle size and suture strength to minimize tissue trauma is the most promising approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to the surgical technique, the elasticity of the suture material is a further critical factor in preventing so-called &#x02018;buttonholes&#x02019;, according to physiological studies of the abdominal wall. Taking into account the results of experimental studies by H&#x000f6;er <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the association of different closure techniques and abdominal wall perfusions leading to different collagen ratios seems to be crucial in terms of creating a stable scar.</p><p>Based on these facts, the use of a monofilament suture material with a high elasticity in combination with a long-lasting basic retention strength as well as an extra-long absorption time of 390&#x000a0;days (MonoMax&#x000ae;, B. Braun Surgical SA, Rubi, Spain) seems to bear a significant potential for the improvement of abdominal wall suture stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This suture material might further improve the promising results of Millbourn&#x02019;s randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and will, therefore, by used in our multicenter, randomized controlled trial, which is aimed at comparing the long term clinical outcome of small versus large bite closure techniques after primary median laparotomies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The Effect of Suture Technique on the Occurrence of Incisional Hernia (ESTOIH) study is a prospective, international, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the short stitch suture technique using an elastic, extra-long term absorbable monofilament suture (MonoMax&#x000ae;) after primary median laparotomy, in comparison with the long stitch suture technique.</p><p>In total, 468 patients will be enrolled in seven centers located in Germany and Austria.

During all operations, the umbilicus has to be completely dissected from the linea alba for an adequate abdominal wall closure. The linea alba is prepared free from fat and cut precisely in the middle. In the case of a deviation, this is recorded in the randomization fax.

To standardize both suture techniques, each participating center has been trained by presentations and videos; in addition, a practical workshop took place during the first study meeting. In three of the seven centers, surgeons had already used the short stitch technique before the start of the trial and have attended a hospitation conducted by the coordinating investigator in the Wilhelminenspital in Vienna, Austria. The other four centers were instructed during a visit by the coordinating investigator Ren&#x000e9; H Fortelny before the first inclusions. All study centers were provided with suture material from the same batch, with the same type of stop watch for time measurement, a counter to enumerate the stitches, and rulers to measure the wound length, to standardize this equipment within the different centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study is the frequency of incisional hernias 1&#x000a0;year postoperatively, as assessed by ultrasound examination.</p><p>An incisional hernia is defined as an &#x02018;abdominal wall gap with or without bulging in the area of a postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by clinical examination or imaging&#x02019; according to the European Hernia Society.

The EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L is used in the German language version and a license has been obtained from the EuroQol Group by the sponsor. The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The questionnaire is designed for self-completion by respondents and takes only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L consists of two pages a descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, anxiety or depression). Each dimension has five levels: no problem, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ-VAS records the respondent&#x02019;s self-rated health on a 20&#x000a0;cm vertical visual analogue scale with endpoints labeled &#x02018;the best health you can imagine&#x02019; and &#x02018;the worst health you can imagine&#x02019;.</p><p>Short term complications include the frequency of burst abdomen and the reoperation rate due to burst abdomen until day of discharge. Wound infections occurring until the day of discharge and within 30&#x000a0;days after surgery will be recorded as short term complications. Wound infections are defined according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Furthermore, wound healing complications, such as seroma, necrosis, and fistula, reported until 30&#x000a0;days postoperatively will be counted as short term complications.</p><p>Long term complications include the frequency of incisional hernias after 3 and 5&#x000a0;years after surgery, ad detected by ultrasound examination. Furthermore, wound infections according to CDC classification 1&#x000a0;year postoperatively and wound healing complications occurring within 1&#x000a0;year after surgery will be investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The ISSAAC study has shown a risk of 19% of developing an incisional hernia within one year using MonoMax&#x000ae; suture material and a long stitch technique for abdominal wall closure of a primary elective midline laparotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

There is limited evidence that even with the &#x02018;long stitch&#x02019; technique using a loop suture, only one layer, the fascia only, should be included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] because there is less trauma to the tissue, implying a reduction in the risk of a burst abdomen. In addition to mesh development, today, different suture materials are available for closing the abdominal wall in primary laparotomies and incisional hernia surgery. Experimental studies and the clinical adaptation of an innovative &#x02018;short stitch&#x02019; technique by the Israelsson study group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] clearly proved, in a controlled trial, the concept of reduced tissue trauma and the impact on infection and incisional hernia rates when using this technique. Reducing the distance between the stitches and the wound edge to between 5 and 8 millimeters, thereby increasing the suture/wound length ratio, and using slowly absorbable sutures of size USP 2/0 (polydioxanone) and a half-circle round-bodied needle (thread length: 20&#x000a0;mm; arch length: 31&#x000a0;mm) and grasping only the aponeurosis, led to a significant decrease in the infection rate, as well as in the incisional hernia rate, compared with the &#x02018;long stitch&#x02019; group. The average suture/wound length ratio of the &#x02018;short stitch&#x02019; group of 5.7 versus 6.4 percent in the &#x02018;long stitch group&#x02019; resulted in a significantly lower rate of wound infection of 5.2 versus 10.2 percent, as well as a highly significant lower incisional hernia rate of 5.6 versus 18 percent at the one-year follow-up. The multivariate analysis revealed a twofold risk of wound infection and a fourfold risk of incisional hernia occurring in the &#x02018;long stitch&#x02019; group. Another randomized controlled trial, the STITCH study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] obtained similar significant results when comparing the large versus short stitch technique of primary midline closure. The one-year results of this study were presented at the annual EHS-Meeting in Edinburgh in May 2014. The incisional hernia rate in the large stitch group was 23%, compared with 14% for the short stitch group. In comparison with the Millbourn study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the incisional hernia rate is more than twice as high in the short stitch group, using an identical suture material. The reason for this difference might be the complete follow-up of all patients by ultrasound. An increase in the incisional hernia rate by 60% from 12&#x000a0;months to 36&#x000a0;months postoperatively has to be taken into account, as detected in the recently published data by Fink <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], regarding the long term follow-up of the INSECT and ISSAAC trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The significant advantage of the short stitch technique in causing minimal trauma to the abdominal wall seems to be clearly supported by the evidence-based level, whereas the synergetic effect of a special suture material used in this field has yet to be proven.</p><p>Based on the use of an elastic suture material with a long-lasting strength retention and ultra-long absorption time (MonoMax&#x000ae;), the ESTOIH study can be expected to yield lower hernia rates than the Millbourn study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study protocol was been registered on 9 October 2013.
