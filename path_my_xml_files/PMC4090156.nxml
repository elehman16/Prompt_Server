To tackle HIV-1 variation, we designed a unique T-cell immunogen HIVconsv from functionally conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome, which were presented to the immune system using a heterologous prime-boost combination of plasmid DNA, a non-replicating simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus ChAdV-63 and a non-replicating poxvirus, modified vaccinia virus Ankara. A block-randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled phase I trial HIV-CORE 002 administered for the first time candidate HIV-1- vaccines or placebo to 32 healthy HIV-1/2-uninfected adults in Oxford, UK and elicited high frequencies of HIV-1-specific T cells capable of inhibiting HIV-1 replication <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Myalgia and flu-like symptoms were more strongly associated with MVA than ChAdV63 or DNA vectors and more common in vaccine recipients than in placebo. There were no intercurrent HIV-1 infections during follow-up. 2/24 volunteers had low ChAdV-63-neutralizing titres at baseline and 7 increased their titres to over 200 with a median (range) of 633 (231-1533) post-vaccination, which is of no safety concern.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data demonstrate safety and good tolerability of the pSG2.HIVconsv DNA, ChAdV63.HIVconsv and MVA.HIVconsv vaccines and together with their high immunogenicity support their further development towards efficacy studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/results?term==HIV-CORE+002">NCT01151319</ext-link>

While vaccines for over 40 human pathogens including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are urgently needed, safety of the volunteers remains the primary concern. The biggest roadblock in the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the ability of HIV-1 to escape selective pressure of host immune response. To tackle this problem, we designed vaccine immunogen HIVconsv, derived from the functionally most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome <xref rid="pone.0101591-Letourneau1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These regions are common to most virus variants around the globe and the virus cannot easily change them without a likely decrease in its replicative fitness <xref rid="pone.0101591-Altfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101591-Leslie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The gene coding for the HIVconsv immunogen was inserted into plasmid DNA (pSG2.HIVconsv: D), simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus (ChAdV63.HIVconsv; C), which is at least equally immunogenic to human adenovirus 5, but has very low pre-existing antibody responses, and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA.HIVconsv; M) <xref rid="pone.0101591-Letourneau1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101591-Colloca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101591-Rosario1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The pre-clinical safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines were demonstrated in mice and rhesus macaques<xref rid="pone.0101591-Letourneau1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101591-Rosario1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101591-Rosario2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Two Good Laboratory Practice repeat-dose studies in the males and females of BALB/c mice showed no systemic toxicity of these three vaccine candidates <xref rid="pone.0101591-Ondondo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and supported approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the UK for their use in a phase I clinical trial. The first phase I trial HIV-CORE 002 (for COnserved REgions) of the pSG2.HIVconsv, ChAdV63.HIVconsv and MVA.HIVconsv vaccines administered in C, CM, DDDCM and DDDMC regimens to healthy HIV-1/2-uninfected adults in Oxford, UK showed high induction of HIV-1-specific T cells. Furthermore, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell effectors were capable of inhibiting growth of multiple strains of HIV-1 in autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> cells <italic>in vitro</italic>

There were no vaccine-related SAEs or serious adverse reactions over the study follow-up. Local and systemic events after vaccination were mild and transient, and the systemic reactogenicity was more associated with the MVA and ChAdV-63 vectors than DNA and with more vaccines than with placebo. No volunteer acquired HIV-1 infection during the study and the HIVconsv immunogen did not induce antibodies that could cause a reaction on standard HIV-1 diagnostic tests in any vaccine recipient.</p><p>An effective HIV-1 vaccine could be used both in prophylactic and therapeutic settings <xref rid="pone.0101591-Hanke1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The former would be administered to uninfected populations to prevent infection or control HIV-1 replication post-infection and thus postpone development of AIDS perhaps indefinitely. The latter would be given to HIV-1-infected patients, in whom T cell-eliciting vaccines aim to either decrease virus load or together with antiretroviral treatment and reactivation of latent HIV-1 aim to eliminate the virus from the body completely. The safety standards for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine applications are expected to be similar given the near-normal life expectancy that is achievable with combination antiretroviral therapy, therefore, in the case of the vaccines employed in trial HIV-CORE 002, the safety data so far support further development of the vaccination regimens for both prevention and therapy of HIV-1/AIDS.</p><p>The HIV-CORE 002 trial tested combinations of 3 vaccine modalities. In general, the safety of subunit vaccines vectored by DNA and MVA has been demonstrated in numerous trials reviewed elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0101591-Cebere1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101591-Dorrell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101591-Estcourt1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101591-Sutter1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In contrast, the safety of recombinant human adenovirus serotype-5 (HAdV-5) vaccines was questioned in a recent meta-analysis of phase IIb trials <xref rid="pone.0101591-Gilbert2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Post-hoc analysis of the Step and Phambili trials raised concerns regarding potential enhancement of HIV-1 acquisition risk after vaccination with the MRKAd5 vaccine <xref rid="pone.0101591-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101591-Duerr1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0101591-Richie1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However, these findings arose from analyses that were not pre-specified, did not reach statistical significance and/or included data that were collected from 80% after study unblinding. Importantly, HVTN 505 specifically addressed a concern raised in HVTN 502 regarding the role of pre-existing Ad5-specific antibodies by excluding individuals with these responses; this trial did not show a significant increase in HIV-1 acquisition in vaccinees <xref rid="pone.0101591-Hammer1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The vector ChAdV-63 employed in HIV-CORE 002 was selected because of its high immunogenicity and yet a number of significant differences from HAdV-5 <xref rid="pone.0101591-Colloca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, as confirmed by our analysis, pre-existing nAb were rare and of low titres. These results agree with a previous study, in which less than 3% of 193 tested Caucasian human healthy volunteers from diverse regions of Europe and the US had nAb titers over 200 <xref rid="pone.0101591-Colloca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Biologically, HAdV-5 is a group C adenovirus, while ChAdV-63 belongs to group E adenoviruses. The only HAdV representative of group E is HAdV-4 used in over 10 million military recruits in the US as a live, enteric-coated oral vaccine, and proven safe and effective again homologous HAdV infections. Yet, antibodies induced by HAdV-4 vaccine display minimal cross-reactivity with non-human adenoviruses <xref rid="pone.0101591-Paris1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.
