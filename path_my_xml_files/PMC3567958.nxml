Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has recently been described as a vascular condition characterized by restricted venous outflow from the brain, mainly due to blockages of the internal jugular and azygos veins. Despite a wide variability among studies, it has been found to be associated with MS. Data from a few small case series suggest possible improvement of the clinical course and quality of life by performing percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA) of the stenotic veins.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and methods</title><p>This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group, blinded, sham-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of PTA. Participants with relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS and a sonographic diagnosis of CCSVI will be enrolled after providing their informed consent. Each participant will be centrally randomized to receive catheter venography and PTA or catheter venography and sham PTA. Two primary end points with respect to efficacy at 12 months are (1) a combined end point obtained through the integration of five functional indicators, walking, balance, manual dexterity, bladder control, and visual acuity, objectively measured by instruments; and (2) number of new brain lesions measured by T2-weighted MRI sequences. Secondary end points include annual relapse rate, change in Expanded Disability Status Scale score, proportion of patients with zero, one or two, or more than two relapses; fatigue; anxiety and depression; general cognitive state; memory/attention/calculus; impact of bladder incontinence; and adverse events. Six hundred seventy-nine patients will be recruited. The follow-up is scheduled at 12 months. Patients, treating neurologists, trained outcome assessors, and the statistician in charge of data analysis will be masked to the assigned treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will provide an answer regarding the efficacy of PTA on patients&#x02019; functional disability in balance, motor, sensory, visual and bladder function, cognitive status, and emotional status, which are meaningful clinical outcomes, beyond investigating the effects on inflammation. In fact, an important part of patients&#x02019; expectations, sustained and amplified by anecdotal data, has to do precisely with these functional aspects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01371760</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency</kwd><kwd>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty</kwd><kwd>Functional disability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with a progressive course. Although the cause of MS is unknown, it is regarded as a complex disease that results from the combined effect of unidentified environmental factors and susceptibility genes. In western countries, it represents the second most common cause of disability in young adults, with onset usually occurring in the third or fourth decade of life. MS has an incidence of about 4 to 4.5 per 100.000 every year, an average prevalence of 83 per 100,000 in Europe and a female-to-male ratio of about 3:1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>MS has a chronic course that evolves over 30 to 40 years. The clinical phenotypes include relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS) and progressive relapsing MS (PRMS)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The development of a progressive course is by far the major route to permanent long-term disability, and it supervenes in about 80% of patients with RRMS by age 20 to 25 years. After age 15 to 18 years, about 50% of patients need assistance to walk, are confined to a wheelchair or have died, but there is substantial variation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>There are currently several pharmacological treatments approved for RRMS, but only one agent (interferon &#x003b2;-1b) has been approved in Europe (but not by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) for the SPMS form
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. First-line treatments for RRMS patients are interferon &#x003b2;-1a (IFN-&#x003b2;-1a) and IFN-1b and glatiramer acetate. The effect of these treatments is a moderate reduction in relapse rate and accumulation of disability at 1 to 2 years&#x02019; follow-up
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There is evidence of no effect of these treatments for patients with SPMS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and inconclusive evidence for those with PPMS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Side effects of these treatments are common, including influenza-like symptoms, injection site reactions, headache, depression and fatigue. Hematological toxic effects include hemoglobin reduction, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and increased liver enzymes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Mitoxantrone, natalizumab or fingolimod are second-line treatments for patients who have failed to respond to the first-line therapy. Mitoxantrone is moderately effective in reducing disability progression and relapse rate in patients with RRMS, PRMS and SPMS at short-term follow-up (2 years), but there is a long-term risk of therapy-related leukemias and cardiotoxicity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Natalizumab has been shown to be consistently effective in reducing the risk of relapses and disability progression after 2 years of treatment, but it increases the risk (not yet definitively assessed, but greater than 1 per 1,000 after 2 years of treatment) of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Fingolimod was the first drug to gain approval as an oral treatment by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for reducing relapse rate, but it can cause serious herpetic infections
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>There is currently no available pharmacological treatment with a good profile of safety and tolerability that is able to change, surely and meaningfully, the natural course of MS. Other biologic agents have recently been evaluated in phase II clinical trials for MS and seem to be more effective than interferons and glatiramer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but more phase III trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence of their efficacy and safety.</p><p>A recent hypothesis suggests that the presence of stenosis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and/or azygos veins that restricts normal blood flow from the brain and spinal cord may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of MS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The multifocal perivenous inflammation or demyelination in the CNS is postulated to be a consequence of a breakdown of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier due to elevated transmural pressure, followed by erythrocyte, plasma and iron extravasation, thus resulting in damage to the immune tolerance and setting off a cascade of inflammatory events and immune responses that can persist over time
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Were this hypothesis tenable, repairing venous stenosis and reestablishing correct venous flow from the brain toward the heart could have therapeutic effects, especially if the intervention was performed early. This condition has been named &#x0201c;chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency&#x0201d; (CCSVI) and is postulated to be congenital and genetically determined. CCSVI, as defined by Zamboni <italic>et al</italic>., is diagnosed with combined extracranial and transcranial echo color Doppler (ECD) radiography when two or more of five established parameters are present
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In 100% of the MS cases examined by Zamboni and colleagues, at least two of these alterations were found, as compared to 0% among healthy controls and patients affected by other neurological diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since publication of this first study, several articles have been published on the prevalence of CCSVI in patients with or without MS. To collect all the available information on CCSVI, we have updated (through May 2012) the results of a previous published meta-analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The included studies were conducted in Italy, the United States, Germany, Poland, Jordan and Iran
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The results (Figure&#x02009;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) indicate a statistically significant association between CCSVI and MS (odds ratio = 4.90; LC 95% = 1.86 to 12.90). However, the body of evidence is highly heterogeneous (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 85%) and thus inconclusive. The heterogeneity can be ascribed to various factors, including low-quality studies, mainly due to small sample sizes, inadequate study design and setting, absence of blindedness, varying accuracy of the ECD, including equipment, parameters, probes, techniques used and examiners&#x02019; experience.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Meta-analysis of diagnosis of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (presence of at least two parameters according to Zamboni criteria in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)) versus healthy controls.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-13-183-1"/></fig><p>Zamboni <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] reported the results of an open study of endovascular treatment for CCSVI on 65 MS patients who had undergone percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) to widen the veins. The results of PTA were safe. Patients with RRMS (<italic>n</italic> = 35) had fewer relapses, and their MS functional composite (MSFC) scores significantly improved at 18 months after the intervention compared with baseline. Patients with SPMS (<italic>n</italic> = 20) or PPMS (<italic>n</italic> = 10) showed little improvement in MSFC score. All patients had improvement of physical and mental health as measured by the MS Quality of Life&#x02013;54 questionnaire at 18-month follow-up. A high incidence (47%) of restenosis in the IJV was reported at 18 months
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In a case series of 24 patients, 6 patients had a relapse of clinical symptoms within 1 to 2 months of the procedure, although it was reported that they felt better than before the procedure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In a case series of 31 MS patients with CCSVI, PTA was performed in the azygos vein in 90% (28 of 31) of patients and in both the left and right IJVs in 77% (24 of 31). Scores on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) significantly improved from preoperative values, and the positive trend was maintained at 1 year
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In a retrospective case series of 167 patients affected by MS and CCSVI who underwent PTA, 67% of patients reported subjective amelioration regarding nonspecific symptoms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In a case&#x02013;control study, eight patients had PTA in addition to medical therapy (immediate treatment group (ITG)), whereas seven had treatment with PTA after 6 months of medical therapy alone (delayed treatment group (DTG)). No adverse events occurred. After PTA, a significant improvement in functional score compared with baseline was found (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02). The annualized relapse rate was 0.12% in the ITG group compared with 0.66% in the DTG (<italic>P</italic> = ns). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a trend for fewer T2 lesions in the ITG (<italic>P</italic> = 0.081), corresponding to a 10% decrease in the ITG compared with a 23% increase in the DTG over the first 6 months of the study. At 1 year, there was a restenosis rate of 27%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>A case series of 495 PTA procedures in 461 patients reported restenosis requiring reintervention in 11 cases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A case series of 331 patients reported that 15 repeat procedures were done for reocclusions following balloon angioplasty
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A case series of 247 procedures (229 primary procedures and 18 secondary procedures due to restenosis) in 231 patients reported that 2% of patients had symptomatic stenosis that required retreatment within 30 days
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the safety of the intervention, the study by Petrov
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] reported vein dissection in 3% of procedures (15 of 495), vein rupture (resolved by prolonged balloon dilatation and stenting) in two patients and groin hematoma in 1% of procedures (5 of 495). The same study reported cardiac arrhythmias in 1% of procedures (6 of 495). These included atrial fibrillation in four patients (two resolved spontaneously and two resolved following treatment with amiodarone) and ventricular fibrillation (successfully treated) and ventricular tachycardia (timing not reported) in one patient each. The case series of 331 patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] reported transient cardiac arrhythmia during the procedure, which was managed pharmacologically in 2 patients. Local bleeding from the groin requiring readmission to the hospital occurred in four patients (including two patients with pseudoaneurysms successfully treated with thrombin injection). One patient had minor gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization at 1 week. Surgical removal of the balloon was required in one patient, and difficulty in removing the balloon or delivery system occurred in four patients. No deaths, cerebral strokes, severe bleeding or injury to the nerves were reported.</p><p>The whole body of data shows that there is inconclusive evidence on the efficacy of balloon angioplasty for MS patients, mainly due to the observational design of the few small case series and their high risk of bias
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The uncertainty surrounding CCSVI and PTA treatment means that it should be dealt with only as part of a properly designed randomized clinical trial. An official position statement put forth by the &#x0201c;Consiglio Superiore di Sanit&#x000e0;,&#x0201d; the scientific advisory board of the Italian Ministry of Health, recommends that study investigators &#x0201c;look at the prevalence and association of CCSVI with MS,&#x0201d; and states that &#x0201c;any test to assess benefits and risk of the treatment for CCSVI should only be carried out in the context of randomized controlled trials which would avoid any commercial conflict of interest&#x0201d;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>In March 2012, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) released guidance on percutaneous venoplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency for multiple sclerosis, stating &#x0201c;Current evidence on the efficacy of percutaneous venoplasty for CCSVI for MS is inadequate in quality and quantity&#x0201d; and encouraging &#x0201c;further research on percutaneous venoplasty for CCSVI for MS, in the form of robust controlled clinical trials. Outcomes should include clinical and quality of life measures&#x0201d;

In the event that one or more functions will not be measurable at the last follow-up or at the 3-month extension follow-up, the Clinical Endpoint Commission (CEC) will assign the patient to one of the above categories, based on a critical data review blinded to the treatment arm. At least three functions must remain testable at the last follow-up; otherwise, the patient will be classified as &#x0201c;worsened.&#x0201d; The classification of the clinical end point will be carried out by the CEC, which will evaluate blindly all of the documentation of each patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Brain MRI</title><p>T2-weighted brain MRI will be used to determine the number of new brain lesions over the entire 1-year period.

A secondary objective is to estimate the proportion of patients with CCSVI diagnosed by ECD and confirmed by venography.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The study was designed by taking into account (1) the need to include all patients who are potential candidates for the therapeutic benefit of angioplasty and (2) the need for a short enrollment period and a follow-up of 12 months. Since the two diagnostic categories (RRMS and SPMS) will have different participant sizes and responsiveness, the statistical power will be different in the two groups. Estimates of the treatment effect will be more precise in the largest subgroup of RRMS. For the patients with SPMS, the study will provide preliminary information, possibly requiring an extension of recruitment of SPMS subjects. The sample size calculation and the definition of the analysis plan will be different for the two types of patients.</p><sec><title>Patients with RRMS</title><p>The sample size was estimated on the basis of the primary end point on MRI. We assume that the average total number of MRI active lesions in the control group is equal to 6 with a standard deviation of 7.6
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of 423 patients, allocated into the two treatment arms according to a randomization ratio of 1:2 (141 in the control arm and 282 in the experimental arm), will allow us to detect an absolute mean reduction of 2.1 lesions with an &#x003b1; error of 0.05 (two-sided likelihood ratio test (LRT)) and a power of 90% (power analysis based on 5,000 simulations, assuming a negative binomial distribution). Thus, we will be able to highlight a 1-year mean reduction from 6 lesions in the control arm to 3.9 in the experimental arm, which corresponds to a relative reduction of 35%. Even in the presence of a higher level of variability, with a standard deviation of nine lesions, our study would have a power of 81%, to show as statistically significant the same difference. This sample size will also be able to show a reduction of at least 0.3 in the annualized relapse rate with a power greater than 93%, (0.6 vs. 0.9 in the control arm, &#x003b1; = 0.05, two-sided LRT). The sample size of 423 patients is also adequate for the evaluation of the combined clinical end point with a 92% power or higher to detect a 15% increase in the percentage of improved patients (with a 5% to 15% figure in the control arm, &#x003b1;=0.05, two-sided test on proportions). To obtain a sample size of 423, a total of 445 patients will be recruited (148 in the control arm and 297 in the experimental arm), to take into account a 5% dropout rate, leading to nonevaluation of the primary end point at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients with SPMS</title><p>This combined clinical end point is being used, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time in this trial. Thus, the power of the study was calculated under various scenarios concerning different values of the 12 months percentage of improvement in either group. The main analysis concerns the probability of improvement, considering the worsened, the stable and the fluctuating conditions as failures. With an enrolment of 222 patients allocated according to a randomization ratio of 1:2 (74 in control arm and 148 in experimental arm), power is sufficient to detect, based on the ITT analysis, an absolute improvement ranging from 15% to 25% (&#x003b1; = 0.05, two-sided test on proportions), as shown in Table&#x02009;

The treating neurologist will provide the monitors with full access to clinical data to confirm the consistency of the information recorded on the e-CRF.

The IDMC will receive a report to evaluate the progress and safety of the study every 3 months in the first year and every 4 months from the second year on, and it will inform the SC of any recommendations for an early interruption of the study. The reporting form will be defined in collaboration with the DCC and the CRO, it will be approved by SC and it will be produced by the CRO in a blinded form. Only the IDCM and the party responsible for the quality of the data may ask for an unblinded version of the report. The IDMC will evaluate safety, also taking into account early stopping rules. The IDMC will also consider whether the proportion of negative venography in the patients with positive echo Doppler results exceeds the expected 10% proportion and will discuss with the SC the possible implications for the conduct of the study. Every 4 months the DCC will provide an evaluation of study quality. Within 1.5 years after the start of recruitment, the DCC member in charge of monitoring study quality will provide a description of preliminary results on the subset of patients with 1 year of follow-up, allowing assessment of the validity of the sample size calculations. This evaluation will be submitted in blinded fashion to the IDMC for recommendations to the SC. During the study, the IDMC, in collaboration with the SC, will assess new publications on CCSVI and MS that might be relevant to the study protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this trial, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of angioplasty of extracranial veins for patients with RRMS or SPMS as well as sonologic diagnosis of CCSVI. Such a study may be seen as controversial because the pathophysiological evidence of the cause-and-effect relationship between CCSVI and MS is lacking. Had this been a typical situation, without strong media pressure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], a phase III comparative randomized trial at this stage probably would not have been justified and we would have proceeded with a phase II study. However, a phase II trial would likely have been done without a control group and the sample sizes would have been too small, given the variability of MS course, to indicate plausible effects. It would thus add little to what we know from observational studies and leave the question of efficacy still in need of a rigorous phase III trial.</p><p>MS is widely considered an inflammatory autoimmune disease; however, this remains a hypothesis, and in reality the exact cause of MS remains unknown. The pharmacological treatments currently available for MS can modify, to a limited degree and over the long term, the natural history of the disease. However, they cause numerous side effects and are, at the moment, not easily proposable along the whole disease course, which corresponds to the rest of the patient&#x02019;s life. Currently, there are no elements for evaluating whether new drugs under review for approval or in the experimentation phase will be able to change the natural history of MS. Thus it is understandable that a nonpharmacological treatment hypothesizing an improvement in the clinical picture (that is, the intervention proposed by Zamboni), arouses great expectations for a confirmation of its scientific validity.</p><p>The proponent group took into account that the end points currently used in clinical pharmacological studies have been criticized on both clinical and methodological grounds
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. For this reason, two primary end points were identified, one defined by a set of clinical instrumental parameters related to specific functional deficits experienced by patients with MS and the other one based on MRI findings, both measured 12 months after randomization. The decision to utilize two primary end points emerged from various considerations. First, the hypothesized effect of angioplasty for MS patients with CCSVI does not allow exclusion of a clinical effect independent of the incidence of active MRI lesions. On the other hand, MRI parameters are largely utilized as indicators of activity in clinical trials for MS and are considered robust with respect to any placebo effect. The observation of a statistically significant advantage in only one of the two end points (clinical or MRI) will be sufficient to declare the study results in favor of the superiority of angioplasty over sham procedure. In the event of conflicting results (active treatment favored by one end point and not favored by the other one), the combined clinical end point will prevail. Second, the use of two primary end points in this situation offers at least two advantages: (1) If masking of both participants and investigators succeeds, the demonstration of a significant effect of the treatment on even only one of the two end points would be sufficient to reject the hypothesis that venous angioplasty is not active or efficacious in patients with MS; and (2) in the event that failure of the masking occurs, thus potentially weakening the evidence coming from the clinical end point, the evaluation of the MRI end point would maintain its validity entirely, thereby permitting the study to conserve, even if only partially, scientific and clinical usefulness.</p><p>A novel functional composite end point was defined to assess the primary clinical end point. The reason for this decision was that the EDSS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], the most widely used disability measure in clinical trials for MS, is an ambulation-centered scale that does not take into account cognitive impairment or upper-arm or bladder dysfunctions that are primary components of disability. The EDSS is an ordinal nonlinear scale whose serial upward changes of 0.5 or 1.0 points, confirmed at 3&#x02013;6 months or unconfirmed, are commonly used in clinical trials. However, changes of 0.5 points are invalid, even if confirmed at 3 or 6 months, and, similarly, 1-point changes are not significantly more likely to occur for worsening than for improvement
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. When choosing the indicators of the functional composite end point, we took into account relevant parameters, that is, the prevalence and clinical relevance of impaired functions in MS, objective and validated measures, and global feasibility of the tests in terms of tolerance, time scales, costs and necessary skills. Also, all tests are instrumental and thus semiobjective, although prone to behavioral influences. An extensive review of the literature was carried out, and the specific skills and experience in the field of functional testing of the various members of the working group were taken into account. The choice was then made after reflection and collegial discussion.</p><p>Each participating center is accredited as a MS center by the National Health Service and employs professionals with the following skills: neurology, neuroradiology, noninvasive vascular diagnosis, vascular surgical radiology, physiotherapy and psychometric testing. The staff participating in the study are accredited for the ECD diagnosis of CCSVI, the venous angioplasty intervention and the measurement of the functional end points.</p><p>This clinical trial will provide answers with regard not only to the efficacy of venous angioplasty on the inflammatory component of MS but also about subjective symptoms and functions, such as motor impairments, sphincteral and visual deficits, fatigue, anxiety, depression and attention deficits, which are meaningful clinical outcomes.
