This trial evaluated the efficiency and quality of a conventional method and a methylene blue&#x02013;assisted method in a randomized manner. The key eligibility criteria were as follows: (i) histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach; (ii) clinical stage I-III; (iii) R0 resection planned by gastrectomy with D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy. The primary endpoint was the ratio of the pathologic number of harvested LNs per time (minutes) as an efficacy measure. The secondary endpoint was the number of harvested LNs, as a quality measure. Between August 2012 and December 2012, 60 patients were assigned to undergo treatment using the conventional method (n=29) and the methylene blue dye method (n=31). The baseline demographics were mostly well balanced between the 2 groups. The number of harvested LNs (mean&#x000b1;SD) was 33.6&#x000b1;11.9 in the conventional arm and 43.4&#x000b1;13.9 in the methylene blue arm (<italic>P</italic>=0.005). The ratio of the number of the harvested LNs per time was 1.12&#x000b1;0.46 LNs/min in the conventional arm and 1.49&#x000b1;0.59 LNs/min in the methylene blue arm (<italic>P</italic>=0.010). In the subgroup analyses, the quality and efficacy were both superior for the methylene blue dye method compared with the conventional method. The methylene blue technique is recommended for harvesting LNs during gastric cancer surgery on the basis of both the quality and efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words:</title><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>methylene blue</kwd><kwd>lymph node dissection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death, after lung cancer.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> D2 gastrectomy is the standard treatment for localized gastric cancer.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> After surgery, the progression of the tumor is determined by the depth of tumor invasion and the presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis.

The LN sampling from the specimens can be affected by the physician&#x02019;s experience and persistence, the extent of dissection, type of gastrectomy, and the method used to harvest the LNs. Surgeons harvest LNs from fresh specimens immediately after surgery in Japan, whereas the pathologists generally harvest the nodes from specimens fixed with formalin after surgery in other countries. Although surgeons may be enthusiastic about harvesting LNs, it is often difficult to do after performing an extensive surgery. In contrast, nodal sampling may be difficult for pathologists, who are not familiar with the surgical anatomy. Moreover, after tissues are fixed with formalin, it is often difficult to separate and identify the LNs, which makes nodal sampling time-consuming work for most pathologists.</p><p>The methylene blue&#x02013;assisted technique is another approach used for harvesting LNs.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In this approach, the specimens are fixed with formalin-containing methylene blue after surgery. The physicians can easily pick up blue LNs, regardless of the their level of knowledge or skill. However, only a few Japanese surgeons have reported efficacy of this method in single-arm studies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It therefore remains unclear whether the methylene blue&#x02013;assisted technique is superior to the conventional technique using fresh samples from gastric cancer patients.</p><p>We hypothesized that harvesting LNs by the methylene blue&#x02013;assisted technique would be more efficient and provide better quality LN than the conventional technique. More accurate staging would lead to appropriate postoperative treatment, which could affect the patient&#x02019;s survival. To confirm our hypothesis, we conducted a single-center, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficiency and quality of harvesting LNs between the conventional technique and the methylene blue technique.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach; (ii) clinical stage I, II, or III disease, as determined by the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma, third English edition<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>; and (iii) R0 resection achieved by gastrectomy with D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy, according to the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines 2010 (ver. 3).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> We excluded the patients who received preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Surgical Procedure</title><p>All patients underwent distal or total gastrectomy with nodal dissection for gastric cancer.

Then, the patients were randomized and assigned to the conventional method or the methylene blue&#x02013;assisted method by a centralized dynamic method using the following factors: lymphadenectomy (D1+/D2), type of gastrectomy (subtotal/total), and surgical experience (&#x0003c;15/15+ y).</p><p>During surgery, the stomach and the perigastric tissues containing the LNs, fat, and vessels were removed in 1 block (by so called &#x0201c;en-bloc dissection&#x0201d;). Then, the perigastric tissues were separated from the stomach and divided into (1) the area that contained the LNs located along the proper hepatic artery, common hepatic artery, celiac artery, and splenic artery, (2) the area that had been attached to the lesser curvature and contained the LNs along the right and left gastric arteries, and (3) the area that had been attached to the greater curvature and contained LNs along the right and left gastroepiploic arteries.</p><p>In the conventional arm, the LNs were harvested from each area immediately after surgery. First, all palpable LNs were removed from each area. Usually, most LNs could be harvested from the area along the major branched arteries by this method because of the limited fat tissues in this area, whereas those in the lesser and greater curvatures were buried in fatty tissues. Thereafter, the remaining tissues were sliced and stretched to detect visible LNs. After that, the resected stomach and all harvested LNs were fixed with 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 hours. In the methylene blue arm, each separated tissue that contained LNs was fixed with 10% buffered formalin with methylene blue for 2 nights. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a photograph of a representative tissue sample containing LNs in the area that had been attached to the greater curvature. The LNs are stained with methylene blue dye. After that, the LNs stained with the blue dye were harvested from each area.

The secondary endpoint was the number of harvested LNs as a quality measure. We expected that there would be a 25% reduction in the ratio of harvested LNs/time (in minutes) for this test treatment, considering the balance between the cost and benefit. On the basis of the retrospective data at our institution and described in previous reports, we estimated that the ratio of the number of harvested LNs per time (minutes) would be 40/30 minutes in the conventional arm. To achieve 25% risk reduction, a ratio of 40/22.5 minutes in the methylene blue arm was expected. On the basis of this assumption, a sample size of 26 per arm (52 total patients) was needed to ensure a statistical power of 80% at a 2-sided &#x003b1; of 5%. Considering the likelihood of enrolling ineligible patients, the number of patients to be accrued was set at 60 in total. The primary endpoint of the study was analyzed on an intent-to-treat principle, and the data were compared using <italic>t</italic> tests. The secondary endpoints, the number of harvest LNs and the time required to harvest the LNs, were similarly analyzed using <italic>t</italic> tests. A subgroup analysis was also performed to explore the effects of the type of gastrectomy, type of lymphadenectomy, sex, and body mass index (BMI) on the endpoints.

Moreover, the similar efficacy and quality of the methylene blue&#x02013;assisted technique were observed regardless of the patient&#x02019;s sex, BMI, type of gastrectomy, and type of lymphadenectomy. Therefore, the methylene blue technique is recommended for harvesting LNs from the viewpoints of both quality and efficacy during gastric cancer surgery.</p><p>In this study, the primary endpoint was the ratio of the number of harvested LNs per time (in minutes). Theoretically, each patient would have a similar number of LNs. If physicians spend an unlimited amount of time harvesting LNs, they might accurately collect all LNs, even those buried in the specimens. Although harvesting LNs after gastrectomy is essential for accurate staging of gastric cancer, most physicians consider that harvesting LNs is time-consuming and relatively undesirable work, because their specialty is surgery or pathology. All physicians would like to harvest as many LNs as possible in a limited period of time. Considering these factors, the harvesting method must be evaluated for efficacy. Therefore, we set the number of harvested LNs per time (in minutes) as the primary endpoint in this study.</p><p>On the basis of the retrospective data at our institution and previous reports, we estimated that the ratio of the number of harvested LNs per time (in minutes) would be 40/30 minutes in the conventional arm and 40/22.5 minutes in the methylene blue arm. We hypothesized that an equal number of LNs could be harvested in a shorter time using the methylene blue method than the conventional method. However, whereas the number of harvested LNs was significantly higher in the methylene blue arm than in the conventional arm, the time for harvesting the LNs was almost equal between the 2 arms. This could be explained by the threshold and accuracy of detecting LNs. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, not only large LNs but also very small LNs, which would not be picked up by the conventional method, were stained with methylene blue, which allowed very small LNs to be harvested only in the methylene blue arm. The time required to harvest the LNs would be longer because of the harvesting of such small LNs in the methylene blue arm. This suggests that the accuracy of detecting LNs should also be taken into consideration. In the present study, the concordance rate was significantly higher in the methylene blue arm than in the conventional arm. These results suggested that pathologic LNs could be accurately picked up by the methylene blue method, regardless of the size of the LNs.</p><p>In the present study, the number of LNs harvested was &#x0003e;16 in all patients except 1 in the conventional arm, which suggested that the final N-staging was appropriate in most patients. This indicates that the examiners were all experts who could pick up the LNs without the assistance of the blue dye in this study, which may have decreased the benefit of the methylene blue technique in the randomized study. Nevertheless, the number and the ratio were superior in the methylene blue arm than in the conventional arm, and it is expected that more superior results would be obtained if the examiners were less experienced.</p><p>Although this study showed positive results, there were some limitations associated with this study. First, all surgeons had previous experience with harvesting LNs, and all had harvested LNs from &#x0003e;50 specimens. All surgeons already had sufficient skills and knowledge for harvesting LNs using the conventional method. Moreover, our hospital is a high-volume center, in which &#x0003e;200 gastric cancer surgeries are performed every year. It is therefore unclear whether our results can be generalized to less experienced surgeons in low-volume hospitals. Second, this was a single-center study. Our results must be validated in other hospitals or in the multicenter study. Third, we excluded the patients who received preoperative chemotherapy. On the basis of the results of the MAGIC trial, perioperative chemotherapy is now the standard treatment for gastric cancer in Europe.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, it is well known that preoperative chemo-radiotherapy in patients with rectal and breast cancer is associated with a reduced number of LNs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It should therefore be clarified whether the methylene blue technique is superior to the conventional method in terms of the efficacy and quality in cancers for which preoperative treatment is frequently selected.</p><p>In conclusion, the methylene blue&#x02013;assisted technique is recommended for harvesting LNs in gastric cancer surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors express their sincere gratitude to Mrs Rika Takahashi for her excellent data management in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>T.A. and T.Y. contributed equally.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflicts of Interest and Source of Funding: Supported, in part, by the Non-Governmental Organizations Kanagawa Standard Anti-cancer Therapy Support System.
