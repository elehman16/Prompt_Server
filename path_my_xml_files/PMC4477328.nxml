Although the use of such lifelike models is beneficial, well-powered, randomized studies supporting this statement are scarce. Two spinal fracture simulation models were generated by 3Dp. Altogether, 120 medical students (54.2% females) were randomized into three teaching module groups [two-dimensional computed tomography images (CT), 3D, or 3Dp] and asked to answer 10 key anatomical and 4 evaluative questions. Students in the 3Dp or 3D group performed significantly better than those in the CT group, although males in the 3D group scored higher than females. Students in the 3Dp group were the first to answer all questions, and there were no sex-related differences. Pleasure, assistance, effect, and confidence were more predominant in students in the 3Dp group than in those in the 3D and CT groups. This randomized study revealed that the 3Dp model markedly improved the identification of complex spinal fracture anatomy by medical students and was equally appreciated and comprehended by both sexes. Therefore, the lifelike fracture model made by 3Dp technology should be used as a means of premedical education.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Learning and identification of anatomy are a fundamental component for neurosurgery treatments.

CT scans were taken in the horizontal plane using a slice width of 0.5&#x02009;mm, a helical pitch of 2.5, and an image production interval of 0.1&#x02009;mm. After scanning, data were exported to a DICOM file. Next, MIMICS 15.0 (Materialise, Belgium) was used for reconstructing a 3D image, which was converted to a **. STL (STereo Lithography) file from the DICOM file. Finally, the **. STL file was sent to the 3D printer (XYZ printing, China) based on fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology, whereas the sintered layers were accumulated using a helical pitch of 0.1&#x02009;mm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. After assessment by two senior professors, no differences were found compared with the original fracture; therefore, the model was used in the teaching process as the next step.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Medical education</title><p>All students completed their basic training by learning anatomy not only through textbooks and dissecting corpses but also through computer simulations in anatomy during their first or second year of enrollment in Binzhou Medical University.

Further, a short technical description of the teaching module (TM) was provided for helping the students in successfully completing the teaching process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Students were randomized into three groups using a computer program. The TM of the first group (CT group) was based on the CT images of the two patients in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The TM of the second group (3D group) was based on the 3D images reconstructed from the DICOM file, original data file from the two patients, each angle freely adjustable in the computer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2 Video</xref>).

In recent years, it has also been applied to medicine. There are five types of prototyping methods: those employing a stereolithography apparatus, selective laser sintering, and FDM and laminated object manufacturing and inkjet printing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. FDM is popular in hospitals and families in China because the involved printing process is cost-effective and has a high accuracy. In this randomized study, two authentic fracture models were reconstructed by this technology, reflecting the situation of spinal fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, 120 medical students (54.2% females) participated, and they were randomized into the CT, 3D, and 3Dp groups, with no significant sex- and age-related differences. Each student was asked to answer 10 key anatomical questions and 4 evaluative questions. Students in the 3Dp and 3D groups performed significantly better than those in the CT group, although males in the 3D, not 3Dp, group scored higher than females. Meanwhile, students in the 3Dp group were the first to answer all questions, and no sex-related differences were found.

We found that males have an unfair advantage in understanding 3D image reconstructions compared with females. However, this sex-related difference was not present in the 3Dp group because teaching was based on real models.</p><p>3Dp is a &#x0201c;clone technology&#x0201d; that enables the generation of realistic models convenient for students to observe from any angle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We also observed that using 3Dp objects improves the learning efficiency of medical students, helps them acquire expertise, and increases their interest and enthusiasm, which are important components in learning.</p><p>The application of 3Dp technology in medical education is rapidly developing. However, randomized controlled studies of medical education using 3D printed models remain scarce. Preece <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> developed and evaluated the use of a model demonstrating the complex spatial relationships of the equine foot, suggesting that physical models have a significant advantage over alternative learning resources in enhancing visuospatial and 3D understanding of complex anatomical architecture and that 3D computer models have significant limitations with regard to 3D learning. Moreover, many case studies regarding the benefits of 3Dp technology in teaching and training processes have been reported. Mashiko <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> developed a method for fabricating a 3D hollow and elastic aneurysm model for surgical simulation and training. They also presented a simulated 3D model of a human temporal bone made by the selective laser sintering method, based on detailed CT data, and it was found useful for understanding the 3D aneurysm structure. Cardiovascular anomalies have been presented in a study by Vranicar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, where 3D models of blood vessels were analyzed for a better preoperative planning.</p><p>Despite our enthusiasm for this TM, our study has some limitations. First, there is a potential selection bias because the sample size was relatively small. Second, the master knowledge of each student may not have been entirely homogenous, which could have affected the stabilization, validation, and generalization of the final results. Third, the printing model and image data did not include analysis of muscles and neurovascular tissue surrounding the fracture, without which the model cannot completely represent a fracture condition. Finally, several technical problems, such as the lengthy printing time, needs to be resolved, which currently limits the applicability of the model.</p><p>Future advances in implementing 3Dp in medical education could include the development of printing devices that allow rapid onsite printing in the teaching hospital and development of 3Dp models that mimic the haptic characteristics of specific tissue (i.e., nerves, arteries, muscles).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This randomized study revealed that the 3Dp model markedly improved the identification of complex spinal fracture anatomy by medical students and was equally appreciated and comprehended by both sexes.
