However, not many people with COPD receive support that promotes the use of such strategies and therefore new methods to facilitate and promote the use of self-management strategies are highly warranted. This pilot trial aims to evaluate the feasibility of the study design and study procedures considering effectiveness of the novel intervention, <italic>the COPD-web.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The overall design is a pragmatic controlled pilot trial with preassessments and postassessments and a parallel process evaluation. Patients with the diagnosis of COPD will be eligible for the study. The intervention group will be recruited when visiting one of the six participating primary care units in Sweden. The control group will be identified from the unit's computerised registers. The intervention, the COPD-web, is an interactive web page with two sections; one directed at people with COPD and one at healthcare professionals. The sections aim to support patients&#x02019; self-management skills&#x02014;and to facilitate the provision of support for self-management strategies, respectively. Effectiveness with regard to patients&#x02019; symptoms, HRQoL, knowledge of and readiness for COPD-related self-management, health literacy, self-efficacy for physical activity and time spent in physical activity and time being sedentary, and further, healthcare professionals&#x02019; knowledge of and readiness to support COPD-related self-management strategies will be assessed using questionnaires at 3 and 12 months. The process evaluation will include observations and interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval has been obtained.

In the European Union, the yearly cost of COPD is estimated to be &#x020ac;38.6&#x02009;billion, while direct and indirect cost of COPD in the USA is estimated to be over &#x020ac;50&#x02009;billion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>The symptom burden of the disease, the impaired functional performance and the decreased quality of life in patients with COPD is a consequence of the underlying condition, and depends on the patient's adaptation to the illness and their ability to manage their disease.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Self-management strategies, including strategies to promote self-efficacy through increasing the patients&#x02019; knowledge and skills and their confidence in successfully managing their disease, is therefore now an important part of COPD management.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The use of such strategies have shown to reduce healthcare use, increase quality of life, improve recovery time after acute exacerbations and reduce overall health-related costs.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5&#x02013;7</xref> Self-management strategies have also shown to increase adherence to medication, increase physical activity and physical performance, increase use of breathing regulation techniques and energy-saving strategies during activities of daily living as well as to reduce the impact of COPD in daily life and breathlessness for individuals with COPD.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Even though the education and promotion of self-management strategies for patients with COPD could be performed independently using a case manager, it is often promoted through pulmonary rehabilitation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Despite the proven effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation including self-management interventions for patients with COPD, only a limited proportion of patients with COPD gain access to such services.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 10</xref> Lack of knowledge and insight in their diagnosis, transportation challenges and changing in health status have been found to be individual barriers for participating in pulmonary rehabilitation programmes, thus reducing access to self-management strategies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> In Sweden, inadequate staffing as well as insufficient COPD-specific knowledge among healthcare professionals have also been reported.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Overcoming these barriers and finding new and alternative strategies to facilitate the provision of self-management strategies to patients with COPD is therefore highly warranted. eHealth solutions are a promising way of delivering health services and have previously been shown to have the ability to increase the level of physical activity<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> as well as reduce the use of healthcare services in COPD.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Whether or not an eHealth solution could be used to promote self-management strategies for patients with COPD remains unclear. To address this question, our research group has developed the COPD-web, which is an internet-based tool aimed at increasing access to self-management strategies for patients with COPD and to support and facilitate for healthcare professionals in promoting such self-management strategies. In Sweden, the vast majority of the population has access to internet at home.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> eHealth solutions have recently been implied as a valuable option for increasing the availability of pulmonary rehabilitation including self-management.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Development of internet-based tools with potential to meet the needs of people with COPD and the healthcare&#x000a0;professionals, might therefore be a beneficial strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>Conducting a pilot trial is highly recommended as a step in the development and evaluation of complex interventions and should preferably precede a randomised controlled trial (RCT).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The aim of this pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility of the study design and study procedures thus refining the study protocol for a prospective RCT of an intervention consisting of an internet-based tool, the COPD-web. The aim is also to increase the understanding of effectiveness of the tool with regard to aspects of health, knowledge and physical activity and furthermore the functioning of the intervention considering aspects of the implementation, mechanisms of impact and the context. In order to meet the aim, the following specific research questions will be addressed:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Are the intervention and the study procedures acceptable and feasible from the perspective of patients with COPD and healthcare professionals?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the effectiveness of the COPD-web with regard to self-rated COPD-related symptoms, dyspnoea, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), knowledge of and readiness for COPD-related self-management strategies, health literacy, self-efficacy for physical activity, time spent in physical activity and physical training, time being sedentary and level of physical activity among people with COPD at 3 and 12 months?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the effectiveness of the COPD-web with regard to healthcare&#x000a0;professional's self-rated knowledge of and readiness to support COPD-related self-management strategies at 3 and 12 months and the provision of interventions to promote such strategies to patients with COPD at 6 months?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How is the COPD-web implemented and maintained in clinical practice at 12 months?

</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s1c1"><title>Trial design</title><p>The overall trial design is a pragmatic controlled pilot trial with preassessments and postassessments and a parallel process evaluation. As the COPD-web is a complex intervention that cannot easily be evaluated in a controlled trial, the process evaluation is an important complement that will be performed in order to understand how the intervention and the study procedures, such as recruitment of participants, delivery and acceptability of the intervention works in clinical practice. Thus, directed by the guidance for process evaluation suggested by the Medical Research Council (MRC),<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> we will assess aspects of the components implementation, mechanism of impacts and context in order to identify and understand core components of the COPD-web, to understand the process of delivering and receiving the interventions and to draw more&#x000a0;of a robust conclusion with regard to acceptability, feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention. The study is designed as a pragmatic trial<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> meaning that the intervention will be delivered by healthcare professionals in ordinary healthcare settings in order to maximise the applicability of the findings to other healthcare settings.

A website map of the section for people with COPD is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. The section aims at supporting self-management skills including activities such as physical activity, physical training, breathing techniques and knowledge of the exacerbation symptoms to be aware of and advice on when to contact healthcare and how to make everyday activities less strenuous. The section includes factual texts, pictures, films and interactive components, such as pages for registering physical activity (steps) and receiving automatic personalised feedback. The website content directed at healthcare professionals complies to a large extent with the contents directed at people with COPD. However, the healthcare professional section of the website aims at facilitating the provision of support for self-management strategies to people with COPD, thereby facilitating the implementation of such services. The section includes factual texts, pictures, films as well as recommended and validated evaluation and screening tools. The content on the COPD-web refers to and is aligned with the National Guidelines for COPD-care recently developed and published by the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The material on the website will be permanent, although the contents will be updated when new national guidelines for COPD are released. In addition, we will continuously add new material such as links to reportages in media where COPD is covered and research news related to COPD. When new material is added, registered users will receive an email notification about the updates. The COPD-web was developed in collaboration with people with COPD and their relatives, healthcare professionals in the primary care and external researchers within the area of COPD.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A website map of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#x000a0;(COPD)-web showing the section aimed at people with COPD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016851f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1d3b"><title>The intervention group</title><p>The COPD-web will, after informed consent, be introduced by healthcare professionals at the primary care unit according to a prespecified routine (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>).<boxed-text id="B1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Routine for introduction of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#x000a0;(COPD)-web by the healthcare professionals</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Registration and creation&#x000a0;of an account in order for the patient to use the COPD-web</p></list-item><list-item><p>Introducing the website structure, the content in the main menus and functions of the website, for example, how to enlarge or reduce the text, listen to the text or bookmark information of special interest</p></list-item><list-item><p>Introducing the section on &#x02018;physical activity and exercise training&#x02019; to the patient.

Currently, despite its proven effectiveness, access to self-management interventions is limited<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 10</xref> and alternative ways of promoting self-management for patients with COPD are warranted. Even though eHealth interventions have been used to increase access to pulmonary rehabilitation, it remains unclear whether an eHealth tool could be used to increase access and provision of self-management strategies in this population. The proposed trial will provide new knowledge to this research area by investigating the use of an internet-based tool, the COPD-web, as a tool for increasing access to self-management strategies for patients with COPD and to support and facilitate for healthcare professionals in promoting self-management strategies to patients with COPD. The results from the study will determine its effect on clinically relevant outcomes such as symptoms, dyspnoea, quality of life as well as physical activity among patients with COPD. The latter is of utmost importance, as the level of physical activity is one of the strongest predictor of mortality in this group of patients.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The results from the study will also provide novel information on the effects on self-efficacy to perform physical activity, health literacy as well as knowledge of and readiness for use of self-management strategies.</p><p>As the COPD-web is a complex intervention that cannot easily be evaluated in a controlled trial, our intention to use a process evaluation will provide novel information and understanding on how the COPD-web works in clinical practice. The process evaluation will assess components of implementation, mechanism of impacts and context in order to identify and understand core components of the COPD-web. This will increase knowledge on how the process of delivering and receiving the intervention can be understood. It will also help us draw a more robust conclusion with regard to if the COPD-web is accepted by patients and healthcare professionals and about the intervention's effectiveness. As the study is designed as a pragmatic trial,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the intervention will be delivered by healthcare professionals in ordinary healthcare settings in order to maximise the clinical applicability of the findings to other healthcare settings. The fact that the intervention is delivered by healthcare&#x000a0;professionals also include challenges with regard to the fidelity to the delivery of the intervention. However, the observations, which form a part of the process evaluation, will provide valuable information on the implementation of the intervention and on the need of enhanced training of the healthcare professionals in the future study. The pragmatic approach, with a focus on how the intervention works when used in clinical practice also means that the inclusion criterion are wide. In line with this approach,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> no selection beyond diagnosed COPD will be made thus increasing the clinical applicability of the findings in healthcare. A limitation in the design of the pilot trial is the non-randomised control group.</p><p>In conclusion, the pragmatic pilot trial will provide clinically relevant information on the acceptability, feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention and study procedures from the perspective of patients with COPD and healthcare professionals. The findings will inform a future large-scale study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e172" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016851.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e173" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016851.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AN has made direct and substantial contribution to this work by contributing to the conception and design of the study, designing and writing of the protocol and approving the final version of the protocol.
