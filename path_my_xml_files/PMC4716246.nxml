Various reasons have been cited including parental anxiety and the acute nature of the infection in children. However, in comparison to hospital admission, children treated at home do better psychologically and physically, have fewer investigations, are at decreased risk of hospital-acquired infections, and have subsequent decreased use of healthcare resources.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It is also less expensive (time off work and transport costs) and disruptive for families.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Some children with moderate/severe cellulitis may be safely treated at home, but criteria for this are unclear.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There are no randomised trials comparing home versus hospital treatment in children for cellulitis. In a recent study at our institution of children presenting with cellulitis to the emergency department (ED), 57% were discharged on oral antibiotics and 43% were treated with intravenous antibiotics due to extensive, rapidly spreading or complicated cellulitis or worsening features despite oral antibiotics. Forty-five per cent of those with uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis had been started on oral therapy and cellulitis had progressed despite this.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Of those discharged on oral antibiotics, 10% re-presented with worsening cellulitis, suggesting there is a culture of trying oral antibiotics first and not starting intravenous antibiotics unnecessarily (unpublished data).</p><p>When intravenous treatment is required for cellulitis, flucloxacillin or cephazolin are the usual choices because they are effective against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and group A streptococci<italic>,</italic> the main pathogens causing cellulitis.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, they are not suitable for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) due to their frequent dosing. The majority of paediatric OPAT services are only able to deliver once daily interventions. Ceftriaxone has antistaphylococcal activity and can be administered once daily.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> There are only a few studies in children in which ceftriaxone has been used to treat cellulitis either in hospital or OPAT, but none have compared outcomes to children treated with other recommended antibiotics.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> There are no studies in children with cellulitis who require intravenous treatment comparing administration at home and in hospital. A study of children with moderate/severe cellulitis who were treated with ceftriaxone at a day treatment centre had an 80% success rate, but no comparison was made with children treated in hospital.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Other studies that have included ceftriaxone for the treatment of cellulitis in children have had cure rates of 91&#x02013;96%, but have had small numbers, no comparison group and/or unclear methodology.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A small study in adults compared ceftriaxone with flucloxacillin, and while ceftriaxone resulted in a higher success rate than flucloxacillin (96% vs 70%), this was not statistically significant.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The differential effect of ceftriaxone and flucloxacillin on the microbiota of children has also never previously been described.</p><p>Increasingly, hospitals are developing programmes where patients who have traditionally been treated on a hospital ward are treated at home under the care of hospital doctors and nurses in Hospital-in-the-Home (HITH) programmes. While attractive in terms of resource use, it is unclear to what extent HITH care is efficacious and safe. The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) Melbourne has the largest paediatric HITH programme in Australia. As an alternative to admission for intravenous flucloxacillin, RCH HITH developed a direct-from-the ED pathway for cellulitis, using once daily ceftriaxone and medical review at home. Since September 2012, more than 70 children at RCH with moderate/severe cellulitis have been treated successfully at home, with outcomes similar to children treated in hospital, although there may be unappreciated differences in selection criteria.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>We therefore plan to randomly assign patients with cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics to either be treated at home (intravenous ceftriaxone) or to the hospital ward (intravenous flucloxacillin). The study aims to compare (1) the rate of treatment failure of home treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone versus hospital treatment with intravenous flucloxacillin; (2) the safety of treatment at home versus treatment in hospital; and (3) the effect of exposure to short course ceftriaxone versus flucloxacillin on nasal and gut micro-organism resistance patterns and the clinical implications of this. The main outcome is treatment failure; defined as a change in treatment due to lack of clinical improvement or the occurrence of adverse events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>This is a single-centre, open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT).

The patient or parents of patients meeting inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.

Data collection includes: age, sex, site of cellulitis, size of area affected, prior antibiotics, underlying comorbidity not affecting inclusion, systemic symptoms and signs. In addition, consent will be requested for nasal swab samples and stool samples. Randomisation will be performed after consent is obtained by a study investigator or the ED clinician. Patients who are randomised to HITH will be prescribed intravenous ceftriaxone (50&#x02005;mg/kg once daily) and those randomised to the ward will be prescribed intravenous flucloxacillin (50&#x02005;mg/kg 6 hourly). A blood culture, nasal swab and where relevant a skin swab (only in the presence of discharge from the site of cellulitis) will be collected at presentation.

ED, emergency department; HITH, Hospital-in-the-Home; IV, intravenous.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015009606f01"/></fig><p>Parents will be asked to take two photos of the cellulitis area using their own camera/phone (if available) after the affected area is demarcated with indelible ink with a tape measure placed alongside the area affected. If parents do not have a camera/phone, permission will be sought from the parent to use a hospital camera to photograph the lesion. This will aid review the following day. The first dose of antibiotics will be administered in ED before the child goes either to the ward or home. After randomisation, treatment decisions for the patient will be made by the appropriate treating physician, as per usual practice: if on the ward the general paediatrician on call, and if at home the HITH paediatrician. In hospital ward and HITH services, the management decisions for cellulitis are usually made by senior trainees/registrars in paediatrics. Sometimes a consultant will be called on to make a decision; this is more likely to occur on the ward than in HITH. Patients will be switched to oral therapy when there is clinical improvement of the cellulitis as judged by the treating clinician. Oral antibiotics will be cephalexin 25&#x02005;mg/kg 6 hourly (as per RCH guidelines), or the most appropriate antibiotic based on microbiology results. Although patients are usually not followed up any further in hospital, in this study, all participants will be followed up as per the study schedule (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009606TB1">table 1</xref>). If parents decline the first follow-up visit at clinic, a review will be conducted by telephone and the parents will be requested to email photos of the area previously affected with cellulitis or give a verbal report (to ensure clinical resolution).

For a non-inferiority study design with a 15% difference, 89 patients are needed in each treatment arm (based on 80% power). Allowing for 5% dropout rate, a total of 188 are therefore required (94 in each treatment arm). Based on our previous data, we will be able to recruit this number over a 2-year period if this study remains within RCH.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, once this study starts at RCH, depending on recruitment, we may expand this study to other centres, which would shorten the length of time to complete the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The randomisation schedule will be provided by the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI). The randomisation will be in randomly permuted blocks of variable length, stratified by age (6&#x02005;months to less than 9&#x02005;years and 9&#x02005;years to 18&#x02005;years) and by the presence of periorbital cellulitis. Randomisation will be enabled through the REDCap (Research electronic Data Capture, REDCap Software&#x02014;V.6.6.2&#x02014;copyright 2015 Vanderbilt University) web-based application housed at MCRI.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised controlled trials and the primary analysis will be primarily by intention to treat. We will also conduct a per protocol analysis, including all randomised participants where outcome data are available. For the primary outcome Pearson's &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test will be used to compare the proportion of participants who fail treatment within 48&#x02005;h from the first dose. Non-inferiority will determined by calculating difference in treatment failure (risk difference and 95% two-sided CI between the failure rates in the home and hospital groups. For the home arm to be non-inferior to treatment in the hospital, the upper limit of the 95% CI must be less than 15% (as we have prespecified this as the non-inferiority margin). As a secondary analysis on the primary outcome a logistic regression model will be used to investigate whether inclusion of the stratification factor (age at randomisation) as predictor modifies the estimated effect (and 95%CI) of treatment group on the primary outcome.</p><p>Secondary continuous outcomes will be compared between the two groups using unadjusted linear regression while binary outcomes will be compared using unadjusted logistic regression. Furthermore, as explorative analyses, regression models (or logistic models according to the nature of the outcome) will also be fitted to the primary and secondary outcomes adjusting for age (as used in the randomisation), presence of fever at baseline and any other baseline and demographic variables where an imbalance is found. The appropriate survival analysis models will be used to compare time to event outcomes between the treatment groups. The statistician performing data analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes will be blinded to the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Ethical issues and dissemination</title><p>Prior to starting of the study and on an on-going basis, ED clinicians have had education sessions to inform them about the study. The appropriate information sheet will be given to the parent and/or child, the study explained and written consent requested. Where parents do not give consent, the ED clinician will make the decision about treatment location. Photos will be identified only by the subject unique identifier assigned for the study and will be stored in a password-protected database. Data will be entered into a password-protected database enabled through the REDCap (Research electronic Data Capture, REDCap Software&#x02014;V.6.6.2&#x02014;copyright 2015 Vanderbilt University) web-based application housed at MCRI. The case report forms will be kept in a locked filing cabinet, accessible only by the researchers. Consent to collect information will be sought from participants who deviate from the protocol. All data will be retained until 7&#x02005;years after last contact with patients or once all patients involved in the study have reached 25&#x02005;years of age (whichever is longer) as per the ethics requirements for our institution.</p><p>We aim to disseminate the findings through international peer-reviewed journals and international conferences either as an oral or a poster presentation.</p><p>At the end of the study a summary of the results will also be posted to the participants. Results will be reported as an analysis of group data rather than individual data and will contain only de-identified information.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Risk management, adverse events and patient safety</title><p>There are no foreseeable additional risks to patients or their families by participating in this study. HITH has been shown to be a safe programme under which children can be treated at home for many conditions, and there will be daily medical review of all patients. Families on the HITH programme have direct access via telephone to an experienced nurse 24&#x02005;h a day and this nurse is supported by a medical team. Potential adverse events in this study would be an allergic reaction to either of the antibiotics used, and these will be reported to the study's independent data safety monitoring board. Serious adverse events such as overwhelming sepsis or death are not expected in this study as cellulitis in children is a condition not associated with such morbidity and mortality. None of the patients in our prospective study of home treatment of cellulitis developed sepsis or any other serious adverse event.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Independent safety and data monitoring committee</title><p>An Independent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee (ISDMC) have been established. The ISDMC consists of two independent clinicians and a biostatistician whom, collectively, have experience in the management of paediatric patients with cellulitis and in the conduct and monitoring of randomised controlled trials. The ISDMC will function independently of all other individuals and bodies associated with the conduct of the study. The ISDMC will review all data by treatment arm every 6 to 10&#x02005;months. The first planned ISDMC review is in October 2015.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Time plan</title><p>We have thus far recruited 52 of the planned 188 patients. We plan to complete recruitment by the end of 2016.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study will be the first RCT to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of home intravenous antibiotics for children directly from ED. If treatment at home is found to be non-inferior, the benefits for children/families and cost-effectiveness for healthcare constitutions will lead to this pathway (direct-from-the ED to home) becoming standard care.</p><p>Our study design has some unavoidable limitations. Although the main aim is to compare standard care in hospital with the novel intervention of home treatment, the antibiotics in the two arms are also necessarily different. Intravenous flucloxacillin or cephazolin (usual standard care) require dosing 3&#x02013;4 times a day in children, which is not feasible for home treatment. The alternative of administering these via a continuous infusion would require a form of central line access, which in children may require sedation or anaesthesia, with associated increased risks and time in hospital. The only intravenous antibiotic viable for home use in this acute direct-from-ED context is therefore once daily ceftriaxone, and from our previous study we do not anticipate differences in antibiotic efficacy.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Although longer term use of ceftriaxone has been associated with increased acquisition of resistant organisms in adults, this has not been shown in healthy children or for very short courses as anticipated in this study. To address the potential issues of resistance development this study is specifically designed to detect any changes in the nasal and gut micro-organisms and any clinically relevant consequences of such changes. Another limitation of this study is that this is a single site, single city study. Antibiotic resistance is geographically influenced, and the availability/skills of home-based care programmes for children may not be available to many centres. These factors may limit applicability to other areas.</p><p>This study will likely have a high impact on clinical practice not only in our own clinical institution but also on a wider global scale. The successful use of home antibiotics is the tip of the iceberg, as it can be expanded to include many common medical conditions ensuring children can go home directly to be treated under the HITH programme and avoid hospitalisation. We anticipate that this would ultimately impact on health policy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank participating families, emergency department staff and HITH staff.
