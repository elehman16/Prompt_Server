Patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group (32 men and 4 women, median age: 61 years, range: 46&#x02013;73 years) received concurrent chemoradiotherapy and subsequent surgery.

Patient with Siewert II and III adenocarcinomas are less likely to have upper and middle mediastinal lymph node metastasis making surgery using the transabdominal approach by the diaphragmatic hiatus feasible. In neoadjuvant therapy, preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy efficacy in treating Siewert II and III gastric cancers has been previously confirmed in clinical trials conducted in Western countries. However, the necessity for neoadjuvant therapy has not been confirmed.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction were not separated from those with esophageal, or gastric, cancer in most of these studies. The authors were able to identify on a few studies that seem to have been conducted investigating adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction. This lack of clinical data might result in inappropriate use of combined chemotherapy drugs or radiotherapy dose.</p><p>The MAGIC trial, which compared the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery alone, resulted in encouraging findings regarding the utility of neoadjuvant therapy.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> That study showed a 5-year survival rate for patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased by 13% compared with a surgery group (36% versus 23%). Patients with type II and III adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction accounted for only 11.5% (58/503) of the total subjects studied, but the findings relating to using neoadjuvant therapy to treat esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas were encouraging.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> As a result, focal radiotherapy was added to systemic chemotherapy with the goal of improving therapeutic efficacy. An RR of 55.6%, total tumor control rate of 100% and clinical stage reduction rate of 61.1% suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy was superior to surgery alone.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These findings were consistent with those of De Paoli et al as an interim analysis of a phase II multicenter study presented at a European Society for Medical Oncology conference.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The timely implementation of radical resection of the cancer is a key step toward a favorable therapeutic result. Radiotherapy may lessen the focal inflammatory edema and fibrous adhesion of the tumor after chemotherapy. Surgery was performed 6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy.</p><p>Among the surgical modalities available for resecting esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma, proximal subtotal gastrectomy seems to have achieved the best radical resection of the cancer. Preoperative evaluation usually shows that the cancer to be localized at the esophagogastric junction. The choice of surgical modality should be made according to intraoperative exploration findings.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> For example, if there is extensive lymph node enlargement at the lesser curvature of the stomach and the lower borderline of the cancer is blurred, active total gastrectomy is the preferred method for achieving radical resection of the tumor. This is also an important factor in the favorable R0 resection rate for patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy. All the patients in this study that received concurrent chemoradiotherapy also underwent surgical intervention and achieved an R0 resection. No other previous studies have found such results.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, the pathological complete remission rate in this study was 16.7% and is consistent with previously reported results that ranged from 15% to 30%.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Some investigators have questioned the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy preceding surgery of adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction and have also expressed concerns about the toxic effects of such therapy. In the CROSS study,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> 1 patient receiving chemotherapy, with carboplatin plus paclitaxel and concurrent radiotherapy at 41.4 Gy, developed grade 4 hematologic toxicity and neutropenic fever.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> One other patient died of possible esophageal perforation, heavy bleeding or thrombocytopenia after chemoradiotherapy and before surgery. A Duke University Medical Center study examined the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy with fluorouracil in combination with platinum or taxane, and concurrent radiotherapy at 45 Gy, in the treatment of 48 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In that study, therapy was discontinued in 6 patients, 2 patients failed to complete the concurrent chemoradiotherapy and 1 patient developed gastric perforation and febrile neutropenia. In this study, 6 patients developed grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Two had leukopenia and 4 had thrombocytopenia. Fever and heavy bleeding were not observed. Chemoradiotherapy-related death was absent. During the perioperative period for patients in this study, 1 patient developed a lymphatic fistula that may have been attributable to an accidental lymphatic injury during the surgery. A single patient developed moderate plural effusion and ascites that might be attributable to abnormal liver function before surgery and also to postoperative stress. These symptoms were resolved after active therapy. Patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group each had an indwelling jejunal feeding tube for 1 month to assure adequate enteral nutrition, and postoperative complications were reduced. The results of this study can be compared with those of the INT-0116 study in which postsurgical adjunctive concurrent chemoradiotherapy was performed.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the INT-0116 study, 64% of patients completed the therapy. Three patients experienced chemoradiotherapy-related death. Forty-one percent developed grade 3 toxic effects and 32% had grade 4 toxic effects. This comparison suggests that preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy is relatively safe. The findings of this study suggest that the toxic effects of chemotherapy are tolerable. A XELOX regimen is administered in combination with radiotherapy at 45 Gy (25 sessions) that may contribute to the absence of highly toxic taxanes in the chemotherapeutic regimen.</p><p>It should be noted that the long-term survival of patients included in this study is unknown. On the basis of available findings, chemotherapy with the XELOX regimen administered in combination with radiotherapy at 45 Gy (25 sessions) seems to be a mildly toxic, but highly effective, therapeutic modality for patients with adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction. However, additional studies conducted with larger sample sizes and careful patient monitoring would be required to confirm these findings. The results of such studies could be used to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy in treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Yong Li, Jun Wang, Jun Zhang and Xueying Qiao are co-first authors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by Chinese Gastrointestinal Oncology Group Gastric Cancer Research Fund (20120101016).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shitara</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Muro</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>
