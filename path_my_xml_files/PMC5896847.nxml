PROMIS&#x000ae; questionnaires were administered prior to and at the end of the treatment period to assess changes in pain intensity, pain interference, physical function, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and social isolation. Questionnaires also captured patients&#x02019; overall impressions of treatments as well as self-reported changes in medication use and work function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred eleven women (71%) and 45 men (29%) with a wide range of pain complaints received a mean of 8.2 treatments during the intervention period. Measurements captured prior to and at the end of the treatment period showed significant improvements in group mean pain intensity, pain interference, physical function, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and social isolation as assessed by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures (paired <italic>t</italic> tests, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Fifty-seven percent of patients using analgesic (nonopioid) medication reported reductions in use. Thirty-two percent of patients using opioid medication reported reductions in use of opioid medication following the intervention. Seventy-four percent of employed patients reported improved capacity to work. Ninety-six percent of patients said that they would recommend acupuncture to others with chronic pain, and 91% reported qualitative improvements, including physical (31%), functional/behavioral (29%), and psycho-emotional (24%) improvements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that acupuncture treatment for chronic pain is feasible and well received by patients in the Vermont Medicaid population. Receiving care from Licensed Acupuncturists was associated with significant improvements in physical, functional, psycho-emotional, and occupational outcomes compared with before receiving acupuncture treatments.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acupuncture</kwd><kwd>chronic pain</kwd><kwd>Medicaid</kwd><kwd>opioid crisis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-2164956118769557"><funding-source id="funding1-2164956118769557"><institution-wrap><institution>Agency of Human Services - Department of Vermont Health Access</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef"/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-2164956118769557">03410-1685-17</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-2164956118769557"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, affecting between 11% and 47% of the U.S. population.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The Institute of Medicine estimates the annual cost burden of chronic pain in the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population to be between $560 billion and $635 billion.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Chronic pain is a complex biopsychosocial phenomenon that affects a person&#x02019;s psychological and emotional health, ability to work, and social function.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Chronic pain has been linked to premature death<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> as well as an increased risk of suicide.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Opioid prescriptions have grown rapidly over the past decades in an attempt to treat chronic pain.

For example, the American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline recommends acupuncture for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain (cLBP).<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that acupuncture is effective for cLBP compared to placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care, or wait list controls.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The U.S. National Institutes of Health recommends acupuncture for low back pain and for knee osteoarthritis.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The <italic>FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain</italic> suggests acupuncture among a range of available therapies as part of a multidisciplinary approach to pain management.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>Despite this guidance, one of the barriers for the utilization of acupuncture and other nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain continues to be the lack of insurance reimbursement. This barrier is especially acute for the financially disadvantaged Medicaid population, a population especially effected by the opioid crisis. Acupuncture is not covered by most of Vermont&#x02019;s insurance plans, including the state-funded Medicaid program. Addressing this disconnect between evidence and policy, the 2016 U.S. Health and Human Services National Pain Strategy noted that the structure of insurance payment and coverage policies &#x0201c;exert powerful effects on how pain is managed,&#x0201d; noting that financial incentives may lead consumers to &#x0201c;gravitate to prescription drugs over complementary or alternative treatments, creating risks for subsequent problems with opioid dependency.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Likewise, the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter signed by 37 state attorneys general to America&#x02019;s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) urging AHIP to &#x0201c;encourage your members to review their payment and coverage policies and revise them, as necessary and appropriate, to encourage healthcare providers to prioritize nonopioid pain management options over opioid prescriptions for the treatment of chronic, noncancer pain.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><sec id="sec2-2164956118769557"><title>Pragmatic Design for Policy-oriented Questions</title><p>This article reports on the outcomes of the Acupuncture for Chronic Pain in the Vermont Medicaid Population trial funded by the 2016 Vermont legislature<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> in response to the opioid crisis.</p><p>The current trial was designed to be as pragmatic as possible in order to deploy limited resources to collecting Vermont-specific data regarding how a potential acupuncture reimbursement policy might be implemented and received locally and what benefits it might confer to the Vermont Medicaid population.

Treatment strategies were based on each individual clinician&#x02019;s assessment of each patient&#x02019;s traditional acupuncture diagnosis and individual needs. Acupuncturists were allowed to perform whatever style of acupuncture they felt was appropriate for each patient during each treatment. In addition to manual acupuncture, treatments were permitted to include the full range of East Asian modalities within the providers&#x02019; scope of practice and training including electroacupuncture, infrared, moxibustion, manual therapy, cupping, gua sha, topical herbal liniments, and Chinese herbal medicines.

Sixty patients (38%) received the maximum of 12 allowable treatments. The most common reasons cited by patients who did not receive any treatments were transportation issues, disorganization, and fear of acupuncture. The Medicaid population is financially disadvantaged and often dependent on others for transportation. Travel to covered medical visits is usually provided for the Medicaid population when the patient has no transportation available. However, due to coverage rules, during this study, Medicaid was unable to cover transportation costs. This likely contributed to some subjects withdrawing from the study. No significant differences were detected in the baseline outcome scores between patients who received or did not receive treatments.

Utilizing a pragmatic design, we were able to treat patients with a wide range of chronic pain conditions and multiple comorbidities. These complex patients are commonly seen in doctors&#x02019; offices but often screened out of efficacy trials in order to increase internal validity. Likewise, we provided care using the existing workforce of Licensed Acupuncturists, allowing them to treat patients using their own judgment in their own office settings, whereas less pragmatic trials often utilize uniform treatment protocols and are delivered by a small group of providers in a centralized setting. A strength of this study, therefore, is the more direct transferability of our findings to real-world people and settings. Our results represent a reasonable representation of what would likely occur if acupuncture services were widely accessible to Vermont patients receiving Medicaid benefits.</p><p>Some data suggest that acupuncture is acceptable to Medicaid users;<sup><xref rid="bibr46-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> however, data regarding the use of acupuncture for this specific population are relatively scant. It is notable that our results demonstrate a high engagement with treatment from these patients: 72% of our patients received 6 treatments or more. This suggests that despite challenges related to schedules, transportation, and unfamiliarity with the therapy, these patients were motivated to incorporate acupuncture into their lives in a committed manner.</p><p>We achieved our targeted patient recruitment in less than 4 months. This indicates a significant demand for acupuncture from both patients and physicians when acupuncture is financially accessible. This comports with survey data that tell us that insurance coverage plays a bigger role in predicting patient decision-making regarding the use of acupuncture than does effectiveness or safety.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>Also notable is the breadth of impact that the intervention had across a range of biopsychosocial outcomes. The effectiveness we documented extended beyond reductions in pain intensity to include improvements in functional, social, and psychological outcomes. The National Pain Strategy stresses the importance of treating chronic pain with therapies and approaches that work across the biopsychosocial spectrum.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, in the context of the opioid crisis, it should be pointed out that no serious adverse events were reported during the study. Over twenty years ago, the NIH consensus conference on acupuncture noted that &#x0201c;One of the advantages of acupuncture is that the incidence of adverse effects is substantially lower than that of many drugs or other accepted medical procedures used for the same conditions.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr48-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> This statement rings truer today than ever.

It is also possible that patients who entered our study hold attitudes or beliefs that predisposed them to favorable outcomes. However, a large body of high-quality randomized controlled trials has demonstrated that acupuncture is effective for chronic pain when these variables are controlled for.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr22-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr23-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr24-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr25-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr26-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr27-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr28-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr30-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr31-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr32-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr33-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr34-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr35-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Although we observed significant changes in a chronic condition over a short course of 60 days, this study does not provide data regarding the long-term effects of acupuncture on our patients. However, a meta-analysis of patients with chronic pain suggests that approximately 90% of the benefit of acupuncture would be sustained at 12 months.<sup><xref rid="bibr52-2164956118769557" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec29-2164956118769557"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, providing acupuncture care for patients with chronic pain was feasible and well received in the Vermont Medicaid population. Receiving care from licensed acupuncturists was associated with significant improvements in physical, functional, psycho-emotional, and occupational outcomes compared with before receiving acupuncture treatments. Our findings provide evidence that Medicaid patients with chronic pain who are provided access to acupuncture care are likely to benefit from such care. We believe that these results, when considered in context with significant high-quality safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness data from other randomized controlled trials, are sufficient to warrant coverage of acupuncture for Medicaid patients with chronic pain.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec35-2164956118769557"><title>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</title><p>The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Mr Davis reports subcontracting fees from the State of Vermont Agency of Human Services during the conduct of the study.
