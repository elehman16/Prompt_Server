Various adjuncts are used to relax the brain. Although practices vary, they are all directed at the components of the intracranial vault, namely the brain tissue volume, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and blood volume. Osmotherapy is frequently used to reduce brain tissue volume and intracranial pressure (ICP) during neurosurgical operation. Mannitol (20%) and hypertonic saline (HS) are most commonly used hyperosmolar solutions in the treatment of elevated ICP.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Mannitol is recommended as a first-choice hyperosmotic agent for the treatment of increased ICP.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The hyperosmolarity of mannitol reduces ICP by withdrawing water from the brain parenchyma to the intravascular tissue with intact blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB). It reduces blood viscosity and transiently increases cerebral blood flow leading to reflex cerebral vasoconstriction. In addition mannitol facilitates decrease in ICP by decreasing CSF volume by virtue of decreasing the rate of formation of CSF. The use of mannitol is frequently associated with serious adverse effects, such as intravascular volume depletion, hyponatremia, rebound ICP elevation, and renal failure.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Initially, HS solutions were used in small volumes for resuscitation of hypovolemic trauma patients. Now HS solutions are increasingly used as an alternative to mannitol for reduction of ICP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Brain trauma foundation guidelines recommend HS, when mannitol fails to reduce ICP.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>HS is used in various concentrations and with varying osmolar loads. HS reduces ICP by dehydration of brain tissue by creation of the osmotic gradient, decreasing blood viscosity leading to cerebral vasoconstriction and increasing plasma tonicity, which favors rapid absorption of CSF. Compared with mannitol, HS have additional beneficial effects like enhancement of cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, and reduction of extravascular lung volume, leading to improved gas exchange and improved partial pressure of oxygen in the blood.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Clinical trials that compared the effects of HS and mannitol on ICP have suggested that HS is at least as effective, if not better, than mannitol in the treatment of increased ICP.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Few studies have shown that HS is better than mannitol for brain relaxation[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and others have revealed that they are equally effective.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Moreover, these studies differ in the amount and osmolarity of mannitol or HS used, thus making it difficult to interpret the results. Hence this study was designed to compare the equiosmolar concentrations of mannitol (20%) and HS (3%) for brain relaxation in patients undergoing elective craniotomies for supratentorial tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethical committee approval on patients posted for elective supratentorial craniotomies, written informed consent was obtained from the patients or relatives of the patients. Fifty patients were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study and they were divided into two groups of 25 each assigned to receive 5 ml/kg of either 20% mannitol or 3% HS. The surgeon was blinded to the agents under study. Patients with age group 18&#x02013;65 years, with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) &#x0003e;13, and ASA physical status 1&#x02013;3 were included in the study. Patients with the presence of raised ICP, electrolyte imbalance, with severe cardiac, respiratory, or renal disease were excluded from the study. Patients who are already on mannitol or HS treatment were also excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Procedure</title><p>All patients satisfying the inclusion criteria were recruited to the study, after approval by ethics committee and written informed consent from the patients or their relatives. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups &#x02013; mannitol (M group) and HS (HS group) by a computer-generated randomization chart. In the operation room, peripheral intravenous line was secured and 0.9% normal saline was given for fluid management. The standard monitors including electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximeter were attached and baseline heart rate (HR), NIBP, and SPO2 readings were recorded. After preoxygenation with 100% O2 for 3 min, general anesthesia was induced with 2 mcg/kg fentanyl hydrochloride and 2 mg/kg propofol. Muscle relaxation was achieved using 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium bromide. Postinduction radial artery was cannulated and central venous catheter was placed depending on the need of surgery. Intraoperative anesthesia was maintained using oxygen&#x02013;nitrous oxide mixture (40:60) with 0.7&#x02013;1 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane. Opioids for analgesia and vecuronium bromide for muscle relaxation were repeated as needed. PaCO2 was maintained between 30 and 34 mmHg. HR and invasive arterial blood pressure were kept within &#x000b1; 20% of the baseline values. Normal saline (0.9%) was used as maintenance fluid at 2 ml/kg/h with additional replacement for urine output, third space loss, and blood loss. At the time of scalp incision patients received 5 ml/kg of either 20% mannitol (1 g/kg, osmolarity = 1098 mOsm/l; M group) or 3% HS (osmolarity = 1024 mOsm/l; HS group) over a period of 15 min through central line for intraoperative brain relaxation.</p><p>Brain relaxation was assessed by the operating neurosurgeon, who was blinded to the study drug upon opening the dura on four point scale:</p><p>

Fifty patients (25 in each group) were randomly allocated to receive either mannitol or HS. We also compared the hemodynamic effect of these drugs in these patients.</p><p>At the end of infusion both HS and mannitol has created an osmolar gradient across the intact BBB, causing an increase in serum osmolality due to the impermeability of the BBB to both HS and mannitol, this leads to water absorption from the brain tissue parenchyma to intravascular tissue causing decreased water content and ICP, which has been shown in several animal[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and human[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] studies in patients with traumatic brain injury and brain tumors, treated with either HS or mannitol. In our study, both mannitol and HS provided acceptable brain relaxation. HS provided perfect and satisfactory brain relaxation in 8 patients (32%) and 13 patients (52%), respectively, whereas mannitol in 5 patients (20%) and 17 patients (68%), respectively, (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The physical effects of HS and mannitol on the brain relaxation have been investigated previously by several researchers. In a similar study by Rozet <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] comparing equiosmolar solutions of HS and mannitol on intraoperative brain relaxation found no difference in the brain relaxation score in two groups. Gemma <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Di vivo <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported satisfactory brain relaxation in equal volumes of nonequiosmolar solutions of 7.5% HS and 20% mannitol. Wu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that HS provided better brain condition as compared with mannitol at equiosmolar doses (0.02). They have classified the brain relaxation on 3 point scale of 1 - soft, 2 &#x02013; adequate, and 3 - tight as compared with our study, where we have used 4 point scale, which is more objective way of classifying brain relaxation.</p><p>All the patients in both the groups remained hemodynamically stable, with no significant changes in HR, systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure. This could be due to better anesthesia and fluid management to avoid fluctuations in blood pressure. We monitored CVP in 19 patients in HS group and 18 patients in the mannitol group. In the mannitol group, there was a gradual reduction in CVP with time as compared with HS group. At 30 min there was a significant reduction in CVP with mannitol as compared with HS (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), coinciding with the onset of peak action of mannitol.</p><p>Being an osmotic diuretic, infusion of mannitol leads to significant diuresis. In our study, hourly urine output for the first 4 h was more in the mannitol group as compared with HS (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas during 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> hour of the surgery there was no difference in urine output between the groups, indicating fading action of mannitol. The total urine output was significantly more in the mannitol group as compared with HS group. These results are in concordance with earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>We measured both serum and arterial sodium values. HS lead to increase in arterial sodium levels at 60 and 120 min as compared with mannitol (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). At the end of 2 h, serum sodium was higher in HS group as compared with mannitol group.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The serum and arterial potassium were comparable at all time intervals. Rozet <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found HS caused increased sodium levels but also a transient hypokalemia. Mannitol leads to a gradual increase in potassium levels. In our study we have measured the arterial and serum sodium at less frequent intervals as compared with Rozet <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which might be responsible for missing arterial and serum potassium level changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Administration of equiosmolar concentrations of mannitol and HS provided acceptable brain relaxation. Mannitol, being an osmotic diuretic, resulted in a significant increase in urine output.
