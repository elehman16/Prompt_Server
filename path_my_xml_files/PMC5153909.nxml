HTLV-1 is also known to be the cause of an aggressive haematological malignancy, adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Having some features similar to multiple sclerosis, and often being of insidious onset, HAM/TSP is difficult to diagnose. Symptoms are usually confined to the lower body. Patients typically complain of stiffness and weakness of the legs, falls, pain in the lower back and legs, urinary urgency, constipation and erectile dysfunction. The majority of patients develop a chronically progressing disability, and 50&#x000a0;% become wheelchair-dependent within 2&#x000a0;decades of onset. A small subset progresses rapidly and a third group minimally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Specific diagnostic criteria have been developed to differentiate HAM/TSP from other myelopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Thirty years after the discovery of HTLV, there is still no internationally recognised treatment available for HTLV-1 infection or HAM/TSP. Clinical scientists are keen to find effective therapy for HAM/TSP. This is ideally proven through a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial (DB RCT) with a well-defined, primary outcome measure, tested in a sufficiently large, well-described, patient cohort. Designing such a trial for HAM/TSP patients has been proven challenging, as addressed by Martin et al. previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the process of designing a HAM/TSP clinical trial that meets all the desirable criteria, an international HAM/TSP clinical trial study group (HAM/TSP CTSG) consisting of HAM/TSP experts from Brazil, Japan, UK and USA was formed. The aim of this group was to collaboratively design a DB RCT approved by all consortium members and to gain access to a large enough HAM/TSP patient cohort. This would allow adjustment of outcome of HAM/TSP patients by variables such as subgroup, gender and baseline disability as well as a short trial recruitment phase, to minimise trial costs.</p><p>There is no uniformly recognised reliable biomarker of treatment response in HAM/TSP. The HAM/TSP CTSG therefore chose to evaluate the potential of a clinical outcome measure, the 10-metre walk test (10MWT) as a primary outcome measure. 10MWT measures the time a patient takes to walk 10&#x000a0;m in a straight line using their usual walking aid and is presented as seconds/10&#x000a0;m. A decrease in 10MWT thus represents improved mobility. 10MWT was chosen for three reasons: (i) When surveyed HAM/TSP patients felt that improving their gait should be a primary goal of a new intervention, making this a patient-centred measure, (ii) 10MWT has been used routinely to monitor patient mobility in all four HTLV treatment centres and (iii) 10MWT is a validated disability outcome measure used in other trials of patients with impaired mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], such as patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Healthy individuals are reported to complete the 10MWT in a mean of 6.84&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a study of HAM/TSP patients, the overall mean 10MWT in 29/49 (81&#x000a0;%) patients increased by +4.25&#x000a0;s/10&#x000a0;m in 12&#x000a0;months (range &#x02212;0.13 to 24.6, median 1.27). 10MWT deteriorated even in patients who walked without any need for further aid by a median of +1.98&#x000a0;s/10&#x000a0;m/year<sup>3</sup>. It is worth noting that the measurement of 10MWT varies considerably within and between patients on a daily basis, over time, and is operator-dependent.</p><p>The standard method to calculate the sample size of a clinical trial is the power calculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In order to be able to calculate the sample size required to have a high probability to refute the null hypothesis, should the treatment really be effective compared to the comparator, the inter- and intra-patient variabilities of 10MWT over time needed to be taken into account. To this aim, the HAM/TSP CTSG submitted prospectively collected 10MWT data of HAM/TSP patients to two biostatisticians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>10MWT data collected as part of HAM/TSP patients&#x02019; clinical routine workup at four HTLV treatment centres were submitted for use in the sample size calculation.

Although endemic in parts of the world, globally HAM/TSP is a rare disease, which makes large DB RCTs difficult to conduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is one of the reasons why although there are estimated 300,000&#x02013;450,000 HAM/TSP patients globally, there is no internationally agreed specific treatment. Since HTLV was discovered and associated to HAM/TSP, there have been only two RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] of which only one was double-blind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In order to provide HAM/TSP patients with a DB RCT, we developed several strategies. An international consortium was established, pooling expertise from HTLV centres based on four continents, to prioritise and sequentially test potential interventions for HAM/TSP. 10MWT was proposed as a clinical outcome measure which would be meaningful, reliable and easy to collect at different trial sites. Data obtained from patients under follow-up at each centre were collated to allow robust power calculations to ensure optimal study design. These longitudinal data on 10MWT were used to calculate the inter- and intra-patient variability.</p><p>Given the rarity of the condition, power calculations should be based on robust data to ensure efficient utilisation of scarce resources, human and financial. Data are presented on the predicted size of effect against required sample size. The selected sample size of 33 patients per arm for the planned comparison of active treatment with placebo has 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a 20&#x000a0;% difference in time taken to walk 10&#x000a0;m, adjusted for baseline.</p><p>10MWT had a positively skewed distribution, and the logarithmic transformation was effective in producing an approximately normal distribution. As a result, differences are presented as logarithms and back transformation produces ratios. This is why detectable differences are presented as percentages rather than differences in seconds.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s strengths are that data were collected longitudinally, including patients from all four continents, thus sampling the target HAM/TSP patient group. In addition, the sample size is fairly large for a disease this rare. 10MWT may vary with gender, age, walking aid and duration of disease. However, these variables are expected to affect the baseline and the outcome variable 10MWT in the same way. Hence, adjustment for baseline 10MWT removes the need to adjust for other variables.</p><p>Although there is bound to be an operator-dependent variability of 10MWT, if the same operator carries out the standardised baseline and outcome measurements in the same patient, this will automatically be adjusted for by the design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to report fixed sample sizes calculated for three different SDs of log<sub>e</sub>10MWT for clinical trials for patients with HAM/TSP powered at 80 or 90&#x000a0;%.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>FM, EI, MB, GPT: study design, data collection, manuscript writing.
