lumbar stability of bridge exercise accompanied by an abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM)
performed on an uneven support surface. [Subjects] A total of 30 participants were divided
into an experimental group (15 participants) and a control group (15 participants).
[Methods] The experimental group performed bridge exercise on an unstable surface, whereas
the control group performed bridge exercise on a stable surface. The respective bridge
exercises were performed for 30 minutes, 3 times per week, for 6 weeks. The static lumbar
stability (SLS) and dynamic lumbar stability (DLS) of both the experimental group and the
control group were measured using a pressure biofeedback unit. [Results] In the comparison
of the initial and final results of the experimental and control groups, only the SLS and
DLS of the experimental group were found to be statistically significant. [Conclusion] The
results of the present study show that when using bridge exercise to improve SLS and DLS,
performing the bridge exercise accompanied by ADIM on an uneven surface is more effective
than performing the exercise on a stable surface.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bridge exercise</kwd><kwd>Abdominal drawing-in maneuver</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lumbago is one of the most common functional disorders in modern society, and is known to
be primarily caused by decline of the most important muscle activities contributing to
vertebral stability, low back and abdominal deep muscle activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with normal persons, lumbago patients exhibit
atrophied low back and abdominal deep muscles, which causes problems for lumbar stability.
Such symptoms also cause lumbago recurrence. Consequently, the recovery of lumbar stability
is important in the treatment and prevention of lumbago. Furthermore, improving lumbar
stability is effective in the treatment and prevention of the recurrence of lumbago
regardless of the cause.</p><p>Thus far, there have been many studies of vertebral stability, which is a testament to the
importance of the issue. As the structure of the spine is unstable compared with that of
other bones, the role of deep muscles is particularly important in the maintenance of spine
stability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The representative deep
muscles of lumbar stability include the transversus abdominis and multifidus<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscles associated with vertebral stability are largely categorized as global muscles and
local muscles. These two groups of muscles interact through a mechanism called &#x0201c;co-working&#x0201d;
to maintain the stability of the lumbar spine. Global muscles contribute to the overall
trunk stability, whereas local muscles, which are situated in deep parts of the abdomen and
lumbar spine, contribute to fine vertebral regulation and segmental stabilization<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Muscles that contribute to lumbar stability include the transversus abdominis, multifidus,
internal oblique abdominal muscle, external oblique abdominal muscle, quadratus lumborum,
and pelvic floor muscles. In particular, among the global muscles the multifidus and
transversus abdominis are activated before other muscles when the human body moves to
regulate trunk balance and therefore play important roles in lumbar stability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises for lumbar stability include
lumbar flexion and extension exercises in the prone, supine, and proprioceptive bridging
positions, which can be performed with a mat, ball, dumbbells, or balance pad<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these, the bridge exercise is widely
used in clinical settings for training the global muscles and the local muscles of the
lumbar spine to coordinate in an appropriate manner<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Designed to activate the abdominal muscles, the abdominal
drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) allows a more effective performance of lumbar stability training
and induces simultaneous contraction of the muscles. Furthermore, ADIM also reduces
excessive lumbar lordosis and anterior pelvic tilt, which occur due to compensation, during
bridging exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. For lumbar
stabilization exercises, rather than performing the exercise in a static environment, the
use of on an unstable support surface, such as the top of a gym ball, enhances
proprioception and activity in the cerebral cortex<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, leading to better balance and equilibrium.</p><p>In preceding studies that used bridging exercises in tandem with ADIM, or bridging
exercises with a sling device on an uneven surface, the thicknesses of the abdominal muscles
were compared using ultrasound imaging<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, few studies have compared the lumbar stability improvement effect of bridging
exercises in tandem with the ADIM method performed on different support surfaces.</p><p>Consequently, the present study sought to investigate the effect of bridging exercises in
tandem with ADIM, which is easy and simple to conduct in a clinical setting. In particular,
we investigated the influence of different support surfaces on the static lumbar stability
(SLS) and dynamic lumbar stability (DLS) of the participants, after they had performed the
exercises on stable or unstable support surfaces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study enrolled 30 university students who were randomly assigned to the
unstable bridging exercise group (UBEG) (15 participants: 2 males, 13 females) and the
stable bridging exercise group (SBEF) or control group (15 participants: 2 males, 13
females). Participants that had muscular, skeletal, or nervous system problems, or could not
perform bridging exercises because of knee or ankle pain, were excluded from the study. This
study was approved by the Korea Nazarene University&#x02019;s institutional review board, and the
subjects were safely protected during all experimental processes. All of the subjects
understood the purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent before
their participation in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The average age, height, and weight of the participants in the UBEG group were
21.57&#x000b1;0.45&#x02005;years, 162.44&#x000b1;3.52&#x02005;cm, and 56.64&#x000b1;5.36&#x02005;kg, respectively. In the SBEG group, the
average age, height, and weight of the participants were 22.22&#x000b1;0.32&#x02005;years, 161.74&#x000b1;3.65&#x02005;cm,
and 57.67&#x000b1;3.53&#x02005;kg, respectively. The analysis of the sex differences of the participants was
performed with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, whereas the analyses of age, height, and weight
differences were performed with the independent t-test. As the above analyses did not reveal
statistically significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05), the 2 groups were deemed to be
homogeneous.</p><p>The bridging exercise on the stable support surface was started with the participants in
the supine position, with the knee joints flexed at 90 degrees and the hip joint flexed at
60 degrees. The feet were shoulder width apart, and both hands were placed on the chest in a
crossed position. Additionally, proper posture of the head and neck was maintained, with
participants&#x02019; gaze pointing to the ceiling. Before the bridging exercise, the ADIM was
performed. The abdomen was drawn in toward the navel to increase the intra-abdominal
pressure by selectively contracting the transversus abdominis and internal oblique abdominis
instead of the rectus abdominis. In other words, the ADIM increases the intra-abdominal
pressure enhancing the effect of the lumbar stabilization exercises and induces simultaneous
contraction of the muscles to reduce excessive lumbar lordosis and anterior pelvic tilt<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Upon the command of &#x0201c;pelvis up&#x0201d;, the participant raised the pelvis to maintain a 0-degree
hip joint flexion. At the command of &#x0201c;hold&#x0201d;, the participant maintained the raised pelvic
position for 15 s. Then, at the command of &#x0201c;pelvis down&#x0201d;, the participant lowered the pelvis
and rested for 10 s. Ten repetitions of the above procedures comprised a single set. The
total exercise program was 6 weeks long, and 6 sets per session were performed 3 times a
week.</p><p>Bridging exercises on an unstable support surface consisted of placing a balance pad (AIREX
Balance Pad, AIREX, Switzerland) beneath the participant&#x02019;s feet to increase the intensity
and the instability of the exercise. Thereafter, the bridging exercises proceeded in the
same manner as that on the stable support surface.</p><p>To evaluate the SLS, the rate of contraction of the transversus abdominis was evaluated
using a pressure biofeedback unit (Chattanooga Group, Australia, PBU). The PBU consists of
an expandable, tensionless pocket connected to a pressure gauge. It is a simple apparatus
designed to record and monitor pressure changes during pelvic spine movements. The pocket
has a dimension of 16.7&#x000d7;24.0&#x02005;cm and can measure from 0 to 200 mmHg. During the evaluation,
an excessive pressure change is an indicator that the pelvic spine area movements are not
being properly regulated. The SLS measurements were made by placing the PBU under the
participant in a prone position, at the site of intersection of the anterior superior iliac
spines beneath the navel. The baseline pressure began at 70 mmHg, and the participant was
directed to decrease the pressure by drawing in the lower stomach without back or hip
movement. Then, the participant was asked to maintain the same pressure for the next 10&#x02005;s,
and the resultant change in pressure was recorded<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To measure the DLS, bent knee fall out (BKFO) was performed. BKFO consists of placing the
PBU under the participant in the supine position, 2&#x02005;cm beneath the posterior superior iliac
spines. To minimize the sway of the trunk, folded towels were placed at the sides of the
PBU. The baseline pressure was set to 40 mmHg, and the pressure changes during 45 degrees
abduction and external rotation movement, while the hip and knee were flexed and the feet
were touching the floor, were measured<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The recorded data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The collected
data are presented as averages and standard deviations. The significance of differences
between the pre-intervention and post-intervention data of the respective participant groups
were examined using the paired t-test. To evaluate the significance of differences between
the 2 participant groups, the independent t-test was used. The significance level was chosen
as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the comparison of the pre-intervention and post-intervention data of the SBEG and UBEG,

an unstable surface after ADIM. The bridge exercise is easy to perform and stabilizes the
trunk. Consequently, it is often used in clinical settings. Improved vertebral stability
reduces damage to and instability in the muscles around the spine, protects the vertebral
joints, and improves spinal adjustment capability. Therefore, bridging exercise has been
used in lumbago treatment, as it increases the stability of the spine by inducing
cooperative contraction of the trunk muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lehman reported that when a conventional exercise was performed on an unstable support
surface, more muscles were activated. In exercises performed on wood balance pad and air
cushion support surfaces, it was reported that bridge exercises on top of air cushions were
more effective in the rehabilitation of lumbago patients, the air cushion support surface
was shown to be more effective<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brill
stated that core stabilization exercises not only contract the transversus abdominis but
also maintain the balance of the spine, and increase lumbar strength and stability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study of Endleman, 18 normal adult
females and 8 normal adult males perform 6 months of intensive Pilates exercises focusing on
the core. In the measurement of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique abdominis
after the intervention, the transversus abdominis exhibited a significant difference,
demonstrating that training the core area had a positive influence on abdominal strength and
trunk stability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the comparison of the pre-intervention and post-intervention data of the SBEG and UBEG,
it was found that the SLS and DLS changes in the UBEG were statistically significant. These
results indicate that the use of an unstable support surface for performing bridge exercises
led to better co-working of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique abdominis
resulting in increases in SLS and DLS. This result of the present study is similar to the
result of a previous study that showed that use of a sling as an unstable support surface
for a bridge exercise led to increases in the thicknesses of the transversus abdominis and
internal oblique abdominis due to the simultaneous contraction of the core, and the training
of surface muscle coordination<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the comparison of the changes between pre-intervention and post-intervention of the
stable bridge exercise group and the unstable bridge exercise group, significant differences
were not found. This result shows that although an unstable bridge exercise is effective, it
is not significantly more effective than a stable bridge exercise at improving SLS and DLS.
However, it does show that in the case of performing bridge exercises for the purpose of
increasing SLS and DLS, the unstable bridge exercise accompanied by ADIM is more effective
than a standalone stable bridge exercise. This indicates that when performing bridge
exercises to treat and prevent lumbago, different types of unstable support surfaces should
be used to increase the effectiveness of the exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Panjabi</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Clinical spinal instability and low back
