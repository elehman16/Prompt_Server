The primary outcome was change in mean blood glucose in each group from recruitment to delivery, calculated with adjustments made for number of blood glucose measurements, proportion of preprandial and postprandial readings, baseline characteristics, and length of time in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 203 women were randomized. Blood glucose data were available for 98 intervention and 85 control women. There was no significant difference in rate of change of blood glucose (&#x02013;0.16 mmol/L in the intervention and &#x02013;0.14 mmol/L in the control group per 28 days, <italic>P</italic>=.78). Women using the intervention had higher satisfaction with care (<italic>P</italic>=.049). Preterm birth was less common in the intervention group (5/101, 5.0% vs 13/102, 12.7%; OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12-1.01). There were fewer cesarean deliveries compared with vaginal deliveries in the intervention group (27/101, 26.7% vs 47/102, 46.1%, <italic>P</italic>=.005). Other glycemic, maternal, and neonatal outcomes were similar in both groups. The median time from recruitment to delivery was similar (intervention: 54 days; control: 49 days; <italic>P</italic>=.23). However, there were significantly more blood glucose readings in the intervention group (mean 3.80 [SD 1.80] and mean 2.63 [SD 1.71] readings per day in the intervention and control groups, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001).

There is enthusiasm for integration of digital technologies into health systems [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although there is some evidence of clinical benefit with the use of digital health technologies in type 1 and 2 diabetes [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], large studies are lacking in the GDM population. There is potential for an integrated digital health solution for GDM: the condition requires frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose over a short time frame (typically 3 months), pregnant women are a motivated group willing to engage with health monitoring and advice, and women of reproductive age usually have an excellent grasp of digital technologies. Combining a digital blood glucose diary with real-time clinician review and feedback may improve glycemic control, reduce diabetes-associated complications, and mean potentially fewer outpatient contacts with the diabetes care team with cost savings to the health system, and it is likely to be more acceptable to women.</p><p>Several groups have developed remote blood glucose monitoring systems for women with GDM; however, trials have been small in size with potentially significant sources of methodological bias [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the context of these limitations, telehealth monitoring systems have not been demonstrated to be superior to standard care for glycemic control and clinical outcomes [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Limited evidence supports that digital solutions are acceptable to pregnant women and possibly reduce the number of clinic visits [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. No trial to date has assessed the associated health care costs.</p><p>We developed a digital blood glucose management system, GDm-health, to facilitate remote blood glucose self-monitoring and bidirectional communication between the clinical team and pregnant women. The system, described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], was developed by patients, midwives, obstetricians, physicians, and biomedical engineers, and showed high levels of user satisfaction in a small service evaluation project [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We hypothesized that the real-time feedback and support offered by the system would improve glycemic control in women with GDM. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized trial to assess whether digital remote management of GDM improved glycemic control compared to standard paper-based blood glucose monitoring, with secondary outcomes of maternal and neonatal outcomes, cost of care, and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>This was a single-center, balanced randomization 1:1, open-label, parallel-group, individually randomized controlled trial, conducted in a large UK tertiary referral hospital between September 2013 and June 2015 [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>There were no published data on precise estimates of the likely standard deviation in mean blood glucose, making sample size calculation challenging. Therefore, we pragmatically decided to assume a standard deviation of 0.8 mmol/L for the mean blood glucose level at the end point. Thus, with 100 patients in each arm, we would be able to detect a difference between the arms of 0.32 mmol/L, with power of 80% and a significance level of .05.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation</title><p>Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: intervention (the GDm-health management system; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>) or control (usual care). Randomization used a partial minimization procedure to balance important covariates including gestational age, weight, and ethnic group using the Oxford University Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit computer-generated randomization system Sortition [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>This trial received ethical approval from National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central-Berkshire B (reference number 13/SC/0176). Written informed consent was obtained for each participant. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ref: NCT01916694).</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Screening for GDM was based on risk factors as per UK clinical guidelines [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and GDM was defined using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] criteria.</p><p>Eligible women were aged between 18 and 45 years with a viable singleton pregnancy of less than 35 weeks and 0 days, and had GDM diagnosed by 75 g oral glucose tolerance test [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Following diagnosis of GDM, women were instructed to perform preprandial and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose monitoring and were given information about the trial. If after this initial week they did not require immediate treatment with insulin, they were eligible for inclusion.</p><p>All women were asked to test their blood glucose six times a day on at least 3 days of the week, as per the local guideline. This consisted of a fasting sample, 1-hour postbreakfast, prelunch, 1-hour postlunch, predinner, and 1-hour postdinner. The target blood glucose range was fasting readings &#x02265;3.5 and &#x02264;5.8 mmol/L and 1-hour postprandial readings less than 7.8 mmol/L. Thresholds for further dietetic support were the same in both groups. A decision to start pharmacological treatment was made by a number of doctors unblinded to treatment allocation, but following the same local treatment guidelines for participants in both the intervention and the control arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention and Control</title><sec><title>Standard Clinic Care Group (Control Group)</title><p>Participants in the control group were instructed to record their blood glucose values in a paper diary. Every 2 to 4 weeks they attended the outpatient clinic for review. Women were instructed to contact the diabetes midwife if their blood glucose breached predefined thresholds [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Remote Glucose Monitoring Group (Intervention Group)</title><p>Participants in the intervention group were loaned a mobile phone with the preinstalled GDm-health app and taught how to record, tag, and review blood glucose readings by a research midwife. Every 4 to 8 weeks they attended the outpatient clinic (ie, half as many clinic visits as the standard clinic care group).</p><p>A diabetes midwife reviewed the blood glucose readings on a secure website at least three times a week. The system generated an alert if the same predefined thresholds as for the control group were breached [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An automatic alert was also generated if the participant was not recording a predefined number of blood glucose readings per week or more glucose testing strips were needed. A short message service (SMS) text message containing advice about diet, dose adjustments of hypoglycemic medications, and messages of encouragement were sent to the participant by the diabetes midwife between clinic visits via the website.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Blood Glucose Data</title><sec><title>Primary Outcome</title><p>The predefined primary end point was the rate of change in glycemia, measured as a function of blood glucose measurements (mmol/L/28 days), compared between the two groups. Change over time in glycemia in both groups was compared from recruitment until delivery.</p><p>Timed and tagged blood glucose data were extracted from the GDm-health management system to determine glycemia for the intervention group. Blood glucose data for the control group were extracted from the paper diaries completed by the women at each clinic visit. Paper diary data were entered into an electronic file, with a subset double-entered to check accuracy.</p><p>Paper diaries were used in preference to glucose meter downloads because the meters employed (LifeScan OneTouch Ultra Mini) did not allow mealtime tagging. Meter-generated time stamps were found to be inadequate surrogates.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Outcomes</title><p>Other predefined markers of glycemia were rate of change of glycated hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>); overall mean blood glucose and mean fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose; and time to treatment from recruitment in weeks. Maternal outcomes known to be associated with diabetic control were compared between the groups: weight was recorded at each visit and body mass index (BMI) was calculated, pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia, gestational age at delivery, birthweight and proportion of large for gestational age babies (&#x0003e;90th percentile for gestation and gender), mode of birth, and perineal severe trauma. Neonatal outcomes were shoulder dystocia or birth injury, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, or admission to neonatal intensive care.</p><p>Participant attitudes were assessed using the Oxford Maternity Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This 12-item questionnaire has previously been validated for this population and was given to all women who participated in the trial within 6 weeks of the birth of the baby. Questions 1 to 9 asked women about their satisfaction with their care, their relationship with their diabetes team, and the reliability and convenience of the system, and were scored on a 7-point Likert scale (0=not satisfied to 6=very satisfied). Question 10 asked women about whether they felt the number of visits was too few, just right, or too many; question 11 asked whether they would be interested in using a mobile phone app to help with blood glucose monitoring; and question 12 asked whether they would recommend the app to a family member or friend with GDM. Scores for the first nine questions were summed with a maximum score of 54.</p><p>Direct health care costs, within the UK National Health Service (NHS) were compared between the two groups from the time of recruitment until hospital discharge after birth of the mother and baby. The complete list of services included in the cost analysis is reported in Table A in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref> [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It was assumed that for some clinical outcomes (eg, shoulder dystocia, birth trauma, or neonatal hypoglycemia), and to avoid double counting, the costs associated with these outcomes were captured by the hospital length of stay. The cost analysis aimed to identify the additional costs of one group versus the other; therefore, the costs of the glucose meter and strips were excluded from the analysis because these were recommended for identical use by women in both groups. As GDm-health is free to install on a participant&#x02019;s mobile phone, no specific intervention costs were included in this analysis. We present unit costs, resource use, and costs separately between treatment arms [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Costs were expressed in 2014-2015 UK sterling pounds (&#x000a3;) and no discounting was employed given the short time horizon of the analysis [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients randomized. The primary analysis of blood glucose was repeated for the per-protocol population. The inclusion criteria for the per-protocol analysis were the population with more than 67% of expected numbers of blood glucose measurements (at least 28 of 42 readings for weeks when on pharmacological treatment and at least 12 of 18 readings for weeks not on pharmacological treatment).</p><sec><title>Primary Analysis</title><p>The primary objectives were to compare rate of change in glycemia in the intervention arm with that in the control arm. Glycemia was assessed as a function of blood glucose measurements. The dependent variable, the blood glucose measurement, was recorded by each patient up to six times per day between recruitment and delivery. The change in blood glucose over gestation was modeled using a linear regression equation. A random coefficient model was fitted that allowed for differences between patients in the rate of change of blood glucose. Factors included in the model as fixed effects were (1) a two-level factor indicating the treatment group; (2) a factor with three levels indicating the time of day of the blood glucose measurement, breakfast, lunch, or dinner; (c) a two-level factor indicating whether the measurement was premeal or postmeal; and (d) baseline characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Analyses</title><p>The methods of linear mixed models were used to analyze the HbA<sub>1c</sub> data. The rate of change of HbA<sub>1c</sub> over gestation was modeled using a first-order regression equation. A random coefficient model was fitted that allowed for differences between patients in the rate of change, as performed for the primary outcome.</p><p>To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in the treatment groups, continuous normally distributed variables were analyzed using analysis of covariance, including baseline characteristics as covariates, and binary outcomes using logistic regression. Results are reported as a treatment effect or odds ratio with 95% confidence limits. For continuous variables that were not normally distributed, the median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) are reported and a nonparametric test was used to compare treatment groups. For binary variables with zero or very small number of events, exact logistic regression was used.</p><p>Costs were estimated by multiplying quantities of health care resource use by the corresponding unit costs (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>, Table A). Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize health care resource use and costs between the two treatment arms. A complete-case analysis was carried out given the small number of missing data present in the dataset. Parametric mean cost differences and associated 95% confidence intervals for each category of resource use were calculated to identify potential cost differences [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

We demonstrated that women using the GDm-health system had significantly more blood glucose readings, higher satisfaction scores and fewer cesarean deliveries compared to women in the control group, and these reached statistical significance. There were longer gestations and fewer preterm births in the intervention group compared to the control group which did not reach statistical significance. Other maternal and neonatal outcomes were similar in both groups. We were not able to demonstrate a significant cost savings.</p><p>This digital health solution has proven popular with women who commented that they appreciated the additional support and monitoring it provided, as well as the perceived time and cost savings of avoiding hospital appointments. The UK strategy for improving health care is to give individuals shared access to their own health records and for them to be at the center of all decision making [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. By directly allowing women to contribute to and access their blood glucose monitoring data, we believe GDm-health is a good example of a system moving toward this goal.</p><p>This is the largest randomized controlled trial to date of a digital health solution for the management of women with GDM. Our findings are in keeping with our published systematic review [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which concluded there was no evidence of superior glycemic control using digital monitoring. As with other trials, patient satisfaction was higher in the intervention group. We did not show a significant effect on secondary clinical outcomes. It is of note that interventional trials in women with GDM that are powered to show significant effects on clinical endpoints are usually much larger than our trial (typically in excess of 500 women in each arm). These trials also compare any treatment against no treatment for GDM; therefore, they are likely to have a bigger effect on outcome [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Fewer women in the intervention group transitioned to hypoglycemic medication during the study, which may have been related to better dietetic adherence, although we did not collect data on diet and exercise in this study. Although not statistically significant, there was an average 3-day prolongation of pregnancy and fewer preterm births in the intervention group compared to the control group, which may have influenced the significantly fewer emergency cesarean deliveries. The clinical benefit of influencing self-managed lifestyle behaviors and dietetic adherence in this population using digital technologies warrants further study.</p><p>Determining the adequacy of blood glucose control during pregnancy is challenging. Although we report no difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, it is a poor measure of glucose control in the context of rapid changes in glycemia over a short period of time [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Likewise, we did not have access to continuous glucose monitoring, thus the overall linear rate of change of blood glucose we present was reliant on the woman&#x02019;s capillary testing and may have missed differences in fetal glucose exposure during the trial. Assessing end organ effects such as fetal growth has been suggested as an indicator of blood glucose control [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; however, by its nature this measure is retrospective indicating past rather than current glycemic status. Trends in fasting and preprandial and postprandial capillary blood glucose monitoring, therefore, remain the mainstay of glycemic assessment in women with GDM.</p><p>Capturing the data in the paper diaries presented several challenges in this trial, with incomplete, untagged, inaccurate, and missing records. Poor compliance has been associated with poor concordance between paper diaries and meter readings and poorer glycemic control [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Digital blood glucose recording with automated delivery of blood glucose data provides a reliable and secure source of data for clinical interpretation. Beyond fidelity in data capture, digital data linked to mealtimes and other clinical parameters (eg, fetal growth) could be used in dynamic analyses, giving feedback to patients and clinicians about overall trends in blood glucose control. In our service development cohort, we demonstrated that 2-week moving-average blood glucose values were significantly higher in women with GDM who delivered large for gestational age infants compared to those with normal infants [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For this trial, we did not incorporate any predictive algorithms into the system, other than a graphical display of blood glucose trends, as algorithms have yet to be validated for clinical practice. However, digital technologies incorporating artificial intelligence or clinician based feedback as well as optimized reporting and alerting visuals could have the potential to promote desired self-managed lifestyle behaviors and dietetic adherence.</p><p>Current thresholds for treatment targets in GDM are based on consensus, historical practice, and targets selected for use in clinical trials. The ability to accurately correlate dynamic data with clinical endpoints will be an important development for future research in GDM, eventually enabling individualized glycemic management plans. As technologies for continuous glucose monitoring become more reliable and affordable, a natural progression would be to incorporate their output into a digital health system such as GDm-health [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strengths of this study are the rigorous design and attention to randomization, which ensured similar groups at study entry and the high levels of follow-up until delivery in both groups. The trial was conducted under &#x0201c;real life&#x0201d; conditions in a busy maternity diabetes service. We considered a range of clinical and nonclinical outcomes, important for comprehensive evaluation of the potential benefits and harms of a new technology. We also present the first randomized comparison of direct costs of maternity-associated care.</p><p>The trial also has limitations. We were unable to demonstrate a difference in the number of clinic attendances between the groups, despite this being specified in the protocol. Booking follow-up appointments based on study allocation proved challenging, as routine 2-week, rather than modified 4-week follow-up appointments for participants assigned to receive the GDm-health intervention were often made by clerical staff, most of whom were unaware of the study. Therefore, it is not possible for us to determine whether this technology can safely replace clinic visits and this clearly impacted on direct health care costs.</p><p>A full economic assessment was not performed, with costs of implementation, medications, and indirect costs not included. The trial was conducted in a single referral center, where the technology was also developed and, as such, uptake and effectiveness may differ in other settings. We are currently evaluating a pilot scale-up program in three other public hospitals. At the time of writing, more than 250 women each month are using GDm-health, with similar satisfaction scores and sustained use over 2 years [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A further limitation is that the trial was limited to women who could understand written and spoken English to be able to provide valid consent without the need for an interpreter. In populations with large non-English speaking populations provision would need to be made to ensure equity of access to the system.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is a national drive to incorporate digital health solutions into routine UK health care delivered through the NHS; however, the evidence for their efficacy and clinical and cost-effectiveness is lacking. This pilot study describes the largest randomized evaluation to date of a system to monitor and manage GDM remotely. The system appears safe with comparable glycemic control, maternal, and newborn outcomes between allocated groups, with improved patient satisfaction and superior data capture in the intervention group. Further large, detailed health economic evaluation of these systems at scale is required to understand their potential impact on health care systems. Likewise, studies to understand whether such real-time digital monitoring systems incorporating continuous glucose monitoring technologies can provide new insights into predictive and bespoke individualized management plans are also required. Finally, studies to evaluate whether these digital systems have the potential to promote desired self-management behaviors and better dietetic adherence which could also influence clinical outcome, are required.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.</p><p>We would like to also acknowledge the participants and the other medical staff who provided the clinical care during the study period.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>Authors' Contributions: LM, JEH, KB, JB, AJF, OJF, YK, JCL, LL, ORA, CV, and LT were directly involved in the trial design and/or execution.
