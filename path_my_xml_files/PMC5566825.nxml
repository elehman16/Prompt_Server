The study was conducted from the month of Mar 2015 to Feb 2016 which covered one summer, one rainy and one winter season. It showed that the children were protected from various illnesses related to infection or allergy under the different seasonal variations though out the year. These findings are also in consensus with earlier published literature which demonstrated that CP provides protection from various illnesses irrespective of seasonal influence.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Out of a total of 1255 episodes related to immunity related infections or allergies, control group had 2.10 times more number of episodes in comparison to CP group which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

The number of children having no immunity related illnesses was 2.22 times higher in the CP group as compared to control group which was found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Out of the total absent days from school, 2.27 times higher number of days were observed in the control group in comparison to CP group and found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) as well.

The mechanism of these benefits of CP can be explained with the help of previously published literature and studies conducted on CP. CP has demonstrated the <italic>in vitro</italic> immune boosting potential by various mechanisms. In the concentration range of 20 &#x003bc;g/ml &#x02013; 500 &#x003bc;g/ml, CP was found to increase the activity of NK cells by 1.8 to 10.3 fold, levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL- 1-&#x003b2; and MIP-1- &#x003b1; secreted by DCs were found to be increased by 1.3 to 3.2 fold and phagocytic activity was found to be increased by 28.9% to 65.2%.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In two separate <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies, the level of IgE and plasma histamine were observed to be almost equal to the vehicle when challenged with allergens in animals (mice and rats respectively) pretreated with CP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] These two studies are suggestive of suppression of allergic response in response to allergens implying protection against various infections.</p><p>Studies on CP have indicated that it contains a number of phenolics which may account for its therapeutic activity.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] CP also contains honey which works as &#x02018;a carrier of herbs&#x02019;, or <italic>Yogav&#x00101;h&#x0012b;</italic>, thereby potentiates absorption of various herbs deep into the tissues and imparts youth, charm, vigour and longevity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the current study as well, the subject diaries were evaluated to assess the change in energy, physical fitness, strength and stamina. Under all of these parameters, fair amounts of improvement were observed at end of three months that continued until the end of the study in both groups. The improvement was higher in CP group in comparison to control. However, comparison within and between the groups was not statistically significant. Assessment of above mentioned parameters in terms of number of children revealed that in CP group all participants except one, moved from the category of dissatisfied to satisfied at the end of the study in comparison to control where 4 participants were still in category of dissatisfied at the end of study.</p><p>Assessment of Quality of life through KIDSCREEN-27 Questionnaires showed improvement in the domain score of &#x0201c;Physical Activity and Health&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;General Mood and Child's Feeling&#x0201d; in both the groups at the end of 6 months of the study. The domain score of &#x0201c;Physical Activity and Health&#x0201d; in CP as well as in control group improved from baseline to the end of the study and was found to be significant. The improvement in this domain was however found to be higher in CP group however; there was no significant difference between the two groups. Similarly the &#x0201c;general mood and child's feeling&#x0201d; showed a better improvement in CP group as compared to control group over 6 months period. The domain score of &#x02018;School &#x00026; learning&#x02019; showed a significant improvement in both the groups from one month further to 3 months and 6 months.

In all the toxicity studies i.e. acute dose oral toxicity, 28 days repeated dose oral toxicity studies and in the 90 days repeated dose oral toxicity studies, CP did not cause any signs of toxicity, body weight loss with all animals surviving throughout the study periods. In acute oral dose toxicity, the LD<sub>50</sub> value of CP in both sexes of rats and mice was found to be greater than 2000 mg/kg of the body weight.

The primary parameter of immunity (episodes of infections or allergy related conditions) showed more than 2 times protection from illness in CP group as compared to the control group. The duration of illness related to infection or allergy was also observed to be significantly lesser in CP group as compared to control group. Other parameters of assessment of immunity such as number of absent days and number of absent participants in school due to these illnesses, also confirmed that CP showed more than twice the protection from immunity related illness as compared to the control group. There was a significant change in energy levels, physical fitness levels, strength and stamina in both the groups, however, CP showed better percentage improvement on these parameters as compared to the control group. Assessment of quality of life by KIDSCREEN-27 Questionnaire showed better improvement in CP group as compared to control group on domains of &#x0201c;Physical activity and Health&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;General Mood and Child's Feelings&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;School and learning.&#x0201d; Assessment of overall improvement by the physician (CGI-I) also showed that over a period of 6 months more number of participants improved in CP group as compared to control group. CP showed excellent to good safety in all the participants in the study.
