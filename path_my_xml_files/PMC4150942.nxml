Considering the adverse health effects and the relation of obesity and screen time in childhood, efforts to affect screen use in children are warranted. Parents have been identified as an important influence on children&#x02019;s screen time and therefore should be involved in prevention programmes. The aim was to examine the mediating role of family-related factors on the effects of the school-based family-focused UP4FUN intervention aimed at screen time in 10- to 12-year-old European children (n child&#x02013;parent dyads&#x02009;=&#x02009;1940).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised controlled trial was conducted to test the six-week UP4FUN intervention in 10- to 12-year-old children and one of their parents in five European countries in 2011 (n child&#x02013;parent dyads&#x02009;=&#x02009;1940). Self-reported data of children were used to assess their TV and computer/game console time per day, and parents reported their physical activity, screen time and family-related factors associated with screen behaviours (availability, permissiveness, monitoring, negotiation, rules, avoiding negative role modeling, and frequency of physically active family excursions). Mediation analyses were performed using multi-level regression analyses (child-school-country).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Almost all TV-specific and half of the computer-specific family-related factors were associated with children&#x02019;s screen time.

Sedentary behaviours have been associated with obesity in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Sedentary behaviours can be defined as behaviours that require a minimal energy expenditure (1.0 &#x02013; 1.5 metabolic equivalent units) and includes activities such as sitting and lying down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis by Trembley and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] showed that increased sedentary time was related to unfavourable body composition in 5- to 17-year-old boys and girls. Currently, evidence for a longitudinal positive relationship between sedentary time and body mass index (BMI) and more specific indicators of fat mass is insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, earlier studies have indicated that decreasing any type of sedentary time is associated with lower health risk in youth aged 5&#x02013;17 years, independent from physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, intervention programmes focusing on sedentary time are warranted.</p><p>The most prevalent sedentary behaviour in youth is electronic media use, especially TV viewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recently developed guidelines on sedentary behaviour recommended that children should not spend more than two hours/day using TV/computer/electronic games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, mean levels of screen time in schoolchildren across Europe were found to exceed two hours per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Between 25% and 40% of 11- to 15-year-old European and North-American children report watching TV more than three to four hours per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have indicated that young adolescents played computer games for an average of 1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;hours per day.</p><p>To date, several interventions that focus on reducing sedentary behaviours in general or specifically screen time have been developed, but their effectiveness on children&#x02019;s screen time, sedentary time and BMI was small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Salmon and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] attributed this limited effect to setting-specific interventions (i.e., home-based, school-based or community-based), suggesting that intervening across multiple settings (e.g., school- and home-based) may be more effective in changing children&#x02019;s sedentary behaviours. Furthermore, earlier research found that parental rules/restrictions of screen-based behaviours, the number of TVs in the home and parental role modelling of sedentary behaviours were the three most important correlates of screen time in 10- to 12-year-olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Studies examining correlates of screen time in children and adolescents have focused predominantly on TV viewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These factors indicate the significance of targeting the family in developing interventions that prevent sedentary behaviour.</p><p>The UP4FUN intervention is a school-based and family-focused pilot intervention aimed at reducing and breaking up sitting time at home and school in 10- to 12-year-old children in five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Norway). This pilot intervention and its preliminary evaluation were part of the &#x0201c;EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth&#x0201d; (ENERGY)-project, a European Commission-funded project that aimed to develop and evaluate a theory-informed and evidence-based multi-component obesity prevention intervention for 10- to 12-year-old schoolchildren across Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Unpublished findings by Vik and colleagues on the short-term effectiveness of the UP4FUN intervention suggest that the intervention was not effective in reducing total TV time and computer/game console use. Nevertheless, earlier research highlights the importance of conducting theory-driven mediation analysis of intervention data to understand the underlying mechanisms of change in sedentary behaviours, even if there is no intervention effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Mediation analyses can provide useful insights in the underlying working mechanisms of interventions even without significant intervention effect. For example, an intervention can effectively influence the presumed mediator if the mediator is not related to the outcome, which indicates that the presumed mediator is not a good predictor of the outcome. Intervention developers can subsequently decide to remove the intervention component targeting this presumed mediator. Alternatively, the presumed mediator may be associated with the outcome, but the intervention did not affect the mediator. In this case, other intervention strategies targeting this mediator are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additionally, mediation of non-significant intervention effects is possible when inconsistent mediation occurs, namely inconsistent mediators can suppress the intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Van Stralen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] conducted a literature review on mediators of overweight prevention interventions in children and adolescents and found only three school-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] that explored the mediators of interventions focusing on sedentary behaviours. Potential family mediators included were screen time rules and social norm but no significant mediators were found. Nevertheless, the authors suggested to further explore mediation effects of environmental variables (including parental factors) on sedentary behaviours, as these behaviours may not be well-considered, conscious behaviours but instead be influenced by individual biological factors, habit strength and parental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to (i) examine the effects of the UP4FUN intervention on family-related factors, (ii) investigate associations between changes in these family-related factors associated with TV and computer/game console time and changes in children&#x02019;s screen time (i.e., TV and computer/game console time), and (iii) determine the role of family-related factors in the UP4FUN intervention effects on TV and computer/console time in 10- to 12-year-old children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and participants</title><p>This pilot intervention was tested in the autumn of 2011 using a pre-test post-test design including an intervention and a control condition in five European countries. The intervention condition included a six-week school-based family-focused intervention, and the control condition involved the usual school curriculum. A convenience sample of schools was recruited in each country and schools were paired according to size. Subsequently, schools were randomly allocated to the control or intervention group. In total 62 schools participated in the study with 31 intervention schools and 31 control schools. Study participants were 10- to 12-year old children and one of their parents. All participating countries obtained ethical approval from the relevant ethical committees and ministries. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Ghent in Belgium; by the State Medical Chamber of Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg in Germany; by the Bioethics Committee of Harokopio University in Greece; by the Scientific and Ethics Committee of Health Sciences Council in Hungary; and by the National Committees for Research Ethics in Norway. The participating parents in all countries except Belgium provided their written consent through their child&#x02019;s consent form, thereby also agreeing to the participation of one of the child&#x02019;s parents. In Belgium, the participating parents consented by returning the parent questionnaire as passive informed consent were allowed by the ethics committee. The study is registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN34562078">ISRCTN34562078</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn/">http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn/</ext-link>).

Changing personal determinants of sedentary time (i.e., awareness, attitudes, preferences, self-efficacy) was considered important to promote self-regulation, because 10- to 12-year olds are likely to spend a considerable amount of non-supervised time at home. The intervention was also framed in a social ecological perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] because of the clear influence of the physical and social home environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was applied to characterise the association between the determinants and intervention components (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and intervention components was based on information gathered from systematic reviews, secondary data-analyses, focus group research and findings from stakeholder interviews about intervention ideas.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The main targets at the interpersonal level were the parents, but the children could define who in their home should help them. They were also encouraged to ask for and offer help to their peers. Planning for social support and social change was therefore the most used change technique at the interpersonal level, but the following additional techniques were used to target parents&#x02019; knowledge, awareness of child behaviour, role modelling, rules and restrictions and physical availability of screens at home: information about the behaviour-health link, agreement on a behavioural contract, monitoring of child behaviour, opportunities for social comparison and identification as role models. Finally, at the organisational level, the teacher was provided information about the behaviour-health link and trained to model breaking-up sitting time and to use prompts and cues to remember to do so. In Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the practical application of these behaviour change techniques in the UP4FUN intervention can be found. Additionally, pretesting was conducted in all five countries to test the core intervention components and identify any substantial cultural differences. More extensive information about the underlying theoretical frameworks and the pretesting phase are described in Lien and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Description of the UP4FUN intervention program</title><p>The name UP4FUN was chosen to remind the pupils to get UP and engage in FUN alternatives to sitting. A design company developed the material so that it should appeal to children of both genders across Europe through a general youth culture image, and inspire to activity and fun without promoting organised sports. The intervention included 6 phases (6&#x000a0;weeks) with 1&#x02013;2 lessons per phase/week (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These lessons introduced the topic of the phase, followed by tasks in school, messages to the family and tasks at home in the 6 newsletters to parents/family. Each newsletter contained 2&#x02013;3 pages and was designed to transfer the children&#x02019;s personalised messages from school to home (e.g., about the results of their sitting time registration and their personal goal for change) and to work on the topic of the phase through tasks at home. During the intervention, motivating factors (economic incentives) were used to support the fun part of the intervention (i.e., step counters and stickers) and the social commitment to the message (i.e., bracelet with UP4FUN embossed). The program ended with a Family Fun Event in phase 6. The aim of this event was to summarise the project, share experiences and raise continued support for the main message. Alternatively, this concluding event could be done in class. Newsletter 6 aimed to convey the main results from this event (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> details the six phases).

The children completed questionnaires during school time and received the parent questionnaire in a closed envelope to take home for completion by one of their parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Child screen time (TV and computer time)</title><p>Time spent on TV viewing and computer/console use was assessed separately by two questions asking the children how many hours they usually spend watching TV and using computer/console on a weekend and weekday, respectively. The outcome variable &#x0201c;TV viewing&#x0201d; included watching all TV programs and films (also DVD) on a TV or on a computer&#x0201d;. Computer/console&#x0201d; use was defined as playing games on a computer, games console or mobile phone and using the Internet for leisure activities such as chatting, e-mailing, surfing, and Facebook.</p><p>Average TV and computer/console time per day was calculated by multiplication of the number of days per week and screen time per day in hours divided by 7.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Parental measures (demographics, family-related factors)</title><p>In the parent questionnaire, demographics, self-reported levels of screen time and other family-related factors associated with screen time were assessed.</p><p>Age, weight, height, sex, and educational level of both parents were asked in the parent questionnaire. Educational level was categorised as &#x02018;none of the parents had education for 14&#x000a0;years or more&#x02019; and &#x02018;one or both parents had education for 14&#x000a0;years or more&#x02019;&#x02009;, which approximately distinguishes between families with at least one parent or caregiver with medium-level vocational training or higher education and families in which both parents were lower educated.</p><p>Questions about screen time on the parental questionnaire were similar to those in the child questionnaire; screen use was assessed by frequency questions referring to a usual day.</p><p>The following family factors (i.e., the hypothesized mediators) were assessed in the parental questionnaire: availability of screens, strictness/permissiveness, monitoring, rules, avoiding being a negative role model, physical activity and sport behaviour of parent, and active family trips. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the exact formulations of the family-related questionnaire items and their psychometric characteristics. The items were based on and informed by the Pro Children and ENDORSE parent questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The items had a five-point answering format. Exploratory factor analyses showed that some items could be collapsed into the following subscales: &#x02018;strictness related to screen time&#x02019;&#x02009;, and &#x02018;active family trips&#x02019; (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

The item of TV time in the child questionnaire had a good test-retest reliability (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.68) and construct validity (0.70), and the computer item had a moderate test-retest (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.54) but a weak construct validity (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28). More information can be found in Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Concerning the family factors related to screen time, all items showed good to excellent test-retest reliability as indicated by ICCs&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.66. Construct validity was moderate to excellent for all items except one, as indicated by ICCs&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.51. More information can be found in Singh et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Additionally, a test-retest reliability study was conducted on the UP4FUN child and parent questionnaires. A convenience sample of six schools was selected in autumn 2011: one school in Belgium, four schools in Hungary and one school in Norway, including 143 pupils and 105 parents. The test-retest reliability showed good values for the items included in this paper (ICCs ranged from 0.51 to 0.80) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Preliminary descriptive analyses of sample characteristics were conducted using SPSS (version 21). A complete cases design was used for conducting the analyses for both behaviours. Only children who had valid measurements for TV and computer time at both pre- and post-test, respectively, and whose parents completed the questionnaire at pre- and post-test were included.</p><p>Residualised change scores of screen behaviours (TV and computer/game console time) were computed by regressing screen time scores at post-test onto screen time scores at pre-test. The resulting residualised scores can be interpreted as the change in screen time between pre- and post-test, adjusted for pre-test scores. Similarly, residual change scores of the family-related items were calculated. The residuals were checked for normality and were considered acceptable.</p><p>Multilevel linear regression analyses (2-level: children within schools) were conducted using MLwiN version 2.22 to provide answers to the three research questions. To assess mediating effects, the product-of-coefficient test of MacKinnon was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The first step in the mediation analyses was to investigate the intervention effect on the outcome variable (c-path). However, the main effect of the intervention on both screen behaviours (TV and PC/console use) was already described by Vik et al. (unpublished data). The second step was to estimate the effect of the intervention on changes in the potential mediator (Action theory test: a coefficient). The third step was to estimate 1) the independent association of changes in the potential mediator and changes in the outcome controlling for the effect of the intervention (Conceptual theory test: b coefficient); and 2) the effect of the intervention on changes in the outcome variable controlling for changes in the potential mediator (c&#x02019;-path). To represent the mediated effect, the product of the two coefficients (a coefficient*b coefficient), was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The statistical significance of the mediated effect was estimated by dividing the product-of-coefficient (a*b) by its standard error. For the calculation of the standard error the Sobel test was used (SE<sub>ab</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0221a;(a<sup>2</sup>*SE<sub>b</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;+&#x02009;b<sup>2</sup>*SE<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup>). Significance was set at the p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 level. All analyses were adjusted for the children&#x02019;s age, children&#x02019;s gender, parents&#x02019; years of education and country, as these constructs were significantly associated with the outcome variables. Additionally, the need for country-specific mediation analyses was checked by examining the moderating role of country on the intervention effects. In models with the different family-related variables and TV and computer/game console time used separately as the outcomes, a test for interaction between country of residence and the intervention was conducted. However, no country-specific analyses were conducted as country was not a significant moderator of the intervention effect on screen time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample characteristics</title><p>In total, 3325 children and 2945 parents completed the pre-test questionnaire in the five countries, from which 1949 and 1940 children and parents, respectively, had valid data for both the pre and post-test measurements of TV and computer/game console time and family factors.

This result was because the intervention had no significant effect on these family factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The six-week UP4FUN pilot intervention is one of the first interventions aimed at reducing and breaking up sitting time in children both at school and home through a school-based and family-focused prevention programme. The present study explored if changes in the family factors mediated the UP4FUN intervention effects on TV and computer/console time in 10- to 12-year-olds in Europe.</p><p>Notwithstanding the systematic and careful development based on theory, explorative research using stakeholders, and earlier experimental evidence, the UP4FUN intervention did not result in significant changes in the screen time of the children (unpublished data). Additionally, the present study has observed that no intervention effects were found on the family-related factors (i.e., the hypothesised mediators). This failure of intervention effects on the family factors may have several causes. First, this study was a pilot test of only six weeks with the main aim to test the feasibility of the intervention. Second, the family intervention may not have been adequately implemented in the intervention schools. Based on the process evaluation results, the family component did not reach a substantial number of parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Third, the insignificance of the intervention might be due to the family intervention components and/or strategies not being appealing/motivating, effective or extensive enough to change family-related factors despite the strategies being based on focus group research with parents of 10- to 12-year-olds conducted as part of the ENERGY-project. This qualitative study assessed parents&#x02019; perspectives about parental participation in school-based obesity prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, these focus groups also indicated that involving and motivating parents is difficult, so even if an intervention is able to reach the parents, they are not always eager to participate actively. The preliminary process evaluation supported this hypothesis, as not all parents read the newsletters despite receiving them, and few parents participated in the family fun event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. More experimental research is needed to find effective strategies to target the home environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A fourth explanation for the non-significance of the action theory could be that measures of the family-related factors were not sensitive enough to measure change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Despite the lack of an intervention effect on screen time and the family-related factors, significant associations of changes in family factors and changes in children&#x02019;s screen time were found. Changes in four family-related factors (parental modeling, monitoring, strictness, availability of TVs and game consoles) were significantly associated with changes in both children&#x02019;s TV and computer/game console time, which indicated their importance as potential determinants of children&#x02019;s screen time. These results support earlier findings that indicate associations between greater screen time in children and greater parental screen-related behaviours, more sedentary opportunities at home (e.g., number of TVs, computers, games), and less rules/restrictions related to screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, our study adds longitudinal evidence to these associations and consequently affirms that changes in the family factors and home environment are indeed important for reducing screen time in school-aged children. Future interventions focusing on reducing screen time should therefore include effective strategies targeting these factors. Whereas school-based interventions appear to be the default choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], we may need to reconsider and explore better ways to include parents and target the home environment. The recent community-based interventions aiming to improve energy balance-related behaviours and reduce obesity risk in children may be a way forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, this is one of the first sedentary behaviour intervention studies that intervenes both at school and home, as well as one of the first examining family factors as mediators of a school-based, family-focused sedentary behaviour intervention in children. Moreover, in contrast to earlier studies focusing on associations between family-related factors and screen behaviours (e.g., mainly TV viewing), a large range of family-related factors were investigated for both TV viewing and computer/game console use separately. Therefore, this study also adds to the current literature information concerning relations between the home environment and children&#x02019;s screen time. Another strength of this study was the large sample of children and parents from multiple European countries that participated in the pre- and post-test assessing sedentary behaviours and their determinants.</p><p>A few limitations of the study need to be mentioned as well. First, screen time and family-related factors were based on self-report and therefore might be answered to in a socially desirable way. Moreover, to limit the burden on the participants, single items to measure the family-related factors were used which could increase measurement error. Nevertheless, the included measures showed good test-retest reliability. Second, because convenience samples of schools in the participating countries were recruited, study results of the pilot intervention study cannot be generalised. Another limitation is the unequal distribution in the participation of mothers and fathers in the UP4FUN study. Only a small amount of participating parents were fathers. Earlier studies underline the limited available paternal data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Additionally, given the low child&#x02013;parent agreement in reporting health behaviours and their determinants, the inclusion of both parents of a family - if feasible - may increase the measurement quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The UP4FUN pilot intervention was not effective in reducing screen time in children or in changing family-related factors. Nevertheless, significant associations were found between changes in almost all TV-specific family-related factors and half of the computer/console-specific family-related factors and changes in children&#x02019;s TV and computer/console use. These findings imply that future screen time interventions should aim strongly at parental practices and the home environment.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial registration</title><p>The study is registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN34562078">ISRCTN34562078</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn/">http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>EB, MMvS, IDB, NL, YM, EK, MJMC, JB, LM were involved in developing the design of this study.
