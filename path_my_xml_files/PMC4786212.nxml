If a surgeon was assigned to perform a vitrectomy for the management of complex retinal detachment after a surgical break of at least 60 hours it was randomly decided whether a warmup training on the simulator was required (n = 9) or not (n = 12). Performance at the simulator was measured using the built-in scoring metrics. The surgical performance was determined by two blinded observers who analyzed the video-recorded interventions. One of them repeated the analysis to check for intra-observer consistency. The surgical performance of the interventions with and without simulator training was compared.

Patients&#x02019; records were pseudonymized and de-identified prior to statistical analysis.</p><p>In the preparation stage of the test, four participating surgeons performed several identical simulator courses within a two-week period. In the course of the paper, these surgeons are referred to as &#x0201c;user NN&#x0201d; with NN representing years of practice. The preparation stage was designed to make the participants familiar with the specific properties of the simulated environment.</p><p>During the study, the simulator software version 2.7.6 (release date: 24th of October 2011) was used. The simulator was equipped with a widefield viewing system and a vitreoretinal forceps handpiece.</p><p>In the surgery stage, we looked at PPVs for management of complex retinal detachment cases [<xref rid="pone.0150690.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] performed by surgeons after a break from work of at least 60 hours.</p><p>After assigning a case to the best-suited surgeon for the surgery at hand, a starting point was determined with a simple 1:1 randomization scheme: either the surgeon went to the operating room immediately or he performed the simulator training courseware (duration: approximately 20 minutes) prior to going to the operating room. All surgical interventions were video-recorded and subsequently analyzed by two &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; observers (surgical vitreoretinal experience of more than 20 respectively more than 5 years). The more experienced observer graded the videos twice to allow a discussion of intraobserver consistency.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Simulator courseware</title><p>The simulator training comprised an abstract bimanual task, two peelings (non-dominant and dominant hand) and a simulated retinal detachment surgery.</p><p>The following tasks were used:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Bimanual Scissors Training Level 2 &#x02013;Trains precise, simultaneous, asynchronuous instrument movements (aspirator, scissors) close to the retina.</p></list-item><list-item><p>ILM Peeling Level 5 &#x02013;Advanced task with a slightly stained, brittle membrane, i.e. frequent regrasping is necessary.</p></list-item><list-item><p>ILM Peeling Level 5 &#x02013;In this second ILM task with similar tissue properties, the peeling must be done with the non-dominant hand.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Retinal Detachment Level 1 &#x02013;Rhegmatogenous detachment with a horseshoe tear in the temporal periphery of a right eye, i.e. for some steps, a left-handed, nasal access is required.</p></list-item></list><p>All tasks were selected to match the nature of the real surgery&#x02013;demanding vitreoretinal, bimanual PVR surgery. We specifically added an abstract task for bimanual skills training because, to our experience, the deliberate practice [<xref rid="pone.0150690.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] of an isolated skill enables even experienced surgeons to raise their established performance level in this particular skill.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Simulator scoring metrics</title><p>The simulator score is composed of numerous parameters. Each parameter has a specific point range that indicates its maximal influence. The total score is calculated by adding the score of all target parameters and subtracting the faults. The targets add up to 100 points whereas the sum of all faults can be higher. If so, the resulting score is cut off at zero points. Adding the fault scores instead of taking the average has been implemented in the simulator in analogy to the real situation: a surgical performance that is unsatisfying under multiple aspects adds up to an even worse situation. This is important in a training setup where predefined performance levels must be reached.

Note that there are differences: some GRASIS categories are not used at all (e.g. &#x0201c;Preoperative planning&#x0201c;, &#x0201c;Surgical professionalism&#x0201c;). They apply to a surgical novice rather than to a practicing surgeon.

The total score is calculated by averaging over all parameters. Therefore the GRASIS categories do not contribute with equal weight. While this reflects the importance of a category in our setup quite well, it also represents a distortion of the GRASIS metrics.

id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether and to what extent a warmup on the surgical simulator Eyesi is efficient in preparing the surgeon for an upcoming intervention. In addition it was investigated whether the performance parameters of the warmup training have predictive power regarding the outcome of the subsequent surgery.</p><p>VR to OR studies are still the exception because trials are difficult to carry out from an ethical standpoint. In our study design we chose the best surgeon available for a given maneuver. After making this choice, the surgeon was randomly assigned to either go straight to the operating room or to warm up at the simulator prior to the surgery.</p><p>Of all studies on Eyesi evaluating the role of training in either the anterior or the posterior eye segment, to our knowledge, there is none that investigates the warmup effect of simulator training.</p><p>Regarding the second part of the study, only Gill et al [<xref rid="pone.0150690.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] used a similar setup and investigated the relationship between simulator performance and surgical performance. However they concentrated on beginners in cataract surgery whereas we focused on the advanced and expert vitreoretinal surgeon.</p><p>Despite the limited data set and the large variation of conditions (four surgeons, treating different pathologies, 21 samples), a statistically significant effect of warmup training on the surgical performance was found as well as a significant relation between performance on the simulator and in the operating room.</p><p>The average performance level of all surgeons was increased by the warmup training. Surprisingly, we found that even the most experienced surgeons benefit from warmup training.</p><p>However, the short training does not have an impact onto the variability of the performance level. We presume that a considerably longer training would be necessary to bring less experienced surgeons to a level of higher reliability that persists longer than the warmup effect that we observed: a 20 minutes warm up module cannot compensate for a lack of systematic training.</p><p>The performance values that were taken as the basis for the statistical evaluation were obtained by measuring numerous different parameters and either calculating a weighted sum (for the simulator score), or taking their average (for the video analysis of real surgery).</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Parameter analysis</title><p>The analysis of individual parameters or groups of parameters allows further insight into the training behavior and the relationship between simulation and real surgery. The ability to map an individual training detail to the corresponding surgical pattern is important for the design of individual simulator courses for training and warmup. In the following, we will discuss the relevance of our primary target parameters (ILM peeling, reattached retina, removed tractive tissue), of iatrogenic damages and, as an example of a parameter that can be measured much easier in simulation than in a video analysis, of the speed of instrument movements.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Injuries</title><p>Eyesi reacts extremely sensitively to undesirable injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150690.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This is intentional, since avoiding iatrogenic damage of all kinds was considered to positively affect the &#x0201c;over all&#x0201d; surgical performance. As we can see in this study, this is of utmost importance for those in the earlier stages of their surgical education, as they have a higher rate of iatrogenic failures compared to more experienced surgeons.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>ILM peeling</title><p>ILM peeling seems to be a fairly standardized procedure. All surgeons peel around 44&#x02013;50% ILM between the vessel arcades. However, there are significant differences in regard to the peeling quality and the percentage of injuries caused during the peeling. Some curiosities are worth to be mentioned: an increasing level of experience in vitreoretinal surgery might affect the surgeon&#x02019;s decision to choose training elements they perceive as most needed (this was confirmed by the expert surgeon, who explained why he had not finished the ILM peel in Eyesi: &#x0201c;I shortened the Eyesi training module because I know that once the beginning of a peel works well the rest will flow smoothly anyway&#x0201d;). The expert tends to overrule the simulator&#x02018;s operation procedure by making use of individually composed training steps. While this might call into question the measurability of expert performance, at the same time it constitutes a training value in itself, as the artificial environment makes it possible to isolate relevant training steps, thus increasing learning curves and the efficiency of the training (deliberate practice).</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Reattached retina</title><p>Both in the simulator and in the real surgery, intraoperative reattachment of the retina could be achieved in 100% of the performed tasks. Therefore this parameter is not suitable for a discriminative analysis of warmup effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Removed tractive tissue</title><p>For a standardized treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with PVR activity, the removal of tissue around retinal tears has been identified as one important surgical step in our hospital. Therefore it was also integrated into the simulated surgery and is the third target criterium in our setup. Working on a tear in the periphery with the appropriate configuration of the surgical machine is a delicate part of the surgery. We see a relationship between the performance at the simulator and in the operating room&#x02013;with one exception: user 05, who performed well in real surgery, but not on the same level in the simulator.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Instrument movements</title><p>By comparing the score in the operating room and the instrument speed while managing a retinal detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150690.g004">Fig 4</xref>), we noticed that more expertise correlates with slower movements and less &#x0201c;action&#x0201d; in the vitreous cavity. This seems to be a bit of a surprise first&#x02013;but is easily explained by the fact that during the vitreoretinal education, every surgeon is told over and over that the slower and more precise she or he moves the instruments, the more efficiently and ultimately faster the procedure will be finished. Eyesi records all movements, classifies them as necessary or unnecessary and scores them with the &#x0201c;odometry&#x0201d; measurement.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150690.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows two exceptional situations (at 1.4/3 and 1.58/3.4): two &#x0201c;non-expert-surgeons&#x0201d; faced two different situations which Eyesi had not prepared them for: the first one was a perfluorocarbon-to-air-to-silicon-oil exchange which was not available in the simulation at that time. The second situation was an inappropriate set of instruments (highly myopic eye, instrument too short) which did not allow an adequate peeling of the ILM as planned, resulting in repeated time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful approaches (readjusting the microscope, changing dominant and non-dominant hand, etc.).</p><p>While the perfluorocarbon-to-air-to-silicon-oil exchange has been added meanwhile, the simulator is not yet able to provide situations with myopic eyes where the right strategies to shorten the actual length of the eye can be trained.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Strength and limitations of this paper</title><p>This paper presents true VR-to-OR data about training of several vitreoretinal surgeons with different surgical expertise. This could not be found in literature up to now. Due to ethics considerations (&#x0201c;choose the most suitable surgeon first&#x0201d;), we did not know beforehand which surgeon had to perform how many interventions. In combination with the &#x0201c;weekend situation&#x0201d;, this resulted in a limited number of cases (n = 21). The simple randomization scheme that we used led to one surgeon performing real surgery after warmup only.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our mixed model approach showed significant results. For future studies with a similar setup, we suggest to replace the simple randomization scheme by a block randomization with fixed A/B sequences (example: 5 surgeons with 3 A/B sequences, resulting in 30 cases). Although this would prolongate the data acquisition, it would guarantee an equal distribution that ultimately results in a higher statistical power. Note that this design resembles an N-of-1 trial series, especially with regard to basic design considerations, such as randomization and carryover effects [<xref rid="pone.0150690.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Since this kind of study has not been published before, it is difficult to find a rating system in literature we can refer to: There is limited possibility of comparison between the global rating assessment GRASIS which focusses on surgeons in their early stage of education and the assessment adjusted for this study which looks atthe performance of surgeons in their early and later stages of education including experts. It seems to be an advantage that in this study different skill levels were covered and less experienced surgeons as well as advanced surgeons and experts were included into the data pool.Further questions have to be addressed and answered in consecutive studies. We chose a break of 60 hours to reflect a weekend situation. How do longer or shorter breaks affect the observed drop in performance? Are surgeons in average more (or less) confident after they used the simulator? Does the level of confidence correlate with the measurable skill performance? Could the observed relation between simulator and surgical performance be used to define a threshold for entering the operating room? Should a specific courseware be designed for experts which allow them to choose between different roads and adjust the training to the individual needs under variable conditions, such as different time intervals between surgical interventions, anticipated complications, different stress levels etc.</p><p>And finally: what clinically relevant simulations must be added to increase the efficiency of a simulator-based warmup and performance measurement?</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150690.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Scoring parameters that all simulated tasks have in common.</title><p>Since the targets are task-specific, the table only shows faults and the neutral parameter &#x0201c;Odometer&#x0201d; that measures the travelled distance of the instruments tips.
