Although the potential for malnutrition in people with kidney disease is well recognized, blood levels of most vitamins and trace elements are rarely measured. Instead, many North Americans with severe kidney disease are routinely prescribed a &#x0201c;renal vitamin&#x0201d; which contains a mixture of B and C vitamins.</p><p>Recent evidence indicates that people with kidney failure are often deficient in zinc and selenium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Potential benefits of zinc supplementation relevant to dialysis patients include improved immune function, taste sensitivity (perhaps reducing dietary sodium intake), and appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Potential benefits of selenium supplementation include reduced risk of vascular disease and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although vitamin E supplements reduced serious cardiovascular morbidity in a randomized controlled trial of people with kidney failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], this treatment is not routinely used in dialysis patients. Thus supplementation of zinc, selenium, and vitamin E may benefit patients with kidney failure. Since patients with kidney failure already take many medications, it is logical to combine any new nutritional supplements with the existing standard renal vitamin to reduce pill burden. However, zinc and selenium may be toxic in large doses or when accumulated over time. Therefore, the optimal dose of zinc and selenium is unknown for people with kidney failure, in whom renal excretion of these elements is impaired or absent.</p><p>We did a randomized trial in hemodialysis patients evaluating a novel nutritional supplement consisting of zinc, selenium and vitamin E added to the contents of the standard renal supplement (B and C vitamins). We compared two doses of the new supplement with the standard supplement with respect to serum concentrations in hemodialysis patients over 180&#x000a0;days of supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the Northern and Southern Alberta Renal Programs (from November 2012 to June 2013, from dialysis wards in Edmonton, Calgary and Red Deer, Alberta. Written informed consent was obtained. The Universities of Alberta and Calgary research ethics boards approved the study. This trial is reported according to the CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Adults (&#x02265;18 y) stable on thrice weekly hemodialysis for 3 to 36&#x000a0;months receiving Replavite (WN Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Coquitlam, BC, Canada) or an equivalent renal vitamin at baseline were eligible for inclusion. Patients who were allergic to or intolerant of zinc, selenium, vitamin E, Replavite or corn starch were excluded from the trial. We excluded pregnant patients or patients planning a pregnancy, scheduled kidney transplantation or gastrointestinal surgery, anticipating a switch in dialysis modality, or estimated life expectancy &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;months. We also excluded patients with an ostomy/short gut syndrome, participants in another clinical trial, patients with head and neck cancer diagnosed in the past 5&#x000a0;years (given theoretical risks associated with selenium supplementation in this population), and those taking zinc, selenium, or vitamin E supplementation at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions: the standard renal vitamin formulation (biotin 300 mcg, folic acid 1&#x000a0;mg, niacinamide 20&#x000a0;mg, thiamine 1.5&#x000a0;mg, cyanocobalamin 6 mcg, riboflavin 1.7&#x000a0;mg, pyridoxine 10&#x000a0;mg, ascorbic acid 100&#x000a0;mg; control), the standard formulation compounded with vitamin E (250&#x000a0;IU) and low doses of zinc (25&#x000a0;mg) and selenium (50 mcg), or the standard formulation compounded with vitamin E (250&#x000a0;IU) and medium doses of zinc (50&#x000a0;mg) and selenium (75 mcg) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The appearance (size, colour, and capsule) and taste of the 3 vitamin compounds were exactly the same. Doses were selected to minimize the risk of toxicity in the setting of kidney failure and incorporated information on the maximum recommended dietary intake for healthy people (zinc: 40&#x000a0;mg/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; selenium 400 mcg/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) as well as prior studies in this population.</p><p>Zinc 25&#x000a0;mg and selenium 50 mcg daily (low dose formulation) are standard doses for supplementation in the general population, and similar or higher doses have been used in previous studies of hemodialysis patients without evidence of toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The higher doses of zinc 50&#x000a0;mg and selenium 75 mcg daily contained in the medium dose formulation may be more suitable for dialysis populations. We did not study high dose supplementation with zinc or selenium (doses &#x02265;75&#x000a0;mg or &#x02265;100 mcg respectively).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Predialysis serum zinc and selenium concentrations were measured at 90 and 180&#x000a0;days (or at early withdrawal) following the baseline visit. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants in the combined medium and low dose groups who have low zinc status at 90&#x000a0;days (&#x0003c;815 ug/L; low zinc status) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], compared to the standard vitamin group. The proportions of participants with low zinc status at 180&#x000a0;days, and with low selenium status (&#x0003c;121 ug/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] at 90 and 180&#x000a0;days were also compared between groups as secondary outcomes.</p><p>Other secondary outcomes included serum levels of zinc and selenium, inter-dialytic weight gain and salt sensitivity (recognition and detection thresholds using SALSAVE [Advantech Toyo Co; Tokyo, Japan] test strips). We also collected data on serious adverse events (death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, persistent and significant disability) and non-serious adverse events potentially related to the trial interventions (self-reported tremor, colour and texture of fingernails, frequent vomiting [&#x0003e;3 per week], severe neutropenia [WBC &#x0003c;3.5x10<sup>9</sup>/L], severe anemia [Hb &#x0003c;60&#x000a0;g/L].) Because high (usually 150&#x02013;250&#x000a0;mg/d) doses of zinc can interfere with copper metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we also compared the proportion of patients in each group with low copper status [&#x0003c;1061 ug/L] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>Zinc, selenium and copper were measured using the Agilent 8800 ICP mass spectrometer with helium and oxygen as the reaction gases. The calibration range for Cu and Zn is 0.1-100ug/L, while that for Se is 0.01-10 mcg/L. In each batch of samples, calibrators and 2 sources of CRMs (Certified Reference Materials) were run prior to sample injections. The CRMs used in this analysis were Seronorm Trace Metals Serum Control Level 1 and 2 and Clinchek Trace Metals Serum Control Level 1 and 2. The CRMs were re-injected after every 10 samples and the results were accepted within 20% range of the target values. Observed CV% (within run-between run) ranged from 4.3-9.2% and 1.2-8.3% for zinc and selenium respectively. For each sample batch, some samples were randomly picked as duplicates. The difference in percentage between duplicates was calculated and the results were accepted if the difference was less than 15%. If this criterion was not met, the sample was repeated in a different run.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Covariates</title><p>We collected data on the following demographic variables: age, gender, and ethnicity (white or otherwise). Obesity (body mass index &#x02265;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and current smoking status were recorded as well as the following baseline comorbidities: cancer, coronary artery disease, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, seizure disorder and stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, active-control, 3-group, parallel trial that was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01473914). Participants were asked to take the intervention orally, once per day after dialysis or the same time of day as they would generally finish dialysis, for 180&#x000a0;days following the baseline visit. The intervention assignments were equally allocated between groups using randomly-generated permuted blocks of 6 and 9. The serially numbered identical bottles were pre-filled with the trial vitamin compounds using lists of intervention assignments, one generated for each renal program, and labelled with the trial name, the site name, and the site and participant number. The randomization lists were kept in a locked cabinet by the statistician who generated the lists. Participants, study coordinators and study investigators with the exception of the study statistician were kept unaware of the intervention assignments. Lab personnel who were involved in outcome ascertainment (serum concentrations) were also unaware of the therapy that participants had received.</p><p>Data were collected via participant interviews, chart reviews and clinical databases at baseline, 30, 90, 180&#x000a0;days (when the trial intervention was stopped), and 30&#x000a0;days following the discontinuation of the trial intervention. Medical history, medication use and demographics were ascertained at baseline. Pre-dialysis blood samples were taken by qualified dialysis unit personnel at day 90 and day 180 and stored in a &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C freezer at the Canadian Biosample Repository. The dialysis prescription, pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure and weight data collection, the salt sensitivity testing, the trial intervention compliance checked, and the serious and non-serious adverse event reviews were completed at each interview. Adverse event reviews were also completed 30&#x000a0;days following the discontinuation of the trial intervention. All adverse events were reviewed by the site investigators within 24&#x000a0;hours.</p><p>A sample size of 150 participants (approximately 50 participants per group) was chosen to provide 80% power (with a 5% type 1 error rate and a 30% loss to follow-up) to detect a relative reduction in low zinc status of 33% (or an absolute reduction from 90% to 60%) between the combined medium and low dose groups and the standard vitamin group. No interim analyses were planned due to the short duration of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were completed in Stata/MP 13.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stata.com">www.stata.com</ext-link>). The primary analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach. In sensitivity analyses, missing outcome data were imputed using a last-value carried forward approach. Per protocol results were also generated. Baseline descriptive statistics were reported as counts and percentages, or medians and inter-quartile ranges, as appropriate.</p><p>For continuous outcome data, we used mixed regression models where participant was modelled as a random intercept, and intervention, time, the interaction between intervention and time, renal program (NARP, SARP) and baseline value were modelled as fixed effects. For inter-dialytic weight gain where there was a maximum of 9 time points (3 dialysis runs at 30, 90 and 180&#x000a0;days on intervention), residuals within the participant were modelled using an exponential covariance-variance matrix. The exponential covariance-variance matrix allows for non-equidistances between consecutive time points; the matrix has two parameters: a shared variance and a correlation which would be raised to the difference between any two time points. For dichotomous outcomes (e.g., low element status) we used simple <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests. In sensitivity analyses, we used generalized linear mixed models (with a logistic link and the binomial family) and adjusted for intervention, time, their interaction, renal program and the baseline low element status. Means with 95% confidence intervals were reported, or counts and percentages, where appropriate. The means were adjusted for dialysis unit location and the relevant mean baseline value. P &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants</title><p>Six hundred and four hemodialysis patients were screened for inclusion in the trial; 454 were excluded (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Results with the medium dose supplement (50&#x000a0;mg of zinc and 75 mcg of selenium) increased serum levels of zinc and selenium. Supplementation with zinc and selenium did not enhance salt recognition or sensitivity, although there were non-significant trends to improvement when the medium dose supplement was considered. There was no evidence that supplementation increased the risk of adverse effects.</p><p>Most previous studies of zinc supplementation in hemodialysis patients predominantly used doses of 50&#x000a0;mg/d, which safely increased zinc levels and (in one study) salt sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other studies used higher doses, zinc 100&#x000a0;mg/d, apparently without adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There are fewer studies of selenium supplementation in dialysis populations, but 200 and 300 mcg/d were both used in short-term studies of hemodialysis patients, without an increased risk of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We chose relatively low doses of zinc and selenium because we were concerned about the risk of toxicity. However, our results suggest that higher doses of oral supplementation may be required to correct low zinc and selenium status in hemodialysis patients.</p><p>Because of a previous RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] suggesting that vitamin E supplementation prevented cardiovascular events in hemodialysis patients, we included 250&#x000a0;IU of tocopherol in the two active treatments. We would have preferred to use a higher dose of vitamin E, but this was not possible without an unacceptable increase in capsule size. Unfortunately, we cannot determine whether the lack of benefit of study drug on cardiovascular outcomes was due to low statistical power or an inadequate dose of tocopherol -- or because vitamin E supplementation does not prevent cardiovascular events in hemodialysis populations.</p><p>Why did we not observe improved serum concentrations of zinc or selenium? First, hemodialysis might remove unbound trace elements such as zinc and selenium from blood, meaning that higher maintenance doses would be required. Second, gastrointestinal absorption might be compromised in the presence of kidney failure, especially in the setting of nausea and vomiting (which is more common in dialysis patients than in the general population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Third, the severe dietary restrictions and frequent anorexia associated with kidney failure might lead to very low dietary trace element intake &#x02013; meaning that unusually high doses are required to overcome deficiency. Fourth, although there is no <italic>a priori</italic> reason that co-administration with vitamins B, C and E should reduce absorption, it is possible that the combination therapy we studied somehow reduced bioavailability of zinc and selenium compared to monotherapy. Fifth, failure to take the supplements as requested is a possible explanation for the lower-than-expected effects on zinc and selenium status. Adherence in our study was 83% as assessed by capsule count but true adherence may have been lower. Finally, our study was powered primarily to detect an effect of treatment for the two supplement groups combined as compared with control. Our results are compatible with a small but still potentially beneficial effect of supplementation with medium dose zinc and selenium on serum levels &#x02013; and suggest that higher doses warrant future study.</p><p>Our study has important strengths that should be considered when interpreting its results. First, it was a randomized, double-blind study that was done with minimal risk of bias. Second, all serum trace element assays were done using batched samples (to avoid assay drift) at a single reference laboratory. The laboratory followed rigorous quality assurance protocols reducing the potential for measurement error. However, our study also has some limitations. First, it was relatively small (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;150) and used two active treatment arms, which likely reduced statistical power for comparisons of treatment vs placebo. Second, although it is one of the longest studies of trace element supplementation ever done in a kidney failure population, a longer study would be required to conclusively assess safety. In addition to reducing the frequency of low zinc and/or selenium levels, a future study demonstrating benefits for patient-important outcomes would be required to inform clinical practice. Third, assessment of zinc and selenium status is complex, and potentially affected by nutritional status as well as shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although blood levels are considered acceptable measures of zinc and selenium status, the precise level that represents biological deficiency is not known for the general population or for dialysis patients. We did not evaluate biomarkers of zinc status such as serum metallothionein activity or plasma levels of glutathione peroxidase. Fourth, and most important, the doses of supplementation used were relatively conservative, which may have reduced the likelihood of showing a beneficial effect on trace element status in this population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we found no convincing evidence that supplementation with low or medium doses of zinc and selenium corrected abnormal trace element status in hemodialysis patients. Future studies of oral trace element supplementation should compare higher doses of zinc (&#x02265;75&#x000a0;mg/d) and higher doses of selenium (&#x02265;100 mcg/d) with control. If these higher doses are also insufficient to correct low blood levels of zinc and selenium, consideration of parenteral supplementation may be worthwhile.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12882_2015_42_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Trial intervention formulations. </p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MT conceived the study.
