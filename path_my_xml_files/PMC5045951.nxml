characterized by physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms such as bloating, mastalgia,
insomnia, fatigue, mood swings, irritability, and depression, that consistently occur during
the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; disappearing within a few days of the onset of
menstruation.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p> Although evidence for a hormonal abnormality has not been established, the symptoms of the
premenopausal disorders are related to ovarian hormones. The progesterone metabolites may
bind to a neurosteroid binding site on the membrane of the neurotransmitters.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p> Prevalence of PMS is difficult to establish because of its variable clinical
manifestations and interpretations. Nevertheless, a general consensus based on the
questionnaire data is that 80%-95% of the female population admit to recurrent premenstrual
symptoms, of which 5% suffer from symptoms severe enough to disrupt their lives.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p> Since the symptoms are diverse, there is a wide array of the theories proposed and the
approaches offered to manage PMS. The milder cases that constitute the major group may
respond well to non-pharmacological approaches like counseling, stress management,
complementary approaches like acupuncture, relaxation techniques, yoga, and consumption of
micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, zinc etc. On the other hand, some cases can only be
managed by drugs like serotonergic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors are the agents that constitute well-established, highly effective and first-line
pharmacologic therapy.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p> Stress appears to be one of the accepted causes of premenstrual syndrome. Thus, stress
relaxation techniques like yoga can be of reasonable value. Properly performed yogasanas are
associated with not only relaxation of the related muscles as shown by EMG changes, but also
are associated with relaxation of mind and body by increasing parasympathetic activity.
Regular elicitation of relaxation response results in decreased norepinephrine sensitivity
and hence decrease in PMS symptoms like irritability and anxiety.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> Literature states that women with mild to moderate luteal phase symptomatology have some
underlying calcium dysregulation<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>with a
secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> There is evidence that this calcium deficiency is unmasked with the rise
in ovarian steroid hormone levels during the menstrual cycle.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p> Medical Undergraduates are heavily burdened by their packed curriculum. The females, in
addition, suffer from affective or somatic premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms that
adversely affect their quality of life. The present study was thus, proposed to attenuate
the symptoms of PMS by practicing yoga and oral calcium administration in medical
undergraduates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This qusi-experimental study was conducted on 78 young female medical students of age
group 18-22 years from JLN Medical College, Ajmer and Rajasthan, India. In each batch of 100
medical undergraduates, there were around 30-35 girls. Amongst all the girls, 78 volunteered
for the study.</p><p> We selected healthy females with a menstrual cycle ranging from 21-35 days and not varying
more than 4 days. The females having a past or present history of some psychiatric illness,
prolonged medication, chronic backaches or usage of oral contraceptives were excluded from
the study.</p><p> Sixty-five females out of 78 volunteers were recruited for the study. To sensitize them to
the study, they were given a lecture on the physiology of normal menstrual cycle; the
hormonal and endocrinal changes during different phases of the menstrual cycle and
premenstrual syndrome.</p><p> All the subjects were required to record the number of symptoms, along with their
severity, in a predesigned, validated questionnaire, prospectively for two consecutive
menstrual cycles. The questionnaire was designed on the diagnostic criteria for the
diagnosis of PMS given by American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG).
Symptoms must appear in three consecutive menstrual cycles:</p><p> The questionnaire included a list of somatic symptoms such as breast tenderness, abdominal
bloating, headache and swelling of extremities. The affective symptoms listed were
depression, angry outbursts, irritability, anxiety, confusion, and social
withdrawal.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p> The presence of at least one somatic and one affective listed symptoms occurring from five
days before the menstrual phase and relieving within 4 days of the onset of menstruation
were the diagnostic criteria of PMS. The severity of the symptoms was assessed by
self-rating, the number of days of discomfort &#x00026; whether any medication was taken for
relief of the symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p> Fifty-eight subjects were found to have PMS. After recording weight, pulse, BP, they were
divided into three groups. One group of 20 girls who volunteered for yoga, constituted yoga
group; another group of 20 chose to take oral tablets of calcium carbonate. Rest 18, who
showed their unwillingness for yoga or oral calcium administration, served as controls.</p><p> The yoga group underwent yoga training, one hour daily, five days a week for a period of
three months under the supervision of an expert and trained instructor. The plan was
tailored by a yoga instructor of the institute. It was a general yoga plan for all age
groups; not specific only for PMS group. The schedule included &#x0201c;OM&#x0201d;&#x0200f;) is a mantra or
vibration coming from Hinduism and&#x000a0;yoga chanting&#x0200f; &#x0200f;(; various yogasanas in standing, sitting
and lying down positions; pranayama and bhramari gunjan. The session was concluded with
Shavasana.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p> Twenty girls that constituted the calcium group, were given 500 mg of calcium carbonate
orally, for a period of 3 months. The students were made to take calcium tablets in front of
the researcher, to ensure adherence to the dosage.</p><p> The control group of 18 subjects was neither given yoga training, nor oral calcium. After
3 months, the assessment of the symptoms &#x00026; severity of PMS was again done by the same
questionnaire.</p><p> We received the approval from the institutional ethical committee of JLN Medical College,
Ajmer for conducting the study. This study was done as a part of MD Physiology Thesis. We
were supposed to present our work before a committee of members and were asked to make
amendments, if any, during that time.</p><p> The study was hence conducted and thesis approved by permission of the members of the
instituteAlso, a written informed consent was taken from all the participants, after clearly
explaining them the purpose of the study.</p><p> Flowchart of the study showed as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="jcs-5-179-g001"/><statement><p>Flowchart of the study </p></statement></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> Fifty eight medical undergraduates with a mean age of 19.4 (1.07) years participated in
the study. The mean weight of control group was 51.2 kg at the beginning which declined to
51 kg at the end of the study (P&#x0003e;0.05). In calcium group, the mean weight was 53.9 kg and
52 kg at the commencement and completion of the study, respectively (P&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p> The yoga group showed a maximal decline in weight from mean weight of 48.8 kg at the start
and 46.6 kg at the end of three months of yoga training (P&#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p> The effect of interventions on the pulse rate of all the three groups is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The result showed that both systolic and
diastolic BP in all the three groups was not significantly different (P &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p> The number of symptoms in yoga ranged from 3-12 prior to the commencement of the study
that declined to 1-7 after yoga training (P&#x0003c;0.05). Eighteen out of 20 (90%) subjects also
reported a decrease in the severity of the existing symptoms (P&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p> Eleven out of 20 subjects (55%) in calcium group showed a decline in the severity of
symptoms. The number of symptoms declined from a mean value of 5.3 at the beginning of the
study to 4.3 at the end of intervention (P&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p> In the control group, there was no significant changes in the number and severity of
symptoms. 38.89% of subjects showed a decrease in the symptoms, while the severity increased
in 33% (P&#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p> The mean number of PMS symptoms in different groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p> On comparing the effects of the yoga and calcium groups, a Kruskal-Wallis test showed that
there was a statistically significant decrease in PMS symptoms between these groups
(&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 10.654,&#x000a0;P&#x000a0;= 0.004).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p> The premenstrual syndrome is a physioclinical entity, afflicting a large segment of the
female population of reproductive age group, severely hampering their lifestyle and
efficiencies.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p> The precise etiology of this multifactorial, psychoneuroendocrinal disorder remains
unclear but lifestyle, nutrition, and general health considerations seem to be important
issues in the management of menstrual symptoms. Severe intensity of symptoms is seen
associated with young age or students, lower education, unemployment, smoking, sedentary
work, poor health, stress, and dysmenorrhea.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>In the present study, a significant reduction in weight in calcium group
(P&#x0003c;0.05) and yoga group was seen. A decrease in water retention and weight was seen in
women fed high calcium diet in a study.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
Yoga is known to reduce weight by burning calories, boosting metabolism and also by
improving thyroid functions.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The effect of interventions on mean pulse rate (per min) of three groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center; border-style: solid none none none; border-width: 1px" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

A decline
in heart rate after yogic exercises was reported by Telles et al.,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>Literature states that there occurs a decrease in noradrenergic
receptor sensitivity by yoga.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p> &#x0200f; There was no significant change in the BP in none of the three groups. Probably our
samples was a group of healthy young females whom none of them had hypertension.</p><p> However, we found a highly significant reduction in the number of symptoms of PMS in the
yoga group. Prior studies have reported that relaxation techniques like 61-PR which is a
type of hatha yoga reduces the stress among women with PMS.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Wu et al., performed a study to evaluate the efficacy of yoga
in PMS. It was revealed that the alpha brain wave percentage was higher immediately after
yoga exercise in the PMS group. This suggests that the participants felt more relaxed or
were in a more peaceful mental condition after yoga exercise.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p> To evaluate the strength of evidence for treatments for premenstrual syndrome, Sue Douglas
performed an advanced MEDLINE search from January 1990 to December 2001.</p><p> The Cochrane Library and personal contacts were also used. The author concluded that
calcium carbonate should be recommended as first-line therapy for women with
mild-to-moderate PMS.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> There is evidence
that a daily intake of 1,000 mg of calcium in women with premenstrual syndrome have
decreased 61% of their physical and 62% of psychiatric symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> There is scientific evidence supporting cyclic fluctuations of
calcium and vitamin D during the menstrual cycle that may help explain some features of PMS
like depression, anxiety and the dysphoric states.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Calcium and vitamin D may influence the development of PMS through their
relationship to endogenous estrogens. Calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D levels
have been observed to fluctuate across the menstrual cycle in response to changes in
estradiol at ovulation and during the luteal phase in several studies.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Buchanan et al., concluded that endogenous
estrogen elevation promotes the formation of 1,25 (OH) 2D from 25 (OH) D and that it may
reciprocally inhibit synthesis of 24,25 (OH) 2D. Thus, Calcium supplementation is a highly
effective method to relieve symptoms of PMS.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p> At the end of the study, students, motivated &#x00026; encouraged with the results of
intervention. They stated that they will include yoga or calcium as a lifestyle measure
regularly. However, we didn&#x02019;t follow the participants regarding adherence to this
change.</p><p> The limitations of the present study are its small sample size and non-randomized
allocation of the participants to various groups.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> According to the result, yoga offers a natural and effective way to alleviate PMS symptoms
and serves as an alternative to painkillers and hormonal supplements.</p><p> Besides stress reduction, it also provides a moderate degree of exercise or toning to the
body and hence can be adopted as a healthy lifestyle adjunct. Calcium is also relatively
inexpensive, simple, safe, and effective approach to alleviate the symptoms of PMS and is
also important in preventing osteoporosis. Since the decrease in number and severity of
symptoms was more in yoga than calcium group, yoga seems to be more effective than calcium
supplementation in relieving PMS symptoms.</p><p> Physical distress is known to cause absenteeism from work, hence, it would be reasonable
to state that if a girl is free from her monthly distress, her well-being and work
efficiency would increase. Thus encouraging a regular practice of yoga or taking a tablet of
calcium daily in the medical schools can improve psychological well-being and work
efficiency of students. </p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> The author would like to appreciate the contribution of all the students who participated
