Cancer-related distress may be ameliorated by comprehensive preparation for treatment and addressing women&#x02019;s informational, physical, psychological and psychosexual needs. This paper describes the protocol for a multisite randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing a novel intervention package which combines tailored specialist nursing consultations and telephone peer support with the primary aim to reduce psychological distress. Secondary aims assess patient quality of life, symptom distress, unmet supportive care needs, preparation for treatment, psychosexual functioning and vaginal stenosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This multifaceted intervention comprises four nurse-led consultations coupled with four phone calls from a peer support volunteer (GC survivor). The evidence-based intervention will be delivered at critical points in the illness trajectory: pre-treatment, mid-treatment, treatment completion and post-treatment. Nurses and peers undergo 2-day intensive training workshops, are guided by comprehensive study intervention manuals and receive ongoing supervision and support. Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of GC, be scheduled to receive curative radiotherapy, be aged 18 years or over and speak English. Three-hundred and six participants will be randomized to receive usual care or usual care with the intervention package. Study outcome measures will be collected at baseline, day 1 of radiotherapy and 1, 6 and 12 months post radiotherapy. Clinical assessments of vaginal toxicity will occur at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months post radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This timely research has the potential to substantially reduce the physical, psychosexual and supportive care needs of women with GC. Using a telephone peer support model, the intervention package ensures equitable access to support services for geographically isolated patients. The novel intervention engages peer volunteers who liaise with nurses to encourage adherence to professionally-delivered information and provide emotional support. It has been designed to be potentially transferable to a range of treatment settings and diseases. Based on pilot data, the proposed intervention was found to be useful and acceptable to patients and clinicians. If effective and feasible in the multisite RCT, the program could be widely disseminated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12611000744954</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Peer support</kwd><kwd>Nurse</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>Gynaecological cancer</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Distress</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Psychosexual function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Physical and psychological burden of disease</title><p>Gynaecological cancers (GC) account for 19% of all female cancers worldwide
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and in addition to the psychological implications of living with cancer, women with GC experience significant psychosexual and psychosocial issues unique to their diagnosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A common treatment for GC is radiotherapy, which can cause many distressing side effects that have both immediate and late impacts on quality of life (QoL)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These side effects include diarrhoea
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], abdominal cramps
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], bladder dysfunction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], menopause, infertility
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and sexual dysfunction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Women may also experience vaginal side effects including stenosis, atrophy, agglutination, reduced genital sensation, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and postcoital bleeding
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As these side effects involve intimate and private aspects of bodily function their presence also has a major impact on close relationships and social functioning.</p><p>Not surprisingly, upwards of 40% of GC patients report chronic and distressing sexual difficulties
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which may continue over the 12 months post treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. GC diagnosis also commonly impacts upon a woman&#x02019;s self-esteem, body image, femininity and intimate relationships
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Yet up to half of GC patients report not having any discussions with their clinicians about post-treatment sexual adjustment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], which represents a concerning gap in the provision of healthcare.</p><p>In addition to the physical impact, over half of patients with cancer feel anxious prior to treatment and about 40% remain anxious at treatment completion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. High anxiety has been associated with poorer sexual functioning
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], worse QoL up to 1 year post treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and lower social support among women with GC
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, anxiety levels may be ameliorated by both comprehensive preparation for treatment and addressing needs during treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>A Cochrane review published in 2008 recommends women use a vaginal dilator and/or engage in regular sexual intercourse
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] to minimise vaginal stenosis and agglutination after pelvic radiotherapy for GC. Patient adherence to such strategies is associated with less physical damage and greater sexual satisfaction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and allows adequate pelvic examination to detect cancer recurrence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, adherence is suboptimal
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, a more recent Cochrane review generated debate over the appropriate use of dilators by concluding that there was insufficient data to recommend routine use
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While recommended practice varies across treatment centres
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], current practice guidelines internationally advocate the use of a vaginal dilator for women receiving pelvic radiotherapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Innovative, evidence-based model of supportive care</title><p>Given the physical and psychological impact of GC, there is a high need to provide appropriate and timely interventions to women with these cancers. An evidence-based intervention combining nurse-led consultations with peer telephone support has the potential to address these needs.</p><p>Level 1 evidence shows that providing sensory and procedural information, and addressing patients&#x02019; fears about surgery results in less pain, distress and fewer days in hospital
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Only two studies have applied these principles to the radiotherapy context; one found provision of sensory and procedural information about radiotherapy resulted in reduced anxiety
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; the other, a RCT involving taped procedural and coping information, resulted in increased perceived knowledge and self-efficacy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This high level evidence has been incorporated into the study design as a radiotherapy area tour.</p><p>A systematic review showed that there are effective, evidence-based self-care strategies for side effects common to several cancer treatments such as fatigue, diarrhoea and infertility
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, involving patients with chronic disease in their disease management results in improved self-reported health and lower psychological distress, less health system use and reduced health costs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is therefore likely that women treated for GC with radiotherapy would benefit from a coordinated provision of individualised, evidence-based interventions and resources to optimise their recovery.</p><p>Nurse-led consultations and telephone interventions for cancer patients have been shown to be appropriate and effective
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Of interest, health professional delivery of tailored information to women with GC about side effects and effective self-care has been linked to better coping with side effects; compliance with post-radiation rehabilitation; less fear about sexual intercourse and less relationship disruption
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, evidence from a RCT shows that nurse coordinated multidisciplinary and community referrals result in better symptom control for cancer patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Aranda and colleagues have recently demonstrated that a nurse-led pre-chemotherapy educational consultation was effective in reducing pre-treatment anxiety amongst those experiencing moderate to high anxiety at baseline
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As such, individualised and targeted nursing consultations with provision of evidence-based self-care strategies are an integral component of the intervention design.</p><p>Multidisciplinary care (MDC) refers to a team approach to healthcare delivery that involves input from all relevant medical, nursing and allied health areas. MDC has been linked to a number of improvements in disease outcomes, including survival benefits and better QoL, lower distress, decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in healthcare costs, improved staff satisfaction and improved knowledge of patient care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. No studies testing a system to facilitate MDC for women with GC have been identified. Effective referral requires that clinicians have excellent communication skills to elicit and respond to patient emotional and information cues. A systematic review showed that communication skills training programs improve clinicians&#x02019; skills and confidence in psychological assessment and interviewing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The intervention includes training of study nurses to facilitate appropriate, timely and effective MDC referrals.</p><p>In addition to nursing interventions, models of psychosocial cancer care have identified a pivotal role for peer-support programs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The unique perspective of a peer facilitates sharing and practical, social and emotional coping
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A systematic review of cancer peer-support programs indicated high satisfaction and perceived psychosocial benefits among participants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Some patients even prefer peer-delivered over professionally-delivered support
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Telephone models of peer support have additional economic and logistic advantages, and are successful in reaching housebound or geographically isolated patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Despite widespread use and positive participant perceptions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], only two RCTs testing one-to-one telephone peer support have been identified in the cancer literature
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Rudy and colleagues found that perceived social support was higher among melanoma patients receiving telephone peer support
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The second study reported no significant difference in newly diagnosed GC patient&#x02019;s emotional distress with peer telephone support, however the sample size was small (<italic>n</italic>=32)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. No RCTs investigating peer-support interventions from treatment initiation to post-treatment completion were identified
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and none have been found that combine tailored nurse consultations with telephone peer support.</p><p>This study will evaluate the effect of an innovative, nurse-led intervention combined with telephone-based peer support to provide evidence-based information and resources, coaching in self-care, multidisciplinary referrals and psychological support to optimise the recovery of women treated for GC with radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Study aims</title><p>The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention package to reduce psychological distress for women receiving radiotherapy with curative intent for GC.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], so women will be encouraged to bring a significant other to the consultation. Given that anxiety related to treatment is typically highest just prior to starting treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and based on Level I evidence on treatment preparation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] each patient will be given a brief tour of the treatment unit followed by a private consultation. The nurse will first ascertain the patient&#x02019;s understanding of their situation and clarify misconceptions. A radiotherapy question prompt sheet developed from the literature and with consumer and professional input will be administered by the nurse and at the first three sessions to guide tailoring of the intervention. The patient identifies her top three concerns for focus in the session, with further concerns addressed at future sessions. The prompt sheet also assesses global distress using the Distress Thermometer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Anxious patients will be trained to use the strategy of controlled breathing with positive self-talk, an effective self-care activity to reduce treatment-related anxiety
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The prompt sheet will aid a discussion of the woman&#x02019;s supportive care needs and possible MDC referrals. The nurse will discuss vaginal health, psychosexual rehabilitation, and if appropriate, menopause and infertility. Coaching and rehearsal of self-care for side effects and stress-reduction will be offered, and tailored fact-sheets and information provided which can improve recall
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. At the end of each session the nurse arranges a time for a call with the peer volunteer.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], this session addresses side effects and coaching in self-care strategies. The woman will be provided with lubricants, informed about and shown how to use the dilator and perform pelvic floor exercises. The timing of commencing dilator use will be according to local hospital policy. In addition, the nurse will assess the patient&#x02019;s experience of treatment, normalise fears and ask about the call with her peer. The nurse will address any ongoing issues from the first session and new concerns and provide coaching in relevant self-care.

The shortcomings of previous peer support studies, particularly regarding inadequate reporting of peer recruitment, training and support, will be overcome through a rigorous multistage selection and training process, the provision of ongoing training, supervision and debriefing by an experienced cancer nurse, and provision of a detailed intervention manual
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Peers will be past GC patients identified by clinical staff at participating centres and sent an invitation letter about the program. Peers must be over 18 years old, speak English and be at least 2 years post treatment. Those with cancer recurrence or a history of major psychiatric illness are ineligible. Experts in assessing peer volunteers for phone-based cancer peer-support programs will conduct screening phone interviews with interested peers. Suitable women attend a 2-day workshop. The workshop learning objectives are to: (1) gain an understanding of the project including privacy and confidentiality; (2) develop skills in active listening and providing empathy; and (3) reinforce self-care strategies recommended by the nurse. In subsequent weeks, they complete practice calls with an actor-patient to apply these skills, and feedback is provided by a communication skills expert.</p></sec><sec><title>Peer intervention sessions</title><p>The peer will contact the patient 1 week after each nurse consultation except for the last session when the peer calls the patient 4 weeks post treatment. The nurse will call the peer after their consultation with the patient, and send a check-list of the patient&#x02019;s concerns and the individualised self-care plan. Using a structured format, the peer&#x02019;s role will be to:</p><p>(1) Provide psychosocial support to the patient: Using open questions, empathy and active listening, the peer will establish rapport with the patient, hear her story and experiences and normalize the woman&#x02019;s emotional reaction.</p><p>(2) Encourage adherence to the recommended self-care strategies: The peer will be trained to reinforce information and coaching on basic self-care strategies recommended by the nurse, including problem solving difficulties. For more complex problems or additional needs, the peer will encourage the patient to contact the nurse or access additional sources of information and support, such as the Cancer Council Helpline. If the peer has concerns about the patient, she will contact the nurse and discuss them.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The treatment effect is conservatively estimated to result in group differences of 0.35 standard deviations for continuous outcome measures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. With the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score (HADS-T) as the primary outcome, to achieve &#x02265;80% power at a 5% significance level, the required sample size in each arm is 130 at the 12-month follow-up.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Usual care practice will be monitored yearly with a questionnaire administered to nurses most involved with the usual care of women with GC receiving radiotherapy at each site. A consecutive sample will be randomly allocated at the central site by computer with a weighted-biased coin method 1:1 to either intervention or usual care arms. Participants will be stratified according to treating hospital and treatment type. Minimisation will be used to balance the randomisation across the strata.</p><p>Participants will not be informed of their allocation until the baseline questionnaire has been received. Blinding of patients and providers to experimental arm cannot be achieved with this study design, however outcome assessment will be by self-reported questionnaire, thereby obviating the need for researcher blinding. Usual care arm participants will receive a booklet on their specific cancer diagnosis, treatment, and psychosexual recovery to meet minimal ethical standards
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and information will be provided as per usual practice by their treatment team. Reasons for attrition will be recorded and recruitment and dropout bias assessed.</p><p>All nurse and peer sessions will be audio-taped and a random sample of 15% of sessions will be assessed for adherence to protocol. Length of sessions will be reported. The first five calls or consultations made by each peer and nurse will be reviewed and feedback provided on adherence to protocol, use of communication and coaching skills and areas for improvement.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Patients will complete self-report, pen and paper measures.

Drawing on best available evidence the standardised intervention is designed to be patient-centred, promote adherence to self-care, provide co-ordinated care including timely multidisciplinary team referrals, and increase access to supportive care for women who are sick or living in a remote setting, via the telephone. This novel program is innovative in several ways. First, it systematically engages peers over the treatment trajectory which is likely to reduce nursing time. Second, peers are linked in with the health professional team to encourage adherence to professionally-delivered information. Third, phone contact is adopted post-treatment completion to support those geographically or medically isolated. Finally, Level 1 evidence on preparing patients for threatening medical procedures is applied to the radiotherapy context.</p><p>We will employ a methodologically rigorous design, incorporating comprehensive selection, training, and monitoring of peers and nurses to ensure the intervention is feasible in a real-world clinical setting. Should this intervention be successful and widely disseminated, it has the potential to reduce the physical, psychosexual, and supportive care needs of women with GC. Additionally, meeting patients&#x02019; psychological and supportive care needs could have economic benefits as psychological morbidity can result in greater healthcare use
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. In this new era which recognises consumers have an essential role in healthcare planning and delivery, the proposed research program has the potential to transform healthcare practices on an international level.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient recruitment is open.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PS and IJ conceptualised and designed the study.
