This study aims to determine whether a low-fructose and/or low-sucrose diet supervised by a physician or nurse decreases IR compared to a standard diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This field trial is located at primary care centers. The participants are adults aged 29 to 66&#x000a0;years, with a Body mass Index (BMI) between 29 and 40.99&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and without diabetes. To date, 245 participants have been assigned randomly to the low-fructose diet intervention group (LFDI) at health centers in the western health service zone of Tenerife island, and 245 to the standard-diet control group (SDC) at health centers in the eastern health service zone. Recruitment is opportunistic and is carried out by physicians and nurses at participating health centers. Initially (baseline), and after 24&#x000a0;weeks of intervention, dietary records, physical activity, waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations (HOMA2-IR) and lipid profile are recorded; blood glucose and insulin and lipid profile are also recorded 2&#x000a0;h after a 75-g glucose overload. After 48&#x000a0;weeks (24&#x000a0;weeks after the intervention), fasting blood samples are again obtained and a physical examination is performed. All tests and measures are repeated and recorded except dietary records, physical activity and oral glucose overload. Low-fructose diets are designed by calculating free and total (free&#x02009;+&#x02009;fructose associated with sucrose) fructose contents in standard diets, and removing foods with a fructose content in the highest quartile for the amounts in the standard diet.</p><p id="Par3">Participants in both groups are prescribed a diet that contains 30 to 40% less than the participant&#x02019;s energy requirements. The primary endpoint is change in HOMA2-IR between baseline and week 24, and other outcomes are change in HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides , waist circumference to height ratio and BMI. The secondary endpoint is change in HOMA2-IR between week 24 and week 48 together with the outcomes noted above. Comparisons between groups for variables used to indicate IR levels are done with a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test for unpaired variables or the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test if the distribution is not normal. Multivariate regression models will be used to control for confounding factors not accounted for in the study design, and for independent prognostic factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">If the dietary intervention being tested, i.e., a diet low in fructose/sucrose, is able to reduce IR, the results &#x02013; if translated into regular clinical practice &#x02013; could provide a hitherto unavailable tool to prevent type-2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ISRCTN, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN41579277?q=&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=5&#x00026;totalResults=15144&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=100&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN41579277</ext-link>.

The influence of suboptimal dietary habits in the appearance of obesity has led many researchers to study the hypothetical role of fructose. One systematic review failed to find support for an effect of fructose on increases in body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the short follow-up period for most participants, for a mean of 4&#x000a0;weeks in trials with an isocaloric diet and 1.5&#x000a0;weeks in those with a hypercaloric diet, was a major source of uncertainty according to the authors of this review. Other sources of uncertainty noted were heterogeneity among groups of participants (13 trials involved patients with diabetes, 7 involved patients with overweight or obesity, and 21 involved patients with normal body weight), the low number of participants in many trials (13 included 10 participants or fewer, 12 included 11 to 25, and only 5 included more than 25 participants), and the sensitivity to imputations in crossover trials. Nevertheless, the association between excess lipid storage as manifested by obesity and insulin resistance (IR) has long been recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Insulin resistance is a metabolic situation characterized by a decrease in the physiological response of peripheral tissues to the action of insulin for cell nutrition and the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. This indicator is strongly predictive of type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The role of fructose in the development of IR in the liver is controversial. This monosaccharide is present especially in fruit, and has become a widely used additive in many food industry products such as soft drinks and nonalcoholic beverages, generally in the form of fructose-enriched corn syrup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, most frequently consumed manufactured food products contain sucrose as an additive; this disaccharide consists of equal proportions of fructose and glucose.</p><p id="Par19">Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of fructose versus glucose consumption on the appearance of IR. One mechanism is related to the liver metabolism of each monosaccharide. Excessive fructose consumption increases de-novo lipogenesis and can lead to dyslipidemia, increased visceral fat, overweight and obesity. Glucose metabolism in the liver may limit the production of substrates characteristic of de-novo lipogenesis since this is regulated by phosphofructokinase which is inhibited by ATP and citrate under conditions of energy intake above the individual&#x02019;s requirements. However, fructose is metabolized in the liver via fructokinase in a manner independent of energy status, and so lacks the limiting control mechanism that operates for glucose. A consequence is that the consumption of large amounts of fructose does not halt de-novo lipogenesis; this, in turn, can increase the amount of hepatic fat and thus induce IR in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another proposed mechanism is related to the possible satiating effect of fructose. Consumption of this sugar stimulates insulin secretion which, in turn, leads to leptin release from adipocytes and the inhibition of ghrelin secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. These changes stimulate brain centers that regulate satiety and energy homeostasis. However, fructose consumption does not lead to acute stimulation of insulin secretion which would attenuate the stimulation of leptin secretion and ghrelin inhibition. These effects, in turn, influence the regulatory action of these hormones on energy balance in the central nervous system. In people who consume large amounts of fructose, the lower circulating levels of insulin and leptin together with increased ghrelin concentration may lead to increased calorie intake, thereby contributing to weight gain and obesity when high-fructose diets are consumed chronically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Page and colleagues showed that glucose but not fructose consumption reduced activation of the hypothalamus, insula and striatum &#x02013; brain regions that regulate appetite, motivation and reward processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Several recent epidemiological studies have suggested a plausible relationship between fructose consumption and IR. Thus far, interventions have been tested to increase and decrease fructose consumption. In two separate studies Aeberli and colleagues. found that even with moderate levels of fructose or sucrose consumption (40 and 80&#x000a0;g, respectively) compared to moderate glucose consumption (40&#x000a0;g), atherogenic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles were increased along with total and LDL-cholesterol, and IR in the liver. However, they found no differences in IR (HOMA2-IR), possibly because of the short duration of the study (3&#x000a0;weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Stanhope and colleagues also found increases in LDL-cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, postprandial triglycerides, cholesterol and remnant triglycerides, as well as small dense LDL-cholesterol, in persons who obtained 25% of their energy requirements from beverages sweetened with fructose-enriched corn syrup compared to persons who consumed a glucose-rich diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Maersk and colleagues studied 17 men and 30 women with overweight for a 6-month period to compare the influence of a sucrose-rich beverage (20% of total energy requirements) with three isocaloric diets (one with low-fat milk, one with aspartate as a beverage sweetener, and one with water). They found increases in visceral fat, liver and muscle triglycerides and elevated fasting plasma triglyceride levels. Interestingly, these effects were not accompanied by changes in body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Most trials designed to reduce fructose consumption have involved children and adolescents as frequent consumers of sugar-rich beverages. A controlled double-blind trial that enrolled children showed that a dietary education programs designed to reduce sugar and fructose consumption by substituting low-calorie sweetened beverages for sugar-containing beverages had beneficial effects on Body Mass Index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

In that study, calorie intake in terms of kcal/day was again higher in the control group than in the two intervention groups (nutrition education, and nutrition education plus strength training).

Patients in the low-fructose diet intervention group (LFDI) are assigned to health centers in the western zone of Tenerife island, and patients in the Canary Islands Health Service standard-diet control (SDC) group are assigned to the eastern zone of the island. This randomization system is used to prevent contamination bias. If patients randomized to both groups attended the same health center this source of bias would be difficult to avoid because many patients in the LFDI group are likely to have relatives or friends in the SDC group, and vice versa. Contamination could also occur between staff members at a given health center. Sixteen primary health centers are participating in this study; all of them belong to the same health care administration district (Gerencia de Atenci&#x000f3;n Primaria de Tenerife). Given that the total area of the island of Tenerife is relatively small, the characteristics of the population served by all health centers are assumed to be similar. The longest distance between participating health centers is 64&#x000a0;km. All centers and staff provide the same suite of services. The variations between centers in the catchment population assigned and the numbers of patients under each staff physician&#x02019;s and nurse&#x02019;s care are similar. We therefore do not anticipate between-group differences in the baseline data or systematic biases in the results of the care provided at different centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par32">Physicians and nurses recruited participants with an opportunistic method. To facilitate recruitment we designed a digital application for electronic medical records that make it possible to identify patients who could hypothetically be recruited on the basis of our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The first screen of the electronic medical record displays an alert indicating that the patient is potentially eligible for inclusion. The nurse or physician explains the nature and aims of the study to the patient, and if the patient expresses interest in taking part, the physician asks three questions about their motivation. If the patient answers &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to all three questions the nurse or physician asks them to sign the Informed Consent Form (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and then gives the patient a brief Information Pack that includes four pages of a food diary in which the patient is asked to record all foods and beverages consumed each day during a 4-day period that includes one weekend day or holiday. The Information Pack also includes a sheet with instructions on how to record foods and beverages in the food diary (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). On the day that the patient signs the Informed Consent Form, an appointment is scheduled to review the food diary and complete the Case Record Form (CRF). At this appointment the physician or nurse carefully reviews all four daily food diary sheets with each participant to ensure accuracy regarding the types, sizes and portions of each food and beverage. During this appointment the participant is interviewed about their physical activity and the information provided is entered by the physician or nurse into the Minnesota Leisure-time Physical Activity Questionnaire form. Body weight, height and waist circumference are recorded, and blood pressure is measured twice and recorded as the average of the two values. At the end of this appointment the participants is given an appointment for a blood test (week 0). The blood sample is provided after an overnight fast, and is used to measure plasma glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations (total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). At week 0 we also record thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) if TSH is altered, and urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio (to rule out relevant thyroid or kidney disease). All participants undergo an oral glucose overload test (75&#x000a0;g) to record blood insulin, glucose and lipids 2&#x000a0;h later. All participating health center staff are reminded to use the same equipment in each appointment to record blood pressure, weight and height. All devices are calibrated regularly by the Canary Islands Health Service. Nonstretchable measuring tape is used to record waist circumference by situating the tape halfway between the lower margin of the last rib and the iliac crest with the participant breathing normally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par33">All participants sign an Informed Consent Form.

Low-fructose diets are designed by calculating free and total (free&#x02009;+&#x02009;fructose associated with sucrose) fructose contents in standard diets. Foods with a fructose content in the highest quartile for the amounts corresponding to the standard diet are removed from the standard diet. The format and graphical appearance of the information about the participant&#x02019;s diet are identical in both groups. Physicians and nurses who prescribe the standard diets are unaware of which foods have been excluded from the low-fructose diets. To avoid contamination bias while recruitment is currently underway, the present report does not include information on the composition of the low-fructose diets.</p><p id="Par35">Nutrition counseling and reinforcement take place at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20. During this process we emphasize to participants the importance of involving in the intervention the person in the household who purchases and/or prepares food. At week 2, after the physician or nurse has reviewed the nutritional information, intervention via individualized nutrition counseling begins. At week 24 a second blood sample is obtained for analysis. Two weeks before week 24 the participants are given a new Information Pack containing the same materials as the initial Information Pack at the start of the study, with instructions on how to record foods and beverages consumed during 4&#x000a0;days (including one weekend day or holiday).

Participants are also asked about their physical activity at work. Physical activity is recorded for the week prior to the appointment and for the six previous months. If the participant reports physical activity equivalent to moderate or brisk walking for 150&#x000a0;min per week or more, they are encouraged to continue this level of activity. If less physical activity is reported, the participant in encouraged to devote 150&#x000a0;min per week to brisk walking.</p><p id="Par38">When the research team receives the four daily food diaries and information on physical activity from the physician or nurse, team members analyze the information to make general dietary recommendations, and advise the health center staff member on the kcal/day the participant&#x02019;s diet should contain, and on the type and amount of physical exercise to prescribe. To evaluate adherence to the prescribed diet, the physician or nurse is reminded to advise participants to record a 24-h recall of foods and beverages consumed at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20. The kcal/day in the prescribed diet are calculated as 30 or 40% less than the kcal/day of the participant&#x02019;s energy requirements for their ideal weight according to age, sex and physical activity. Ideal weight is calculated as the product of 25 multiplied by the square of height (measured in meters); physical activity is evaluated from information provided in the Minnesota Questionnaire, and participants are asked specifically about the nature of their employment. Members of the research team classify physical activity into four levels of intensity: mild, moderate, vigorous or very vigorous. Energy requirements in kcal/kg/day are calculated with the protocol for persons with obesity used by the Canary Islands Health Service (based on recommendations of Spanish Ministry of Health Guideline, 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). For men, the requirements are assumed to be 42, 46, 54 and 62&#x000a0;kcal/kg/day, respectively, for each of the four levels of intensity, and for women the requirements are assumed to be 36, 40, 47 and 55&#x000a0;kcal/kg/day. These figures for energy requirements are reduced by 5% for participants 45 to 49&#x000a0;years old, by 10% for those 50 to 59&#x000a0;years old, and by 20% for those aged 60&#x000a0;years or older. After energy intake equivalent to 30 to 40% less than the individual&#x02019;s energy requirements is calculated, the participant is advised to consume the diet that most closely approximates this figure (1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, 2500 or 2750&#x000a0;kcal/day). Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> provides an example of the standard 1750&#x000a0;kcal/day diet, how the energy requirements for the recommended diet are calculated and one example of the information provided by the researchers to participating physicians and nurses.</p><p id="Par39">On the basis of the available data for the Canary Islands&#x02019; population, we decided that the energy intake restriction should ideally represent approximately 35% of each participant&#x02019;s energy requirements.

Overall reductions in fructose/sucrose consumption are evaluated with no distinction between added sweeteners and sugar naturally present in foods. A diet low in foods with natural fructose content is prescribed for the intervention group, but participants in both groups are instructed to refrain from consuming foods with added sugar. This approach is used because it reflects the usual care offered at participating health centers, and in an effort to ensure comparable food intakes in kcal/day in both groups. To evaluate the difference in fructose intake our reference is the mean value from four daily food diary records from the end of the intervention period (week 24) compared to four daily food diary records at week 0. Although the evidence at present is insufficient to claim that four food diaries are sufficient to provide a reliable analysis of fructose or sucrose intakes, most studies that have estimated these intakes to date have used 24-h recall or (usually four) food diaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">At present, the amount of fructose intake that could be harmful to health is unknown. A trial such as this one, carried out in the primary care setting, should provide valuable information for future efforts to control IR. Because the restricted calorie diet prescribed for our participants is similar in both groups, we expect to see similar weight reductions in both. Our hypothesis is that under our trial conditions, the reduction in IR will be greater in the group with the low-fructose diet than in the SDC. Accordingly, if the dietary intervention being tested, i.e., a diet low in fructose/sucrose, is able to reduce IR, the results &#x02013; if translated into regular clinical practice &#x02013; could provide a hitherto unavailable tool to prevent type-2 DM.</p><p id="Par50">A potential limitation of this type of study is the likelihood that many participants will under-report some of their food intakes, as has been shown for persons with obesity.
