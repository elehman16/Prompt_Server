This study compares the effects of desflurane-based anesthetic regime with a toll iv technique utilizing propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam on outcomes in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. A number of studies done on patients undergoing cardiac surgery have used troponin I (cTnI) as a biomarker for myocardial injury.

Premedication consisting of intramuscular morphine in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg and intramuscular promethazine in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg was administered to all patients 30 min prior to shifting inside the operating room. All patients received general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation facilitated by iv rocuronium in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg; neuromuscular blockade was maintained using timed boluses of vecuronium titrated to effect throughout surgery. The depth of anesthesia was monitored using bispectral index (BIS) that was kept in a range of 40&#x02013;60 during the procedure. All patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen and following intubation subjected to volume-controlled mechanical ventilation with oxygen in the air (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.6) and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub> O targeted to an end-tidal carbon dioxide level of 30&#x02013;35 mmHg.</p><p>Patients in the TIVA group were administered a combination of midazolam-fentanyl-propofol along with neuromuscular blockade. Anesthetic induction in these patients was effected using fentanyl (5 &#x003bc;g/kg) followed by etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) given intravenously. Anesthesia was maintained using incremental doses of midazolam-fentanyl administered as needed to control hemodynamic responses to surgical stimulation. The boluses of midazolam (0.05 &#x003bc;g/kg) and fentanyl (2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;g/kg) were administered intravenously and also added to the venous reservoir of the CPB pump on an hourly basis. An iv infusion of propofol was started after intubation in a dose range of 75&#x02013;150 ug/kg/min for all patients in the TIVA group and titrated to mean arterial pressure (MAP) and BIS.</p><p>Induction of general anesthesia for patients in the desflurane-fentanyl group was done using iv administration of fentanyl (2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;g/kg) and etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) and maintained with desflurane (0.15&#x02013;1 MAC end-tidal) during the entire surgical procedure and with hourly boluses of fentanyl (1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg/) iv. Before initiation of CPB, heparin was administered into a central vein in a dosage of 400 U/kg, to maintain the kaolin-activated clotting time (ACT) above 400 s. The ACT was measured every 30 min during CPB, and after a reversal of heparin with protamine, Magnesium sulfate in the dose of 50 mg/kg was administered on CPB on aortic cross-clamp removal. After separation from CPB, protamine sulfate was infused in a dose of 1.3 mg/mg of heparin to antagonize the effects of heparin. An additional dose of protamine 0.2 mg/kg was added in cases where the ACT was than 130 s. All patients received 0.1 U/kg of platelet transfusion for hemostasis after separation from CPB.</p><p>Following surgery, the patients were transported to the cardiothoracic surgical ICU and managed by a separate team of intensivists. Adhering to a fast track protocol, standardized intensive care was implemented, and analgesia provided by iv fentanyl and paracetamol. Extubation was performed in hemodynamically stable patients after a period of gradual weaning from mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Surgery</title><p>A mid sternotomy approach for AVR performed under CPB, and cardioplegic arrest was used in all patients included in this study. The extracorporeal CPB circuit was primed with lactated ringer solution 20 ml/kg, sodium bicarbonate (7.5%) 1 ml/kg, mannitol (20%) 0.5 g/kg, and 100 U/kg of heparin. A membrane oxygenator was used to establish a nonpulsatile blood flow between 120 and 200 ml/kg/min in all patients. Del Nido cardioplegia administered in the aortic root and repeated as per institutional protocol. Patients were cooled to 32&#x000b0;C. Alpha-stat acid-base management was used in both groups. Perfusion pressure was maintained between 50 and 70 mmHg.

The length of ICU and hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were noted commencing from the time; the patient arrived in the ICU. The number of episodes of arrhythmias, attempts of cardioversion post-CPB, and hours of inotrope usage while under anesthesia and postoperatively for 24 h in the ICU was tabulated.</p><p>Blood samples were drawn from the central venous catheter immediately after induction of anesthesia (baseline, T1) and thereafter three and 6 h postaortic clamp removal (T2 and T3) to measure the levels of IMA.

There was no difference found in 30-day mortality, urine output, serum creatinine, incidence of arrhythmias, and need for cardioversion between both groups.

The mean HRs of patients in the desflurane group were higher post-CPB but did not attain statistical significance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The IMA and cTnI levels were not found to be significantly different between both the study groups [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>]. However, the post-CPB cTnI level was significantly higher than baseline in the TIVA group, showing a cardioprotective ischemia preconditioning effect of desflurane. This is similar as found by the authors in a similar study done on cyanotic pediatric patients undergoing modified Blalock-Taussig shunt surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Previously conducted trials and meta-analysis by other authors have focused on the myocardial protective effects of volatile anesthetics mainly in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>No studies are available that compare the effects of using desflurane versus TIVA in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery for AS. Among the studies published, several have compared the effects of sevoflurane and desflurane versus TIVA using propofol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A significant decrease in morbidity and mortality has been shown in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who received volatile anesthetics as compared to those that were managed with TIVA using propofol in these studies.</p><p>Among the earliest trials undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of volatile anesthetics in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft, sevoflurane was shown to preserve hemodynamics and better preserved the myocardium as demonstrated by lower postoperative troponin levels when compared with TIVA.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Several other trials have since then established the protective effects of volatile anesthetic agents on the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] A recently published large meta-analysis done by Landoni <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that the cardioprotective effects of sevoflurane and desflurane resulted in decreased perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Sevoflurane and desflurane have both been reported to confer this cardioprotective effect.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In addition to the lower blood gas coefficient that effects quick equilibration of alveolar-arterial concentration, desflurane is devoid of toxic metabolites such as fluorides that cause renal damage.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Thus, desflurane may retain a theoretical advantage in the fast tracking of patients that undergo prolonged duration of anesthesia. This coupled with possibly even a greater degree of cardioprotection than sevoflurane could; therefore, confer an advantage on the use of desflurane as anesthetic agent for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p><p>Studies have shown that there is evidence that desflurane confers myocardial protection in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The concern that desflurane causes sympathetically mediated tachycardia is allayed by the absence of such effects in a dose range of 0.15&#x02013;1.00 MAC that is used in this study. However, a higher degree of myocardial depression seen with desflurane may offset these advantages. Although desflurane is known to exert negative inotropic effects on the myocardium,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we found no difference was found in the duration of inotrope use in the two groups.</p><p>In patients undergoing mitral valve surgery with concomitant coronary artery disease, a marked decrease in postoperative cardiac troponin (cTNI) release has been demonstrated after preconditioning with desflurane.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In a study by Cromheecke <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] on a small group of 30 patients undergoing aortic valvular replacement, sevoflurane-based anesthesia reduced postoperative cTnI release, incidence of atrial fibrillation, and ICU stay as compared to a technique employing target controlled infusion with propofol.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, the evidence in favor of myocardial protective effects of volatile agents have been reported to be contradictory in a setting of noncoronary artery surgery. No clear advantage was found by Landoni <italic>et al</italic>. in using a preconditioning protocol with volatile anesthetics in patients undergoing coronary mitral surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In a study published by Kapoor Malhotra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] the effects of desflurane versus opioid anesthesia for cardiac shunt procedures in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease were compared. Inhalational anesthesia with desflurane was proven to reduce the duration of elective ventilation, decrease ICU, and hospital LOS but without a difference in perioperative morbidity or mortality. No hemodynamic instability was encountered, and there was no evidence that desflurane exerted a negative inotropic effect. A renal protective effect was also not clearly established in patients who received desflurane. The authors expressed the need to measure cardiac and renal biomarkers to establish the protective effects of desflurane so as to further objectify their findings.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study included a relatively small cohort of patients and did not rule out inter-observer bias as well as individual variations in surgical techniques between surgeons.

Although some benefit in terms of shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stays as well as cTnI levels were seen. There was no difference in the biomarkers level of IMA levels between the desflurane and TIVA groups. No difference in overall outcome could be clearly established between patients who received desflurane and those that were managed solely with iv anesthetic technique using midazolam-fentanyl-propofol. It is rather difficult to make a relatively pertinent conclusion with respect to the findings from any of the two individual groups as to which is superior in AS patient. The sample size is low in the individual groups. Further, prospective multi-centered investigations are required for evaluating the additional benefits of desflurane support in the sick AS patient.</p><p>A larger cohort of patients is needed to show the benefit of either in this at risk the population of AS patients undergoing AVR. Larger, multi-centric, and randomized controlled trials are needed to unequivocally establish as to which a better technique of the two anesthethetic regimes compared in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was undertaken at Center for Cardiovascular Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.
