Preventive analgesia consists of all perioperative efforts to decrease pain and minimize consumption of analgesics in the postoperative period. This seems to be the most effective means of decreasing postoperative pain, because surgical incision alone is not the only trigger for central sensitization. Other factors, such as preoperative pain and additional painful noxious intraoperative inputs such as retraction, as well as postoperative inflammatory processes, can all result in the development of an altered central processing of afferent input, which, in turn, is capable of amplifying subsequent postoperative nociceptive input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The emphasis of preventive analgesia is on the pathophysiologic phenomenon that should prevent altered sensory processing, and thus investigation of a preventive analgesic effect requires comparison of two groups of patients receiving identical treatments that had been started before and after surgery, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The concept of preventive analgesia was founded on experimental studies of pre-emptive analgesia in animal models of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pre-emptive analgesia is an intervention given before incision or surgery that it is more effective than the same treatment administered after incision or surgery. There are only a few investigations fundamentally designed for comparing the pre- versus postoperative administration in veterinary patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In humans, the pre-emptive epidural analgesia with opioids or local anesthetics induces consistent postoperative improvements, and the pre-emptive infiltration of wounds with local anesthetic improves analgesic consumption and time for the first rescue analgesic request [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also can improve some aspects of postoperative pain when given before surgery compared to the administration after surgery in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The NSAIDs inhibit peripheral and central prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces the inflammation that accompanies tissue injury, in addition to the attenuation of the response to noxious stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Vedaprofen is a NSAID that can control pain and inflammation associated with clinical and experimental musculoskeletal disorders in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is available as a palatable gel formulation, which has a rapid and almost complete absorption after oral administration in dogs. The oral route has a terminal half-live of the same order of magnitude of the intravenous administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but with the advantage that the oral route is less stressful to the animal and can be easily administered by the owner during postoperative home care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Vedaprofen is known to preferentially inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase-2 in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and it is apparently safe in this species, as there was a low incidence of gastrointestinal changes, like vomiting and diarrhea after a long-term treatment for 30&#x02013;56 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although vedaprofen has proved to be an effective analgesic for postoperative pain control in dogs, no studies have investigated if the sublingual preoperative administration has a superior analgesic effect over the administration after surgery on postoperative pain control in this species. Therefore, the aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, was to investigate whether sublingual vedaprofen given before was more effective than that given after surgery for decreasing postoperative pain intensity and analgesic consumption in dogs undergoing maxillectomy and mandibulectomy. Since the analgesic effect of sublingual vedaprofen was never assessed in dogs undergoing maxillectomy and mandibulectomy, we included a control group consisting of animals receiving ketoprofen, a NSAID known to provide adequate postoperative analgesia for this surgical procedure in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our hypothesis was that the preoperative administration of vedaprofen would reduce postoperative pain and analgesic requirements more than would vedaprofen or ketoprofen given after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences among groups in terms of the study population.

Regardless of the time of administration, vedaprofen given through the sublingual route was associated with low pain scores and was as effective as ketoprofen for controlling postoperative pain in dogs undergoing maxillectomy and mandibulectomy.</p><p>Vedaprofen was chosen in the present study based on pilot registers made up on the authors&#x02019; experience. The dosing was the one recommended by a pharmacokinetic study of vedaprofen in dogs, describing that absorption of vedaprofen is rapid and almost complete after oral administration, which is followed by a terminal half-live of the same order of magnitude of the intravenous administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the present study, the advantages of using the sublingual route were that one did not have to force the animal to swallow the medication and the absorption of the drug was ensured even in dogs that did not have a swallow reflex (unconscious anesthetized). Vomiting was not observed in the present study, but the sublingual route would be another advantage over the oral route in these cases. The sublingual route was proven to be effective on absorbing vedaprofen, because both pre- and postoperative strategies resulted in pain scores as low as with ketoprofen, a NSAID known to be effective for controlling postoperative pain in dogs undergoing maxillectomy and mandibulectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A group of dogs receiving ketoprofen was used as control due to ethical reasons, considering that the use of a placebo group is unfeasible in a study whose main objective is to find the best method to provide pain relief.</p><p>Among all analgesic agents used routinely, the NSAIDs are the less likely to block central sensitization resulting from surgery, since they primarily act peripherally by blocking the release of mediators that have been found to sensitize peripheral nociceptors, thus, leading to a reduction in inflammation and pain perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Even though, a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] found that dogs receiving carprofen, a NSAID, were awarded lower pain scores during the first postoperative hour than the group of dogs that received carprofen at the end of the surgery for a variety of orthopedic and soft tissue procedures. Therefore, one of the reasons for the lack of a preventive analgesic effect could be attributed to the fact that vedaprofen was administered in animals that were already experiencing some pain, considering the discomfort induced by the background disease that led to the indication for the surgical treatment. The crucial point in preventive analgesia strategies focuses in the administration of the analgesic before pain emerges, more than simply before surgical incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accordingly, a previous study found a preventive analgesic effect of carprofen in dogs with no background painful disease that were anesthetized for elective ovariohysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In another study, the authors did not find a preventive analgesic effect of carprofen in dogs with femoral or pelvic fractures, even though they had received the NSAID before surgical incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, a preventive effect could have been revealed beyond the period covered by vedaprofen after a single administration (24&#x000a0;hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This is because a study in human patients found that 86% of the patients who received preemptive epidural analgesia with opioids and local anesthetics were pain free at 9.5&#x000a0;weeks, in comparison with only 47% of the control patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This analgesic approach is more likely to block central sensitization because it is delivered directly into the epidural space. However, it was less likely to observe an improvement in pain control after long-term treatment with vedaprofen, considering that NSAIDs act reducing inflammation peripherally and, therefore, are expected to be more effective in the acute postoperative phase.</p><p>Another explanation for our findings could be attributed to the subjective judgment of pain scores. Since pain represents an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, a direct measurement of a subjective experience is challenging and imposes difficulties, especially when evaluating it with a single tool. Therefore, in order to minimize variations, pain was assessed using two scoring systems in the present study. In addition, objective evaluations, such as physiological data, and serum cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine were measured as indirect measurements of pain, in order to reduce the subjective nature of the pain scores. The stress caused by a painful stimulus can increase heart rate, MAP, f<sub>R</sub> and serum cortisol and catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, it is unlikely that the postoperative decrease in f<sub>R</sub> and temperature compared to baseline was a response to pain. In fact, these changes were found in all groups, suggesting they were attributed to the residual effects of isoflurane, rather than caused by differences in the NSAID used or in the time they were administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Less likely explanations could be the residual effects of acepromazine or an increased f<sub>R</sub> and temperature at baseline caused by fear and stress experienced prior to the pre-anesthetic medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The preoperative vedaprofen induced no significantly differences in the serum cortisol and catecholamine levels compared to the postoperative administration. In both groups, the norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations did not vary significantly throughout the study, which is in accordance with the other measurements. Nevertheless, both groups had increased cortisol and epinephrine levels at 30&#x000a0;minutes post-extubation compared to baseline. This was the only pain indicative in the present study and it was not in-line with the changes observed in pain scores and physiological variables. The cortisol levels, however, were similar to a previous study that found an effective pain control in dogs receiving tramadol, codeine, ketoprofen alone or in combination for the same type of oral orthopedic surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the changes on cortisol and epinephrine were attributed to a stress response that probably was not caused by pain. For instance, the stress caused by a different environment (e.g. veterinary hospital, cage) is capable of activating the pituitary-adrenal system in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Despite of the hormonal postoperative changes, the dogs had no other signs of pain. They all had good appetite and ate normally when they were offered food 5&#x000a0;hours after surgery, which supports the fact that the increase in cortisol and epinephrine levels was due to stress not induced by pain.</p><p>If the analgesic efficacy for the pre- over the postoperative administration was not proven advantageous, then the lack of information about the potential intraoperative adverse effects could preclude their preoperative use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One may choose to start the analgesic therapy with NSAIDs at the end of surgery in order to prevent a possible increase in bleeding time intra-operatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, since vedaprofen is known to be a preferential cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], it would be advantageous for causing less adverse effects than other conventional NSAIDs, allowing long-term treatment with low incidence of gastrointestinal and renal adverse effects or on increase in bleeding time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, controversial findings were reported on clinical studies in dogs. A multicenter clinical trial reported that mild and transient side effects, such as diarrhea, vomiting and loss of appetite, were observed in 11% and severe side effects, such as bloody diarrhea and/or repeated vomiting, were observed in 5% of dogs with musculoskeletal disorders receiving vedaprofen for 14&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another study described mild and transient side effects in 17.1% of the dogs and treatment had to be stopped in 6.7% of the dogs receiving vedaprofen for 56&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The incidence of these adverse effects was similar to that found with the meloxicam in both studies. In addition, in other species, such as horses, vedaprofen was found to be cyclo-oxygenase-1 selective in experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], although clinical studies in this species showed no such adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the present study, although data were not recorded during long-term treatment, adverse effects were not observed in any dog during surgery or within 24&#x000a0;hours of administration of vedaprofen.</p><p>Although the preventive analgesia concept supports the assumption that blocking central sensitization reduces overall pain perception and duration, it is not known, however, at which point is preventive intervention most important, if it is blocking the nociceptive input at surgery or blocking the postoperative pain resulting from surgery in the immediate postoperative period. A study in humans indicates that whether or not the nociceptive input of surgery was blocked through the administration of long acting local anesthesia, overall postoperative pain perception was the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, regardless of the timing of the vedaprofen administration, both pre- and postoperative strategies are ethically justified by their efficacy on pain relieve observed in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that vedaprofen had no preventive analgesic effect, since the preoperative administration had no advantages over the postoperative administration.

Thirty client-owned dogs undergoing maxillectomy or mandibulectomy for oral neoplasms removal were evaluated. The minimum sample size for paired data was calculated using power analysis and 10 dogs per group were required to have 95% chance (with 5% risk) to detect a difference of 2.5&#x000a0;mm in the pain score between groups and considering a standard deviation of 4&#x000a0;mm in the population. The study population of the PRE group consisted of 5 males and 5 females, comprising 4 mixed-breed dogs, 3 Poodles, 2 Cocker Spaniels and 1 Maltese.

In the Control group, there were 6 males and 4 females, which were 4 Poodles, 3 Cocker Spaniels, 2 mixed-breed dogs and 1 Bichon Frise. Animals were only included in the study if they had mandible or maxillary neoplasm confirmed by clinical examination and other evaluations, such as radiography, ultrasonography, tomography, cytology or histopathology; if they were scheduled for maxillectomy or mandibulectomy surgery in the morning period and; if no clinical cardiopulmonary, renal or hepatic abnormalities were detected after a complete physical examination, blood cell count and serum biochemical analysis were performed.

Anesthesia was induced with propofol (5&#x000a0;mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Propovan, Cristalia, Itapira, Brazil) administered slowly through the IV catheter. After orotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with an end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 1.6-1.8% (Isoforine, Cristalia, Brazil) vaporized in 100% oxygen via a semi-closed rebreathing circuit. A side-stream gas analyzer (Multinex Plus, Datascope, New York, USA) was connected between the endotracheal tube and the Y-piece to measure the end-tidal isoflurane concentration, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) and the f<sub>R</sub>. Animals were allowed to breath spontaneously, unless ETCO<sub>2</sub> was not adequate (35&#x02013;45&#x000a0;mmHg), in which case mechanical ventilation could be used. The need for mechanical ventilation, if any, was registered. Heart rate and rhythm, and NIBP were monitored with a multiparametric data collection system (Viridia-M3, Hewllet Packard, Germany).

Dogs included in the study were treated for as long as necessary, but data for the study were recorded only up to 24&#x000a0;hours after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Laboratory data</title><p>These data were measured in duplicate in the laboratory of the Faculty and were performed at baseline, and at 30&#x000a0;min, 6&#x000a0;h and 24&#x000a0;h after extubation. Venous blood samples of 1.5&#x000a0;mL were collected from the jugular catheter to measure cortisol and catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine) levels. Samples to measure cortisol were withdrawn in plastic syringes and transferred to glass tubes, which were then centrifuged at 1500&#x000a0;rpm for 10&#x000a0;minutes and frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for later analysis using commercial immunoassay kits (Autodelfia Cortisol Kit, Wallac, Finland). The detection limit for cortisol was 15&#x000a0;nmol.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with a 1.4% interassay coefficient of variation and a 3.1% intra-assay coefficient of variation. Blood samples to measure catecholamines were withdrawn using a specific anticoagulant (glutathion&#x02009;+&#x02009;ethylene glycol tetra acetic acid) and then immediately centrifuged at 3000&#x000a0;rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;minutes in a cold centrifuge (Model RT7, Sorvall, California, USA). Resulting serum were then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (Model 460, Waters, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil), according to the methodology described by Krstulovic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The intra-assay coefficients of variation for the measurement of catecholamines in venous plasma were 5.5% for both epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the inter-assay coefficients were 6.8% for norepinephrine and 7.9% for epinephrine. The limits of detection were 12.5&#x000a0;pg.mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for both epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The physiologic data were analyzed by parametric examination within groups and between groups by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements.
