However, sometimes, these encounters may lead to severe challenges. Today, families are involved in different types of conflicts and intense disputes leading to the distortion of the family as an institution in which the creation of healthy personalities is the main focus. Conflict can be defined as disagreement or incompatibility between people due to different objectives, perceptions, and interests [<bold><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></bold>]. Marital conflicts are kind of ongoing significant mismatches between married couples who are shown by at least one of them. &#x0201c;Significant&#x0201d; in this definition connotes the effects of the conflicts on married couples&#x02019; performance and &#x0201c;ongoing&#x0201d; signifies the conflicts, which will not disappear over time. Conflicting couples are disturbed by their partners&#x02019; habits and personality and normally have communication problems in different areas and difficulties in accepting each other&#x02019;s differences [<bold><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></bold>]. Couples in modern societies face several problems in establishing intimate relationships. It is obvious that deficiencies in the emotional quality of the marriage, along with several other factors, adversely affect the couple&#x02019;s lives. Deriving from the negative responses to the partner&#x02019;s differences, marital conflicts are invigorated when feelings of anger, hostility, revenge, hatred, and jealousy or verbal and physical abuses dominate the couples&#x02019; relationships [<bold><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></bold>]. Oliver and Miller [<bold><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></bold>] showed that many of the conflicting couples continue their marriage successfully because they believe that their marital problems are sexual, financial, or even due to their relatives&#x02019; interference while, the origin of their problems is actually the absence of healthy emotional behaviors. Marital confusion and conflicts may cause attachment problems for the couples and lead to reduced happiness, life satisfaction, and self-esteem; they also increase symptoms of psychological distress. It has also been confirmed that the biggest predictor of marital dissatisfaction and divorce is neither financial problems nor lack of sexual attraction or love but the method by which couples manage their marital conflicts in challenging situations [<bold><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></bold>].</p><p>Maladaptive emotion regulation can lead to creation or expansion of the conflicts. When people consistently suppress their emotions or react impulsively, they will experience more negative emotions, less positive emotions, relationship problems and reduced quality life [<bold><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></bold>]. Emotion regulation consists of all conscious and non-conscious strategies used to increase, maintain, or decrease emotional, behavioral, and cognitive components of an emotional response to a challenging situation [<bold><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></bold>]. It also refers to the ability to understand and express emotions appropriately [<bold><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></bold>]. Emotion regulation training means teaching techniques to control/ reduce negative emotions and increase/ use positive emotions. Regarding the importance of emotion regulation in relationships, the results have indicated that negative emotion regulation strategies can predict negative emotions and low satisfaction while positive emotion regulation strategies can predict less negative emotions in relationships [<bold><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></bold>]. Moreover, it has been specified that emotion regulation strategies are associated with reduced negative emotions and conflicts and focus on positive emotion regulation strategies can enhance people&#x02019;s understanding of emotion management in relationships [<bold><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></bold>]. Essentially, emotion regulation and its training have been considered important factors in the improvement of the couples&#x02019; relationships as well as their lives&#x02019; quality and satisfaction [<bold><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></bold>].</p><p>Based on previous studies, emotion regulation refers to the process by which people experience and express their emotions [<bold><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></bold>,<bold><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></bold>] Difficulties in emotion regulation may be due to lack of emotion regulation capability [<bold><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></bold>].</p><p>According to the emotion regulation model, emotion regulation is a unique process for the modification of emotional experiences in order to achieve social acceptance and be in an appropriate physical and emotional state to respond properly to both internal and external demands. Emotion regulation also refers to &#x0201c;regulation and adjustment&#x0201d; of emotional processes applied in adaptive performances; therefore, emotional irregularity refers to a process that ultimately disrupts adaptive performances [<bold><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></bold>]. In a study, Beck [<bold><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></bold>] found that control and regulation of emotions along with people&#x02019;s self-awareness of their emotions significantly enhance their marital relationships. In another study [<bold><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></bold>], it was found that people who had participated in emotion regulation group therapy sessions had a better control over their communication and mood swings.</p><p>One way to prevent behavioral and communicational problems is the improvement of the couples&#x02019; mental capacity that can be done through mindfulness training [<bold><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></bold>,<bold><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></bold>]. Mindfulness-based interventions are considered as one of the third-generation or third-wave cognitive-behavioral therapies. Mindfulness is a type of meditation rooted in Eastern rituals and wisdom, particularly the teachings of Buddha [<bold><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></bold>]. Mindfulness training can be introduced as a simple way to train the mind to be in a flexible and adaptive state [<bold><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></bold>]. For the first time, Linhan [<bold><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></bold>] put emphasis on the need to consider mindfulness as one of the essential components of psychotherapy. For an individual to be mindful, it is necessary to have non-judgmental awareness of his/ her emotions and thoughts occurring in the present moment. Focused attention on the present moments leads to the processing of all cognitive, physiological, and behavioral aspects of the immediate experience. Through mindfulness-based exercises, people become aware of their daily activities and the automatic function of their minds in the past and the future and through moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, they can control their thoughts, emotions, and physical statuses and their minds become free from daily issues and automatic focus on the past and the future [<bold><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></bold>]. Studies have shown that mindfulness increases life quality, positive emotions and life enjoyment and decreases anger in interpersonal relationships [<bold><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></bold>].</p><p>The overall purpose of mindfulness training is to improve people&#x02019;s compatibility with themselves, their environment, and others.</p><p>Today, the increasing rate of marital problems and conflicts has highlighted the importance of considering marital relationships more deeply. Too much conflict between married couples may lead to severe consequences and breakdown of the relationship. Consequently, considering the importance of mindfulness skills and the vital role of emotion regulation in marital relationships and their effects on the reduction of marital conflicts, the following hypotheses were tested in the present study:</p><p>1. Both mindfulness and emotion regulation training reduce marital conflicts.</p><p>2. Emotion regulation training is more effective than mindfulness training in the reduction of marital conflicts.</p><p><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p>The present evaluation was a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design and a control group. After the data collection, the obtained data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance (SPSS software).</p><p>The population consisted of all the clients who referred to Moein Counseling Center in Alborz province (Spring 2014) due to marital problems.

Based on the standard T scores, the temporary norm of this questionnaire was calculated separately for the experimental group and men and women control groups. The minimum and maximum scores in this questionnaire were 42 and 210 respectively. Those whose raw scores were in the range of 70 to 114 (equivalent to the standard T scores between 40 and 60) had a normal marital relationship, those whose raw scores were in the range of 115 to 134 (equivalent to the T scores between 60 and 70) had more than normal marital conflicts and those whose raw scores were above 134 (equivalent to T scores above 70) were experiencing severe conflicts in their marriage and their marital relationships were extremely vulnerable.</p><p><bold>Procedure</bold></p><p>Using the simple random sampling method, 45 married people were selected as the sample and divided into two experimental groups (15 participants in each) and a control group (15 participants).

the analysis of covariance was applied in the present study. Before the analysis, it was necessary to examine its assumption. The interaction between the dispersion variable (pre-test) and the dependent variable (marital conflicts) was not significant; therefore, the data supported the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes (p&#x0003e;0.05). Likewise, the parallelity and linear relationship between the variables confirmed the mentioned assumption as well. The levene&#x02019;s test results concerning the variable of marital conflicts did not show any significance (F=0.861; P&#x0003e;0.05), confirming the homogeneity of variance in the three groups.

Therefore, compared to the control group, the amount of marital conflicts was significantly reduced in the two experimental groups, confirming the first hypothesis again. Moreover, a significant difference was observed regarding the amount of marital conflicts between the two experimental groups. Therefore, the second hypothesis of &#x0201c;Emotion regulation training&#x0201d; is more effective than mindfulness training in the reduction of marital conflicts&#x02019;, was confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p>Martial conflicts significantly lack consistency between married couples, bringing about severe consequences for the families and may lead to breakdown of the marriage [<bold><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></bold>].</p><p>The overall objective of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of two training methods of mindfulness and emotion regulation in the reduction of marital conflicts. Comparing the pre-test and posttest scores of marital conflicts, the results indicated that the marital conflicts scores of married people in the emotion regulation group were reduced compared to the mindfulness group and scores of married people in the mindfulness group were reduced significantly compared to the control group. These findings are consistent with another study done by Denham [<bold><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></bold>], regarding the effectiveness of emotion regulation in the reduction of marital conflicts and the increase of intimate relationships between married couples. Results of other studies conducted by Kirby [<bold><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></bold>] and Abbot [<bold><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></bold>] regarding the impacts of irregularity of emotions on marital satisfaction were also in line with the present study findings.</p><p>Staford and Semik [<bold><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></bold>] found that in unhappy marriages, women showed their negative emotions frequently and men were very defensive leading to a decrease of the marital satisfaction and creation of conflicts.</p><p>Many variables directly or indirectly affect the couples&#x02019; quality of life and the frequency of conflicts between them. One of these variables is their emotions. The quality of emotions, as the most important factor in the relationships, can predict marital satisfaction.</p><p>Various emotion regulation strategies can be used in different stages of an emotional reaction. Even before the occurrence of an emotional outburst, people can feel their coming emotions; therefore, they can avoid it, limit its expression through inhibition, or change the consequences of its expression or non-expression. Thus, it seems that emotion regulation done by couples can increase their adaptive capabilities and enhance their marital satisfaction. Couples need to learn how to calm down the situation, regain their calmness, and focus on the problem again. They also have to discover how to adjust their intense emotions to different stressful situations. Hence, the attention paid to the role of emotion regulation in peoples&#x02019; coping capacity brought about the researcher&#x02019;s curiosity to examine the effects of emotion regulation strategies on the reduction of marital conflicts.</p><p>In line with other studies [<bold><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></bold>,<bold><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></bold>] regarding the effectiveness of mindfulness training in reducing marital conflicts, it can be said that mindfulness meditation training is effective in the reduction of anger and anxiety in relationships, improvement of life quality [<bold><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></bold>] and reduction of interpersonal conflicts [<bold><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></bold>].</p><p>The bases of MBCT have presence of mind at any moment, preventing mental ruminations, having control over daily events, recognizing automatic thought patterns through focusing on breathing, attending to faulty recognitions and accepting confrontation with coming thoughts. Mindfulness techniques provide a way to deal with daily stressful situations. Stressors within the family are part of life and sometimes impossible to change; however, ways to deal with or respond to them can change. Since marital conflicts are significantly related to daily stresses and faulty automatic thoughts, it gives the impression that regular mindfulness exercises can create positive changes in some of the couples&#x02019; relationships and consequently enhance their marriage.</p><p>The limitations of the present study included a small number of the previous studies on the effects of mindfulness training on marital conflicts and non-equal numbers of male and female participants (the majority of participants were females).</p><p>The results of this study provided important information about the effectiveness of mindfulness and emotion regulation training in the reduction of marital conflicts. It is recommended to pay more attention to the importance of mindfulness and emotion regulation training in the improvement of interpersonal relationships, particularly relationships between married couples. It is also recommended to evaluate the durability of the effects of mindfulness and emotion regulation training on the couples&#x02019; marital relationships.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Afkhami</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bahrami</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Fatemi Zade</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relationship and Marital Conflict in Yazd</article-title><source>J Family Research</source><year>2007</year><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>26</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmad Khani</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effective communication skills on the social adjustment of mothers of mentally retarded children in Ardebil</article-title><source>Master&#x02019;s Thesis Tehran University</source><year>2011</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sanaii</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Alagheband</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Abasi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Measures of family and marriage</article-title><year>2000</year><publisher-loc>Tehran, Besat.</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hoseyni</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Compared with the parental marital conflict marital conflict in the marriage of their children</article-title><source>J New thoughts training.</source><year>2005</year><fpage>12</fpage><lpage>81</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fereydoni</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Tabrizi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Navabi Nejad</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Even short-term treatment increases the effectiveness of self-regulation of the marriage Mrakhan cultural center city Babolsar</article-title><source>Journal of Family Studies</source><year>2008</year><fpage>213</fpage><lpage>229</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abbot</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Emotion Dysregulation and Re-Regulation: predictor of Relationship intimacy and Distress.
