Warm-needling acupuncture and medicinal cake-separated moxibustion have been separately reported with potential therapeutic effects on hyperlipidemia treatment in several studies but with limitations in study methodology. Combining these two modalities may provide a more advantageous strategy in treating hyperlipidemia. Therefore, a strict evaluation through well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT) is necessary to determine their efficacy and safety on hyperlipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study a multicenter, open-label, randomized, stratified, active-controlled, noninferiority trial with two parallel groups. Subjects with hyperlipidemia will be stratified into different groups by risk levels of heart diseases. They then will be instructed to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC) diet. Those who have not reached the target lipid level will be randomly assigned to the treatments of either acupuncture and moxibustion or simvastatin with a 1:1 allocation. One hundred and thirty subjects are aimed to be recruited. The duration of intervention for this study will be 12 weeks, followed by another 4 weeks for post-treatment assessment. The primary outcome is percentage change from baseline to the end of the study in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Other indicators in lipid change, safety and adherence will also be assessed secondarily. The repeated measures, linear mixed-effects model will be applied to the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Acupuncture and moxibustion could be a potentially effective treatment alternative for hyperlipidemia.

This condition is associated with the deterioration in lifestyle and dietary habits and represents an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other diseases. Large randomized controlled trials in hyperlipidemia treatment have provided evidence that reducing LDL cholesterol concentration with statins is efficient in both secondary and primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, individuals at moderate or high CVD risk are often considered as candidates for lipid-lowering therapy with statins. However, statin therapy can incur significant cost to the society. In addition, statin therapy is often associated with low treatment compliance and high rates of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Acupuncture and moxibustion has been widely applied to hyperlipidemia treatment in clinical practice of China. Thus, an increasing number of studies have explored whether acupuncture and moxibustion could serve as an alternative treatment for subjects with hyperlipidemia. As shown in a meta-analysis, acupuncture solely, compared to statins, has demonstrated a more significant effect on decreasing TG and increasing HDL-C, but no superiority in lowering the LDL-C and TC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Meanwhile, moxibustion, which is often administered with acupuncture in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practice, also plays an essential role in lipid-lowering by warming meridians and facilitating lipid conversion in the TCM theory. The recent studies have further revealed the biological pathway in lipid-lowering of moxibustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This modality, especially the warm-needling acupuncture (acupuncture with a moxa stick), can enhance microcirculation, adjust the lipid metabolism, and thus lower the blood viscosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">Medicinal cake-separated moxibustion, an important kind of moxibustion, applies the acupoints, moxibustion, and traditional Chinese herb in an integrative way. It has gained increasing popularity in the practice of hyperlipidemia treatment and thus been further assessed on its potential impact. Some findings have shown, from a perspective of gene transcription and protein expression, that the medicinal cake-separated moxibustion could prevent the formation of atheromatous plaque by adjusting Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathways as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), in order to delay atherosclerosis (AS) formation and stabilize atheromatous plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Chang et al. indicated that both the medicinal cake-separated moxibustion and direct moxibustion have a certain protective action on endothelial cells of the aorta in the rabbit of hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Yue et al. found that herb-partition moxibustion delays the formation of atherosclerosis through the inhibition of TLR4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This has provided a new strategy for the research on AS pathogenesis and prevention. In addition, based on clinical observation and systematic review of TCM literature, the selection of meridians and acupoints potentially having effect on hyperlipidemia treatment, has been studied and identified, which includes ten meridians (five <italic>Yin</italic> and five <italic>Yang</italic> meridians), and five acupoints (Stomach (ST), Spleen (SP), Ren (RN), Bladder (BL) and Pericardian (PC)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Based on these findings, several clinical studies on assessing medicinal cake-separated moxibustion have been undertaken, testing different acupoint prescriptions, medicinal-cake ingredients, treatment duration, etc., in attempt to identify an effective and standardized regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most of these studies have shown possible therapeutic effects of the medicinal cake-separated moxibustion on hyperlipidemia, superior to the placebo or noninferior to statins.</p><p id="Par66">In general, acupuncture and moxibustion is shown to be possibly effective in treating hyperlipidemia, with lower cost and fewer serious adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, due to the lack of robust study design and assessment methodology in existing clinical studies, the findings should be interpreted with caution. According to previous attempts on identifying an optimal regimen of acupuncture and moxibustion for treating hyperlipidemia, the warm needling acupuncture along with medicinal cake-separated moxibustion seems to be a modality that successfully combines the advantages of both acupuncture and moxibustion. This is worth further exploring to warrant its therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. So far, very few studies on this combined intervention are available. Hence, there is a need for a well-designed randomized control trial to validate the efficacy and safety of warm-needling acupuncture along with medicinal cake-separated moxibustion, by comparing it with statins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses and objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="Par67">

The cake-separated moxibustion treatment belongs to the category of indirect moxibustion which applies moxibustion, herb and acupoints together. In this treatment, a drug-cake mixture is allocated upon selected acupoints, and then the lit moxa cone is placed onto the cake. In this case, the moxa-effect enhanced by the active components of the drug cake is allowed to penetrate through the skin and the acupoints.</p><p id="Par125">Based on the TCM theory that the heart is in charge of the blood circulation and blood vessels, some specific acupoints related to heart meridian and heart are selected, such as the <italic>Shu</italic> acupoint (RN14) and the <italic>Mu</italic> acupoint (BL15) of the heart meridian. BL18, BL20 and BL23 are used to tonify the spleen <italic>Qi</italic>, strengthen the liver <italic>Qi</italic> and also maintain the kidney <italic>Qi</italic>, as well as facilitate the conversion of lipids in the liver. ST40 and ST25, which belong to the stomach meridian and help the transformation function of spleen, can protect and work against hyperlipidemia by assisting the removal of phlegm from the body.</p><p id="Par126">Additionally, five Chinese herbal medicines are selected, including <italic>Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix</italic> (<italic>Dan shen</italic>), <italic>Crataegi Fructus</italic> (<italic>Shan zha</italic>), <italic>Curcumae Radix</italic> (<italic>Yu jin</italic>), <italic>Rhei Radix et Rhizoma</italic> (<italic>Da huang</italic>), and <italic>Alismatis Rhizoma</italic> (<italic>Ze xie</italic>).

Effective treatment alternatives on hyperlipidemia have been explored to address the shortcomings of statins; and acupuncture and moxibustion are considered as potentially effective regimens based on clinical practices and clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, acupuncture and moxibustion, separately, have not been proved to be as effective as statin from previous studies, despite the existence of their clinical effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Additionally, as approaches of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), their introduction to the mainstream medical community is often limited due to lack of robust evidence and differences in the philosophy adopted. Therefore, the RCT described in this paper has been developed to validate the efficacy and safety of combined acupuncture and moxibustion on hyperlipidemia via a well-designed evaluation.</p><p id="Par241">There are several strengths in design of this study. First, the intervention adopted in this study is developed not only based on profound TCM theory but also supported by comprehensive scientific research. The theory guiding the acupoints selection and traditional Chinese herb composition has been studied, identified and well-demonstrated in this study which is discussed in the &#x0201c;Treatment rationale&#x0201d; section. Meanwhile, several studies from the perspectives of laboratory animal medicine and clinical medicine have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] which serve as the key foundation of intervention development in this study. Specifically, the biological mechanism was explored on how cake-separated moxibustion can have an impact upon hyperlipidemia; and the acupoint selection and regimen implementation from ample TCM theory were validated in multiple clinical studies.</p><p id="Par242">Second, the TLC will be included prior to both interventions of acupuncture and moxibustion and statins, which enables this study to reflect the actual practice in clinical settings to the greatest extent. According to the guideline of hyperlipidemia treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], TLC is recommended as the first step before any other treatment. By adhering to the commonly adopted clinical guideline during study procedure, on the one hand, we can take good care of the &#x0201c;non-maleficence&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;justice&#x0201d; principles in study ethics, because the opportunity of receiving appropriate medication will not be compromised for patients attending this study; on the other hand, this can enhance the generalizability of this study due to following the clinical operations in real life.</p><p id="Par243">Third, the stratification on risk levels for heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] will be applied to this study, which makes possible that the effect of interventions of this study can be differentiated and specified according to different risk groups. Patients with hyperlipidemia may enter the study with different initial lipid levels, due to different time points of initiating medication intervention for groups with different risk levels. Meanwhile, the goal lipid level for each patient may also differ accordingly. It is impractical and erroneous to set exactly the same criteria in determining the clinical effect for all the patients. In recognition on this, patients will be stratified by their risk levels during the study, and then the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion versus simvastatin can be observed and examined within different risk levels, instead of within a large group with extensive variance. This stratification reflects that patient&#x02019;s risk levels for heart diseases are considered important impacting factors on the outcomes in this study; it enables exploring this impact upon the effects of interventions, which can further guide the appropriate intervention by targeting on the right populations. In addition, different treatment goals will be adopted for different risk groups according to the standard clinical guideline; this ensures the study will be implemented in accordance with the daily clinical practices to the most extent, thus, the external validity can be mostly warranted.</p><p id="Par244">However, certain limitations still exist in this study. One is the absence of a placebo control group due to the limited study budgets. Because of this lack of comparison, it may not be able to determine whether the outcome observed is due to the therapeutic effect of acupuncture and moxibustion or its placebo effect, if acupuncture and moxibustion is proved to be inferior to simvastatin. Nevertheless, judgment from clinical experiences and relevant findings from previous studies can help in identifying and justifying the effect with clinical significance.</p><p id="Par245">Another limitation is the absence of blinding in patients and health care providers due to the operation characteristics of acupuncture and moxibustion. With patients knowing their intervention assignments after randomization, there may be a potentially higher possibility of cross-over between and drop-off from these two arms; thus, the potential selection bias may occur. But detailed explanation can be given to patients on these two arms of interventions in order to inform potential effects and safety in both arms. This will help limiting the drop-off and cross-over rates. Moreover, with the intervention assignment revealed, the effect identified from the acupuncture and moxibustion group may not fully result from its therapeutic aspect but a psychological aspect. But the outcome measures examined in this study are all objective &#x02013; based on the fasting lipid level; and in the analysis process intervention assignment is fully blinding to data assessors. Therefore, the information bias due to lack of blinding could be controlled to a considerable extent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec100"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par246">In conclusion, efforts have been devoted, in this study, to developing a well-designed assessment approach to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined acupuncture and moxibustion on treating hyperlipidemia, by integrating the TCM regimens with the standardized Western medicine appraisal approach. It is expected this assessment will introduce a potentially effective alternative treatment of hyperlipidemia by borrowing the wisdom from the time-tested practice approach, TCM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec60"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par247">
