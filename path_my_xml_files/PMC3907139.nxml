Providing care for people diagnosed with schizophrenia can be stressful for their caregivers. Psycho-educational interventions may improve patients&#x02019; and primary caregivers&#x02019; knowledge of schizophrenia and impact positively on patients&#x02019; physical and psychological outcomes and primary caregivers&#x02019; burden of care and quality of life. Studies thus far have shown that these interventions may improve patients&#x02019; and caregivers&#x02019; outcomes, but the quality of included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is poor and it is difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the effectiveness of such interventions on patients and primary caregivers&#x02019; outcomes, hence the current study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized controlled trial in four outpatient mental health clinics in Jordan comparing psycho-educational interventions in the form of six booklets every fortnight, with treatment as usual in people diagnosed with schizophrenia and their primary caregivers. The primary outcome for participants is knowledge of Schizophrenia; secondary outcomes for patients are positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and relapse rate, while secondary outcomes for primary caregivers are burden of care and quality of life. All measures are assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at three months follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized control trial, conducted in Jordan among people living with schizophrenia and their primary caregivers, will assess the effect of psycho-educational interventions on knowledge of Schizophrenia, patients&#x02019; positive and negative symptoms and quality of life, and caregivers&#x02019; burden of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN78084871">ISRCTN78084871</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Schizoaffective</kwd><kwd>Primary caregivers</kwd><kwd>Trial</kwd><kwd>Psycho-education</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Schizophrenia is one of the most common and serious forms of mental illness and is often chronic, recurrent, disabling and debilitating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>While studies have reported that the main cause of schizophrenia is unknown, a widely accepted model is the stress vulnerability hypothesis, which proposes that the interaction between biological vulnerability and socio-environmental stressors, including social stressors, have a significant role in the presentation and illness course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This model suggests that schizophrenia is caused by an imbalance in biological or psychological systems. Imbalance in biological systems is considered the main precipitating cause for schizophrenia, and it includes genetics, head injury and viral infection. The impact of schizophrenia is commonly mitigated by taking medication and abstaining from alcohol. The psychological system is concerned with stress; stress is caused by events that challenge people and compel them to adapt themselves in order to function as &#x02018;normal&#x02019;. However, people who struggle to adapt to stressful life events (e.g. bereavement, loss of job) often report poorer disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have estimated that schizophrenia affects around 1.1% of the adult population worldwide, which equates to around 51 million people. Commonly, people are diagnosed with schizophrenia before the age of 25 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The health system in Jordan has three sectors: Ministry of Health (MoH), private and military. The MoH provides healthcare to the majority of the Jordanian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In Jordan, a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] has shown that 305 individuals per 100,000 of the population have been diagnosed with mental illness, 50% of whom are diagnosed with schizophrenia, making this a significant healthcare issue.</p><p>Family interventions described in previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] are psycho-educational in nature and seek to improve patients and primary caregivers&#x02019; knowledge of schizophrenia and change patients and primary caregivers&#x02019; behaviour by improving their knowledge about expected &#x02018;maladaptive&#x02019; behaviour, disease symptoms and how can they deal with these issues using psycho-educational interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Whilst the content psycho-educational intervention varies between studies, there are common factors among most studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] including; general information about schizophrenia, symptoms, medication management, problem-solving strategies and communication skills for patients and primary caregivers. Psycho-educational interventions are usually delivered by psychiatrists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. mental health nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and social workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The average duration of sessions varies among studies from 60 to 120 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], The methods of delivering psycho-educational interventions in studies for people diagnosed with Schizophrenic patients and primary caregivers include lectures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], face to face methods supported with a printed booklet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and online education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Studies which adopted an online method of delivering psycho-educational interventions to participants revealed a substantial improvement in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and caregivers&#x02019; knowledge levels and patients&#x02019; symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], stress and social support levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Additionally, delivering psycho-educational interventions with minimal interaction such as printed booklets and online provision has shown a similar effect on participants&#x02019; outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] of RCTs that delivered psycho-educational interventions online, by email and by printed leaflets was easy to access for large numbers of mental health patients and their primary caregivers at a relatively low cost. There has been an increasing interest recently demonstrating the effectiveness of psycho-education interventions using online, or booklets on patients and caregivers&#x02019; outcomes in relatively resource-poor countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Studies thus far have shown that these interventions may improve patients&#x02019; and primary caregivers&#x02019; outcomes, but the quality of included RCTs is poor due to a lack of randomization and blinding and insufficient sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Consequently, the evidence base is inconclusive about the effectiveness of such interventions on patients and primary caregivers&#x02019; outcomes, hence the current study.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the the effectiveness of psycho-educational intervention delivered via a printed booklet on people diagnosed with Schizophrenia and their primary caregivers&#x02019; outcomes. It is anticipated that treatment as usual and psycho-educational intervention delivered by a booklet will: Improve patients&#x02019; and primary caregivers&#x02019; knowledge of schizophrenia, improve patients&#x02019; positive and negative symptoms and reduce their relapse rates, and improve primary caregivers&#x02019; burden of care and quality of life better than treatment as usual alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><p>The study is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of psycho-educational intervention delivered via a printed booklet with treatment as usual on people diagnosed with Schizophrenia and their primary caregivers&#x02019; outcomes assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at three months follow-up.</p><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The study will be conducted in four state funded psychiatric outpatient clinics in Amman, Jordan.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Participants will be people aged 18 years or over, diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and their primary caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>To be included in this study patients will have a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition (DSM-IV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and their primary caregivers.

Secondary outcomes are schizophrenia symptoms measured by the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) for patients and Family Burden of Care measured by the Family Burden interview Scale (FBIS) and quality of life measured by the Schizophrenic Carers Quality of Life Scale (S-CQoL) for caregivers.</p><p>KASQ is a self-reported questionnaire developed by Ascher-Svanum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It consists of 25 multiple-choice items intended to measure patients&#x02019; basic knowledge about schizophrenia and its management, aetiology, prevalence, prognosis, treatment and anti-psychotic medication effects and side effects. KASQ is scored from 0 to 25 with a higher score indicating more knowledge. KASQ has been used with people diagnosed with Schizophrenia and carers worldwide. Studies with subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] reported Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficients of 0.89 and 0.85 and test-retest reliability coefficient over three weeks was 0.83.</p><p>The PANSS was developed by Kay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It assesses positive, negative and general psychopathology schizophrenia symptoms. The scale measures 30 clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, each symptom is scored from 1 indicating absence of psychopathology to 7 indicating severe psychopathology with higher scores indicating a poorer mental health status. The scale has good internal reliability and criterion related validity was examined with Andreasen rating systems. The result indicated that high correlation between two positive scales (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001) and negative scales (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001).

The FBIS consists of 24 items and focuses on six domains of caregivers&#x02019; burden: family finance, routine, leisure time, physical health, mental health and family interaction. Each item is rated on a three-point Likert scale (0: no burden, 1: moderate burden, 2: severe burden). The participants&#x02019; final scores range from 0 to 48; a higher score indicates a higher level of burden. The scale has good reliability and validity (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha 0.87; test-retest 0.83) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The S-CQoL was developed by Richieri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] to assess the impact of caring for people diagnosed with Schizophrenia on carers&#x02019; quality of life. The S-CQoL consists of 25 items scored from 25 to 125; a higher score indicates a good quality of life. The S-CQoL has seven dimensions: Physical and Psychological Wellbeing (PsPhW), Psychological Burden and Daily Life (PsBDL), Relationships with Spouse (RS), Relationships with Psychiatric Team (RPT), Relationship with Family (RFa), Relationships with friends (RFr) and Material Burden (MB). The Scale has an adequate internal consistency for all dimensions ranging from 0.64 to 0.95 and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha is 0.79 to 0.92.

However, the majority of these studies adopted numbers of readmission, or exacerbations in psychotic symptoms of more than 5&#x02013;10 points measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or PANSS, the number of increases in anti-psychotic medication dosage, or medication compliance. For this study, relapse is defined as the number of readmissions measured at baseline three months prior to the study commencing, at end of intervention immediately and three months follow up. Furthermore, relapse with medication means the numbers of increasing current antipsychotic medications prescribed to patients during the same intervals.
