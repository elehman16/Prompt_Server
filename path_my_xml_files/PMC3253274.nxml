Electromyographic activity (EMG), tissue oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy), and pain intensity were measured in trapezius during pegboard and stress tasks before and after the intervention period. During the pegboard task, GFT improved trapezius oxygenation from a relative decrease of &#x02212;0.83&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.48&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M to an increase of 0.05&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, and decreased pain development by 43%, but did not affect resting levels of pain. SST lowered the relative EMG amplitude by 36%, and decreased pain during resting and working conditions by 52 and 38%, respectively, without affecting trapezius oxygenation. In conclusion, GFT performed as leg-bicycling decreased pain development during repetitive work tasks, possibly due to improved oxygenation of the painful muscles. SST lowered the overall level of pain both during rest and work, possibly due to a lowered relative exposure as evidenced by a lowered relative EMG. The results demonstrate differential adaptive mechanisms of contrasting physical exercise interventions on chronic muscle pain at rest and during repetitive work tasks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Stress task</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>Trapezius</kwd><kwd>NIRS</kwd><kwd>Aerobic training</kwd><kwd>Strength training</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neck/shoulder pain&#x02014;and especially trapezius myalgia&#x02014;is frequent in females employed in repetitive stressful jobs (Larsson et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). Pain in the trapezius muscle has been shown to be associated with various mitochondrial changes in type 1 muscle fibers as well as reduced capillarization per fiber cross-sectional area (Kadi et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>; Larsson et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>), pointing towards a relation between metabolic insufficiencies and pain. This is supported first by the finding of an increased anaerobic metabolism and second by a larger and more sustained oxygen deficit during the start of a work task in myalgic subjects compared with healthy controls (Sj&#x000f8;gaard et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Rosendal et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004b</xref>). Further, among healthy subjects, trapezius muscle pain development during a work task seems to be related to regulation of blood flow (Strom et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>).</p><p>Specific strength training of the painful muscle has been shown to be effective in decreasing levels of pain at rest (Andersen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Ylinen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>; Ahlgren et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>). However, regarding pain development during a work task, the effect of interventions with different types of exercise is unknown. It is plausible that other types of exercise than specific strength training can have an indirect positive effect on pain development during work. General fitness trainings such as bicycling and jogging are acceptable forms of exercise for many people. Although such types of exercise do not directly involve the painful trapezius muscle, it is possible that exercising large muscle groups may improve the oxygenation of distant relaxed muscles. The prevailing view is that blood flow to inactive tissue decreases during exercise due to increased sympathetic nervous activity (Ohlsson et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>; McAllister <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1998</xref>; Perko et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1998</xref>). Nevertheless, increased blood flow to non-working muscles during aerobic exercise by improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation has also been reported (DeSouza et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>). Supporting this, vascular adaptations have been shown to occur in the vascular beds of the forearm muscles in response to lower extremity conditioning training (Silber et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1991</xref>). Also, improved endothelial vasodilatory capacity in conduit arteries of the non-working limb has been observed in response to exercise with the contra lateral limb (Tanaka et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). In accordance with these studies, we have recently shown that leg-cycling with passively hanging arms enhances blood flow and oxygenation in the trapezius muscle in myalgic as well as in healthy subjects (Andersen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Therefore, potentially, this improved oxygenation of the relaxed muscles during exercise could have an indirect beneficial effect on pain development during work tasks involving the myalgic trapezius muscle. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess changes in myalgic trapezius activation, muscle oxygenation, and pain intensity during repetitive and stressful work tasks in response to 10&#x000a0;weeks of: (1) training in terms of leg-bicycling with relaxed shoulders; (2) specific strength training locally for the affected muscle or (3) a reference intervention without physical activity. It was hypothesized that both types of physical training would be superior to the reference intervention with regard to improved oxygenation and reduction in pain intensity in the myalgic muscle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized controlled trial with short-term effect measured immediately after the 10&#x000a0;weeks intervention was performed in Copenhagen, Denmark. The participants were women, aged 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years, recruited via seven workplaces (2 banks, 2 post office work places, 2 different national administrative offices and 1 industrial production unit) or via announcement in local newspapers. The typical work tasks of the participants were monotonous and repetitive, e.g., assembly line work, office work and the majority performed computer typing. The procedure of recruitment has recently been described in detail (Andersen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). Briefly, 812 female workers were invited to participate in the study, 530 replied to the invitation by answering a screening questionnaire to identify workers with trapezius myalgia. Three hundred and sixteen were willing to participate, and of these, 147 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: (1) trouble (pain and discomfort) for more than 30&#x000a0;days during the last year in the neck/shoulder region; (2) not more than 30&#x000a0;days of trouble in maximally three body regions out of eight major body regions (neck/shoulder, low back, left or right arm/hand, hip, knee/foot) to exclude generalized musculoskeletal diseases; (3) the trouble should be at least &#x0201c;quite a lot&#x0201d; on an ordinal 5-step scale ranging from &#x0201c;a little&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d;; (4) the trouble should be frequent (at least once a week) and (5) the intensity of the trouble should be at least 2 on a scale from 0 to 9, where 0 is &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 9 is &#x0201c;worst imaginable pain&#x0201d;. Additionally, none of the participants should suffer from serious conditions such as previous trauma or injuries, life threatening diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or arthritis in the neck and shoulder. The 147 workers who fulfilled the inclusion criteria based on the screening questionnaire were invited to a neck and upper limb clinical examination originally developed by Ohlsson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>) and later modified as described in detail by Juul-Kristensen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>). Briefly, the main criteria for a positive clinical diagnosis of trapezius myalgia were: (1) pain in the neck area; (2) tightness of the trapezius muscle and (3) palpable tenderness in the trapezius muscle. Those who based on this examination qualified for trapezius myalgia and did not show contraindications (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43) were invited for the study. Results from this intervention trial on maximal muscle activation, muscle strength and morphology as well as perceived pain measures have been reported earlier (Andersen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>; Nielsen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>) in addition to baseline data from trapezius myalgia cases compared with healthy controls on muscle activation, oxygenation, metabolites, biochemistry and pain (Sj&#x000f8;gaard et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Mackey et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). The present paper focuses on the short-term intervention effects on muscle activation, oxygenation, and pain development during a repetitive work task with measurements of tissue oxygenation obtained from 39 out of the 43 participants. The intervention trial also includes data on muscle endurance, metabolism and histochemistry; however, these results will be dealt with in future publications.</p><p>All participants were informed about the purpose and content of the project and gave written informed consent to participate in the study, which was conformed to The Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Local Ethical Committee (KF 01-138/04). The study was qualified for registration in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register: ISRCTN87055459.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><p>All three interventions lasted 10&#x000a0;weeks. The randomization to one of the three groups was done at the cluster level in a balanced design accounting for similar age, BMI, and screening questionnaire based on neck/shoulder trouble. The three intervention groups were: (1) general fitness training in terms of leg-bicycling with relaxed shoulders (GFT); (2) specific strength training locally for the affected muscle (SST) or (3) a reference intervention without physical activity (REF). Due to the randomization procedure, no difference between groups was observed with regard to age, height, and body mass (GFT: 45.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8.0&#x000a0;years, 1.67&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.05&#x000a0;m, 74.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;18.7&#x000a0;kg; SST: 44.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8.5&#x000a0;years, 1.67&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.06&#x000a0;m, 71.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;11.4&#x000a0;kg; REF: 42.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;11.1&#x000a0;years, 1.69&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.09&#x000a0;m, 67.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14.0&#x000a0;kg).

The participants bicycled in an upright position without holding on to the handlebars; it was emphasized that the participants should relax the shoulders during training. During each training session, heart rate was recorded in each subject by a heart rate monitor (Polar Sport Tester, Kempele, Finland) to adjust the workload to the intended relative level.</p><p><italic>SST</italic> (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16) specific strength training was performed for the neck and shoulder muscles with five different dumbbell exercises (1-arm row, shoulder abduction, shoulder elevation, reverse flies, upright row). During the intervention period, the relative loadings were progressively increased from 12 repetitions maximum (RM) (~70% of maximal intensity) towards eight RM (~80% of maximal intensity). Three of the five exercises were performed during each training session with three sets per exercise, each set typically lasting 25&#x02013;35&#x000a0;s.</p><p><italic>REF</italic> (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8) this group was not offered any physical training but received an equal amount of attention as the physical training intervention groups. The participants received health counseling on group and individual level regarding workplace ergonomics, diet, health, relaxation, and stress management. Unfortunately, the time-wise successive balanced recruitment resulted in a smaller REF group, e.g., due to withdrawal of participants who initially stated that they would volunteer for the study.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pegboard and stress task</title><p>On two experimental workdays before the 10&#x000a0;weeks intervention period started and within 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days after the end of the intervention, respectively, the participants performed two work tasks in a seated position. A standardized repetitive task consisted of 40&#x000a0;min pegboard work as described previously (Sj&#x000f8;gaard et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>). The pegboard work was interrupted every 5&#x000a0;min for inquiring about pain intensity (VAS) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE), thus a total of 8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;min sessions were performed.</p><p>Following the pegboard task, the participants rested for 120&#x000a0;min before the stress task was performed.

Electrodes were placed under the NIRS probe with an inter-electrode distance of 20&#x000a0;mm (Jensen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1993</xref>). The accelerometer was placed over the lateral electrode. Signals were amplified, band-pass filtered (8th order Butterworth filter, EMG 10&#x02013;400&#x000a0;Hz, MMG 5&#x02013;100&#x000a0;Hz), and sampled on dataloggers (Logger Teknologi HB, Lund, Sweden) with a sampling frequency of 1,024&#x000a0;Hz. The signals were analyzed for root-mean-square (EMG<sub>RMS</sub> and MMG<sub>RMS</sub>) and mean power frequency values (EMG<sub>MPF</sub> and MMG<sub>MPF</sub>) during eight 5-min periods during the pegboard task and ten 1-min periods during the stress task. The EMG<sub>RMS</sub> was computed within windows of 100&#x000a0;ms duration and the power spectral density was calculated in 1&#x000a0;s intervals. The average muscle activity level during the pegboard task was judged from the EMG<sub>RMS</sub> and for evaluation of fatigue development EMG<sub>MPF</sub> and MMG measurements were included. The resting EMG signal was recorded with visual feedback from an oscilloscope to minimize the visible EMG activity during 5&#x000a0;s of instructed rest and subtracted from all EMG registrations. Signals were normalized to EMG<sub>RMS</sub> during a maximal voluntary isometric shoulder elevation (MVC). During the MVC, the maximal EMG amplitude (MVE) was calculated as the highest mean EMG<sub>RMS</sub> obtained with a 1&#x000a0;s window moving in steps of 100&#x000a0;ms and EMG<sub>RMS</sub> values are presented in %MVE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Tissue oxygenation</title><p>Muscle tissue oxygenation was measured continuously during the pegboard and stress task using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) (NIRO 300, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan).

While GFT decreased pain development during repetitive work tasks, likely due to improved oxygenation of the painful muscles, SST lowered the overall level of pain both during rest and work, potentially due to a general lowered relative work load as evidenced by a lowered relative EMG in the standardized pegboard task.</p><p>The intervention study showed that 10&#x000a0;weeks of GFT improved oxygenation of chronically painful trapezius muscles during repetitive work tasks. Increased O<sub>2</sub>Hb and THb during the pegboard work indicate increased blood flow to the trapezius muscle similar to the response in healthy controls during such work tasks (Sj&#x000f8;gaard et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>). Since MAP and EMG were unchanged this cannot be explained by increased perfusion pressure or a change in relative muscle load (relative EMG) during the pegboard task in response to GFT. In an earlier paper, we have reported a mean increase of 21% in aerobic fitness as response to the GFT intervention (Andersen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). Therefore, an increased total blood volume potentially could explain the improved oxygenation of the trapezius muscle during the pegboard work. An alternative explanation is functional vascular adaptations in the non exercised muscles due to the training with large muscle groups such as the GFT in the present study. This could be indicated from the increase in blood flow in the relaxed trapezius during leg-bicycling shown in our recent study (Andersen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Also earlier studies support this having shown vascular adaptations such as increased forearm blood flow, blood viscosity, and release of nitric oxide in response to 4&#x000a0;weeks of leg-bicycle training at 65&#x02013;70% <italic>V</italic>O<sub>2</sub>max (Kingwell et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>; Silber et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1991</xref>).</p><p>After 10&#x000a0;weeks of SST, there was no change in THB during the pegboard task but a smaller change in HHb, and a tendency to an increased O<sub>2</sub>Hb. Thus, there was no change in blood flow and the results may rather reflect the lower relative workload in this group.</p><p>The rate of pain development during the pegboard task changed for GFT in terms of a 43% decrease in VAS slope. This improved resistance to pain development could have important practical relevance during low-force repetitive work tasks at the workplace. Further, even small reductions in pain and the increased level of aerobic fitness found in response to GFT may motivate persons with severe pain to overcome barriers to exercise.</p><p>In response to the SST intervention, a decrease in overall pain during the pegboard work task as well as a decrease of 52% in resting pain was observed. This is in line with earlier results from the same study showing a 79% decrease in worst pain based on pain-diary registrations (Andersen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). However, the rate of pain development during the pegboard work did not change significantly in response to SST, likely due to the fact that the overall pain level was already markedly lowered. As recently reported in another paper from this study, both muscle thickness and shoulder elevation strength was increased in SST (Nielsen et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>), and may explain the lowered relative workload of the trapezius muscle&#x02014;as evidenced by a lowered relative EMG&#x02014;during the pegboard task. Together these findings point towards differential adaptive mechanisms of pain reduction in response to GFT and SST.</p><p>EMG and MMG did not show signs of fatigue development during the 40-min pegboard work, even though fatigue development was expected compared with a previous study on a pegboard task where lighter weights were used (Rosendal et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004a</xref>). In spite of decrease in relative workload (EMG<sub>RMS</sub>) during the pegboard task, no change was found in MMG<sub>RMS</sub>. MMG reflects the mechanical response in the muscle; since the absolute workload during the pegboard work was the same before and after the intervention, no changes were expected in MMG<sub>RMS</sub>.</p><p>In contrast to the pegboard task, the baseline results from the stress task were an increase in O<sub>2</sub>Hb and THb and a decrease in HHb for both myalgic and healthy subjects (Sj&#x000f8;gaard et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>). This surprising result was not affected by the intervention. The acute increase in MAP with the stress task may have increased blood flow and thereby increased the blood volume in the trapezius muscle explaining the increase in oxygenation. Oxygen tension above resting level may have a deleterious effect on tissue structures due to its potential of increased formation of free radicals that may provoke lipolysis of membrane structures. Thus, over prolonged periods of time maintenance of homeostasis is crucial and neither reduced nor elevated levels of oxygenation may be beneficial although novel aspects on the role of free radicals as key regulators of muscle function has recently been presented (Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of the present study is the initial dropout of participants in REF (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8), which made this group much smaller than the other intervention groups. In addition, a general concern is that the study may not have sufficient power to be fully conclusive on all variables.</p><p>In conclusion, as a short-term effect the study demonstrates differential adaptive mechanisms of two contrasting physical exercise interventions on chronic muscle pain during both repetitive work tasks and at rest. The GFT intervention performed as leg-bicycling decreased pain development in the trapezius muscle during repetitive work tasks. This may be due to the corresponding improved oxygenation of the painful muscles also demonstrated in this study. SST lowered the overall level of pain both during work and rest, possibly due to the lowered relative exposure as evidenced by a lowered relative EMG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Henrik Baare Olsen and Jesper Kristiansen are acknowledged for their contribution to data and statistical analyses.
