In addition to the physical impact of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) on pregnant women,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3">1&#x02013;3</xref> IDA is a potential risk factor for preterm delivery and subsequent low birth weight, and may be associated with inferior neonatal health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Infants born to women with IDA are more likely to become anaemic themselves, which in turn is known to have a potential effect on an infant's mental and motor development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7 R8 R9">5&#x02013;9</xref> Although iron supplementation during pregnancy is a widely practised public health measure, there are some concerns regarding iron replacement therapy and its long-term effect, especially the intravenous form.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Therapeutic response to oral iron therapy is not always adequate in pregnant women, due to difficulties associated with oral intake of the tablets and their side effects, which impacts negatively on compliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>

We studied the effects of both treatment types on the perceived health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by a modified SF-36 questionnaire.

The initial study assessed Hb and serum ferritin levels after intravenous followed by oral iron therapy versus oral iron therapy only. The current study constitutes a follow-up on the earlier one and took place between January 2010 and January 2011 and focused on HRQoL, breastfeeding duration and child health. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The original and the follow-up studies were approved by the Tasmanian Human Research Ethics Committee and registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12609000177257.aspx">http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12609000177257.aspx</ext-link>) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial.aspx?trialid=ACTRN12609000596202">http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial.aspx?trialid=ACTRN12609000596202</ext-link>).</p><p>In the original study, we prospectively assessed HRQoL at baseline prior to treatment in the second trimester, 4&#x02005;weeks after the initiation of treatment, in the third trimester before delivery, and at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks postdelivery. In the follow-up study, an HRQoL questionnaire was completed that incorporated the original questionnaire plus additional parameters such as the length of the breastfeeding period and occurrence of postnatal depression as well as child growth data. This was performed at a median of 32&#x02005;months postintervention in order to assess the long-term effects of both treatment types on mothers&#x02019; HRQoL in relation to data from the earlier study. This questionnaire, although completed prospectively, had a retrospective component that asked the participating mothers the same questions again that they had previously answered prospectively. These data were compared with the mothers&#x02019; original prospective QoL data for validation purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Pregnant women aged 18&#x02005;years or above who presented to the LGH with IDA between 2007 and 2009 were invited to participate.

Treatment arms were allocated in blocks of 10 by computer-generated random assignment, and allocation was done by concealed envelopes.

The oral-only treatment arm comprised iron sulphate 250&#x02005;mg tablets once daily, (elemental iron 80&#x02005;mg, Abbott, Australasia Pty Ltd) to be taken daily within 2&#x02005;days after booking until delivery. The intravenous arm required a single intravenous infusion of iron polymaltose (Ferrosig, Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Sydney, NSW,Australia) within 1&#x02005;week after first antenatal visit followed by oral iron identical to the other arm. Pre-enrolment, there were no significant differences in the dietary iron intake or supplement intake between the two groups based on a specially designed questionnaire addressing these issues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Patients assigned to intravenous iron polymaltose received a 100&#x02005;mg test dose dissolved in 50&#x02013;100&#x02005;ml normal saline infused over 30&#x02005;min. Clinical observation and vital signs were assessed initially and every 15&#x02005;min from the start of the infusion.

First, a clinical questionnaire was completed prospectively by trained midwives at 4&#x02005;weeks after initiation of treatment, at 28 and 34&#x02005;weeks gestation, and then 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks postdelivery. This questionnaire assessed four aspects: energy levels, activity, tolerance and side effects of the treatment. This was used to guide individual patient clinical decision-making as well as to provide a safety audit of the trial treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Second, a prospective/retrospective survey was conducted between June and October 2010 by trained research personnel via phone interview using a modified version of the SF-36 HRQoL questionnaire, similar to a version published previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Additional modifications for this study included: (1) use of eleven of the 36 questions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012000998TB2">table 2</xref>) and (2) the women were asked to recall their response to each of the questions at four timepoints; pretrial prior to commencement of iron therapy during the pregnancy, 4&#x02005;weeks after the start of iron therapy, 1&#x02005;week after delivery and the last 4&#x02005;weeks prior to the telephone questionnaire contact (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012000998TB2">table 2</xref>). This was compared in a retrospective manner to the same questions answered earlier prospectively by the participants at these different timepoints. In order to validate the retrospective use of the modified SF-36 questionnaire to assess the women's HRQoL during and after pregnancy, we estimated the associations of the physical activity component of the prospective monitoring questionnaire following entry into the trial with the Physical Component Scale values of the modified SF-36 at each of the timepoints. We hypothesised that the association would be greatest at 4&#x02005;weeks after enrolment compared to trial entry, time of delivery or at the time of questionnaire completion. In addition, data concerning breastfeeding and the health of the child were collected from the baby's growth booklet. This included breastfeeding duration, baby gender, age, weight and previous hospitalisation, if any, in addition to the baby's sleep quality since birth and specific growth data for the children as set by the APEG. Hb and ferritin levels for participants at delivery were available for all participants; however, no further testing was performed during the follow-up.

We are reporting on 126 patients in a follow-up study of the effect of intravenous iron versus oral iron therapy on HRQoL during and after pregnancy. Our study demonstrates that there was an improvement in the self-assessed feeling of general health in both treatment groups from the prelabour period to all subsequent periods. Although the improvement was significantly greater during pregnancy in the intravenous iron group 4&#x02005;weeks after commencement of trial treatment (p=0.001), the difference persisted in the subsequent measurement periods at a lesser magnitude that did not achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Regardless of treatment and regardless of which period was being considered, higher Hb and higher ferritin levels were associated with better baby sleep quality, a longer period of breastfeeding and a higher level of mothers&#x02019; general health.</p><p>The modified HRQoL questionnaire used in our study includes many useful and relevant aspects regarding general health, daily activities, levels of energy and depression. There was a substantial improvement of iron status in women who received intravenous iron compared to oral iron as demonstrated during the trial analysis (p&#x0003c;0.001). Limitations of our study include the modified questionnaire being in part a retrospective HRQoL evaluation that should ideally have been conducted within a shorter period of time. However, a correlation to a prospective evaluation of the studied subjects has been made in our study in order to overcome a possible recall bias. Therefore, we were able to minimise the number of retrospective questions, since the women were asked to recall their responses to each question at four different timepoints. The full SF-36 was impractical and may have been judged to be an excessive burden on the women. Thus, we attempted to provide a retrospective form of validation by showing that the clinical HRQoL questions in the physical domain, recorded prospectively at week 4 after trial, were most strongly associated with the Physical Component Scales of the recall of modified SF-36 at week 4 compared to the other timepoints. This indicates that the retrospective methodology was able to provide an acceptable degree of accuracy in the differentiation of HRQoL levels at different timepoints despite the concerns that may have arisen with this issue. The assumption being made is that the way those patients judge their physical and mental condition will be relatively stable over time,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> an assumption with which we agree may occur in patients with chronic diseases. However, this assumption may not hold for women during and after pregnancy. The expectations by the woman about how she should be feeling at the different stages of pregnancy, around the time of delivery, and when she is caring for one or more young infant or child may differ substantially at those different timepoints. At least in our analysis, the judgement the woman is making about how to answer the questions is likely to be the same for each timepoint, since she had made that judgement at one point in time: the repeated measures analysis compares each woman with herself, thus substantially reducing the impact of variation between women in this judgement. Thus, for the purpose of generating a hypothesis concerning iron status and quality of life, we believe that our methodology has been adequate. Another limitation of our study is the relatively small number of women studied. Nevertheless, prior to our study there was a lack of research that addressed HRQoL during and after pregnancy, and particularly the association between iron status and postnatal clinical depression as well as breastfeeding duration in our cohort of patients provides a novel finding and a basis for further research.</p><p>An incidental finding of our study was a trend for unfavourable mental health component outcomes for women with male babies. There is only a single report in the literature that addressed this issue and reported similar findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Perhaps this may be explained with the observation that male babies are usually more active, and this may be associated with postnatal depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> However, due to lack of more detailed data, this issue should be addressed separately and studied in future research.</p><p>Owing to paucity of data regarding HRQoL during and after pregnancy, there are only limited data available from other studies. Jansen <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> studied the effect of delivery and postpartum changes on the HRQoL. A cohort of 141 pregnant women were included in that study. HRQoL questionnaires were measuring the immediate effect of delivery on the quality of life. The HRQoL questionnaires were conducted less than 1&#x02005;day after vaginal delivery and less than 2&#x02005;days after delivery by caesarean section and compared to 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks postdelivery for both groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> The study focused on patients&#x02019; HRQoL recovery after both delivery interventions. In that study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> the different timepoints of completion of the questionnaire (immediately postdelivery and 3&#x02013;6 weeks thereafter) may not necessarily reflect the HRQoL during pregnancy and subsequently after the postpartum period. Furthermore, the immediate questionnaire after delivery and at 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks time in the postpartum period may have been influenced, at least in theory, by the event of delivery, in particular when complications occurred, as well as by the possible emotional and hormonal fluctuations during this period. It is worthwhile to note that the same study did not show any association between Hb and QoL; however, it did not investigate a possible effect of iron status on perceived HRQoL in conjunction with breastfeeding. This highlights our novel finding of the correlation between iron status and improved HRQoL during and after pregnancy.</p><p>In summary, we found a significant improvement in the general health of women who received intravenous iron (p&#x0003c;0.001), but this effect was found prominently 4&#x02005;weeks after the intravenous iron treatment. The duration of breast-feeding was longer (p=0.04) in those women who had received intravenous iron. Women with better iron status were less downhearted (p=0.005) and less likely to develop postnatal clinical depression (p=0.003).</p><p>Our results indicate that it is worthwhile considering Hb and iron status as a surrogate marker for assessment of women's well-being, not only during pregnancy, but also during the postnatal period.</p><p>Further studies are warranted to confirm and extend our findings, and to determine outcomes in different populations with IDA in order to improve the estimates of the magnitude of the benefits of intravenous iron for the management of IDA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e215" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-000998.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e216" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-000998.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research received a grant from the Clifford Craig Medical Research Trust, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia.
