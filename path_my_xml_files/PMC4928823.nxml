Recent data have demonstrated an increase of 48% in HIV infections in the 12&#x02013;24 year age group between 2003 and 2014. The vast majority of these occurred in young Black or Latino MSM [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].TGW also continue to have unacceptably high rates of HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] especially those who are involved in sex work [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Adolescents and young adults with HIV infection fare poorly in the US health care system; their rates of diagnosis of HIV infection, access to care, initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and viral suppression are all lower than among older populations [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These statistics reinforce the need to develop HIV prevention strategies that will be acceptable to, and used by, young MSM and TGW.</p><p>Topical microbicides are products that can be applied to the vaginal or rectal mucosa with the goal of preventing or significantly reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission including HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The CAPRISA 004 trial demonstrated the efficacy of pericoital tenofovir (TFV) 1% gel as a vaginal microbicide [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] although two subsequent TFV vaginal gel studies did not demonstrate efficacy, primarily because of suboptimal adherence [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Multiple early phase trials of antiretroviral rectal microbicides have been completed or are ongoing [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, since both TFV and cyanovirin have demonstrated efficacy in non-human primate rectal challenge models [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] there is a strong scientific rational for evaluation of rectal microbicides in human efficacy trials.</p><p>Preliminary research findings concerning the potential acceptability of a rectal microbicide have been highly encouraging [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Carballo-Di&#x000e9;guez et al. found that a sexually active cohort of middle aged MSM rated volumes of up to 35 ml of gel acceptable for use during anal intercourse [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Formative research from Peru has suggested that MSM and TGW might find oral and rectal antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) highly acceptable [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, information is lacking concerning microbicide acceptability in younger populations, particularly ethnic minority adolescent MSM and TGW.</p><p>Anorectal symptoms are common in the general population which may require medical attention or, more commonly, are self-medicated with over-the-counter preparations [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Regardless of etiology, anorectal conditions such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, abscesses, and dermatoses frequently have a shared presentation with symptoms of itch, pain, bleeding, swelling, or development of a mass lesion [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Condomless RAI places the anorectum at risk of a number of STIs that may be symptomatic or asymptomatic that includes; <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoea</italic> (GC), <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT), <italic>Lymphogranuloma venereum</italic> (LGV), syphilis, Herpes simplex type 2, and human papillomavirus (HPV) [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Anorectal symptoms are more common in MSM who practice RAI and RAI <italic>per se</italic> can cause anal fissures, anorectal ulcerations, hemorrhoids, and anorectal tears [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Anogenital STIs are associated with increased rates of incident HIV-1 infection; conversely, HIV-incidence is reduced when these infections are treated [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. From a clinical perspective, there are limited published data on the prevalence of STIs, HPV, HPV-associated anal dysplasia, anal fissures, and other anorectal pathologies or trauma that facilitate HIV infection in young MSM, particularly those of ethnic minority extraction [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Certain practices are known to damage the rectal mucosa and render it more vulnerable to infection. For example, the use of hyperosmolar rectal lubricants [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or certain enemas [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] can result in epithelial sloughing; furthermore, lubricants containing N-9 that transiently damages rectal epithelium continue to be used among some MSM [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There is a need to identify the extent of these behavioral practices and how they may contribute to the vulnerability of sexually active MSM.</p><p>The overall goal of this study was to evaluate the rectal acceptability, adherence, and safety of rectal microbicides in young MSM and TGW and to characterize associated behaviors and acquisition of STIs that might affect the effectiveness of antiretroviral rectal microbicides and to assess adherence to tenofovir gel in a phase I safety trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158310.s001">S1 File</xref>) and Protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158310.s002">S2 File</xref>).</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (IRB) on the 4<sup>th</sup> October, 2010, the University of Puerto Rico IRB on the 15<sup>th</sup> October, 2010, and Fenway Health IRB on the 30<sup>th</sup> July, 2010.

The first recruitment period took place between December 2010 and June 2012, focused on young MSM. All three sites used a combination of established research registries and community outreach events within the MSM and TGW communities to recruit potential study participants. The second one, with recruitment occurring between April and July 2013, focused on sex workers and included MSM and TGW. Recruitment of sex workers used similar strategies but intensified outreach activity within the sex worker community. The study consisted of three stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158310.g001">Fig 1</xref>) with target sample size for each stage determined by the primary objective of each stage. By study design, after completing a brief screening evaluation, 280 eligible participants, including up to 40 sex workers, were to be enrolled into Stage 1A and to undergo a baseline medical evaluation for both history and presence of STIs and anorectal health pathologies or injuries, as well as a detailed, web-based, baseline behavioral assessment. The first 140 eligible participants, including up to 20 sex workers, reporting at least one occasion of unprotected receptive anal intercourse (RAI) in the previous 3 months were to be enrolled into Stage 1B. In Stage 1B participants were asked to apply a hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) placebo gel [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] rectally prior to each episode of RAI over a 3-month period, reporting each use via an interactive voice response system (IVRS); they were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire and a video teleconference at the end of the 3 months and to bring in both used and unused applicators to the clinic to be counted. The first 24 eligible participants completing Stage 1B, excluding sex workers, were to be invited to enroll in Stage 2 and randomized to receive either TFV 1% gel or HEC placebo gel. Following a Baseline visit, participants returned to the clinic where a single dose of the study gel was administered. Within approximately 30 minutes, rectal swab and rectal biopsy specimens were obtained via anoscopy. After a one-week recovery period, participants returned to the clinic for assessment. If no significant adverse events (AEs) were reported, they self-administered once-daily outpatient doses of the study gel for 7 days, after which they returned to the clinic for evaluation and specimen collection. The study was conducted at three clinical sites: the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Fenway Health in Boston, Massachusetts; and the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan.</p><fig id="pone.0158310.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0158310.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Overview of study design and visit schedule.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0158310.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study population</title><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria varied by study stage. Stage 1A required that participants were biologically male, aged between 18 and 30 years at time of screening, HIV-uninfected or of unknown HIV status, had a history of consensual RAI in the previous month, and a history of one episode of condomless RAI in the previous year. Sex workers were also required to have a history of two episodes of transactional sex within the two months prior to study entry. There were no other specific exclusion criteria for Stage 1A other than the clinical investigator determining that the participant was not suitable for the study, unless participants had symptomatic rectal STIs. Stage 1B required that participants had completed Stage 1A, were HIV-uninfected, and had a history of at least one episode of unprotected RAI in the previous three months. Exclusion criteria for Stage 1B included active rectal STI requiring treatment, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, a history of inflammatory bowel disease, and an intention to have unprotected RAI with HIV-infected partners. Inclusion criteria for Stage 2 included completion of Stages 1A and 1B and being HIV-uninfected. Exclusion criteria included meeting any Stage 1B exclusion criteria, reporting a history of transactional sex, undergoing or completion of gender reassignment surgery, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities defined by the DAIDS toxicity table, abnormalities of the colorectal mucosa, significant gastrointestinal symptoms (such as a history of rectal bleeding), or a requirement to use drugs that were likely to increase the risk of bleeding following mucosal biopsy were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Study products</title><p>The TFV and HEC placebo gels were manufactured under direction from CONRAD (Arlington, VA) by DPT Laboratories (San Antonio, TX).

a microbicide gel if it provided some protection against HIV. Responses were provided on scales ranging from 1 = very unlikely to 10 = very likely. At baseline, most participants expressed high likelihood to use it every time they had RAI (M = 9.18, SD = 1.51), to use it with a lover (M = 8.24, SD = 2.53), with one-night stands (M = 9.35, SD = 1.70), with other partners (M = 9.15, SD = 1.84). Participants were also asked about their likelihood to use a rectal microbicide if it came in the form of a suppository or a rectal enema. In these cases, likelihood to use was still high (M = 7.67, SD = 2.71, and M = 6.56, SD = 3.10, respectively), although relatively less likely than if the microbicide were a gel.</p><p>At baseline, we also measured awareness of, and experiences with, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) via web-based CASI. Among the initially recruited MSM participants, 41% had heard of PEP, ranging from 16% in San Juan to 36% in Boston. Three had used PEP, none had used PrEP. Interest in both was high, with intentions to use PEP and PrEP respectively at 9.1 and 7.7 (10-point scale) [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Stage 1B</title><sec id="sec029"><title>Enrollment and retention</title><p>A total of 134 participants were enrolled into Stage 1B of Project Gel and 101 completed this phase of the study. 92.5% were MSM from the initial cohort, 7.5% were from the sex worker cohort, and 4.5% identified as female or transgender. The average age of study participants was 23.1 &#x000b1; 3.3 years. 75.4% of the participants completed follow-up in Stage 1B.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Adverse events</title><p>A total of 214 AEs were reported by the 134 participants in Stage 1B of the study. The majority of AEs were graded as mild (Grade 1; 69.2%) or moderate (Grade 2; 28.0%). The most common AEs were gastrointestinal (N = 46) with hemorrhoids (17%), constipation (13%), and rectal/anal itching (8%) being most commonly reported and infections (N = 53), with STIs accounting for 43% of the infections. Two Grade 3 and four Grade 4 AEs were not related to study product.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Sexually transmitted infections</title><p>At Visit 3 five participants were found to have rectal CT infection and three had rectal GC.

Rectal examination was normal in 79.5% and 89.5% of participants at Visits 3 and 4 respectively. As in Stage 1A, the most commonly reported abnormalities included warts, hemorrhoids, and fissure.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Behavioral data</title><p>For the MSM group recruited in the first period, adherence to product use was measured via CASI, IVRS, and by applicator count. These three sources were compared among participants who completed Stage 1B (N = 95). Based on CASI, 83 participants had RAI using gel on 82.4% of occasions (SD 26.7; 0&#x02013;100). Based on IVRS, 88 participants had RAI (median 10 occasions) using gel on 87.9% of occasions (SD 20.0; 20&#x02013;100). By applicator counts the median gel use was 12. Those who did not use the product consistently (n = 40) adduced not having it with them (85%), forgetting to use it (48%), not wanting to use it (13%), partner refusal (10%) and gel messiness (10%) [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>MSM participants recruited in the first period of the study also reported via CASI on product acceptability (i.e., satisfaction with applicator and gel, perceived gel side effects; and sexual satisfaction when gel was used) and likelihood of future microbicide use. Using linear regression, we found a positive association between future use intentions and applicator satisfaction (b = .33; p&#x0003c; .001), and based on an interaction effects model, greater gel satisfaction was associated with increased future use intention. However, the strength of this relationship was magnified when men reported greatest satisfaction with the rectal applicator [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>We also assessed acceptability of the gel and likelihood of future use across partner types among MSM recruited in the first period. Sixty-two men (71.3%) reported gel use with a lover (i.e., spouse-equivalent or boyfriend), 32 (36.8%) with a one-night stand (i.e., a man with whom you had sex once), and 29 (33.3%) with an "other" male partner. While gel acceptability was high across partner types, use with lovers was facilitated by trust and familiarity; yet, trust made participants feel that protection was less necessary. Conversely, participants expressed high likelihood of future gel use with one-night stands, whom they perceived as riskier; yet, they felt less comfortable discussing gel with them during the trial, often resorting to covert use or foregoing gel [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We also assessed men's history of lubricant use and acceptability of the gel's qualities as a lubricant during sex. Their preferences varied as to product viscosity, durability, residue, and mode of application [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Stage 2</title><sec id="sec035"><title>Enrollment and retention</title><p>A total of 24 participants were enrolled into and completed Stage 2 of Project Gel.

Acceptability ratings for TFV 1% gel did not differ from ratings for the HEC placebo gel. Most ratings on gel characteristics, applicator and applications process, product use, and liking the product were on the higher end of 10-point scales, indicating high acceptability. In some cases participants did not comment on certain characteristics of the gels, probably because delivering it inside the rectum with an applicator prevented them from assessing its color or scent. Participants were not asked to taste the gel; yet one participant scored this item. The few participants who reported in CASI experiencing some leakage (n = 7), bloating (N = 3), gassiness (N = 5), or urge to have a bowel movement (N = 5) reported not being bothered much by these side effects. As reported at baseline by the larger cohort before having had any experience with rectal use of the product, participants anticipated less likelihood of using a microbicide for RAI with a lover than

Applicator acceptability was rated on a scale of 1&#x02013;10, with 10 the highest rating. Although participants scoring of applicators indicated high likelihood of using either applicator in the future, many comments were recorded concerning problems with the applicators and suggestions for improvement. Those who tested both applicators liked the vaginal one significantly more than the rectal applicator (7.8 vs 5.2, p = 0.003). Improvements in portability, conspicuousness, aesthetics, tip comfort, product assembly, and packaging were suggested for both [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec041"><title>Discussion</title><p>Project Gel demonstrated that it is possible to enroll young high-risk MSM/TGW who are at increased risk for HIV/STI acquisition into a rectal microbicide study. The average age of participants in Stage 1A (23.3 years) contrasts with previous rectal microbicide Phase 1 studies where the average age of study participants was greater than 35 years [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Enrollment of younger MSM into HIV prevention studies is important as this high-risk group is often underrepresented in HIV prevention trials. However, Newman et al. recently presented data from a discrete choice experiment in which more than 400 young Thai MSM and TGW (Mean age 24.3 years) were asked to provide feedback on rectal microbicide attributes. Anticipated high product use was associated with the following factors: high product efficacy, intermittent use, a gel rather than a suppository, and availability via prescription rather than over-the-counter [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition other important studies, conducted in Peruvian MSM and TGW, have used conjoint analysis to explore the impact of product and user characteristics on the acceptability of rectal microbicides [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, Phase 1 HIV prevention studies are conducted in low-risk populations. This strategy, although understandable from a product safety perspective, limits the generalizability of the study data. Low-risk participants are likely to view HIV prevention research in a different context to individuals at significant risk of HIV acquisition and may therefore have a different perspective towards product acceptability and desirability. It was noteworthy that Project Gel required that study participants should have a history of condomless RAI. This resulted in recruitment of a population who were at increased risk of HIV infection but who may also have been harder to retain in the study. Study retention varied from 75.4% in Stage 1B to 100% in Stage 2. It is likely that the lower retention in Stage 1B related to the longer duration of this phase of Project Gel but also to the type of participant enrolled in the study. The most common reason for premature discontinuation from Stage 1B was a change in social circumstances such as a new job or the need to move to a new city for employment. Innovative strategies to improve retention of young MSM will be required for the Phase 2/3 evaluation of rectal microbicides where study duration can exceed 18 months.</p><p>The prevalence of STIs in Stage 1A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0158310.t002">Table 2</xref>) was similar or lower than previously published data but this observation is confounded by the fact that many MSM studies have often enrolled older populations attending STI clinics. Project Gel appeared to enroll less risky young MSM since the HIV prevalence in our population was 2.0% which is lower than previous estimates of 4.2% for MSM under 25 years of age [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, the inclusion criteria for Stage 1A stated that participants should be HIV-uninfected or unaware of their status, and this may have selected for a lower prevalence population. Project Gel HIV prevalence data was also much lower than recent estimates for all North American MSM (15.4%) [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This is probably an age-related phenomenon, and recent incidence may be a more relevant metric for characterizing the risk profile of this population than prevalence (which includes cumulative incidence). In this regard, two new HIV infections were identified at the end of Stage 1B during which 134 participants were followed for 12 weeks. This approximates to an annual HIV incidence rate of 6.4% and illustrates that the Project Gel participants were indeed high-risk. The prevalence of anal and oral HPV infection was similar to that seen in an Australian cohort of young MSM [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection was similar to data collected from MSM in the UK [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and San Francisco [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Urethral infections were uncommon compared to other studies in German and South African MSM [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Rectal GC (1.2%) was also uncommon compared to a large multi-center study in the US where rates were 10.2%. In contrast, rectal CT infection (10.1%) was similar to other published studies [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Despite counselling and condom provision, Project Gel participants continued to acquire STIs during Stage 1B and Stage 2. These data are concerning as viral and bacterial STIs, particularly anorectal STIs, are a risk factor for the acquisition of HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>HRA allows the perianus, anal canal, and distal rectal to be visualized anoscopically by using a light source and magnification. Unlike the rectum, the anal canal is surrounded by the internal and external anal sphincter that makes it liable to mucosal trauma and infection during RAI. The presence of anal findings was less likely to be noted by naked eye exam. This is an important finding for future studies as inflammatory conditions and infections that may facilitate incident HIV infection can be detected by HRA.</p><p>Our findings regarding gel and applicator acceptability point to several critical factors for rectal microbicide development. First, gel acceptability and likelihood of use is influenced by several factors, including partner type [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and product viscosity (Frasca et al, in press). Therefore, a successful microbicide gel would have higher acceptability if positioned as a sexual pleasure enhancer, and it should be available in a range of viscosities. That way, it could be presented to partners as a gel with the qualities they seek to improve sexual satisfaction, and secondarily to prevent HIV. Furthermore, neither the rectal nor the vaginal applicator was ideal as a gel delivery system [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our findings show that applicator satisfaction may be a salient factor in decision-making to use a rectal microbicide in the future (Bauermeister et al, in press). Therefore, further attention is needed to develop user-friendly, quick-acting rectal microbicide delivery systems [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Overall adherence to gel use with RAI in Stage 1B was high. Adherence data are based primarily on self-report and may be biased due to recall, missed reporting, or social desirability bias. However, Project Gel integrated multiple modalities of self-report including computer assisted self-interview and interactive voice response systems that may have reduced this potential problem [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The main reason for not using the gel was not having it available when needed. Improvements in applicator portability may contribute to increased microbicide use. Adherence measures in this trial, including self-report via CASI and IVRS and product count, were compared to assess convergence. Although self-reports may be subject to social desirability and produce inflated results, we observed convergence among results obtained with different methods. In the absence of a gold standard to measure adherence, these findings continue to support the use of data convergence as a method for adherence measurement in future rectal microbicide trials.</p><p>Finally, few participants were aware of PEP and PrEP as prevention options at the start of the study, but their interest was high after learning of these options. Increased public education is needed to raise awareness of PEP and PrEP as HIV prevention methods among MSM and TGW with potential risk behavior; given that they would be likely to use these methods once they become aware of them [<xref rid="pone.0158310.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In this study we were able to enroll a sexually active population of young MSM/TGW who were willing to use placebo and antiretroviral rectal microbicides. TFV gel was safe and acceptable and should be further developed as an alternative HIV prevention intervention for this population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec042"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158310.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Project Gel CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158310.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158310.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Project Gel Trial protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158310.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158310.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of visits.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158310.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158310.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Detailed summary of adverse events.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158310.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Project Gel participants for volunteering their time for this study.
