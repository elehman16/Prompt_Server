For bevacizumab only two clinical trials have been published and a head-to-head comparison is lacking to date. However, if proved non-inferior to ranibizumab, use of the off-label bevacizumab could reduce costs enormously without a loss in visual acuity.

In patients with DR, diabetic macular edema (DME) is the main cause of permanent decrease of vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Until recently, the treatment options were focal and grid laser photocoagulation and intra-vitreal injections with corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but their efficacy is limited. The recent introduction of the anti-VEGF agent ranibizumab (Lucentis) represents an important improvement in the treatment of DME. Ranibizumab is a Fab fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), a major causal factor in DME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In several large randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], patients treated with ranibizumab had a better visual outcome than those treated with sham injections and/or laser therapy. Ranibizumab given as monthly injections, or in an &#x02018;as needed&#x02019; scheme, led to a 6&#x02013;10 letters better mean visual acuity after 12&#x000a0;months compared to control groups. The maximum effect of ranibizumab was observed around 6&#x000a0;months, after which the effect stabilized. In addition to its effect on visual acuity, ranibizumab markedly decreased retinal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and significantly improved patient reported quality of life parameters.</p><p>Bevacizumab (Avastin) is the full length anti-VEGF-A antibody from which ranibizumab is derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Bevacizumab has been used off-label on a widespread scale by ophthalmologists in the US and Europe, and has gradually become standard care in the treatment of DME in The Netherlands, since the first results of the ranibizumab RCT&#x02019;s became available in 2009. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab 1.25&#x000a0;mg in the treatment of DME have been demonstrated in a number of case series and two RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Bevacizumab was found to improve visual acuity by approximately 8 letters at 3&#x02013;12 months follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Bevacizumab markedly reduced retinal thickness on OCT, to a similar extent as reported for ranibizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Conclusive evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) directly comparing bevacizumab and ranibizumab is lacking.</p><p>Nepomuceno et al. recently completed a head to head comparison in 63 eyes. Patients were treated monthly if the central retinal field thickness was more than 275&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m with either bevacizumab or ranizumab for one year. They observed a significant improvement in both groups at all study visits. The improvement was significantly greater in the ranibizumab group compared with the bevacizumab group at week 8 and 32. There was no significant difference in decrease in central retinal thickness. The mean number of injections was significantly higher in the bevacizumab group (9.84) than in the ranibizumab group (7.67) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>At this moment two other trials are ongoing. NCT01627249 is a single blind study comparing the effectiveness of intravitreal aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumaf for DME. Six hundred sixty patients will be treated over a one year time frame. The primary outcome is change in BCVA. The secondary outcome is the number of injections.</p><p>The other trial, NCT01610557 is a double blind comparison of ranibizumab as monotherapy and ranibizumab and bevacizumab consecutively.</p><p>Finally there was a double blind trial, NCT00545870, comparing bevacizumab to ranibizumab for diabetic retinopathy in 60 patients. However it has been suspended.</p><p>The costs of bevacizumab are 20 - to 40 fold lower than the costs of ranibizumab, and it has been estimated that in the Netherlands alone, the costs of ranibizumab treatment of DME would be around 10&#x02013;15 million Euros higher than treatment with bevacizumab.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The BRDME study is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked comparative clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient population</title><p>All patients with vision loss due to DME and foveal thickening (as determined on OCT) that may benefit from anti-VEGF treatment are potentially eligible for the study (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>1. patients&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years of age who have signed an informed consent.</td></tr><tr><td>2.

Starting from a common standard deviation - based on observations in previous trials with ranibizumab in DME - of the change in BCVA score of 11 letters in both groups, and assuming an improvement from baseline of 6&#x02013;8 letters in both the ranibizumab group and the bevacizumab group, a sample size of 246 patients (123 in each group) has an 80 % power of demonstrating non-inferiority by excluding a difference of 3.5 letters or more, using a one-sided Student&#x02019;s <italic>T</italic>-test and a significance level of 0.05. The mean improvement of 7 letters is the average of the changes observed in the placebo-controlled trials discussed earlier. The margin of non-inferiority is equivalent to less than half this improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>According to the intention-to-treat principle all randomized patients are included in the final analyses.</p><p>The primary outcome measure is the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to month 6 as assessed with ETDRS-like VA charts. When visual acuity is measured in this manner, a 15 letter gain means a doubling of the visual acuity, and a 15 letter loss means that acuity is halved. As the measure of effectiveness, the mean BCVA score at month 6 in the ranibizumab group is compared with the mean score in the bevacizumab group, corrected for baseline differences. The confidence interval for the difference in mean BCVA change scores are reported. We also test statistically for non-inferiority of bevacizumab to ranibizumab using the <italic>T</italic>-test for independent samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ecomomic evaluation</title><p>If the non-inferiority of bevacizumab to ranibizumab can be demonstrated, then the economic evaluation will be performed as a cost-minimization analysis from a societal perspective. If bevacizumab turns out to be inferior, then the question arises whether the health losses are in reasonable balance with the expected cost savings. In that situation a cost-utility analysis will be performed with the cost per quality-adjusted life-year as outcome parameter. The analysis will be based on (i) the observed cost and visual acuity data, and (ii) available and upcoming literature on health utility associated with different levels of visual acuity. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] If a cost-utility analysis seems opportune, sensitivity analyses will be done to study the robustness of using patient-based preferences instead of general population based preferences in order to derive health utilities. The latter ones will be reported as the main outcome.</p><p>Costs will include the direct medical costs of diagnosis and treatment restricted to (potential) vision loss, including the use of visual aids. Only the medical costs attributable to loss of vision or the prevention thereof will be included in this population with a high risk of co-morbid conditions. Costs will be estimated as the product-sum of the volumes of resources used and their respective unit costs. The cost items will include visits to the health care providers (e.g., ophthalmologist, optometrists, and general practitioners), medication use, and ophthalmic equipment for imaging (Digital Imaging Systems, Fundus Camera&#x02019;s, Optical Coherence Tomography) and operating theatres. Patient-related costs will include the costs of health-related travel and over-the-counter medication. In this population data on loss of productivity will also be collected. The use of resources will be documented in the case record forms and by an additional questionnaire to be completed at baseline and at 3-monthly intervals by the study participants. Unit costing will be based on the national guideline on costing in health care research, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] supplemented by mean local unit costing data from participating reference centres and practices.

First, we have to investigate in a well designed head-to-head comparison whether or not both medicines are equally effective, or at least, bevacizumab is not inferior to ranibizumab. For age-related macular degeneration clinical trials have demonstrated non-inferiority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] We cannot extrapolate these results to DME because the mechanism of vision loss in DME by intraretinal edema in diabetes is not the same as that of subretinal neovascularization and scarring as in macular degeneration.</p><p>We could have included aflibercept in our comparison too. At the time we designed the study there was very limited data about this medicine. We would need to enrol many more patients to be able to perform the comparison which is at present not feasible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Summary</title><p>In order to determine the best first line anti-VEGF medicine in the treatment of DME we decided to set up a head-to-head comparison with monthly injections during six months. The primary clinical target is the improvement of best corrected visual acuity, while the primary health economic target is cost reduction without a loss in health gain as measured by a change in visual acuity or by quality adjusted life years.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DR</term><def><p>Diabetic retinopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DME</term><def><p>Diabetic macular edema</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized clinical trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCT</term><def><p>Optical tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FA</term><def><p>Fluoroangiography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCVA</term><def><p>Best corrected visual acuity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IOP</term><def><p>Intraocular pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIA</term><def><p>Transient ischemic attack</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>FV.
