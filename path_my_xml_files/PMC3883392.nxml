Previous studies have shown that hyperosmolar sodium lactate (HSL) infusion has improved cardiac performance with smaller volume infusion, which resulted in negative fluid balance.

We excluded the patients who needed combined operations and intra-aortic balloon pump, patients with severe arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter with rapid response, heart block), the presence of severe haemodynamic imbalance, severe bleeding and/or re-operation, liver dysfunction as indicated by serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase &#x0003e;2 times normal value) and renal failure (creatinine level &#x0003e;180 &#x003bc;mol/L). Signed informed consent was obtained from all eligible patients or the next of kin if the patient was not able to comprehend or unable to accept and sign informed consent.</p><p>Patients underwent routine monitoring including 5-lead electrocardiography, radial, central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery (PA) catheters, pulse oximetry, blood, urine and temperature monitoring. Following pre-medication with intravenous midazolam (2.5-5 mg), anaesthesia was induced with 3-5 mg/kgBW propofol, titrated and adjusted based on patients haemodynamic status and clinical condition and 1-2 &#x003bc;g/kgBW sufentanil. A dose of 0.1-0.2 mg/kgBW pancuronium bromide was administered for intubation.</p><p>Anaesthesia and haemodynamic stability during surgery was maintained with continuous infusion of 1.0-1.5 mg/kgBW of propofol as baseline hypnosis, coupled with titration of inhalational anaesthesia agent (sevoflurane). Then propofol was continued as post-operative sedation with patient warming and improvement in CO. Intravenous bolus of sufentanil was administered in case of poor analgesia and/or increase in blood pressure or heart rate at 30% or more. Nitroglycerin was continuously infused only for a tight indication, such as for patients with left main coronary artery occlusion or low ejection fraction (&#x0003c;40%) with multiple coronary occlusions, or if there were any signs of revascularisation injury. The infusion rate was modulated according to the blood pressure at 0.5 to 2 &#x003bc;g/kgBW/h. CO/cardiac index (CI), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)/pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR)/systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) were also measured and monitored intermittently by PA catheter to ensure that the haemodynamic status was normal during the infusion.</p><p>For cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the extracorporeal circuit consisted of a roller pump (Sarns 8000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and a membrane oxygenator (Capiox Sx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The pump flow was 2.4 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>. During CPB, patients were cooled to 31-32&#x000b0;C and received intermittent antegrade normothermic blood cardioplegia, a mixture of 400-600 mL of oxygenated blood with graduated doses of potassium-magnesium solution. Standard systemic heparinisation (3 mg/kgBW) was performed and an activated clotting time of greater than 480 s was maintained during CPB. Heparin was neutralized with protamine sulphate on discontinuation.</p><p>Patients were randomised by block permutation with block size of 3. Randomisation was conducted by an independent nurse and random allocation was concealed within a thick envelope. Study drug was administered by a nurse according to random allocation; hence the investigator was blind about the treatment. Similar dose of HSL or HES solutions were administered at 3 mL/kgBW within 15 min at the beginning of surgery (after induction and fasting fluid replacement). Additional fluid were given as needed, which was managed similarly in both groups. Types and amount of additional fluids administered were recorded.</p><p>Patients were intensively monitored during surgical procedure. The haemodynamic parameters were recorded on baseline and immediately after study fluid administration including heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), CO, CI, CVP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure, SVR and PVR. SVRI and PVRI were subsequently calculated using standard formulae. Laboratory parameters including arterial pH, PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>), haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, blood electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium), blood glucose and blood lactate were recorded. Intra-operative fluid input, urine output, bleeding volume and fluid balance were also measured at the end of surgery. Any adverse event during the study period was documented.</p><p>Sample size calculation in this study was based on the anticipated minimal difference of CI between control and treatment group (delta value).

The within-group (HSL vs. HES) changes between baseline and loading dose was evaluated using ANOVA. The multivariate analysis was conducted to see the influence of each covariate on CI.

Lactate plays an important role as an energy substrate for cardiac cells and many studies showed that lactate administration directly improved cardiac performance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Previous studies have showed that administration of HSL for post cardiac surgery patients resulted in better cardiac performance and tissue perfusion when compared with hypertonic sodium chloride 3%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Until now, we did not find any publication comparing the efficacy of HSL with colloid in cardiac surgery setting, therefore we conducted this study. The randomisation resulted in comparable baseline parameters between HSL and HES group.</p><p>This study revealed that HSL infusion resulted higher increase of CI with lower SVRI than HES infusion despite comparable intravascular volume expansion, as indicated by comparable changes in MAP and CVP in both groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the decrease of SVRI was mostly associated with the improvement of CI and this finding was consistent with the previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The decrease of PVR/PVRI and also alkalinizing effect of HSL also contributed to improved cardiac performance. The increase in myocardial contractility directly related to the increase in cardiac performance and lactate has been shown to improve cardiac contractility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Unfortunately in this study, we did not record the cardiac contractility after study fluid infusion, but we strongly feel that the lactate contributed for the improvement of cardiac performance. The decrease of vascular resistance after hypertonic solution infusion has been attributed to its hypertonicity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and we postulate that the same mechanism worked during HSL infusion in this study. Previous studies have showed that the intravascular volume expansion after hyperosmolar solution infusion as indicated by the improvement of MAP and CVP contributed for increasing CI[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] however the vascular expansion was comparable between HSL and HES group in this study.</p><p>In this study, lower total fluid input with comparable total fluid output resulted in a much negative fluid balance in HSL group, whereas it became positive in HES group. This finding is in accordance with previous trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] This effect is could be due to a redistribution of interstitial fluid and mobilisation of intracellular fluid from swollen endothelial cells to intravascular space. Endothelial cell swelling and accumulation of interstitial fluid frequently occurred in major surgery patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Reduction of endothelial cell swelling and mobilisation of extra vascular fluid into intravascular space following hypertonic solution administration were beneficial during cardiac surgery because it would reduce tissue oedema and improve microcirculation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>Overall, HSL could be considered as an ideal fluid in cardiac surgery due to its ability to maintain haemodynamic status and improve CI with negative fluid balance. The goal of perioperative fluid therapy is not only to maintain the effective circulatory volume, but also to avoid fluid overload whenever possible. Tissue oedema in surgical patients should be minimised because it increases the morbidity and mortality.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>The infusion of HSL was well-tolerated since there was no adverse event during this study and laboratory parameters were still in normal range in both groups. Sodium level increased and chloride level decreased after HSL infusion, however the average levels were still within the normal limits. In contrast, in HES group sodium level slightly decreased and chloride levels increased. Hypernatremia, one of the potential side-effects of hyperosmolar fluid infusion, was not found in this study, as also was the case in previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Osmolality and electroneutrality principles were suspected responsible for the decrease of plasma chloride level after sodium lactate infusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>After study drugs administration, arterial pH, HCO<sub>3</sub> and base excess reached normal levels in HSL group, whereas in HES group base excess and HCO<sub>3</sub> were almost unchanged and still below normal range. This finding indicated that HSL infusion could completely reverse tissue acidosis, whereas HES infusion did not improve the existing tissue acidosis. Reversal of tissue acidosis in this study could be due to mild alkalinisation effect of HSL. This was an expected result, considering that infusion of HSL will increase the strong ion difference as a consequence of higher sodium and lower chloride in the HL patients after lactate gets metabolised.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Number of patients requiring concomitant supportive drug during cardiac surgery such as vasodilator and inotropes was numerically less in HSL group.
