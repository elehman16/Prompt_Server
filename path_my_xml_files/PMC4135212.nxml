information which is entered, according to circumstances and physical conditions, all the
time, and appropriate sensory input is necessary for normal postural reflexes and
adjustments. Senses are classified into somatic, special, and visceral. All of these 3
senses are indispensable for daily living activities, and it becomes difficult to execute
smooth movements if one of them does not appropriately function. Hearing is a sensory
response to sound vibrations at 20 to 20,000&#x02005;Hz, detected through the cochlea in the bony
labyrinth as a receptor perceiving the direction of a sound source and providing a basis for
postural control and voluntary movements in daily life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among previous studies, Russolo<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that fluctuations of the center of gravity toward the source of pure tone stimulation at
500&#x02005;Hz and 105 dB were observed in all healthy individuals with normal hearing. However,
when Shibata et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study,
involving 7 healthy subjects and using Russolo&#x02019;s method, responses were not characteristic,
and fluctuations of the center of gravity were observed along both the X- and Y-axes. Watson
et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a lower-limb muscle
reflex as a response to a clicking sound, while Furubayashi<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> performed surface electromyography to measure tibialis anterior and
pectoralis major muscle contraction with sound stimulation at 110 dB in 7 healthy adults.
The author also previously reported that major sound stimulation temporarily reduces the
excitability of the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, depending on the intensity and
duration of the sound. The startle reflex as a somatic, reflexive motor response to sudden,
intense sensory stimulation has also been examined using auditory stimulation in most cases.
In the auditory startle reflex, a reflexive response is generally generated in the
craniocervical region, and expands to the extremities. Based on these findings, sound
stimulation is likely to change muscle tone and consequently affect flexibility. Although
auditory stimulation is used for the functional assessment of the saccule and
saccule-derived vestibule-cervical reflex in clinical environments, there have been no
reports regarding its influences on posture-related muscle tone and movements. Considering
such a situation, the present study aimed to clarify the influences of sound stimulation as
a type of auditory stimulation on the body.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 9 healthy youths (2 males and 7 females) were studied, excluding those with
orthopedic or neurological abnormalities. With a view to adopting a crossover design to
treat all subjects with both sound and control stimulation, they were randomized into 2
groups: those initially undergoing sound stimulation (5, &#x0201c;preceding&#x0201d;); and those initially
undergoing control stimulation (4, &#x0201c;following group&#x0201d;). They were also provided with
sufficient written and oral explanations regarding the study objective and methods, as
well as personal information management, to obtain their written consent. This study was
conducted with the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the International
University of Health and Welfare (approval number: 12-25.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>As a stimulus, a sound was created at 1,000&#x02005;Hz and 70 dB with a standard signal
generator, and was entered into the subjects through an earphone on both sides for 2
seconds. To prevent measurement-related carryover effects, an interval of 1 week was
inserted between the intervention and control periods.</p><p>Before and after the intervention and control periods, the finger-floor distance (FFD),
functional reach (FR), hamstring muscle hardness, and reaction time (RT) were
measured.</p><p>Based on a physical fitness test developed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,
Science, and Technology and using the Standing Trunk Flexion Meter (Takei Co., Ltd.), the
FFD was measured while standing on a 30-cm table. The measurement was repeated twice at an
interval of 1 minute to measure absolute values, and means were adopted for statistics. On
measurement, the subjects were instructed to maintain their knee joints completely
straight and place their feet close to the anterior edge of the table, with a distance of
5&#x02005;cm between the tiptoes of both feet and the heels contacting each other. Subsequently,
they bent forward to push down a measurement bar with the hands joined and fingers
straight. Based on the level of the upper surface of the table as 0&#x02005;cm, those at which
they were able to maintain the bar with the lowest part of the fingertips of both hands
for 2 seconds were measured in cm, adopting values in the first decimal place.</p><p>The FR measurement was initiated in a standing position, with both arms naturally hanging
down. Subsequently, the subjects bent forward as much as possible for 5 seconds, with
upper-limb flexion at 90 degrees, and returned to the original position, taking 5 seconds.
The length of the trace of the fingertips in the horizontal direction during this movement
was measured twice using a measuring tape, and means were adopted as representative values
in cm, rounding them down to the first decimal place. The hardness of the right medial
part of the hamstrings was measured twice in a prone position, using a muscle hardness
meter (NEUTONE TDM-N1). Similar measurements were performed before and after
intervention.</p><p>The RT was measured using a portable auditory stimulator (Hitachi Living Systems, Ltd.,
DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER i.&#x003bc;&#x02019;s) and recorder (Olympus Corporation, Voice-Trek V-62). An sound
stimulation file was created by compiling a vocal advance notice signal and stimulating
sound (50&#x02005;msec) using a personal computer with voice processing software Digion Sound 5
(DigiOn Inc.). The intervals between the advance notice signal and stimulating sound and
between the latter and the following advance notice signal were randomly set at 2.0 to 0.5
seconds, based on a table of random numbers. On measurement, the subjects were instructed
to implement a task of responding to the stimulating sound emitted after the vocal advance
notice signal as soon as possible in a standing position. The task was sufficiently
rehearsed before measurement, and the RT was measured 5 times to adopt means as
representative values. The sounds generated by the subjects were recorded with the
recorder.</p><p>For statistics, baseline values before stimulation were compared between the groups,
using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance and the Bonferroni method for
multiple comparisons. Variations in measurement values before and after intervention were
also compared by conducting a t-test. All statistical procedures were implemented using
SPSS 17.0, with the significance level set at 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were not significant differences between the groups in baseline values before

comparison between before and after intervention and that of the variation between
conditions. The RT improved most markedly with sound stimulation. It represents the entire
process from stimulation input to response, which is divided into the following periods:
receiving stimulation through the receptor and transmitting it to the primary sensory area;
processing stimulation-related information in the high-functioning areas of the brain for
cognition, classification, and motor preparation; and transmitting an order generated in the
primary motor area to the effector. The position of the body and posture, arousal of the
central nervous system, synaptic transmission speed, and attention level have been reported
to be factors influencing the RT<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Kurosawa et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the influences
of variations in the auditory stimulation intensity level on the simple RT of the upper
limb, and reported that the RT was shortened with increased stimulation intensity. Based on
these findings, RT shortening may be considered to represent central nervous system activity
to process stimulation-related information, and, in the present study, it was observed,
presumably as a result of the expansion of the activating region of the brain with sound
stimulation, increasing the synaptic transmission speed.</p><p>The FFD is an index to measure the thoracolumbar range of flexion, which may be limited by
factors, such as hamstring shortening and abnormal muscle tone in the lower back<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sound stimulation has been reported to
temporarily suppress the activity of the motor areas of the cerebral cortex<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. As these areas are involved in muscle tone
adjustments, in the present study, decreased muscle tone due to their suppression may have
increased extensibility, consequently improving the flexibility of the thoracolumbar region
and hamstrings. Furthermore, sound stimulation at 80 dB or more has been reported to induce
the startle reflex as a somatic motor reflex<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and considering the similar stimulation intensity level, such a
reflex may also have been generated in the present study, inducing flexor contraction. By
the mechanism of reciprocal innervation, this may also have suppressed extensor muscle tone,
improving flexibility.</p><p>Sound stimulation improved the RT and flexibility, supporting the usefulness of physical
therapy approaches using it to improve the physical condition, warm up, and prevent injury
in clinical environments in which it is necessary to obtain favorable treatment outcomes
within a limited time frame. Further studies are needed to compare various sound stimuli and
examine the duration of the effects. Considering the possibility of the vocal advance notice
signal used to measure the RT having served as a stimulus, it may also be necessary to
measure and compare RTs using other advance notice signals, such as visual stimuli.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gotoh</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Functional Anatomy of the Center Nervous System&#x02014;Sensory
