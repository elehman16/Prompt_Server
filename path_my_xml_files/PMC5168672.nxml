Both are associated with psychological distress, such as heightened anxiety and low mood,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and are prevalent in a range of psychological disorders (see ref. <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Moreover, worry and rumination are central to two particular emotional disorders. Uncontrollable worry about multiple topics is the key diagnostic criterion of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD),<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> while rumination is a common feature of depression.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Worry and rumination differ in thought content and in aspects such as temporal orientation (eg, future threats in GAD and past/ongoing concerns of failure in depression<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Their overlapping characteristics as well as their co-occurrence within individuals and across disorders have led worry and rumination to be conceptualised as a transdiagnostic process<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> termed repetitive negative thinking (RNT). While worry and rumination may be characterised by a common thought process with distinct content, it remains unclear whether they are underpinned by the same cognitive mechanisms. This is especially important to elucidate given the role of RNT in maintaining clinical disorders (see ref. <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and to inform approaches for therapeutic intervention. The present multisession experimental study aims to investigate interpretation bias&#x02014;the tendency to make certain interpretations about ambiguous information&#x02014;as part of a cognitive mechanism underlying RNT in relation to worry in GAD and rumination in depression.</p><p>Hirsch and Mathews<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> identified three processes underlying RNT in the form of pathological worry: namely, emotional processing biases towards negative information, a verbal thinking style and deficits in attentional control. In the current study, we focus on emotional processing biases and specifically on negative interpretation bias, the tendency to habitually interpret ambiguous information as negative or threatening, to investigate whether negative interpretation bias plays a causal role in worry and rumination. Negative interpretations are prevalent in GAD and depression<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13</xref> (for a review, see ref. <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Its causal impact on worry and rumination has been examined using cognitive bias modification for interpretations (CBM-I), an experimental paradigm which repeatedly resolves ambiguous situations (often realistic scenarios capturing situations occurring in daily life) to favour certain (eg, positive) interpretations and thus aims to train a particular interpretive style (see refs. <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>&#x000a0;for a review). In single experimental CBM-I sessions in clinical participants with GAD and non-clinical participants with high levels of trait worry, selectively training benign interpretations reduces worry,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> while consistently reinforcing negative interpretations increases state rumination.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These findings point to a causal role of interpretation bias in worry and rumination. Thus, interpretation bias seems a promising candidate process to target using interventions designed to reduce worry and rumination and hence RNT.</p><p>Although pivotal for our theoretical understanding, single-session CBM-I studies are unable to address the sustained impact of changing interpretation bias. Multisession CBM-I, providing repeated training over several days to weeks and including a post-training follow-up period, is necessary to investigate the longer term training success of CBM-I on &#x02018;near-transfer&#x02019; measures of interpretation bias and &#x02018;far-transfer&#x02019; effects relating to central aspects of the disorder such as reductions in RNT, anxiety and depression symptoms. Initial multisession studies training positive interpretations revealed promising effects of CBM-I in reducing anxiety<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> and depression.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, more recent multisession studies have presented mixed findings, with some showing that both CBM-I and active control conditions, in which no training effects are expected (eg, because positive and negative interpretations are presented with equal frequency) reduce negative interpretation bias.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> It is possible that repeated exposure even to 50% positive interpretations may lead to an incidental training effect over time and to reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> (see ref. <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, online supplementary materials, for considerations regarding the design of CBM-I studies). Thus, active control conditions which are closely matched to aspects of CBM-I (structure of sessions, number of sessions, experimenter contact, etc) but do not target resolution of ambiguity may be needed to demonstrate that effects of CBM-I are indeed driven by changes in interpretations. In the present study, we include an active control condition in which our training materials are adapted to remain ambiguous (no resolution of ambiguity); this was chosen over conditions in which materials are unambiguous (eg, ref. <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, study 2) which have also shown training effects.</p><p>Multisession CBM-I has the potential to shed light on the role of interpretation bias in sustaining worry and rumination and was developed to test hypotheses regarding causality. Previous studies on CBM-I have focused on its possible clinical utility (eg, it has been compared to cognitive behavioural therapy<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) with a focus on reducing psychological distress (notably anxiety and depression), rather than with a view of better understanding cognitive mechanisms underlying RNT in clinical disorders. In this vein, although single-session studies have tailored training materials specifically to worry<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and rumination-related<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> concerns, training materials in multisession studies often relate to broader symptoms of anxiety and depression rather than RNT. Thus, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the role of interpretations specifically in relation to RNT. In the present study, we tailor our CBM-I (and control) materials to common worry and rumination concerns with the hope of training interpretations made in the context of RNT (see also ref. <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> regarding the necessity to closely match materials used to assess or modify interpretation bias to ambiguity related to the key constructs&#x02014;in this case RNT&#x02014;being investigated).</p><p>The importance of considering the context in which interpretations are trained is further highlighted by research into another type of emotional processing bias, namely attentional bias towards negative or threatening information. Engaging in a period of experimentally induced worry in its typical verbal form increases attention to threat cues,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> indicating that worry may activate latent cognitive biases. Consistent with this (although in a different disorder), activating concerns in individuals with social anxiety disorder by exposure to idiosyncratic anxiety-provoking situations enhances the effects of subsequent attention training, leading to a greater reduction in social anxiety symptoms.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This may be due to (re-)activation of emotional processing biases, rendering these more malleable and susceptible to modification, akin to findings in the memory reconsolidation literature.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>While providing tentative evidence that activating emotional processing biases via RNT (or exposure) may be beneficial in enhancing training effects, this has not yet been explored in relation to CBM-I. This is despite evidence that a depression-specific interpretation bias is most likely to be demonstrated in the context of depressive rumination.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Building on this evidence, we seek to examine whether engaging in RNT prior to CBM-I, proposed to activate interpretation bias, will moderate the effects of CBM-I on interpretation bias, RNT and psychological distress. Although the attention bias literature points to a potential beneficial effect of prior RNT, it must be considered that Kuckertz <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> focused on social anxiety rather than RNT. RNT, especially in its typical verbal form, depletes attentional control.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;35</xref> Thus, it is possible that worrying or ruminating prior to CBM-I may hinder beneficial effects of training. Furthermore, effects of prior RNT may differ for the two diagnostic groups. As the first multisession study to test the proposed moderating role of RNT prior to training, we compare CBM-I with an induced period of RNT before training to CBM-I without such an induction (ie, standard CBM-I). Based on memory reconsolidation studies showing it is necessary to allow 10&#x02005;min after reactivation for reconsolidation processes to be initiated (see ref. <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), participants in the condition with an induced period of RNT will engage in RNT on a recent RNT topic, followed by CBM-I relating to various worry or rumination topics (see also the Experimental conditions section). To further augment the impact of prior RNT on training, we then present CBM-I materials matched in content to participants' current RNT topic 10&#x02005;min after their period of RNT. Participants in the standard CBM-I condition will be asked to indicate a recent RNT topic without subsequently engaging in RNT, and will also receive tailored CBM-I materials 10&#x02005;min after completing a neutral (non-RNT) task.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Study objectives (rationale and comparators)</title><p>This experimental study aims to investigate whether worry and rumination, two forms of RNT, share underlying cognitive mechanisms. We focus on negative interpretation bias, a transdiagnostic cognitive process prevalent in GAD and depression (see ref. <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and shown to play a causal role in influencing levels of worry<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and rumination<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in single-session experimental studies. Using CBM-I, we investigate whether repeatedly training positive interpretations over multiple sessions (vs an active control condition) leads to a sustained reduction in worry and rumination in the disorders in which they play central maintaining roles, namely GAD and depression. Individuals with GAD or depression will receive worry-related or rumination-related training materials, respectively, to maximise potential training of interpretations relevant to the key form of RNT for the given disorder. We assess interpretation bias, levels of worry and rumination (primary outcomes) as well as anxiety and depression symptoms (secondary outcomes) at baseline (study visit 1) and again after multisession CBM-I or active control sessions (study visit 2). In addition, we examine the sustained impact of training positive interpretations on levels of worry, rumination, anxiety and depression at 1-month follow-up. Further, we compare two types of CBM-I, with and without prior RNT, to examine whether activating RNT modulates the effects of CBM-I in individuals with GAD and depression. Finally, to consider how cognitive processes may influence each other, and drawing on the combined cognitive bias hypothesis<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> as well as building on findings that single-session CBM-I increases attentional control during worry,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> we include a classic Stroop and emotional Stroop task to examine whether multisession CBM-I impacts the ability to inhibit irrelevant and RNT-related information.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>For both diagnostic groups, we predict that CBM-I with and without prior RNT will reduce negative interpretation bias, RNT (levels of worry and rumination) and psychological distress (levels of anxiety and depression) relative to the active control condition. Furthermore, we examine whether an induced period of RNT prior to CBM-I either enhances the effects of training (by activating underlying cognitive biases, as in attention bias research), or reduces training effects (potentially due to the additional demands placed on attentional control resources by RNT). Finally, and crucially given its proposed underlying role, we expect that effects of CBM-I on worry and rumination, anxiety and depression will be driven by changes in interpretation bias.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>Individuals meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-V) diagnostic criteria for either GAD or current major depressive episode (MDD) will be randomly allocated to one of three conditions: CBM-I with prior RNT (henceforth CBM_RNT), standard CBM-I without prior RNT (henceforth CBM_STAND) or an active control condition (henceforth CONTROL). To investigate the impact of CBM-I on changing interpretation bias, near transfer will be assessed using measures of interpretation bias. To explore the impact of CBM-I on measures of RNT and psychological distress, far transfer will be assessed by changes to levels of worry and rumination (assessed using a behavioural task and self-report questionnaires) as well as self-report measures of anxiety and depression symptoms following 10 internet-based CBM-I or active control sessions over the course of 3&#x02005;weeks.

Participants will be fluent English speakers aged between 18 and 65&#x02005;years old. They will be screened for levels of anxiety and/or depression, and participants with a total score &#x0003c;10 or five items scored &#x0003c;2 including items 1 and/or 2 on Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and/or with a total score &#x0003c;10 or item 2 scored &#x0003c;2 on GAD-7<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> will be excluded. Further exclusion criteria are severe depression (&#x0003e;23 PHQ-9 total score), past or current risk to self (self-harm in past 12&#x02005;months/suicide attempt in last 5&#x02005;years/PHQ-9 suicidal ideation item 9 scored &#x0003e;1<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), comorbid psychosis, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder or substance abuse, non-normal/not corrected to normal hearing (as the study involves listening to audio clips) as well as current or recent (past 6&#x02005;months) psychological treatment. Further, individuals taking psychotropic medication must have been stabilised on that medication for at least 3&#x02005;months without remission to be included. The latter two criteria serve to ensure that any positive effects of CBM-I are not confounded by ongoing improvements due to other treatments. Diagnosis of GAD or MDD will be confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V axis I disorders (SCID<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) at an initial assessment prior to the first experimental session.

All online sessions begin with the prescenario RNT induction (CBM_RNT) or neutral task (CBM_STAND or CONTROL). Subsequently, participants listen to 50 audio clips (henceforth scenarios) per session and answer a corresponding question after listening to each scenario. All scenarios were audio-recorded by a professional actress and are presented to participants via headphones. In keeping with CBM-I research (see ref. <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), instructions in all conditions emphasise that participants should imagine themselves in the situations the scenarios describe and try to anticipate the ending of each scenario.

Participants first select a theme about which they have found themselves worrying (GAD group) or ruminating (MDD group) on the day of the session or very recently. Participants have the choice of three common themes (performance, social relationships, or illness and harm for GAD worry; abilities, social relationships, or feeling low for depressive rumination) which correspond to the main themes reflected in the CBM-I and control scenarios (see below). Each theme may be selected once a week (three times in total) to ensure that all participants engage in RNT about themes relevant to the training/control materials. Following the selection of the theme, participants rate the frequency with which they have recently (past few days) thought about a topic relating to this theme and how distressing this has been for them. Then, participants are asked to write a one-line summary of their worry/ruminative thoughts on their selected topic, which is fed back to them on a subsequent screen. Participants are next prompted to identify negative thoughts relating to their topic.

This 5-min task consists of reading a short story, divided into eight sections, and making a grammatical correctness judgement about the last sentence of each section. At the end of the eight sections, participants complete a comprehension question about the story content, designed to enhance engagement with the task. The presentation of each section is timed to ensure that the duration of the task is matched to the RNT induction. Participants read a different story at each session (order randomised across participants). Subsequently, participants complete the same ratings of current worry, rumination, anxiety and depression as participants in the CBM_RNT condition. A subset (five) of stories was initially piloted in N=23 participants (unrelated to the current study) and stories were judged to be emotionally neutral (mean valence rating on a 100-point visual analogue scale with anchors <italic>very negative/very positive</italic> =59, SD=1.41).</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Online scenario-based task: CBM-I and control condition materials</title><p><italic>CBM-I materials</italic>: The two CBM-I conditions (CBM_RNT and CBM_STAND) consist of participants listening to scenarios describing situations relating to common worry-related (GAD group) and rumination-related (MDD group) themes which are initially emotionally ambiguous and which are resolved in either a positive manner (76% of the time), negative manner (12%) or which are left unresolved (12%) by the final word or short phrase of the scenario. Positive scenarios constitute the training scenarios and are designed to promote positive interpretations of ambiguous events; negative scenarios are included to ensure that participants attend carefully to the content of the scenarios.

This serves to reinforce the interpretation. The 12% unresolved scenarios serve as &#x02018;test&#x02019; trials.

To match the control condition as closely as possible to the CBM-I conditions, each session contains scenarios adapted from worry and rumination materials, with the endings amended so that the ambiguity is left unresolved. As in the CBM-I conditions, participants hear 50 scenarios per session. Each scenario is either followed by a Yes/No question relating to the ambiguity of the scenario, which is not followed by feedback (similar to the &#x02018;test&#x02019; trials), or relating to a factual element of the scenario, which is followed by feedback regarding whether participants' responses were incorrect. Both questions are designed to encourage participants to process the meaning of the scenarios. In addition, the &#x02018;test&#x02019; trials from the CBM-I conditions will be included so that interpretations made across the course of the sessions can be compared between CBM-I and control conditions. Thus, we can also examine whether participants in the control condition impose their (default) negative interpretive style on the scenarios and whether there are any inadvertent training effects, such as participants in the control condition generating more positive or negative interpretations across the sessions.

Participants use five of six presented words to form grammatically correct sentences, which can either be of negative or positive valence. For example, &#x02018;looks the future bright very dismal&#x02019; may be unscrambled to form the sentence &#x02018;the future looks very bright&#x02019; (positive) or &#x02018;the future looks very dismal&#x02019; (negative). Participants are told to form the first sentence that comes to mind (rather than select a particular valence). In the present study, participants unscramble 20 sentences in 5&#x02005;min, while holding in mind a string of six digits, as such a cognitive load depletes cognitive resources and is thus thought to present a truer reflection of participants' interpretative style.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Half the sentences are related to worry themes (see themes above) and were generated by the authors, while half are related to depressive rumination and were selected from Wenzlaff and Bates<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> and Wenzlaff and Bates.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The number of negative sentences divided by the total number of grammatically correct sentences generated serves as an index of interpretation bias, with a higher index (scores range from 0 to 1) denoting a more negative interpretation bias. The test can be scored across all items or for worry and depressive rumination items separately. The scrambled sentences test is administered at the first and second study visit; thus, two separate lists of 20 items were created and the order is counterbalanced across participants.</p><p><italic>Recognition memory test</italic> (based on ref. <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>): The recognition memory test consists of two parts. In the first part, participants read 20 ambiguous scenarios, make a fragment completion judgement on the final word (see example below) and answer a comprehension question for each scenario. In the second part, participants are prompted with the title of each scenario and are presented with four statements for each scenario. Two statements relate to the resolution of the ambiguity in the scenario (targets), while the other two statements do not relate to the ambiguity (foils). In each pair of targets and foils, one statement is positive and one negative in valence. Participants rate how similar each presented statement is to the content of the original scenario, with greater similarity ratings for positive targets indicating a more positive interpretation of that scenario (and vice versa for negative targets). Foils are included to assess a general valence effect. The recognition test is relatively opaque in terms of its purpose and is not subject to demand or selection bias (see ref. <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013404">supplementary materials A</ext-link>).</p><p>Of the 20 scenarios, half are related to worry (taken from refs. <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, with some slight wording changes) and half relate to depressive rumination (created by the authors).

Should participants indicate risk to themselves (a score of &#x0003e;1 on PHQ-9 suicidal ideation item) on the preassessment questionnaire, this will trigger a risk assessment at the study visit.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016013404F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Participant flow chart with measurement points.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016013404f02"/></fig><p>At the first study visit (experimental session), participants provide written informed consent and will be randomised by diagnostic group to one of the three conditions: (1) CBM_RNT, (2) CBM_STAND or (3) CONTROL (see the Experimental conditions section above for details). They will then complete the scrambled sentences test, classic and emotional Stroop task, recognition memory test and breathing focus task. Then, participants will be given the study rationale for the online homework sessions and will complete expectancy and acceptability ratings before completing the first online session on the study website. This is completed during the study visit to ensure participants understand the instructions for their condition and are able to complete the sessions correctly. Each session includes the RNT induction (CBM_RNT) or neutral task (CBM_STAND and CONTROL conditions), followed by 50 scenario audio clips (see above) with a short break after 25 scenarios. In addition, participants complete ratings of state levels of worry, rumination, anxiety and depression after the prescenario task (RNT or neutral task) and at the end of each session. Following the first online session, participants complete the recognition memory test again (different scenarios; see above) to assess change from pre to post first study visit. Finally, participants are presented with instructions for completing the nine online sessions over the course of the next 3&#x02005;weeks, and the researcher will complete a diary card with each participant to help schedule the homework sessions.</p><p>Participants will complete three online sessions per week over the next 3&#x02005;weeks, with some flexibility in terms of dates and times of day, and with the provisos that they complete no more than one homework session per day and complete the homework sessions within 1&#x02005;month and the final session no later than the day before their second study visit. Researchers will monitor adherence to the homework sessions using the online platform. They will keep in touch with participants by using participants' preferred method of contact (email, phone, SMS) to facilitate engagement and trouble shoot issues with the online sessions, and will encourage participants to catch up missed sessions. Participants are required to complete a minimum of eight sessions (see also the Statistical methods section).</p><p>Up to 24&#x02005;hours before returning for their second study visit, participants will again complete the presession questionnaire (PSWQ, RRS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, RNTQ), and additionally will complete a &#x02018;negative events form&#x02019; in relation to the previous 3&#x02005;weeks to assess incidence of mental health-related events (eg, deterioration in symptoms, suicidal intent, hospitalisation, etc). Any events reported will be addressed with the participant at the second study visit; events may also be captured during other points of the study and will be addressed with the participant when they are raised. If the event is related to an aspect of the study, an adverse events form will be generated, which will be reviewed by the Research Steering Committee. At the second study visit, participants will again provide written informed consent for this visit, will complete treatment expectancy and acceptability ratings, assimilation and imagination ratings (in reference to the past nine sessions), and will then complete the scrambled sentences test, classic and emotional Stroop task, recognition memory test and breathing focus task before being debriefed and partially paid for their participation to date. One month after their second study visit, participants will complete the follow-up questionnaire online, which is identical to the presession questionnaire for study visit 2, and receive the final payment for their participation. The experimenter will contact participants for further information should any negative events and/or mental health-related events be reported at follow-up. Participants will receive &#x000a3;130 for their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Monitoring adverse events</title><p>Adverse events (significant and prolonged increases in anxiety and/or depressive symptoms related to taking part in the study) will be recorded and reported to the Research Steering Committee at the end of the study.

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and who return for the second study visit within 1&#x02005;month of their first visit.</p><p>To consider differences between GAD and MDD diagnostic groups that received tailored training materials, we will specify multigroup models with diagnostic group as grouping variable. We will test whether parameters differ significantly between the two diagnostic groups. Further, we can examine significant effects within each diagnostic group. Predictors in each model are experimental condition (CBM_RNT, CBM_STAND, CONTROL) and time point (study visits 1, 2 and follow-up; follow-up for questionnaire measures only).</p><p>We will examine effects on measures of interpretation bias to assess whether the CBM-I conditions are successful in training positive interpretations (near transfer). We will then assess effects on measures of RNT (self-report and behavioural) as well as anxiety and depression to investigate the impact of our CBM-I conditions on changing RNT, anxiety and depressive symptoms (far transfer). Further, we will examine whether the extent of change on self-report measures of anxiety and depression falls within the range of reliable change, defined as a reduction in scores exceeding the reliable change index for that measure. We will supplement the above analyses with disorder-specific analyses, examining the effects on near transfer for disorder-specific items only (see the Interpretation bias measures). We will control for differences in demographic variables as appropriate by including them as covariates in analyses.</p><p>To examine the mediating role of interpretation bias, we will conduct mediation analyses using Baron and Kenny's<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> approach. Depending on the final sample size and distribution of the data, bootstrapped SEs and bootstrapped CIs will be estimated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>This experimental study investigates interpretation bias as part of a transdiagnostic cognitive mechanism underlying worry and rumination. Using multisession CBM-I tailored towards worry-related and rumination-related concerns, we examine whether repeatedly training positive interpretations (vs an active control condition) reduces negative interpretation bias and leads to a sustained reduction (up to 1-month follow-up) in worry and rumination in the disorders in which they play a central maintaining role, namely GAD and depression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine CBM-I in relation to worry and rumination within the same study, allowing us to directly compare the effects of interpretation training on these forms of RNT and elucidate whether they share common underlying processes.</p><p>Furthermore, we compare two versions of CBM-I with and without RNT prior to training to investigate whether initiating RNT&#x02014;proposed to activate latent negative interpretation bias&#x02014;enhances the effects of CBM-I (as has been shown in cognitive bias modification for attention<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) or decreases its effects, potentially by depleting participants' attentional control resources (see ref. <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). A further possibility is that the two CBM-I conditions may be differentially effective in GAD compared with depression, that is, that prior RNT is beneficial for one disorder but detrimental for the other. Assessing contextual effects of prior RNT is especially important given the need to better understand moderators and mediators of CBM-I<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in order to optimise interpretation training. This can ultimately enrich our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying RNT in emotional disorders such as GAD and depression, and improve CBM-I approaches as potential adjunct interventions alongside more established clinical treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The results will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
