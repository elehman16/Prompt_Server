Most patients need parenteral treatment, and in primary healthcare facilities, where intravenous therapy is not available but intramuscular injections can be given, intramuscular quinine, artesunate, and artemether have been used before transporting patients to hospital.</p><p>However, in rural settings with limited access to health care, intramuscular injections may also be unavailable. In these situations, rectal artesunate given prior to transfer to hospital by volunteers with little medical training, may be a feasible option.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To evaluate the effects of pre-referral treatment with rectal artesunate on mortality and morbidity in people with severe malaria.</p></sec><sec><title>Search methods</title><p>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE and LILACS up to 21 May 2014. We also searched the WHO clinical trial registry platform and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for ongoing trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection criteria</title><p>Individual or cluster-randomized controlled trials comparing pre-referral rectal artesunate with placebo or injectable antimalarials in children and children with severe malaria.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for potentially eligible trials, and extracted data from the included trials. Dichotomous outcomes were summarized using risk ratios (RR) and presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Where data allowed, we conducted subgroup analyses by age, trial region and whether participants were included in the trial analysis. We assessed the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes using the GRADE approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Main results</title><p>One trial met the inclusion criteria; a placebo-controlled trial of 17,826 children and adults living in rural villages in Ghana and Tanzania (Africa) and Bangladesh (Asia). Villagers with no previous medical training were trained to recognize the symptoms of severe malaria, administer rectal artesunate and refer patients to hospital. The trained villagers were supervised during the trial period. In the African sites only children aged 6 to 72 months were enrolled, whereas in Bangladesh, older children and adults were also enrolled.</p><p>In young children (aged 6 to 72 months) there were fewer deaths following rectal artesunate than with placebo (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93; one trial; 8050 participants; <italic>moderate quality evidence</italic>), while in older children and adults there were more deaths in those given rectal artesunate (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.18 to 4.15; one trial; 4018 participants; <italic>low quality evidence</italic>).</p><p>In Africa, only 56% of participants reached a secondary healthcare facility within six hours compared to over 90% in Asia. There were no differences between the intervention and control groups in the proportion of participants reaching a healthcare facility within six hours (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; 12,068 participants), or in the proportion with parasitaemia (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02; 17,826 participants), or with coma or convulsions on arrival (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 12,068 participants).</p><p>There are no existing trials that compare rectal versus intramuscular artesunate.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' conclusions</title><p>In rural areas without access to injectable antimalarials rectal artesunate provided before transfer to a referral facility probably reduces mortality in severely ill young children compared to referral without treatment. However, the unexpected finding of possible higher mortality in older children and adults has to be taken into account in forming any national or local policies about pre-referral rectal artesunate.</p></sec><sec><title>PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY</title><sec><title>Rectal artesunate for treating people with suspected severe malaria before transfer to hospital</title><p>Cochrane Collaboration researchers conducted a review of the effects of pre-referral rectal artesunate for people with suspected severe malaria, living in rural areas without healthcare services. After searching for all relevant trials up to May 2014 they included only one randomized controlled trial. This trial was conducted at various sites across Ghana, Tanzania and Bangladesh, and enrolled 17,826 children and adults.</p><p><bold>What is severe malaria and how might pre-referral rectal artesunate reduce deaths?</bold></p><p>Severe malaria is a serious medical condition caused by infection with the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite which typically causes vomiting, anaemia, fitting, coma, and death. It is treated by giving injections of antimalarial drugs, which need to be started as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of death and brain damage. In some rural areas where malaria is common, people have to travel for several hours to reach healthcare clinics and hospitals, and many die on the way. In these settings, people without formal healthcare education could be trained to give artesunate rectally to start treating malaria before transporting the patient to hospital.</p><p><bold>What the research says</bold></p><p>Only one trial evaluated rectal artesunate as pre-referral treatment. In the African sites only, children aged 6 to 72 months were included in the trial; while in the Asian trial site, older children and adults were included.</p><p>Young children in the African and Asian trial sites (aged 6 to 72 months) had fewer deaths with rectal artesunate than with placebo (<italic>moderate quality evidence</italic>). However, in Asia among older children and adults, there were more deaths in those that received rectal artesunate (<italic>low quality evidence</italic>).</p><p>In the African sites, 56% of children took longer than six hours to reach hospital whereas over 90% of people in the Asian site reached hospital within six hours.</p><p>The unexpected finding of more deaths with rectal artesunate in older children and adults should be taken into account when forming national and local policies about pre-referral treatment.</p></sec></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS FOR THE MAIN COMPARISON <italic>[Explanation]</italic></title><p><table-wrap id="d36e193" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><bold>Pre-referral rectal artesunate compared to placebo for preventing deaths from severe malaria</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><bold>Patient or population:</bold> Children and adults with severe malaria</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><bold>Settings:</bold> Rural settings in Africa and Asia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><bold>Intervention:</bold> Rectal artesunate and referral for further care</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><bold>Comparison:</bold> Placebo and referral for further care</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Outcomes</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Illustrative comparative risks* (95% CI)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Relative effect(95% CI)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>No of participants(studies)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Quality of the evidence(GRADE)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Comments</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Assumed risk</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Corresponding risk</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Placebo</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Rectal Artesunate</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>All cause mortality</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Children aged 6 to 72 months</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>RR 0.74</bold> (0.59 to 0.93)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8050(1 study)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02295;&#x02295;&#x02295;&#x025cb; <bold>moderate</bold>

In 2009 approximately 225 million clinical cases and 781,000 malaria-related deaths occurred worldwide (WHO <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>). The greatest burden of disease occurs in sub-Saharan Africa where the highest risk is in children below the age of five years (WHO <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>). The dominant parasite species <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> accounts for over 95% of cases.</p><p>Severe or complicated malaria is characterized by signs of vital organ dysfunction, and prompt and effective drug treatment is required to prevent severe neurological deficit and death (WHO <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). Patients are often unable to take drugs by mouth because of repeated vomiting or a reduced level of consciousness, and parenteral treatment with either intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injections is preferred.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the intervention</title><p>Artesunate and artemether are antimalarial compounds derived from the herb <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>. Once administered these artemisinin-derivatives are rapidly converted to the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, which has been shown to rapidly clear malaria parasites from the peripheral blood (German <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Artemisinin-derivatives now form the backbone of the global malaria treatment strategy where they are used orally in artemisinin-based combinations for uncomplicated malaria, or as injections for severe malaria (WHO <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>).</p><p>Artesunate is the recommended first line treatment for severe malaria worldwide (WHO <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>), and when given by intravenous or intramuscular injection has been shown to reduce deaths in both children and adults compared to the older alternative quinine (Dondorp <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Dondorp <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This effect has been consistent across all published randomized trials, and the most recent Cochrane review of artesunate versus quinine concluded that further studies comparing these two drugs parenterally are probably unnecessary (Sinclair <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>In hospital-based studies artesunate also appears to be reliably absorbed and effective when administered rectally. A systematic review (Karunajeewa <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) identified two studies directly comparing rectal artesunate with parenteral alternatives (Barnes <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Karunajeewa <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). These two studies were conducted in hospital settings, enrolled a total of 268 participants, and both reported a reduction in parasitaemia as the primary outcome. Neither were powered to look at mortality and only one patient died (after rectal treatment). Rectal artesunate was associated with superior reductions in parasitaemia at 12 and 24 hours compared to parenteral quinine (Barnes <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and intramuscular artemether (Karunajeewa <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The review found no studies directly comparing rectal artesunate with parenteral artesunate.</p><p>A more recent review of pharmacokinetic data concluded that rectal artesunate had similar characteristics to oral administration but with a slightly shorter time to maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) (Morris <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Rectal artesunate has the advantage of not having a first pass effect through the liver so bioavailability after administration is high (Morris <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The rate of absorption in children is modified by the body temperature, with higher absorption positively correlated with rising body temperature (Karunajeewa <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The volume of distribution is also influenced by body weight which in this context is a proxy for age (Karunajeewa <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Stepniewska <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>How the intervention might work</title><p>The risk of death from severe malaria is greatest within the first 24 hours of onset of illness (Marsh <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Treatment should therefore start as soon as possible in such patients, preferably before the referral process is completed. Ideally the drug should be given intravenously although current recommendations allow for intramuscular or rectal administration where this is not possible or available (WHO <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>).</p><p>In most malaria endemic countries injectable formulations of artesunate and quinine and the necessary skill to give them are mainly concentrated in large healthcare facilities. The transit time to these facilities is often prolonged due to long distances and a lack of adequate transport. The resulting delays in accessing treatment could account for the high mortality associated with the disease (Marsh <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Indeed, results of verbal autopsy studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with severe malaria never reached the hospital (Kamugisha <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kaatano <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Mudenda <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Addressing this situation requires improvements in the initial emergency response package for identifying and treating cases of suspected severe malaria. Specifically, this would involve the use of effective drugs in formulations that can be easily administered by healthcare staff at the point of first contact, taking into account the level of skill available at such points. In this context artesunate suppositories offer a distinct potential advantage as a means of initiating treatment of severe malaria as they are easy to administer by individuals with minimal training (Tozan <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Why it is important to do this review</title><p>The exact role of rectal artesunate in the management of malaria has remained the subject of discussion. While rectal artesunate provides a pragmatic solution for early treatment, its effects on mortality and morbidity are less clear. Furthermore, the rectal route of treatment may not be universally acceptable (Inthavilay <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Studies on the effects of rectal artesunate have mainly been conducted in hospitals (Awad <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Barnes <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and are difficult to generalize to rural settings where a pre-referral intervention is needed. A trial by Gomes and colleagues (Gomes <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) evaluated the effects of a single dose rectal artesunate administered before referral on death and permanent disability and the trial was designed to address some of these questions (Gomes <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This trial's findings were used to inform recommendations (WHO <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). However, the results of this trial and the subsequent recommendation of rectal artesunate as pre-referral treatment in severe malaria has been the subject of criticism. Notably, Hirji and Premji reported limitations in the design, implementation, analysis and interpretation of the trial data (Hirji <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>); while others questioned the ethics of using a placebo control group in patients considered to be critically ill (Bello <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>These concerns indicated a real interest in this field and make this review timely. Given the importance of early intervention for the outcomes of severe malaria it is vital that we have a concise summary of the available evidence regarding the use of rectal artesunate at an important early stage in the management of severe malaria.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To evaluate the effects of pre-referral treatment with rectal artesunate on mortality and morbidity in people with severe malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Criteria for considering studies for this review</title><sec><title>Types of studies</title><p>Individual and cluster-randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Types of participants</title><p>Children and adults with any of the features of severe malaria as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).

A total of 17,826 children and adults with suspected severe malaria were randomized to receive either a single artesunate suppository (n = 8954) or placebo (n = 8872). The trial report focused on 12,068 participants (6072 artesunate; 5996 placebo); 5758 (32.3%) participants were excluded from the primary analysis because they had either received an antimalarial injection around the time of randomization (n = 1110) or were retrospectively observed to have a negative blood smear at the time of randomization (n = 4648).</p><p>Trial participants were categorized as children aged 6 to 72 months (67%, n = 8050), or older children and adults (aged over 72 months).

In young children rectal artesunate probably reduces the risk of death by 26% (moderate quality evidence) while in older children and adults rectal artesunate may increase risk of death (low quality evidence).</p><p>The risk of neurodisability was low with both rectal artesunate and placebo, without a statistically significant difference between groups (low quality evidence).</p></sec><sec><title>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</title><p>The single included trial was conducted to evaluate the use of rectal artesunate in a very specific scenario; rural communities without access to injectable antimalarials, and as such includes a placebo control group rather than the prior standard of care; parenteral artesunate or quinine. The findings of this review are therefore only directly applicable to similar settings. Indeed, despite extensive searching we found no trials comparing pre-referral rectal artesunate with either intramuscular quinine, artesunate or artemether.</p><p>The trial included a mix of African and Asian trial sites across a range of malaria transmission settings. However, there are several differences between the study sites which complicate interpretation of the results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Older children and adults were only enrolled in Asia, making it impossible to determine if the harm detected in older children and adults is specific to Asia or consistent across regions, and trial participants in Bangladesh were able to access definitive care much quicker than those in Africa, which may explain the lower mortality seen at the Asian sites.</p><p>The finding that rectal artesunate reduced the risk of death in young children but increased the risk of death in older children and adults is both unexpected and difficult to explain. There is some evidence that the profile of severe or complicated malaria differs between children and adults (WHO <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>), but a review of artemisinin-derivatives in severe malaria has shown consistent benefits in children and adults with only variation in the magnitude of the benefit (Sinclair <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). We attempted to understand this finding but without other trials to confirm or refute the findings we can not provide a plausible explanation. The small number of deaths recorded in older children and adults in Asia raises the possibility that this is a chance finding, but other explanatory factors may be the higher dose administered, differences in the care received, or a true differential effect of age in the host response to severe malaria. Undoubtedly, this finding has implications for policy recommendations regarding rectal artesunate in older children and adults.</p><p>The primary analysis in the trial excluded a large proportion of the randomized participants. This decision was made before unblinding, and we did not detect major differences in results when these participants were added back into the analysis. The rationale for the time and age cut-offs used in the analysis are less clear.</p><p>Despite the limitations, and questions arising from this single trial, it is unlikely that a trial of this size will ever be repeated due to the challenges of recruiting an adequate sample size, and the decline in malaria transmission globally. There is also the ethical question of the use of a placebo in a potentially life threatening situation with little option for rapid intervention if the condition deteriorates. Consequently, the observed harmful effect in children older than 72 months and adults may remain unexplained.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality of the evidence</title><p>We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, and our judgements are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>We consider the data available from the trial sites in Asia to provide only <italic>low quality evidence</italic> of a benefit in young children and a harm in older children and adults. The main limitation was the low number of events (deaths) in both age categories at this site, which means the trial was not powered to confidently detect these effects. This limitation raises the possibility that these are both chance findings. We have therefore downgraded for serious imprecision, and for serious inconsistency due to the opposite effects in the two age groups; a finding which is both unexpected and unexplained.</p><p>However, we considered the data in young children from Africa and Asia to provide <italic>moderate quality evidence</italic> of a reduction in death with rectal artesunate in this age group. This means that we have moderate confidence that rectal artesunate is beneficial in this age group. We downgraded the evidence from high due to the inconsistency in effect between the two regions (with a smaller effect seen in Africa). We also considered downgrading for imprecision because the result in Africa did not reach statistical significance without the addition of the Asian data. However, after discussion we did not consider this issue sufficient to further downgrade.</p><p>We also note that the absolute benefit of pre-referral rectal artesunate in young children is relatively small, saving just 10 more lives per 1000 people treated than referral alone (with placebo). This is of smaller magnitude than the additional benefits of parenteral artesunate versus parenteral quinine (26 additional lives saved per 1000 people treated, Sinclair <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Potential biases in the review process</title><p>We did not identify any specific bias in our review process.</p></sec><sec><title>Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</title><p>We found no other reviews of pre-referral rectal artesunate. We did however find three reviews of trials evaluating the effect of rectal artemisinins compared to conventional treatments for severe malaria (parenteral artemisinins and quinine) in hospital-based care settings (Gomes <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Karunajeewa <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wilairatana <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The most recent of these reviews (Gomes <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) used individual patient data from three published and three unpublished studies to compare rectal and parenteral artemisinin-derivatives. However, none of the studies in the review directly compared rectal with parenteral artesunate, or directly assessed pre-referral treatment. The review authors concluded that rectal artesunate was effective at reducing parasitaemia during the first 24 hours after treatment and could be an option in remote rural settings (Gomes <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and this formed the background for the included trial (Gomes <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>The authors of the single included trial in our review concluded that "if patients with severe malaria cannot be treated orally and access to injections will take several hours, a single inexpensive artesunate suppository at the time of referral substantially reduces the risk of death or permanent disability". We would suggest an amendment to limit the conclusion to children aged between 6 and 72 months.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' conclusions</title><sec><title>Implications for practice</title><p>In rural settings without access to injectable antimalarials, rectal artesunate probably reduces mortality in young children (6 to 72 months old) being transported to hospital for further care. However, the unexpected finding of possible higher mortality in older children and adults should be taken into account when forming national and local policies about pre-referral treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for research</title><p>The concerns about increased mortality with pre-referral rectal artesunate in older children and adults will not be resolved without further trials. However, it is unlikely that these trials will be done, due to the large sample size required and the ethical issues related to the use of a placebo group.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The academic editor for this review was Professor Paul Garner.</p><p>We thank the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group for their support of this project.The editorial base for the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group is funded by the UK Department for International Development for the benefit of developing countries.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1"><title>Appendices</title><sec><title>Appendix 1.
