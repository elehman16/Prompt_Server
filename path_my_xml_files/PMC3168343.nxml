The body of SLIPA is shaped like a hollow boot with &#x0201c;toe,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;bridge,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;heel&#x0201d; prominences, which is engaged in the patient's pharynx, allowing it to seal without the use of an inflatable cuff. It therefore does not require cuff inflation and extra straps to maintain a secure airway during positive pressure ventilation. Furthermore, a 50-ml empty internal space allows the removal of pharyngeal secretions, thus reducing the risk of pulmonary aspiration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Although PLMA had been compared with other airway devices[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] during laparoscopic surgery, there are only one comparative research[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] on SLIPA and PLMA during anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a single-use SGA with noninflatable cuff (SLIPA) for efficacy of positive pressure ventilation and postoperative complications when compared with the standard reusable PLMA for patient undergoing lower abdominal laparoscopies under general anesthesia with controlled ventilation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional human ethics committee (Menoufiya university hospital, Menoufiya city, Egypt), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Over nine months, 120 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical status I, II) scheduled for lower abdominal laparoscopic surgeries were enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria were patients at risk for aspiration, current sore throat, known lung diseases, morbid obesity, pregnancy, and a suspected difficult airway. The physician inserting the device (one of the authors) had a minimum of 3 years experience in anesthesia and airway management with PLMAs and had used the SLIPA for more than 100 times before study. Patients were randomized into one of 2 equal groups, PLMA group and SLIPA group, with 60 patients in each group.</p><p>Modified Mallampati classification was used to evaluate the patients&#x02019; airway and the results were recorded at preanesthetic evaluation sheet. In PLMA group, size 3 was used for patients weighing below 50 kg, size 4 for those weighing between 50 and 70 kg, and size 5 for those over 70 kg. After insertion, the cuff was inflated by 20 to 30 ml of air to maintain the cuff pressure at 60 cmH<sub>2</sub>O with a hand pressure gauge (PORTEX, UK). For male in SLIPA group, size 51 was used for patients less than 165 cm in height, size 53 for those between 165 and 175 cm, and size 55 for those over 175 cm, and for female in SLIPA group, size 47 was used for patients under 155 cm in height, size 49 for those between 155 and 165 cm, and size 51 for those over 165 cm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.SLIPA.com">http://www.SLIPA.com</ext-link>).</p><p>In the operating room, the patient was placed supine with the head in sniffing position. After attachment of cardiac monitor and preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes, general anesthesia was induced with midazolam 1 mg i.v. and fentanyl 2 ug.kg<sup>-1</sup> i.v. followed within 2 minutes by propofol 2 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> and cisatracurium 0.15 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> to facilitate insertion of SGA. Ventilation was provided through a face mask with 100% oxygen until neuromuscular monitoring revealed full relaxation. The devices were inserted after being lubricated with water-soluble lubricant according to the manufacturer's instruction. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.5 to 2% and 60% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> with supplementary fentanyl (50-100 &#x003bc;) to maintain mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of the baseline. Cisatracurium 0.05 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> was administered during surgery as required to maintain a train-of-four ratio of &#x0003c;25%.</p><p>Two attempts were allowed for placement of each device, with mask ventilation and oxygen between attempts, and the second attempt was made with a different size. If a secured airway was not achieved, a tracheal tube was used and the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>Effective ventilation was defined as proper chest expansion, a square wave capnograph trace, absence of audible leak, and lack of gastric insufflations. After obtaining an effective airway, the device was connected to a circle breathing system (Primus, Drager, Lubek, Germany) and the lung was initially ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minutes, and I : E ratio of 1 : 2 in volume-controlled mode. Five minutes after securing the airway and then after abdominal insufflation, the lung mechanics were measured using the same anesthesia machine, then the tidal volume and respiratory rate were adjusted to achieve an end tidal carbon dioxide value of 35 to 40 mmHg. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained with carbon dioxide and adjusted to a pressure of 15 mmHg.</p><p>After completion of the surgery, the surgeon systematically administered 10 ml ropivacaine 0.75% in the peritoneum through the main umbilical trocar, the anesthetics were discontinued, and the residual neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> and atropine 0.02 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, then the airway device was removed once the patient was awake.</p><p>The following data were recorded:</p><p>

Patients were interviewed 30 minutes after arrival to postanesthetic care unit by anesthetist who was blind to the study, with respect to presence of sore throat (pain independent of phonation or swallowing), dysphonia (pain on phonation/altered voice), and dysphagia (difficulty or pain on swallowing). The questions were &#x0201c;do you have hoarseness of voice or sore throat&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;do you feel any discomfort or pain when you swallow your saliva.&#x0201d; If the answer was yes to any of these questions, the intensity of complaint or pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale rated from 0 to 10 (0 = no discomfort or no pain to 10 = extreme discomfort or maximal imaginable pain). Symptoms&#x02019; intensity was also rated in the ward just before leaving the hospital. Similar questions concerning postoperative upper airway discomfort were asked by the surgeons at the day 5 to 7 postoperative visit.</p></list-item></list>

These &#x0201c;rules&#x0201d; were Trendelenburg tilt, &#x0003c;15 degree; peritoneal insufflation &#x0003c;15 cm.H<sub>2</sub>O; and duration of abdominal insufflation &#x0003c;15 minutes. In our study, the head down tilt was &#x02264;15 degree and peritoneal insufflation pressure was preset at 15 mmHg, but the peritoneal insufflation time was not limited to 15 minutes because inadequate ventilation and gastric distension should be evident within 15 minutes of starting insufflation. If it does not occur within 15 minutes, it should not occur later, provided that anesthetic depth and muscular relaxation are adequate and the LMA-C/PLMA is not dislodged. Furthermore, Maltby <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] had previously shown that the LMA-C and ETT with PPV were equally effective during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in nonobese patients, when mean peritoneal insufflation time was 47 minutes.</p><p>Successful placement of the device was achieved at the first attempt in 57 patients (96.9%) in PLMA group and in 55 patients (94.8%) in SLIPA group. Miller and Camporota[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] compared SLIPA, PLMA, and standard endotracheal intubation in 150 healthy adult females scheduled to undergo laparoscopic, gynecological procedures under general anesthesia and had a first insertion success rate of 96% and 98% for the PLMA and SLIPA, respectively. Lange <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] compared classic LMA and SLIPA in ophthalmic surgery and had first insertion success rate 100% and 98%, respectively. Another study done by Miller and Light[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] on 120 female undergoing minor gynecological procedures, the first insertion success rate was 95% and 92% for the classic LMA and SLIPA, respectively. Hein <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] conducted study on medical students with no experience on SLIPA or LMA and demonstrated that the first insertion success rate was 83% and 67% with overall success rate 94% and 89% for SLIPA and LMA, respectively. On the other hand, Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] compared SLIPA with PLMA in 60 patient undergoing surgeries under general anesthesia, the first insertion success rates for PLMA and SLIPA were 93.3% and 73.3%, respectively. We assume this variation in results to the relative experience of the anesthesiologist who has inserted the airway and the appropriate selection of the size of SLIPA airway. Correct size selection is important for successful insertion because SLIPA comes in a fixed preformed shape and six adult sizes (47-57). Many previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] selected SLIPA size by matching the transverse diameter of the device with the patient's thyroid cartilage; however, in our study, we used the size according to the recommendation of the manufacturer, which involved gender and height.</p><p>The insertion time was longer than 15 seconds in 12.1% of SLIPA cases and in 8.48% of PLMA cases, with no statistically significant difference. Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] found that the insertion of SLIPA took much longer time and was more difficult with statistically significant difference between both groups. The authors attributed this to the lack of experience and the difficulty of selecting the appropriate size of SLIPA. Miller and Camporota[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] compared SLIPA, PLMA, and standard endotracheal intubation. The insertion time was longer than 15 seconds in10% of SLIPA cases and in 18% of PLMA cases. Our results also come in agreement with Lange <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] in which the insertion of SLIPA was straightforward in 88%, slightly difficult in 10%, obviously difficult in 0% of cases, and failure in 2% of cases, compared with 90%, 8%, 2%, and 0%, respectively, in LMA group.</p><p>Airway sealing pressures and minimum flow rate were comparable in both groups with no statistically significant difference. The minimum fresh gas flow rate in the circle system is another measure of the seal's effectiveness, the seal was sufficient to allow low flow anesthesia (1 l.min<sup>-1</sup>). Similar findings had been reported in studies comparing sealing qualities of SILPA with PLMA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] or SLIPA with LMA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Brimacombe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] reported that the PLMA had a 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O sealing pressure more than the LMA. In our study, the sealing pressure was higher than the PIP in both groups before and after abdominal insufflation. Theoretically, a SGA with a higher sealing pressure should better protect the airway from aspiration.</p><p>In our study, the SLIPA enabled better fiberoptic bronchoscopic view (81% compared with 64% in PLMA group). Giatini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] reported 60% of the LMAs as being in the appropriate location. In another study, when PLMAs and LMAs were compared, 48% of PLMAs and 74% of LMAs were reportedly successful.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] reported that 60% of PLMAs and 40% of SLIPAs were deemed to be appropriately inserted at fiberoptic assessment and they attributed this value to less experience regarding SLIPA insertion.</p><p>Gastric air insufflation did not occur in both groups. Similar findings had been observed in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Lange <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] observed a higher incidence of gastroesophageal insufflation (19%) in the SLIPA than with the LMA (3%) and this may be related to the choice of the size used and the appropriate position of the device. The SLIPA sizes 47-57 are equivalent to LMA sizes 3-5.5. The authors in their study used LMA 4-6 in comparison.</p><p>No regurgitation of gastric contents was observed in both the groups. The ability of SLIPA and PLMA to protect against aspiration has been evident in previous study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Also, the increase in the intra-abdominal pressure has long been known to cause a reflex increase in the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The belief that the increase in intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux is erroneous.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The reported incidence of clinically significant pulmonary aspiration in healthy patients undergoing elective surgery with classic LMA is 1 in 5 000 to 1 in 12 000.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] This is a similar order of magnitude to the incidence with ETT or face mask in ASA I or II patients undergoing elective surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the incidence of sore throat was higher in PLMA (20.3%) group compared with SLIPA (10.3%) group, despite the harder appearance of SLIPA. No patient complaint of dysphonia or dysphagia in both groups. The VAS score for sore throat ranged from 1 to 5. The upper airway symptoms rapidly decreased in incidence and intensity just before leaving the hospital. No one in both groups suffered from persistent upper airway symptoms at the follow-up visit. Our results are against the results of previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] in which SLIPA was associated with a higher incidence of sore throat. The incidences of sore throat according to Miller and Camporota[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] were 57%, 49%, and 30% for endotracheal tubes, SLIPA, and PLMA, respectively. Our results are in accordance with a recent study by Lange <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] in which fewer patients in the SLIPA group compared with those in PLMA group complained of sore throats.</p><p>Several reports associate the use of LMA with injuries of the lingual, hypoglossal, and recurrent laryngeal nerves[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and to sore throat.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] When the cuff is used to seal the pharynx, as in the case with PLMA, the initial cuff pressure of 60 cm water gradually increases because of N<sub>2</sub>O diffusion across the cuff wall. The intracuff pressure significantly increases over 30 minutes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] It is thus important to constantly monitor the intracuff pressures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] We did not do adjustment of the cuff pressure during surgery, because changing of the cuff pressure may cause slippage of PLMA and gas leakage.</p><p>After removal of the airway devices, SLIPAs had significantly higher incidence of blood stains than PLMAs. Reinsertion of SLIPA was associated with blood on the device in all 3 cases, suggesting that the SLIPA has the potential to be more traumatic with the second attempts. The SLIPA is made of stiffer plastic material than the PLMA, which causes more direct trauma to the oral mucosa. Insertion can be helped by an assistant holding up the jaw or by using laryngoscope or gloved left middle or index finger and thumb to create suitable space in the pharynx.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Our study has some limitations. Although the investigators were experienced with both devices, they had more experience with the PLMA than with the SLIPA. The fiberoptic data were collected by the same investigator who inserted the device and was not blinded, and that might have resulted in some bias. The devices were used in nonobese patients with nondifficult airways and no underlying respiratory disorders. The results cannot be extrapolated to other groups of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>SLIPA effectively conforms to the perilaryngeal anatomy despite the lack of an inflatable cuff, it consistently achieves proper positioning for supraglottic ventilation, so can be used as a useful alternative to PLMA in patients undergoing lower abdominal laparoscopic surgery with muscle relaxant and controlled ventilation. Management of the airway with SLIPA was as simple as using PLMA. Fewer patients in SLIPA group complained of a sore throat, suggesting that SLIPA might increase patient comfort after surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brimacombe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Boehler</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Puhringer</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Positive pressure ventilation with the ProSeal versus classic laryngeal mask airway: A randomized, crossover study of healthy female patients</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2001</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>1351</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11682428</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akhtar</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kenny</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparison of the anesthetic requirement for tolerance of laryngeal mask airway and endotracheal tube</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>1992</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>668</fpage><lpage>71</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1519715</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brain</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Verghese</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Strube</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The LMA &#x02018;ProSeal&#x02019;-a laryngeal mask with an esophageal vent</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2000</year><volume>84</volume><fpage>650</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10844848</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maltby</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Beriault</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lieper</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Fick</surname><given-names>GH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The LMA-ProSeal is an effective alternative to tracheal intubation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy</article-title><source>Can J Anesth</source><year>2002</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>857</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12374716</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Light</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Laboratory and clinical comparisons of the Streamlined Liner of the Pharynx Airway (SLIPA) with the laryngeal mask airway</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>2003</year><volume>58</volume><fpage>136</fpage><lpage>42</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12562409</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name><name><surname>Brimacombe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Shyr</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>ProSeal versus the Classic laryngeal mask airway for positive pressure ventilation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2002</year><volume>88</volume><fpage>824</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12173201</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Camporota</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Advantage of ProSeal&#x02122;
