The diet, tooth morphology, oral environment, and microorganisms are associated with the caries process.

Even though mechanical methods of tooth cleaning are considered to be the most accepted and reliable method of oral health maintenance, chemotherapeutic agents are also used as adjuvants to reduce plaque formation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Ayurvedic literature mentions certain procedures such as <italic>Kavala graha</italic> or <italic>Gandoosha</italic> for oral hygien for oral hygiene maintenance.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] They are discussed They are discussed in ancient texts of <italic>Charaka Samhita</italic> and <italic>Sushrutha's Samhitha</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In <italic>Kavala graha</italic> or <italic>Gandoosha</italic>, an individual takes a certain amount of oil and holds it in the mouth for some time and swishes it all over the oral cavity, and when the oil turns milky white, it is spit out. Dr. F. Karach, a Russian scientist, popularized this procedure and described it as oil pulling in modern literature.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Newer studies of oil Newer studies of oil pulling therapy using various edible oils such as sunflower oil, sesame oil, and coconut oil were found to promote oral health.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Coconut oil is widely used in Asian and Pacific regions as an edible oil. It differs from other edible oils because of high content of medium chain fatty acids. Coconut oil contains 92% saturated acids, with lauric acid being the main constituent.

The study was conducted in a residential educational centre for a period of 2 months. Three hundred children of age group 8&#x02013;12 years were screened. Children were selected based on the inclusion criteria of decayed missing and filled (DMF) index of less than 2. Out of the 300 children, 50 were selected for the study. The sample size was derived by using the formula <italic>n</italic> = 4pq/d<sup>2</sup>. The exclu = 4pq/d<sup>2</sup>. The exclusion criteria were use of systemic or topical antibiotics, history of any dental treatment in the past 1 month, DMF scores of children more than 2, and children with any systemic or congenital diseases. The study and treatment protocol were explained in detail to the parents and informed consent was obtained. Institutional ethics committee approval was also obtained.</p><p>Each participant was assigned a specific numbassigned a specific number and a random sampling was done by using a table of random numbers.

Oil swishing was done under the observation of a care giver. The study was conducted by a single observer. The participants were given 5&#x02013;10 ml of coconut oil/chlorhexidine and were asked to swish it all over the oral cavity with the mouth closed and to forcefully move it in between the teeth. No concealment of drugs was possible due to the taste difference in the materials used for the study. The plaque and saliva samples were collected within 30 minutes of oil/chlorhexidine swishing.</p><p>The samples were collected by a single examiner, who was blinded regarding the use of materials in the study. The examiner is a postgraduate student of dentistry possessing good knowledge about oral diseases. Day 0 was the baseline status of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in both the control and study groups. Plaque samples were collected from the buccal surface of the maxillary right molar, labial surface of the maxillary incisor, lingual surface of the mandibular incisor, and lingual surface of the mandibular left molar. These samples were gently spread on the rough surface of the plaque strip. For Saliva, samples were collected from each participant by chewing a paraffin pellet for 1 minute. The rough surface of Dentocult SM saliva strip was pressed against the saliva on the tongue. The strips were then placed in the selective cultural broth.

Chlorhexidine readily binds to the charged bacterial surfaces and acts against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The antibacterial action may also due to an increase in cellular membrane permeability followed by coagulation of the cytoplasmic macro molecules. It is representative of the cationic group that is highly effective against <italic>S. mutans</italic> infection. Its superior effect is due to the fact that it retains its antimicrobial effect as its remains adsorbed to the tooth surface even after its clearance from saliva.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Coconut oil used in this study was commercially available for edible purposes. For oil pulling therapy, oil is gargled in the mouth and is moved between the teeth.

Various hypotheses have been discussed on the mechanisms by which oil pulling may act in decreasing the plaque adhesion. The oil pulling exerts mechanical shear forces leading to its emulsification, thereby increasing the surface area of the oil. The oil film thus formed on the tooth surface can reduce plaque adhesion and bacterial aggregation. Studies have shown that coconut oil has a high saponification value, and is one of the most commonly used oil in making soaps. The soaps produced with coconut oil lather well and have an increased cleansing action. The alkalis in the saliva can also react with the oil leading to saponification and formation of a soap-like substance which leads to reduction in plaque adhesion.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The cleansing action and decreased plaque accumulation may be also due to the action of lauric acid in the coconut oil, which reacts with sodium hydroxide in saliva during oil pulling to form sodium laureate,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] the main constituent of soap.</p><p>The antimicrobial effect of coconut oil was first reported by Hierholzer and Kabara.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Recent studies have shown that coconut oil has antimicrobial activity against various gram positive and gram negative organisms such as <italic>Escherichia vulneris</italic>, <italic>Enterococcer spp</italic>, <italic>Helicobater pylori</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, and <italic>Candia albicans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Coconut oil is a rich source of beneficial medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), particularly, lauric acid, capric acid, caprylic acid, and caprioic acid [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>].[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Electron microscopic Electron microscopic image showed that 15 minutes exposure to monolaurin, a monosaccharide present in coconut oil, caused cell shrinkage and cell disintegration of gram positive cocci.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The glycolipid compo The glycolipid compound sucrose monolaurate, a consitituent of coconut oil, has anticaries effect due to reduced glycolysis and sucrose oxidation in a noncompetitive manner on <italic>S. mutans</italic>, and thus preve, and thus prevents <italic>in vitro</italic> plaque.</p><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Fatty acid composition of coconut oil (wt%)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-6-447-g008"/></table-wrap><p>Huang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. studied the short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain fatty acids which were specifically compared for their antimicrobial activity against <italic>S. mutans</italic>.
