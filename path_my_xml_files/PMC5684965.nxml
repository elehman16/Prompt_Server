Despite these recommendations, a large proportion of insulin-treated diabetes patients do not perform SMBG at optimal frequencies <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Although the cost of SMBG is often cited as a key obstacle to optimal testing frequency, inconvenience and interference with lifestyle may be a more significant factor in SMBG adherence. In a study of 62 insulin-treated diabetes patients by Nyomba and colleagues, 47% of participants reported inconvenience of testing as the primary reason for not performing frequent SMBG <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>One recent advance in SMBG that may lessen the inconvenience of testing and, potentially, lead to greater adherence to recommended SMBG regimens is the development of integrated, strip-free systems such as the Accu-Chek Mobile System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The Experience in Accu-Chek Integrated Strip-free Systems (ExAct) study investigated the impact of using an integrated strip-free SMBG system compared to single-strip systems in a cohort of patients with type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes using self-adjusted insulin regimens.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This 24-week, prospective, controlled, stratified, cluster-randomized, observational, international, multicenter study assessed changes in SMBG frequency and glycemic control in type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients, using the Accu-Chek Mobile system (experimental [EXP] group) compared with similar patients who were using any unspecified single-strip SMBG system (control [CNL] group). Investigators functioned independently in managing their patients. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and the guidelines of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14155 were followed as applicable for a post-marketing study <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to conducting any study-related procedures.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Randomization</title><p>Sixty study sites in Germany, the UK, Italy and the Netherlands were recruited for the study. Study inclusion required that sites must have qualified personnel and be equipped with the appropriate medical facilities to fulfill the study requirements. Additionally, the sites were required to be associated with and under the guidance of an independent ethics committee (IEC) to satisfy all regulatory authority requirements and to conduct meetings on a regular basis. Study sites were country-stratified and cluster-randomized (1:1) to the integrated strip-free system (Accu-Chek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mobile System) or any single-strip system study arms but not matched for demographic characteristics. Envelopes with alternating group allocation were sent out by sequence of inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were identified based on the usual care provided at the center they routinely attended and the investigator's assessment of the individual patient's clinical need. Selected patients were invited for screening and enrollment at baseline (week 0, Visit 0). Inclusion criteria for study participation were: &#x02265;18 years of age; &#x02265;1 year duration of diagnosed diabetes; initial HbA1c value of &#x02265;7.0%, treatment with prandial insulin (regular insulin or rapid-acting insulin analog); self-adjustment of insulin dosages at each meal; and &#x02265;12 weeks duration of SMBG at an average frequency &#x0003c;3.25 tests per day, using a current blood glucose meter with a minimum data capacity of 200 blood glucose measurements.

SMBG frequency at baseline and follow-up visits was assessed using patients' respective SMBG system memories. Secondary endpoints assessed changes in HbA1c (e.g., between-group differences at week 24, proportion of patients who achieved &#x02265;0.5% HbA1c reduction [high achievers] from baseline). HbA1c was assessed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24. Validated instruments were used to assess PRO measures, including the: SMBG survey to assess patients' attitudes regarding blood glucose monitoring <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; the EQ-5D health status measure <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) to assess patients' satisfaction with their treatment regimens <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; and regimen-related distress subscale from the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) to assess patients' emotional distress related to their treatment regimen <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The investigator-developed Treatment Adherence and Barriers (TAB) measure was used to assess patients' reasons for adherence and nonadherence. All of the PRO measures were assessed using self-administered questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analysis population was defined as all eligible patients who provided signed informed consent, participated in the baseline visit and for whom at least one post-baseline observation on the primary endpoint was available. Sample size estimation was based on the results of a previous user survey <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; it was assumed that the change in test frequency from baseline in patients using the integrated strip-free SMBG system and patients using single-strip SMBG systems would differ by 3 tests per week relative to a within-group standard deviation of 11 tests per week. The sample size of 478 enrolled patients combined with an observed average number of 6.4 patients per center and an assumed intra-cluster correlation of &#x0003c;0.01 was considered sufficient to provide at least 80% power for this study. The primary analysis addressed the difference in changes in test frequency between the two device groups, which was assessed by means of a two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test at a significance level of 5%. The last observation was carried forward if &#x02265;1 post-baseline value was available to impute missing values. Mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) were also used to analyze the change in average test frequency and in HbA1c from baseline to both follow-up visits as dependent variables <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. These model-based analyses support the evidence of the primary analyses and were performed to address the following objectives to evaluate and adjust for effects of co-factors (e.g., differences in dependent variables among countries), adjust for differences in covariates such as the baseline test frequency, allow for missing data under the missing-at-random assumption <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and account for a possible intra-cluster correlation <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The analysis of HbA1c also included test frequency at each visit as a time-dependent covariate. Sites with &#x0003c;4 patients per country and device group were pooled for analyses to account for center effect. Within-patient variation was modeled as a random effect, with unstructured covariance matrix and center as random factor; the latter to account for a possible cluster effect <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>High achiever rates were analyzed based on the number and percentage of patients who achieved &#x0003e;0.5% HbA1c reduction from baseline at week 24 by device group, using Fisher's exact test. Selected demographic and baseline variables across device group were compared using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Subject disposition and demographics</title><p>The study was conducted from October 2010 to July 2012 at centers in Germany, the UK, Italy, and the Netherlands.

At the start of the study, patients in both groups were performing SMBG at less than the recommended frequency of &#x02265;3 tests per day <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, which is generally required for accurate calculation and effective adjustment of insulin dosages. After 12 weeks, use of an integrated strip-free SMBG system resulted in a significantly greater increases in mean SMBG testing frequency compared with single-strip systems. At week 24, the mean SMBG frequency in the strip-free system group remained significantly greater than baseline, while testing frequency in the single-strip system decreased to baseline levels. Although we failed to recruit and retain all patients who were approached for this study (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;478), the observed study power for the tests of treatment differences were not adversely affected because the observed change in SMBG frequency was significantly greater (with lower standard deviation) than anticipated.</p><p>There was a significant association between change in HbA1c from baseline and use of the strip-free system. As reported, the increased SMBG frequency in the EXP group was accompanied by significant reductions in HbA1c values from baseline after 12 weeks, which were maintained through week 24. The improvement in glycemic control in the strip-free system group compared with the single-strip system group also remained significant after multivariate analysis that included HbA1c level at baseline. Moreover, a greater proportion of patients in the EXP group achieved a clinically relevant decrease of &#x02265;0.5% in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 compared with the CNL group.</p><p>The glycemic improvements seen in our study may be due to more accurate and/or frequent bolus insulin dosage calculations. Because manual calculation of bolus insulin dosages is complex and time consuming, patients often do not perform these calculations and, instead, rely on empirical estimates, which can lead to poor glycemic control (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Although patients were provided no additional tools to aid in their bolus calculations, it is possible that changes in their behavior regarding SMBG frequency may have influenced their willingness to appropriately and more frequently calculate their prandial insulin dosages.</p><p>A key limitation of the study was a probable selection bias among clinicians. As described earlier, investigating clinicians selected patients based on their assessment of each patient's clinical need. If EXP clinicians did, indeed, select less adherent and/or less well-controlled patients, this would likely explain the imbalances seen in baseline HbA1c levels and SMBG frequency. However, it would also suggest that EXP clinicians recognized the potential value and utility of the strip-free system relevant to these patients and that the strip-free system achieved significant gains in testing frequency and HbA1c reduction with potentially more adherence-challenged patients. Although additional multivariate analyses methodologies were performed to control for these baseline differences, we recognize the potential of these imbalances to influence our findings. A more traditional randomization scheme would have limited selection bias by minimizing clinician discretion at study initiation; however, we chose a cluster-randomized study design to avoid any potential &#x0201c;cross-contamination&#x0201d; of study participants, both patients and clinicians, which can occur throughout the course of an unblinded study when &#x0201c;within-clinic&#x0201d; randomization is utilized <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Another possible limitation of the study was the potential influence of the &#x0201c;novelty effect&#x0201d; among EXP patients. We recognize that receiving a new blood glucose meter would likely prompt increased SMBG frequency among patients during the first few weeks of the study, and that this increased frequency would then subside over time. This was not observed in our study; the increased SMBG frequency and associated improvements in HbA1c that occurred between weeks 0 and 12 within the EXP group were sustained for the duration of the study, suggesting that the increased SMBG frequency may have provided a greater amount of meaningful information that facilitated patients' ability to make more appropriate therapeutic decisions. Moreover, one might have expected CNL patients to maintain their current monitoring frequency, and even increase their frequency due to the study effect <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Monitoring frequency in CNL patients showed a modest increase during the first 12 weeks of the study (significantly less than that achieved by EXP patients at week 12) and then declined to baseline levels at the end of the study. Although modest HbA1c improvements were seen in the CNL group at weeks 12, albeit, significantly less than that achieved by EXP patients, CNL group glycemic control deteriorated from week 12 to week 24 in direct proportion to decreased SMBG frequency. Lack of standardization of meters used by CNL patients is also a possible limitation due to differences in meter testing procedures and ease of use.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to explore the potential impact of an integrated strip-free SMBG system on SMBG frequency and glycemic control in a large, international patient population. Results from the ExAct study demonstrated that the use of the Accu-Chek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mobile System can lead to significant increases in the frequency of SMBG tests towards guideline-recommended values in previously non-adherent patients and to improvements in glycemic control. Importantly, the SMBG and glycemic improvements seen with the integrated strip-free technology were maintained throughout the study period, suggesting that patients had better awareness of their glucose levels and were able to make the necessary adjustments to their medication and diet in a timely manner, thus supporting adherence to their medication. Although additional studies are needed to further stratify the changes in SMBG testing frequency to type 1 or type 2 diabetes patients in order to determine whether one type of patient is more responsive to the new technology than the other, our findings suggest that the benefits of an integrated strip-free SMBG system may be generalizable across a large range of individuals with insulin-treated diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><article-title>Standards of medical care in diabetes &#x02013; 2013</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><volume>36</volume><issue>Suppl.&#x000a0;1</issue><year>2013</year><fpage>S11</fpage><lpage>66</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23264422</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref2"><source>Global guideline on self-monitoring of blood glucose in non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes</source><year>2009</year><publisher-name>International Diabetes Federation</publisher-name><comment>Available from:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/SMBG_EN2.pdf" id="intref0010">http://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/SMBG_EN2.pdf</ext-link><comment>Accessed 03.11.13</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Parkin</surname><given-names>C.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Buskirk</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hinnen</surname><given-names>D.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Axel-Schweitzer</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Results that matter: structured vs. unstructured self-monitoring of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes</article-title><source>Diabetes Res Clin Pract</source><volume>97</volume><year>2012</year><fpage>6</fpage><lpage>15</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22464874</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group</collab></person-group><article-title>The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</article-title><source>N&#x000a0;Engl J Med</source><volume>329</volume><year>1993</year><fpage>977</fpage><lpage>986</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8366922</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schutt</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Krause</surname><given-names>U.</given-names></name><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dapp</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Grziwotz</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose related to long-term metabolic control?
