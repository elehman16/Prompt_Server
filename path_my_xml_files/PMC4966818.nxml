However, penetrance differs interindividually, indicating that environmental and behavioral factors may modify this risk. It is well documented that the risk for sporadic breast cancer disease can be modified by changing lifestyle factors that primarily include physical activity, dietary habits, and body weight. It can thus be hypothesized that the modification of these lifestyle factors may also influence the incidence and progression of cancer in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This multicenter, interdisciplinary, prospective, two-armed, randomized (1:1) controlled trial aims to enroll a minimum of 600 <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers to partake in either a lifestyle intervention or usual care. The study primarily aims to demonstrate an improvement of nutritional behavior (adherence to the Mediterranean diet), body mass index, and physical fitness. Furthermore, the effects on quality of life, stress coping capacity, breast cancer incidence, and mortality will be investigated. The intervention group (IG) will receive a structured lifestyle intervention over 12&#x000a0;months, whereas the control group (CG) will only receive information regarding a healthy lifestyle. During the first 3&#x000a0;months, women in the IG will receive structured, individualized, and mainly supervised endurance training with a minimum of 18 MET-h physical activity per week and nutrition education based on the Mediterranean diet. Over the following 9&#x000a0;months, IG monthly group training sessions and regular telephone contacts will motivate study participants. The CG will receive one general training session about healthy nutrition in accordance with the recommendations of the German Society of Nutrition (standard of care in Germany) and the benefits of regular physical activity on health status. At randomization and subsequent time points (3 and 12&#x000a0;months), cardiopulmonary fitness will be assessed by spiroergometry, and nutritional and psychological status will be assessed by validated questionnaires, interviews, and clinical examinations.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>As data on the role of lifestyle intervention in women with a hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer are currently lacking, this study will be of major importance from a scientific, as well as a practical advice viewpoint. It will investigate the optimal strategy to improve physical fitness, nutritional status, and psychological factors such as quality of life, perceived stress, optimism, as well as incidence and outcome of cancer in this selected group of women at high risk. If the study indicates a positive long-term outcome, a structured lifestyle intervention program could be added to health care prevention strategies for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02516540?term=LIBRE&#x00026;rank=11">NCT02516540</ext-link>.

However, since penetrance rates are not 100&#x000a0;%, it can be postulated that risk-modulating factors do exist. It can be shown that the risk of development of cancer in gene carriers may be influenced through genetic factors (polymorphisms) as well as exogenous factors such as number of pregnancies, year of birth, and physical activity during youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The risk for breast cancer is lower if gene carriers were born before 1940, have given birth, or were physically active during their youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The risk for developing sporadic breast cancer is considerably influenced by physical activity, nutrition, and body weight factors which also affect disease progression. Likewise, it has been demonstrated in several prospective studies that regular physical activity can significantly reduce breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal and premenopausal women, the risk being reduced on average by 25&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the risks of recurrence and mortality in women with breast cancer are reduced by 50&#x000a0;% if they engage in regular physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Further advantages of physical activity include a gain in the quality of life, increased fitness, and better tolerance of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nutrition also influences the risk for breast cancer. Obesity and weight gain increase the risk of breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A weight gain of more than 20&#x000a0;kg after the age of 18 doubles the risk for breast cancer. Furthermore, women with a body mass index (BMI) of &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> have a greater risk of developing distant metastases and of dying of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a prospective study of patients with sporadic breast cancer who were given adjuvant standard therapy, a calorie- and fat-reduced nutrition program led to a significant improvement in recurrence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, in the prospective PREDIMED prevention trial, women in the Mediterranean diet arm supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil had a 68&#x000a0;% lower risk for breast cancer compared with the controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Further risk factors for breast cancer include depression, a pessimistic outlook on life, and problems of coping with stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It was shown that physical activity has a favorable influence on stress management and depression. Many studies have convincingly documented the great significance of an optimistic life perspective for different psychological and somatic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A positive correlation was shown between an optimistic outlook on life and psychological well-being, health, stress reduction, and mortality, as well as a quicker recovery rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>So far, no studies exist in this context on women with hereditary breast cancer or women with a deleterious <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation. Even retrospective data are rare. There is only one publication on this subject by Manders in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which reports on an association between increased body weight and an increased risk for breast cancer in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation carriers.</p><p>We therefore aim to examine whether a lifestyle intervention in the form of structured physical endurance training and nutrition education, emphasizing the Mediterranean dietary pattern, will lead to an improvement of nutritional behavior (adherence to the Mediterranean diet), BMI, physical fitness, quality of life, and optimistic outlook on life, and cause a significant reduction of the perceived stress. Secondary aims of the study are to investigate whether the intervention will lead to a reduction of breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Design/methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is a multicenter, prospective, two-armed randomized (1:1) controlled clinical trial. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether a structured, one-year exercise program combined with a Mediterranean dietary pattern in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers will improve BMI, physical fitness (ventilatory threshold VT1 in spiroergometry), and adherence to a Mediterranean diet in the intervention group. Additionally, we will analyze whether the lifestyle intervention has a positive effect on quality of life, perceived stress, optimistic outlook on life, breast cancer incidence, and mortality.

The program is applied intensively during the first 3&#x000a0;months and is maintained and monitored for the following 9&#x000a0;months through monthly contacts and meetings. The lifestyle intervention program comprises the measures described in the following paragraphs.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Physical activity</title><p>The LIBRE training program is primarily endurance-oriented training, which is completed during the course of one year. After a mandatory introductory lecture on the theory behind the intervention training, the goal is to increase physical activity to &#x02265;18 MET-h/week (MET&#x02009;=&#x02009;Metabolic Equivalent of Task). This activity level has been correlated consistently with a reduction of morbidity and mortality in patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This goal should be achieved within the first 12&#x000a0;weeks and maintained throughout the whole study period. Each subject receives an individual training plan, which is continuously adapted according to her fitness status to support this goal. The training is divided into two phases: the intensity of the first phase should be at least 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% of peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> peak) (initial phase, weeks 1&#x02013;6), and that of the second phase should be 60&#x02013;75&#x000a0;% of the VO<sub>2</sub> peak (optimization phase, weeks 7&#x02013;12). In the first 12&#x000a0;weeks of the intervention program, training takes place 2 times per week as supervised training and once per week as home-based training (HBT). Afterwards supervised training units are only carried out monthly so that training in phase II (months 4&#x02013;12) is mainly HBT. Training continues to take place with an intensity of at least 60&#x02013;75&#x000a0;% of the VO<sub>2</sub> peak in accordance with the individual training plan.</p><p>A record of compliance with the training intervention program as well as with the achieved MET-hours/week is kept in the training diaries (questionnaire on physical activity, V0&#x02013;V2). Participants are asked to record their daily activities as well as intentional physical activity including intensity and duration of training. The training intensity levels are assessed from spiroergometry and are outlined in the diary, which facilitates training control. Monthly supervised training units (as of V1) offer the opportunity to realign training intensity and discuss any problems with adherence to training. In addition, physical activity is recorded by questionnaires (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] from SE&#x02013;V4, and physical fitness is assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing by spiroergometry (VO<sub>2</sub> peak) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] at time points SE, V1, and V2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Nutrition</title><p>Within the framework of the LIBRE study, the nutrition intervention is based on the principles of a Mediterranean dietary pattern (MD). Furthermore, obese patients (BMI &#x02265;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) are instructed to limit their energy (kilocalorie) intake. Nutrition intervention in the intervention group begins with an intensive 3-month nutrition program during which biweekly nutrition courses led by dietitians take place in groups. The group course includes a cooking class and a guided tour of a supermarket. At the end of the first 3&#x000a0;months, the nutrition courses take place at monthly intervals for the remaining course of the first study year. The main objective of the nutrition intervention is to provide practical nutritional training, which should enable the subjects to achieve a long-term change in their eating habits, replacing former eating habits with the MD. Eating habits are recorded using validated questionnaires (the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Food Frequency Questionnaire [EPIC-FFQ] and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener [MEDAS]) at the time points SE, V1, V2, V3, and V4. Participants of the intervention group additionally received the MEDAS questionnaire at time points V1-6 and V1-9.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Psychological support</title><p>Psychological support of the intervention group comprises solely an explanation of the psychological data survey questionnaires given to the study participants. Explicit psychological support is not planned. The participants are informed that the objective of the lifestyle study is, among other things, that the lifestyle change including regular physical activity and healthy eating should lead to an improvement in general quality of life, stress reduction, a more optimistic outlook on life, and a better attitude towards endurance training and MD. In order to verify this, the participants receive the questionnaires Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS), Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires-Core 30 and BR23 (EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23), and Evaluation of Physical Activity and Nutrition (&#x0201c;Bewertung koerperlicher Aktivitaet und Ernaehrung&#x0201d; [BKAE]) at different time points (SE, V1, V2, V3, and V4). Advice on psycho-oncological aspects of the LIBRE study is given during the introductory lecture at the beginning of the study. Particular importance is attached to participants giving as detailed information as possible in the survey questionnaires.</p><p>Psychological advice given to the study participants should serve to inform the subjects of the significance and improvement of psycho-social lifestyles for the prevention of breast and ovarian cancer, as well as to promote compliance and recognize possible psychological impediments for participation in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control group</title><p>The control group will receive a mandatory introductory lecture on the positive effects of physical activity on the incidence and prognosis of breast cancer. Afterwards all participants will be given a brochure providing the most important facts on this topic.</p><p>Contrary to the intervention group, no training and no physical activity diaries will be provided. Changes in physical activity behavior are measured identically to the interventional group through questionnaires (IPAQ at SE&#x02013;V4) and examinations of physical capacity (VO<sub>2</sub> peak) at time points SE, V1, and V2.</p><p>Additionally, a dietitian-led nutrition group lesson on healthy eating will be held for the control group. During this lesson the subjects receive general information based on the recommendations of the German Society of Nutrition, which is referred to as &#x0201c;usual care in Germany&#x0201d; in this study. Eating habits will be recorded identically as in the intervention group via validated questionnaires (EPIC-FFQ and MEDAS) at the defined time points SE, V1, V2, V3, and V4.</p><p>The psychological guidance of the control group consists of an explanation of the psychological data entry forms which are given to the study participants. An explicit psycho-oncological intervention strategy is also not intended in this group. The participants will be informed that changes in daily routine concerning physical activity and dietary habits among other things should resolve in improvement of quality of life, a reduction of stress, and a more optimistic approach to the future. In order to verify this, the participants will receive questionnaires (TICS, LOT-R, EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23, and BKAE for registration of changes in attitude towards physical activity and MD) at SE and V1&#x02013;V4.

For each item questions are asked concerning the average quantity consumed (predefined servings) and the frequency of consumption (one to six times per day, week, month, or year). Color photos simplify the definition of serving sizes for food items which are not consumed in normal household quantities. Furthermore, the participants are specifically asked about their use of cooking fats/oils, the frequency of consumption of sauces with meat and fish, the fat content of the milk they consume, the use of sugar and milk in coffee and tea, and the seasonal consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. The data input and questionnaires are evaluated via the study management system (SMS) for health research, which has been developed and supervised by the Department of Epidemiology of the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke (DIfE).

Accordingly there are reference values by Scott et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which are of great importance for comparing our data. The advantage of the QLQ-C30/-BR23 is on one hand its present-day relevance and on the other hand its validation for breast cancer (QLQ-BR23). We formulate the hypothesis that regular physical activity and the implementation of healthy nutrition (intervention group) can lead to a general and specific improvement in HRQOL. The 53 questions focus on cognitive, social, emotional, and physical functioning, and one scale evaluates the global health status in general. Three other scales estimate fatigue, pain, as well as nausea and vomiting, and six single items measure dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties. The breast cancer-specific module QLQ-BR23 comprises 23 multiple and single items assessing disease symptoms (breast and arm symptoms, upset caused by hair loss and systemic therapy side effects) as well as addressing body image, sexual functioning, and future perspectives.

Most people take a positive view of prevention such as cancer screening, but de facto only a small number of people actively make use of cancer prevention measures. Therefore, for the present LIBRE study, above all due to the question of the practicability of the intervention program in the sense of good compliance, it is important to ask about the attitudes towards lifestyle changes. In particular, we are interested in two questions. (1) What are the predictors of regular participation in preventive measures (sport, nutrition)? (2) Are attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived behavior control towards a behavior relevant for the intention of behavior (i.e., to train regularly and to eat healthfully) and for the de facto behavior shown? To answer these questions, we developed a new questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior according to Fishbein and Ajzen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This theory maintains that the best predictors for planned and deliberate behavior are the intentions related to behavior. Behavioral intentions are defined by attitudes towards a behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control. The theory of planned behavior has been examined in many studies dealing with health psychology (e.g., surgery intentions, food adherence, and physical activity behavior among others) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>The questionnaire Evaluation of Physical Activity and Nutrition (Bewertung koerperlicher Aktivitaet und Ernaehrung, BKAE) contains questions which are divided into two sections: physical activity and regular healthy nutrition. Each section has four scales (two attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control) and two innovative single items (past behavior and factor time and guidance). All questions are measured on seven-point Likert scales and, to avoid conformational bias, several statements are reverse scaled.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The trial employs three independent co-primary endpoints: (1) the adherence to the Mediterranean diet measured by the MEDAS score, (2) the BMI, and (3) the ventilatory threshold VT1 measured in spiroergometry as a parameter of physical fitness one year after the structured intervention program.</p><p>Secondary endpoints of the study are, among others, the measurements of quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30-/BR23), stress coping (TICS), optimism grade (LOT-R), fat calorie intake (EPIC-FFQ), maximal oxygen intake (VO<sub>2</sub> max), and physical activity (IPAQ) over time (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for details).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Primary, secondary, and other outcome measures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Primary outcome measures:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Body mass index (BMI)<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1) determined by bicycle spiroergometry<break/>For all three outcome measures, the change between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months will be analyzed.<break/>Secondary outcome measures:<break/>Psychology:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Stress coping capacity, as measured by the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS) questionnaire<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Grade of optimism, as measured by the Life Orientation Test (LOT) questionnaire<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Quality of life, as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)<break/>Physical activity:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> peak), as measured by spiroergometry<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and watts at ventilation threshold 1 (VT1 and VT2), as measured by spiroergometry<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Physical activity, as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)<break/>Nutrition:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Dietary habits and calorie intake, as measured by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Study Food Frequency Questionnaire (EPIC-FFQ)<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; BMI<break/>Breast cancer incidence and mortality<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Breast cancer incidence<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Overall and breast cancer mortality rate<break/>Other outcome measures:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Attitudes and beliefs regarding physical training and healthy diet, as measured by the &#x0201c;Bewertung koerperlicher Aktivitaet und Ernaehrung&#x0201d; (BKAE) questionnaire<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Satisfaction with the study<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Body fat content, as measured by skinfold measurement<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Tobacco and alcohol consumption<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Omega 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids in the erythrocyte membrane<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Serum cholesterol including serum high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Serum triglycerides, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and insulin<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Serum proenkephalin and proneurotensin<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Hospitalization days for breast cancer<break/>If appropriate, secondary and other outcome measures will be analyzed as the change from baseline over time of all available time points.</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Sample size, randomization, and statistical analysis</title><p>The following differences of the three co-primary endpoints between study arms one year after the structured intervention are considered clinically relevant and achievable: 1 point increase in the MEDAS score, 1&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>u</sup> reduction in BMI, 1&#x000a0;ml/min/kg increase in the ventilatory threshold VT1.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a structured one-year exercise program combined with a Mediterranean dietary pattern will improve BMI, maximal as well as aerobic and anaerobic physical capacity, and adherence to a Mediterranean diet in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers. Additional secondary endpoints are to demonstrate that the lifestyle intervention will also improve psychological parameters, like quality of life, stress coping capacity, and grade of optimism. An important further intention of the trial is to investigate whether the improvement of physical fitness, body weight, quality of life, and stress coping capacity will lead to a reduction of breast cancer risk, progression of disease, and mortality. A similar approach is followed by Pasanisi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], who published a study protocol for a randomized trial in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers to test whether moderate calorie intake and protein restriction together with increasing physical activity will decrease serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). They hypothesized a functional interaction between the <italic>BRCA</italic> genes and IGF-1 systems, which may be causal for a higher penetrance of breast cancer in those with elevated IGF-1 levels. They further hypothesize that a lifestyle intervention may reduce IGF-1 levels and thereby potentially cancer penetrance.</p><p>Both studies will evaluate the role of a lifestyle intervention program in the same cohort of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers. Therefore, it seems realistic to add a structured lifestyle intervention program to health care prevention programs in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers in the future. Current risk-reducing strategies for women at risk include prophylactic mastectomy and early detection programs. With structured exercise and dietary changes, mutation carriers will be able to independently play a role in cancer prevention, which will help to strengthen their self-government. Moreover, it is known that psychological intervention may improve stress symptoms in patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By improving and optimizing the women&#x02019;s lifestyle, we expect a preventive health effect not only on a somatic, but also on a mental level.</p><p>A limitation of the trial might occur during randomization, especially for highly motivated participants. They may be disappointed if randomized to the control arm, and therefore may withdraw from the study or exercise nonetheless. In addition, cross-over communication regarding the Mediterranean dietary pattern between the intervention and control group cannot be completely avoided. On the other hand, it might be difficult for less motivated working women or mothers to integrate the exercise program into their everyday life.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is currently recruiting participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BIA, bioelectric impedance analysis; <italic>BRCA</italic>, breast cancer gene; CHC, coronary heart condition; ECG, electrocardiogram; GC-HBOC, German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer; HBT, home-based training; LIBRE, Life-style intervention in <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers; LOT-R, Life of Orientation Test; MD, Mediterranean dietary pattern; MET, Metabolic Equivalent of Task; QLQ-C30/-BR23, Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 and breast cancer module 23; SE, study entry; SSCS, Screening Scale for Chronic Stress; V, visit</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec32"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1504_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT checklist.
