[<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] We developed an alternative model&#x02014;a specialist unit in a general hospital to care for people with delirium and dementia (the Medical and Mental Health Unit (MMHU)). [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Its development aimed to reflect best practice in dementia and delirium care taking into account the published literature, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and expert opinion from clinicians working in the field. It was tested in a randomised controlled trial (Trial of an Elderly Acute care Medical and mental health unit (TEAM)), [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] which showed that the quality of care was higher, as judged by direct observation and carer satisfaction, but benefits in health status outcomes at three months were small and not statistically significant [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There are no other robust studies of these types of specialist units and the cost and economic implications of this model of care are not yet known.</p><p>This analysis compared the costs and cost-effectiveness of the MMHU with those of standard care, from the perspective of the National Health Service and publically funded personal social care. The trial-based economic evaluation is reported in accordance with the CHEERS Statement (<xref rid="pone.0140662.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Medical and Mental Health Unit and standard care wards</title><p>An existing 28-bed acute geriatric medical ward, including its ward-based staff, was converted to a specialist unit, MMHU, where only older patients with cognitive impairment were admitted. Five main areas of enhancement (described in depth elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) were: 1) Additional specialist mental health staff were employed (mental health nurses and occupational therapist along with additional support from physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, psychiatry and geriatric medicine), including three healthcare assistants working as activity coordinators; 2) Staff training in recognition and management of delirium and dementia and the delivery of person-centred dementia care; 3) A programme of organised therapeutic and diversionary activities; 4) The environment was made more appropriate for people with cognitive impairment; 5) A proactive and inclusive approach to family carers was promoted.</p><p>Standard care wards included five acute geriatric medical wards, and six general (internal) medical wards. Practice on geriatric medical wards was based on the principles of comprehensive geriatric assessment, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and staff had general experience in the management of delirium and dementia. Mental health support was provided, on request, from visiting psychiatrists. There was no dedicated old age liaison psychiatry service at that time. None of the MMHU enhancements listed and described above was routine on standard care wards.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>TEAM trial</title><p>A randomised controlled trial, Trial of an Elderly Acute care Medical and mental health unit (TEAM), was conducted. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The trial protocol (<xref rid="pone.0140662.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>) was published, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the full report on the trial, including recruitment flow chart, is available elsewhere as an open-access article.[<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The protocol for the TEAM study was given a favourable opinion by the Nottingham 1 Research Ethics Committee (reference 10/H0403/1). Recruitment of patient participants followed the requirements of the English Mental Capacity Act (2005) and was approved by the research ethics committee. After allocation to a ward, research staff identified patients who had been randomised, discussed the study with them and assessed them for capacity to give consent to take part in the study. Those with capacity who were willing to participate were asked to give written consent. Most potential participants lacked capacity, in which case an informal carer was asked to give written agreement to participation. If there was no available carer, the nurse in charge of the ward was asked to act as a "professional consultee".</p><p>Patients were recruited who had been admitted for acute medical care to a single large teaching hospital. Participants were aged over 65, and identified by admissions unit physicians as being &#x02018;confused&#x02019;. We used the term &#x02018;confused&#x02019; as there is considerable overlap between delirium and dementia in this population, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and dementia is often undiagnosed in the community and hospital. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Suitable patients identified on the hospital&#x02019;s medical admissions unit were entered onto a computerised screening log and, if a bed was available on the MMHU, randomised 1:1 between the MMHU and standard care in a permuted block design, stratified for previous care home residence. Randomised patients who were readmitted were assigned their original allocation. Regardless of allocation, patients had access to standard medical and mental health services, rehabilitation, intermediate and social care. Baseline clinical data was collected from the patient, family members, or other informal or professional carers by interview with a researcher. Outcomes were ascertained at interviews at home 90 days (&#x000b1;7 days) after randomisation by researchers not involved in recruitment or baseline data collection, and blind to allocation.</p><p>Between July 2010 and December 2011, 310 patients were recruited from the MMHU and 290 from standard care. One patient in the MMHU arm was lost to follow-up (moved away from the geographical area). A professional consultee was involved in the recruitment of 30 MMHU and 31 standard care participants, as allowed by English mental capacity law when a patient lacking mental capacity has no family or friends to advocate for them. Baseline characteristics of the population and clinical effectiveness outcomes have been reported previously. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In short, there was no statistically significant difference between settings in the trial primary outcome, days spent at home (median 51 vs 45 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference -12 to 24; <italic>p</italic> = 0.3); median index hospital stay was 11 vs 11 days, mortality 22% vs 25% (95% CI for difference: -9%, 4%), readmission 32% vs 35% (95% CI for difference: -10%, 5%), and new care home admission 20% vs 28% (95% CI for difference: -16%, 0), for the MMHU and standard care, respectively. Participants on the MMHU spent significantly more time with positive mood or engagement (79% vs 68%; 95% CI for difference: 2%, 20%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), and experienced more staff interactions that addressed emotional and psychological needs (median 4 vs 1 per observation; p&#x0003c;0.001). More family carers were satisfied with care (overall 91% vs 83%; 95% CI for difference: 2%, 15%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), and severe dissatisfaction was reduced (5% vs 10%; 95% CI for difference: -10%, 0; <italic>p</italic> = 0.05).

[<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We used EQ-5D utility measure in this economic evaluation because of its relevance for UK policy makers, particularly the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Patient-reported EQ-5D valuations at baseline and 90-day follow up (measuring health state on a scale in which 0 and 1 represent death and full health, respectively) were applied to estimate QALYs gained, assuming baseline utility until date of death for a patient dead at follow up. Hence, a patient&#x02019;s QALYs gained were calculated as the area under curve using linear interpolation between EQ-5D measurement points, and health outcome was summarised into a single index. Due to the nature of the population studied, 55% of participants had missing data for self-reported EQ-5D. Other health status variables [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] were used to impute values in these cases, including proxy completed EQ-5D, dementia-related quality-of-life at follow up (DEMQOL [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), behavioural and psychological symptoms (Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI) [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), and dependency in personal activities of daily living (Barthel ADL [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Costs</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Costs of delivering the MMHU intervention</title><p>The MMHU intervention cost was calculated as the additional MMHU staffing cost compared with standard care on a general or geriatric ward&#x02013;additional staff employed on MMHU and associated costs are presented in <xref rid="pone.0140662.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

However, the results did show a trend towards cost savings and a high probability of cost-effectiveness (94%) from a combined health and social care perspective, when usual criteria were applied. When excluding the cases in which there were cost savings but worse outcomes (QALY loss), the probability of cost-effectiveness fell to 59%.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Internal validity</title><p>The strengths of this study were that it was conducted as part of a RCT rather than a less robust design, resource-use ascertainment was by extraction from electronic datasets rather than recall enhancing the quality of the data and hence results, and multiple resource-use datasets were examined to produce a more comprehensive estimate of costs than using a single and potentially unreliable data source. The economic evaluation was conducted independently of the clinical service and, in large part, independently of the investigators who had designed and implemented the clinical effectiveness evaluation.</p><p>There were considerable missing data, due to the inability of frail and cognitively impaired participants to complete EQ-5D, and a systematic difference in values for proxy compared with self-completed EQ-5D. Hence imputation was used, incorporating proxy EQ-5D and other clinical measures, to estimate the true impact of MMHU care on patients&#x02019; health status, which could be a source of error. Employing an alternative approach omitting missing data (complete-case analysis) showed no major differences in results; however, we did not ascertain informal care or privately funded costs, meaning that our findings are limited to the health and social care service perspective. Informal care costs form an important part of total costs for people with dementia.

However, 70% of standard care was situated on specialist acute geriatric medical wards delivering comprehensive geriatric assessment, which is known to deliver better health outcomes than general internal medical wards for frail older people (that is, an &#x02018;active control&#x02019;). [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The impact of the MMHU on health status may therefore have been understated compared with less specialist care.</p><p>The EQ-5D has limitations as a preference-based generic health status measure for calculating QALYs in frail and cognitively impaired older people with progressive conditions. Firstly, the EQ-5D is a simple, five dimension, 3-level measure of health status which may be insensitive to changes in health that are important in this context. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] There is some evidence to support the EQ-5D as a valid measure for assessing quality of life in older people, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] including people with cognitive impairment using proxies when necessary. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Due to the advocacy by NICE to use the EQ-5D for comparability between studies, and the lack of other, more sensitive preference-based measures which can be used to elicit the QALY, the EQ-5D was the best preferred option for performing this economic evaluation. At the time of planning this study the DEMQOL, a condition specific quality of life measure for use in older people with dementia, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] did not have a valid preference-based scoring tariff. The DEMQOL may be more sensitive for measuring condition-specific quality of life but was no different when measured in survivors at the end of the follow up period. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] More recently the UDEMQOL has been developed as a preference-based version of the DEMQOL which can be used as a condition-specific preference-based measure for eliciting the QALY. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] The UDEMQOL can be used to provide complimentary results for comparison with the EQ-5D [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and should be considered for use in future studies if further studies establish its validity in this setting. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Secondly, the QALY as elicited by the EQ-5D is a unidimensional metric of change in health status over years of life, and therefore does capture broader aspects of well-being, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] capability [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] or the &#x02018;spillover&#x02019; effect on carers [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] that may have been affected by the intervention. These aspects are increasingly recognised as areas that should be accounted for when assessing the economic outcome of trials. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] Evidence from the TEAM trial showed that participants on the MMHU spent significantly more time with positive mood or engagement, and experienced more staff interactions that addressed emotional and psychological needs. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Additionally, more family carers in MMHU arm were satisfied with care. For these reasons, we believe our analysis only presents a partial assessment of the overall benefit of the intervention.</p><p>This economic evaluation was derived from trial data up to three months of follow-up, without measuring or modelling the health and cost outcomes beyond this horizon. However, given the fast moving changes in clinical conditions of patients, the health and cost effects of MMHU care are likely to be limited to a short period after hospital stay, and the trial follow-up was long enough to assess effects of the MMHU (cf. trial protocol [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), although the trends towards cost savings (such as from long term care) may have been stronger if we had data from a longer period of follow up.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>External validity/context</title><p>This is the first study of this specific model of care: no cost-effectiveness analyses of specialist unit care for cognitively impaired frail older people have been identified. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] However, the patient group involved and the core processes of the MMHU were similar to the patient groups and core processes involved in services delivering comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), where a potential cost reduction compared with general medical care has been observed. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] Thus this study contributes towards, and is compatible with, a small evidence base about the economic consequences of CGA.</p><p>The economic impact of the health and social care of older people has been rarely described fully. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Despite recommendations to assess opportunity costs [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], only half of published studies measured costs other than secondary care, even fewer including long term or social care costs: the eight studies reporting costs in CGA trials in a recent review only reported costs from a hospital perspective, and so did not investigate whether costs were shifted to other areas of health care, or to social care or informal carers. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] Thus, this study is an important contribution to the evidence base, particularly because around 1/3 of the cost savings observed in this study were non-hospital costs (social and primary care). Despite the fact that cost savings shown were only small percentages of the total care cost occurred in the standard care arm (4% and 2%, for unadjusted and adjusted costs, respectively), the potential cost savings for the NHS could be large if similar specialist dementia care is implemented in the UK hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>What the results mean</title><p>The value of these findings depends upon the degree to which the findings from economic studies based on trials that were not positive for their primary outcome are judged by those using such information, and the degree to which conventional cost-effectiveness estimates are judged when they rely considerably upon cases in which there were cost savings but QALY losses. Health care funders may find that cost-effectiveness findings based upon QALY gains at additional cost (willingness to pay, WTP) are more acceptable than cost savings and QALY losses (willingness to accept, WTA)&#x02013;an issue discussed widely in the health and behavioral economics literature (cf. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Hence, we provided the sensitivity analysis to incorporate possible WTA/WTP disparity, by estimating probability of cost-effectiveness dependent on the value of WTA/WTP ratio. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Due to unknown decision makers&#x02019; preference over WTA/WTP, the interpretation of such sensitivity analysis is limited to the extreme in which small QALY loss is not accepted for any level of cost-savings. In this study, the interpretation is even more difficult because of the possibility that the overall benefits of the intervention may have been understated in the economic analysis. However, we conclude that there are sufficient grounds for further development of evaluation of specialist medical and mental health units.</p><p>The further development and evaluation of this comprehensive model of care can be guided by the results of this study. For example, this study illustrates the potential value of determining a wider range of health and social costs to appraise the total impact of services. Given that considerable effort was put into discharge planning, communication with families and care homes, referral to community services, and advance care planning, it is likely that the accumulation of multiple small incremental improvements in multiple processes and outcomes can only be observed when multiple sources of costs across the health and social care system are taken into account.</p><p>Mortality was high in the population studied (25% at 90 days).[<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It is difficult to define measurable outcomes in studies of palliative and supportive care, but patient experience and carer satisfaction are likely to be important. The NHS Outcomes framework includes &#x02018;a positive experience of care&#x02019; as one of its five domains. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] Tools widely used to measure health care outcomes in economic evaluations do not appear to discriminate well in the end-of-life care context, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] so carer preferences should be incorporated in healthcare decision making. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] Economic evaluation of such services may need to consider broader outcomes than the QALY. For example, a recent study has shown the advantages of multiple domain comparisons, emphasizing transparency and better informing reimbursement and research decisions when using this approach. [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] Therefore, considering the totality of outcomes, including patient experience and carer satisfaction (a cost-consequences analysis), would emphasize effects that may be more appropriate for frail older patients, often approaching the end of life. An alternative would be a cost minimization approach. Our findings suggest that care on the specialist unit was preferable (better quality and experience even if health status was no different). In this case, costs can be compared to determine preference. In this study, we showed a trend towards cost reduction in the MMHU arm, and hence a trend towards superiority.</p><p>In conclusion, further development and evaluation of specialist units in general hospitals for people with dementia and delirium is warranted based on the fact that the unit studied here led to better quality of care, [<xref rid="pone.0140662.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] has a reasonable probability of cost-effectiveness even when cost saving QALY losing cases are not included in the estimate of cost-effectiveness, and showed a trend towards cost-savings when a cost minimisation approach is taken. Such units should be seen as an important response to the challenge of managing mental health conditions in general hospitals, in addition to liaison old age psychiatry services. Further research of similar services should aim to find better ways of capturing health benefits in patient groups receiving palliative and supportive care, and use multiple cost sources to assess the full cost impact.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140662.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist for TEAM clinical trial manuscript.</title><p>Goldberg SE, Bradshaw LE, Kearney FC, et al.
