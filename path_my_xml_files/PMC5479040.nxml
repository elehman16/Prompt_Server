Over the past two decades, the absolute number of people with first stroke (16.9 million), stroke survivors (33 million), and stroke-related deaths (5.9 million) and the overall global burden of stroke (DALYs lost, 102 million) have been on the rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Statistics from the American Heart Association show that approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In China, stroke is reported as one of the most common causes of death in both urban and rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An epidemiologic study published in 2007 indicates that China has more than 7 million stroke survivors. Ischemic stroke is the most common subtype of stroke, accounting for about 80% of all strokes. Approximately 70% of stroke survivors experience functional disabilities, motor dysfunction being the most significant symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The activities of daily living and social participation are limited in patients with stroke due to motor dysfunction; this greatly influences the patient&#x02019;s quality of life and return to society. Also, these limitations place a heavy burden on the family and society as a whole, becoming a huge public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Western conventional treatment of patients with stroke includes pharmacological treatments, surgical operation, and multi-professional rehabilitation. This approach is a multi-disciplinary and complex procedure designed to improve functional disability, prevent complications, and reduce the risk of additional attacks at any stage of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In China, stroke rehabilitation mainly develops the clinical mode of combining traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine. Acupuncture use as a complementary or alternative therapy has increased worldwide and has become widely applied to stroke rehabilitation over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which confirms that the efficacy of acupuncture can have a great impact on stroke management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As early as 1997, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel recommended acupuncture as a complementary rehabilitation treatment for stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) also recommended acupuncture as a treatment for stroke; they thought that acupuncture treatment could improve a variety of functional disabilities such as motor, sensation, speech, and other neurologic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have shown that scalp acupuncture has a remarkable treatment efficacy on motor dysfunction in stroke patients in China, and in recent years, various scalp acupuncture schools have been developed to treat motor dysfunction in stroke patients in hospitals. The motor area of Jiao&#x02019;s scalp acupuncture or the anterior oblique line of the vertex-tempora of the international standardized scalp partition is usually selected as the scalp acupuncture stimulatory region to treat motor dysfunction in stroke patients; however, Jiao&#x02019;s scalp acupuncture is the more widely used of the two techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Jiao&#x02019;s scalp acupuncture combines a modern understanding of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology with traditional techniques of Chinese acupuncture to develop a radical new tool for affecting the functions of the central nervous system and accepts a central theory that incorporates brain functions into Chinese medicine principles. The motor area of Jiao&#x02019;s scalp acupuncture that is specifically used for treatment of motor dysfunction after stroke is equivalent to the structure of the precentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex on the scalp projection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to demonstrate the clinical curative effect of the motor area of Jiao&#x02019;s scalp acupuncture treatment on motor dysfunction in patients with stroke.</p><p>Moreover, with the rapid development of evidence-based medicine, any clinical intervention strategies which are used must be backed by a high level of evidence-based support. Although acupuncture as a treatment for stroke has become widely accepted and has shown a better clinical curative effect than conventional treatments, numerous meta-analysis reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] based on clinical RCTs have summarized that the clinical curative effect of acupuncture treatment in stroke remains uncertain. The reason is the often low quality of the available trials; further large-scale RCTs of better quality are still needed. Furthermore, system reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] based on scalp acupuncture treatment of motor dysfunction in stroke concluded that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a clinical recommendation due to the generally low methodological quality of the included studies. In addition, there was no evidence available on the safety of this treatment because none of the trials reported adverse effects.</p><p>At the same time, almost all the RCTs used the evaluation system of modern medicine, and based on the evaluation system of modern medicine, the clinical curative effect of acupuncture treatment for stroke has some limitations. For example, many motor function assessment scales do not accurately reflect the actual curative effect of acupuncture based on the syndrome differentiation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in a certain stage of stroke. Thus, we need to use TCM scales based on TCM symptomatology to effectively evaluate the curative effect of acupuncture. It is worth considering the best way to solve the issue of how to apply standardized RCTs to accurately evaluate the individualized curative effect of acupuncture treatment based on the theory of TCM in patients with stroke.</p><p>Based on the above, the purpose of this study is to observe the therapeutic effect of scalp acupuncture using Jiao's motor area for motor dysfunction in ischemic stroke patients by using both international general evaluation scales and the TCM evaluation system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of this proposed study is to investigate whether Jiao's scalp acupuncture treatment could improve significantly motor function in patients with ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This is an outcome assessor- and data analyst-blinded, randomized controlled study.

For the Chinese MBI version, the ten items are continence of bowels and bladder, feeding, dressing, entering and leaving a toilet, grooming, bathing, moving from a wheelchair to a bed and returning to a wheelchair, walking on a level surface for 45&#x000a0;m, and ascending and descending stairs. The standards for evaluation are as follows. Each item (activity) can be divided into five levels; each level represents a different degree of independence, the lowest level being 1 and the highest being 5, and the higher the level, the greater the independence. The normal score is 100. If a person&#x02019;s score is 100, he is able to get along without attendant care. The MBI will be assessed at baseline, during the interventional period (at 4&#x000a0;weeks and 8&#x000a0;weeks), and during the follow-up period (at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 16&#x000a0;weeks).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL) scale</title><p>The SS-QOL is a patient-reported outcome measure intended to provide an assessment of health-related quality of life, specific to patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The SS-QOL questionnaire consists of 49 items in the 12 domains of energy, family roles, language, mobility, mood, personality, self-care, social roles, thinking, upper extremity function, vision, and work. Scoring on the SS-QOL is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Response options are scored as 5 (&#x0201c;no help needed/no trouble at all/strongly disagree&#x0201d;), 4 (&#x0201c;a little help/a little trouble/moderately disagree&#x0201d;), 3 (&#x0201c;some help/some trouble/neither agree nor disagree&#x0201d;), 2 (&#x0201c;a lot of help/a lot of trouble/moderately agree&#x0201d;), and 1 (&#x0201c;total help/could not do it at all/strongly agree&#x0201d;). The domains are scored separately; a total score is also calculated, with higher scores indicating better function. The SS-QOL will be assessed at baseline, during the interventional period (at 4&#x000a0;weeks and 8&#x000a0;weeks), and during the follow-up period (at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 16&#x000a0;weeks).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Stroke Syndrome of TCM (SSTCM)</title><p>The SSTCM was developed mainly based on a quantified index of TCM symptoms. The SSTCM includes signs and symptoms which cause the most concern for patients and doctors after stroke. SSTCM mainly consists of two domains: TCM symptoms, and pulse conditions and tongue pictures. The TCM symptoms area contains 24 items. The assessment standards of each item are divided into four levels and corresponding scores (normal&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, light&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, middle&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, heavy&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), based on the severity of the symptoms and their impact on life.

As acupuncture was developing, various physicians began to introduce western neurophysiology into the field of acupuncture and explored correlations between the brain and human body. Dr. Jiao Shun-fa, who is the founder of Jiao&#x02019;s scalp acupuncture and a neurosurgeon in Shan Xi Province, is also the recognized founder of Chinese scalp acupuncture. Dr. Jiao combined the modern understanding of neurophysiology and neuroanatomy with the traditional concept of acupuncture to develop the new scalp acupuncture utilized to affect the functions of the central nervous system. Scalp acupuncture uses special techniques to harmonize and regulate the functional activities of the brain and body. Many researches on scalp acupuncture have indicated positive results in treating various disorders of the central nervous system. Stroke is one of the most common diseases for which acupuncture treatment is recommended, according to the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In view of the motor dysfunction that occurs post-stroke, the upper one-fifth and middle two-fifths of the motor area on the scalp were selected as the primary area for the scalp acupuncture stimulation region.</p><p>In stroke rehabilitation clinical studies, rehabilitation evaluation plays an important role. The FMA and MBI were selected as the gold standards for the evaluation of acupuncture treatment&#x02019;s curative effect in almost all acupuncture treatment stroke researches, both domestically and overseas. We used the FMA scale to best observe the comprehensive motor ability of stroke patients based on the specific environments and the corresponding instructions; the FMA reflects the motor dysfunction level of stroke patients and is widely applied in the evaluation of motor dysfunction after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The MBI was used as an individual-level assessment scale to evaluate daily life activities of stroke patients; it responds to the complex activity ability and necessary functional skills of patients in daily environments and is often used to assess the degree of influence of motor dysfunction in families and social environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, in Chinese medicine, stroke itself is thought to involve several interpromoting disease mechanisms, possibly including qi stagnation, heat, phlegm, blood stasis, and wind. Hence, the common name for stroke in Chinese medicine is wind stroke. According to the &#x0201c;four diagnostic methods&#x0201d; of TCM, the syndrome changes in stroke patients are in a dynamic development process. These symptoms&#x02019; academic terminologies are not relevant to the understanding of western traditional medicine for the symptoms of stroke diagnosis, including hemiplegia, aphasia, and facial nerve paralysis, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Many motor function assessment scales do not accurately reflect the actual curative effect of acupuncture based on syndrome differentiation of TCM in a certain stage of stroke. The study of acupuncture treatment of stroke should fully reflect and embody the characteristics of TCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. It needs to develop the evaluation standard of acupuncture&#x02019;s curative effect based on TCM symptomatology. It is not conducive to reasonably judge the effectiveness of acupuncture intervention based on the priority of &#x0201c;syndrome differentiation&#x0201d; because of the lack of an appropriate therapeutic effect evaluation standard of syndromes. However, SSTCM in this research conforms to the TCM identification rule of similar syndromes and highlights the advantages and characteristics of TCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture is a frequently used therapy for stroke rehabilitation in China, but the evidence of its effect from previous studies seems to be inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Some systematic reviews have been done to study the effect of acupuncture on stroke rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. These reviews have drawn consistent conclusions that acupuncture appears to be safe and effective for stroke rehabilitation, but the benefits require further confirmation with larger, more transparent and well-conducted randomized clinical trials. Thus, the purpose of this research is to observe the therapeutic effect of scalp acupuncture using Jiao&#x02019;s motor area for motor dysfunction in patients with ischemic stroke according to both international general evaluation scales and TCM evaluation systems.</p><p>Under strict quality control, this study could potentially confirm whether or not scalp acupuncture on a motor area is an effective adjunct to the standard rehabilitation treatment for stroke patients with motor dysfunction. This study also aims to explore the correlation between the TCM symptoms improved and the motor function recovery for patients with stroke, which is of great significance in further improving the evaluation system of acupuncture treatment on motor dysfunction in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p>This study has been completed. </p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Additional file</title><p>
