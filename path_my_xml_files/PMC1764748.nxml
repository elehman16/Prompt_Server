Combined administration of PGF2alpha and PGE2 increased uterine pressure in healthy cows. We hypothesized, that the combination of both prostaglandins would accelerate uterine involution and have, therefore, a positive effect on fertility variables. In commercial dairy farming, the benefit of a single post partum combined prostaglandin treatment should be demonstrated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>383 cows from commercial dairy farms were included in this study. Uterine size and secretion were evaluated at treatment 21&#x02013;35 days post partum and 14 days later. Cows were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: PGF2alpha and PGE2, PGF2alpha or placebo. For every animal participating in the study, the following reproduction variables were recorded: Interval from calving to first insemination, days open, number of artificial inseminations (AI) to conception; subsequent treatment of uterus, subsequent treatment of ovaries. Plasma progesterone level at time of treatment was used as a covariable. For continuous measurements, analysis of variance was performed. Fisher's exact test for categorical non-ordered data and exact Kruskal-Wallis test for ordered data were used; pairwise group comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment of significance level were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference among treatment groups in uterine size. Furthermore, there was no significant difference among treatments concerning days open, number of AI, and subsequent treatment of uterus and ovaries. Days from calving to first insemination tended to be shorter for cows with low progesterone level given PGF2alpha and PGE2 in combination than for the placebo-group (P = 0.024).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study indicate that the administration of PGF2alpha or a combination of PGF2alpha and PGE2 21 to 35 days post partum had no beneficial effect upon measured fertility variables. The exception was a tendency for a shorter interval from calving to first insemination after administration of the combination of PGF2alpha and PGE2, as compared to the placebo group. Further research should be done in herds with reduced fertility and/or an increased incidence of postpartum vaginal discharge.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Delayed uterine involution causes economic losses to dairy farmers. Uterine involution is normally completed between 26 to 52 days post partum, but changes after 20&#x02013;25 days are often imperceptible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Puerperal controls are often done between 20&#x02013;33 days post partum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This period overlaps with the period for normal postpartum involution, but this window of time corresponds to the period when post partum controls were described in German [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and Canadian studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. First visit criteria include evaluation of condition and involution of the uterus and type of vaginal discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Reevaluation can be done 14 days later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Inadequate production of endogenous prostaglandin has been associated with delay in uterine involution post partum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Repeated administration of prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>(PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>) twice daily from days 3 to 13 after calving shortened the time needed for uterine involution by 6 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the early post partum period, even single administration of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>does accelerate uterine involution and hasten a return to fertile ovarian cyclicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Single administrations of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>14 to 28 days post partum resulted in an enhanced first service conception rate (68% as compared to 43% in control cows) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The advantages of this therapy, though, were restricted to herds with below average conception rates (&#x0003c; 50% to first insemination) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Improved conception rate after single administration of dinoprost in cows 14 to 28 days post partum was particularly seen in cows with a serum progesterone value less than 0.5 ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This fact demonstrated that the benefit of a prostaglandin therapy was not the consequence of luteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but the beneficial effect of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>administered post partum is rather the result of myometrial contraction and thereby accelerated uterine involution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In healthy experimental cows, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) increased uterine pressure in a dose-dependent manner if administered intravenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, there was a cumulative effect related to uterine pressure, if PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>and PGE2 were given in combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In humans, the potency of prostaglandin E2 in stimulating smooth muscle contractility exceeded that of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], whereas the two substances were equally potent as to myometrial contractility in cows near parturition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In experimental cows, increased uterine pressure of PGE2 compared to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>was only measurable within the first 15 min after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Obviously, there are two different receptors for PGE2 and PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, but they also seem to be able to bind to the same receptor with different affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. PGE2 may even bind to the PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>&#x02013; receptor with higher affinity than PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and furthermore, PGE2 is degraded via PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In humans, it was, furthermore, suggested that a greater number of PGE receptors was responsible for the greater potency for PGE's in stimulating uterine contractions compared to that of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We decided to use a d-cloprostenol (as to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>: there are copies of the natural PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>and synthetic more potent cloprostenols which are racemic or in the d-form), as it can be used in a lower dose than the dl-cloprostenol, and it has an equal effect on myometrial contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>It was the purpose of our study to evaluate the effect of a single administration of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, or PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>and PGE2 in combination (= PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>+ E2), or placebo in dairy cows 21 to 35 days post partum. Our hypothesis was, that the combination of both PG's had a beneficial effect on measured fertility variables based on accelerated uterine involution and cycle induction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and including criteria</title><p>Data from 80 herds (10 &#x02013; 50 cows per herd) participating in the Fertility Service of the Clinic for Ruminants, Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Berne were evaluated (biweekly herd visits).

There was a significant difference among the 3 treatment groups in cows without CL, but after Bonferroni adjustment, only a tendency for a shorter interval from calving to first insemination for (PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>+ E2) as compared to placebo could be demonstrated. No significant effect on the interval from calving to first insemination was found for the cows in the PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>&#x02013; group as compared to placebo. This is in contrast to a study by Gay and Upham, where a single injection of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>at a median of 25 days post partum reduced median time to first breeding by 4.5 days, but not median time to conception or conception rate in clinically normal cows with a palpable corpus luteum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This fact might be induced by the selection of cows: Gay and Upham only chose cows with a palpable corpus luteum, where PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>influenced oestrus induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In our study, the modest benefit of (PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>+ E2) in cows without a corpus luteum could be explained by a favourable effect on myometrial contractility, which is intensified for (PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>+ E2) as compared to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>alone as shown in experimental diestrus cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A positive effect of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>on cows without corpus luteum as found in our study was already described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Increased uterine contraction and favourable factors involved in uterine defence mechanisms were induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In another study, prostaglandin therapy at day 26 and/or 40 independent of cycle state and uterine health provoked a decreased calving to conception interval as compared to saline treated control cows by 19 and 16 days, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Though the cows in our study were judged "healthy" by their owners, there might have been cases of clinical and subclinical endometritis. Rectal palpation and evaluation of vaginal discharge are the basis for diagnosis of subclinical endometritis and possible treatment of most cows in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the cow, a moderate amount of purulent discharge at oestrus or during uterine involution may be part of the self-cleaning process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is, therefore, difficult to decide whether cows in good general condition but suffering from purulent discharge are healthy (physiologic self-cleaning) or suffering from endometritis. The incidence of post partum uterine infections in clinically healthy cows has been assessed as reducing by self-cure from 92% in the first week to 64% in week 4 and to 25% in week 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of the prostaglandin effect administered post partum including 4052 cows described in 10 papers, days open were shorter in treated cows as compared to untreated cows (2.6 days) and this difference tended to be greater for cows with an abnormal puerperium (3.3 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>As the results of our study indicate that the administration of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>or (PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>+ E2) in healthy dairy cows 21 to 35 days post partum had no beneficial effect upon fertility variables, further research will be directed towards the treatment of cows diagnosed with clinical endometritis later than 50 days post partum with PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>and PGE2 and its effect on reproductive variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study indicate that the administration of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>or a combination of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>and PGE2 21 to 35 days post partum had no beneficial effect upon fertility variables measured. This fact is supporting the theory, that blanket treatments in healthy post partum cows should not be performed. A tendency for a shorter interval from calving to first insemination after administration of the combination of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>and PGE2, as compared to the placebo group does not justify this therapy. Contrarily, further research should be done in herds with reduced fertility and/or an increased incidence of postpartum vaginal discharge, as the combined prostaglandin treatment may have a positive effect on cycle induction and emptying the uterus of pathological contents.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AI = artificial insemination; GnRH = Gonadotropin-releasing hormone; IV = intravenously; PGE2 = prostaglandin E2; PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>= prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>; (PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>+ E2) = the combination of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>and PGE2; CL = corpus luteum</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was financially supported by Dr.E.
