Although the endogenous opioid system has been implicated in emotion regulation, the effects of mu-opioid receptor blockade on brain systems underlying negative emotional processing are not clear in addiction. Individuals meeting criteria for alcohol dependence alone (<italic>n</italic>=18, alcohol) and in combination with cocaine and/or opioid dependence (<italic>n</italic>=21, alcohol/drugs) and healthy individuals without a history of alcohol or drug dependence (<italic>n</italic>=21) were recruited. Participants were alcohol and drug abstinent before entered into this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain response while viewing aversive and neutral images relative to baseline on 50&#x02009;mg of naltrexone and placebo. We found that naltrexone modulated task-related activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus as a function of childhood adversity (for aversive versus neutral images) in all groups. Furthermore, there was a group-by-treatment-by-condition interaction in the right amygdala, which was mainly driven by a normalization of response for aversive relative to neutral images under naltrexone in the alcohol/drugs group. We conclude that early childhood adversity is one environmental factor that influences pharmacological response to naltrexone. Pharmacotherapy with naltrexone may also have some ameliorative effects on negative emotional processing in combined alcohol and drug dependence, possibly due to alterations in endogenous opioid transmission or the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist actions of naltrexone.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Emotions have a critical role in the development, maintenance and successful treatment of addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Suppression of negative affective states such as anxiety and withdrawal symptoms is one motivational pathway to support the consumption of alcohol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> As negatively reinforced drinking becomes more pronounced, negative affective states increase, thereby escalating alcohol intake and raising vulnerability to relapse after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Negative reinforcement is driven by activation of stress-induced neurocircuitry in what is widely referred to as the &#x02018;dark side' view of addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Negative emotion is thus a key affective process that could be targeted by treatment interventions for addiction.</p><p>Functional abnormalities during negative emotional processing have been found in limbic and cortical networks in substance dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Threat-related reactivity of the amygdala, for example, is strongly associated with negatively reinforced problem drinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus is associated with maladaptive emotional processing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> and alterations in hippocampal network activation and connectivity have been shown to predict relapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The prefrontal cortex has extensive connections with subcortical structures that regulate emotional processing, including the amygdala.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Alcohol and drug exposure impairs emotion regulation in this region, with interconnected medial and cingulate networks showing enhanced reactivity to arousing stimuli and reduced capacity to suppress negative affect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also act to appraise and regulate negative emotions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> These cortical areas over-activate in response to substance-related and naturally evocative stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> and, together with limbic regions associated with impaired emotional processing in addiction, are candidate loci for pharmacological intervention.</p><p>Naltrexone is one pharmacotherapy used in the management of alcohol dependence that works by modulating opioid control of dopaminergic cell firing in the ventral tegmental area, thus preventing an increase in dopaminergic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> The endogenous opioid system has been implicated in emotion regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> There is some evidence of naltrexone dampening responses to negative emotional stimuli in healthy adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> although this likely reflects stress-reducing effects of the potent kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist actions of naltrexone. mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism is known to precipitate withdrawal symptoms in humans with current<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and previous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> opiate use. MOR antagonism also precipitates aversive consequences of withdrawal from chronic opioid exposure in animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Naltrexone increases negative emotions in response to stress- and drug-related images in individuals with opioid dependence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and increases anxiety in response to drug-related films in individuals with alcohol and cocaine dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> However, the efficacy of naltrexone treatment has been shown to be associated with greater naltrexone-induced aversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> (that is, the more negative the aversive stimulus, the greater the treatment response). This may be due, in part, by activation of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis associated with all substances of abuse potential. Specifically, naltrexone-induced adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels are thought to reduce craving in individuals with alcohol dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Exposure to psychological trauma, another form of aversion, is also known to contribute to individual treatment responses to naltrexone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> This is consistent with preclinical evidence showing that early environmental adversity is associated with better treatment effects of naltrexone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> suggesting that adversity experienced in early stages of development upregulates endogenous opioid function.</p><p>Childhood adversity has long been known to be common in substance use disorders, with at least two-thirds of alcohol- or drug-dependent adults reporting a history of physical, sexual or emotional abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Childhood adversity leads to more illicit substance use and increases the risk of dependence in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Combined alcohol and drug dependence is particularly harmful, as individuals dependent on both consume more units of alcohol and have greater incidence and severity of psychiatric illness than individuals dependent on alcohol alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> The heterogeneity of alcohol use disorders, including concurrent non-alcohol drug use, necessitates development of more tailored treatment approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> However, patients are typically categorized according to their primary dependency or by the drug for which they seek treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Personalized assessment and specialized treatments addressing the effects of combined alcohol and drug-taking behavior are often omitted, thus reducing the potential for more successful recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p><p>We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain response to aversive and neutral images.

Participants provided consent, basic demographic information and baseline assessment measures. For the experimental medicine sessions, participants completed a urine screen and alcohol breath and pregnancy tests. Participants screening negative were dosed 2 h prior to the MRI scan. The experimental medicine sessions consisted of administering placebo or 50&#x02009;mg of naltrexone in a counterbalanced order. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> and the Spielberger-State Anxiety Inventory (STAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> were administered to evaluate current mood on the day of testing. Smoking was permitted up to 1 h before scanning; caffeine was only permitted in the morning. Participants were given a snack on arrival but subsequent food intake was restricted to ensure full drug absorption. The experimental medicine sessions were separated by at least 1 week.</p></sec><sec><title>Evocative images task</title><p>The evocative images task probes negative arousal to aversive stimuli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Aversive images of threat or injury were contrasted with neutral images of human or inanimate objects selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/iapsmessage.html">https://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/iapsmessage.html</ext-link>). Any images with alcohol or drugs in them were not included. Similar tasks have been used to demonstrate functional activation in alcohol- and drug-dependent groups in response to negative IAPS images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> A total of 240 images (120 aversive, 120 neutral) were presented in a block design consisting of two runs. Each run contained eight blocks of six images presented for 5 s each, followed by a 400 ms inter-stimulus interval that consisted of a fixation cross. Participants were given the implicit task to press a response button when the next image appeared on the screen. Images were counterbalanced for valence and arousal between sessions and between blocks and were presented in a pseudorandomized order, with a neutral image always presented first. Each block was separated by a 15 s rest period to prevent habituation effects. Response latency (in ms) was recorded for each participant in response to all images presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec><title>Demographic, baseline assessment and behavioral measures</title><p>Demographic and baseline assessment measures were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance (ANOVAs) for continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables. <italic>Post-hoc</italic> Tukey tests were used to identify pairwise differences for continuous variables. Mean response latencies during emotional processing were square-root transformed to stabilize variances relative to the mean (untransformed scores presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

London and Cambridge operated nominally identical 3 T Siemens Tim Trio systems and Manchester operated a 3 T Philips Achieva.</p><p>fMRI data were preprocessed using SPM8. Mean echo-planar imaging (EPI) was first computed for each participant and visually inspected in the orbitofrontal cortex and temporal lobe to ensure that none showed excessive signal dropout. All EPIs were then realigned to the first scan by rigid body transformations to correct for head movements. Next, EPIs were normalized to the standard template in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using linear and nonlinear transformations and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum of 8&#x02009;mm. Realignment parameters were then inspected for each subject to make sure that movements of translation and rotation were &#x0003c;2&#x02009;mm and 2&#x000b0;, respectively.</p><p>To identify significant differences across groups in regional responses of brain areas, a general linear model (GLM) was employed. Subject-specific GLMs included three experimental factors (aversive images, neutral images and fixation cross) and six realignment parameters as effects of no interest to account for residual motion-related variance. Low-frequency signal drift was removed using a high-pass filter (cut-off 128&#x02009;s). An autoregressive modeling of temporal autocorrelations was applied. The following contrasts were generated for the second-level analysis: (1) aversive images versus neutral images, (2) aversive images versus fixation cross and (3) neutral images versus fixation cross.</p><p>Group differences in brain responses were assessed via: (1) a full factorial analysis for the contrast &#x02018;aversive versus neutral' including three groups (control, alcohol, alcohol/drugs) and two pharmacological treatments (placebo, naltrexone) as main factors and (2) a full factorial analysis including three groups (control, alcohol, alcohol/drugs), two pharmacological treatments (placebo, naltrexone) and two task conditions (aversive images versus fixation cross, neutral images versus fixation cross) as main factors. For each model, SPM-F-maps assessing the main effect of group, the main effect of treatment, the group-by-treatment interaction and the group-by-treatment-by-condition interaction were generated, respectively.

This is in line with previous studies showing that individuals with a history of childhood abuse are more prone to combined alcohol and drug taking in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Sensitivity to stress was also high in our alcohol/drugs group compared with the control group. These differences support that aversive emotional states contribute to negatively reinforced drug seeking, consistent with the &#x02018;dark side' view of addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Negative reinforcement thus acts to increase more compulsive drug-seeking behavior, particularly during the withdrawal/negative affect stage of the addiction cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup></p><p>Similarities between the effects of childhood maltreatment, one form of early adversity, and impairments in emotion regulation systems underlying vulnerability to substance use disorders have been identified, but are poorly understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> In maltreated adolescents, increased activation in prefrontal regions has been found during effortful control of emotion regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> However, surprisingly few fMRI studies have investigated brain response to emotional stimuli in substance-dependent groups abused in childhood. It has been shown that functional alterations in mPFC activity are associated with greater maltreatment severity in response to drug- and stress-related cues in individuals with cocaine dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> Heighted mesolimbic response has also been found in response to drug-related and evocative cues in cocaine-dependent individuals reporting a history of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> Consistent with preclinical evidence demonstrating that the therapeutic efficacy of naltrexone is associated with early adverse experiences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> we found that naltrexone modulated task-related activation in the mPFC, one key region associated with emotion dysregulation in both substance use disorders and adults with histories of childhood adversity, depending on the degree of abuse experienced.</p><p>Naltrexone also modulated ACC&#x02013;hippocampal connectivity, two regions integral to mood regulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref></sup> depending on childhood adversity. In fMRI studies, hippocampal activation and network connectivity has been shown to predict cocaine relapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Limbic connectivity between the hippocampus and the amygdala is also associated with reduced adaptive emotional processing in maltreated individuals with methamphetamine dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Interplay between the ACC and the hippocampus has been implicated in the reconsolidation and expression of fear memories,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref></sup> with alterations in ACC&#x02013;hippocampal connectivity found in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup> These findings, together with our data, suggests that opioid receptors in the ACC and the hippocampus are important pharmacological targets in individuals with a history of abuse, which, although not specific to our substance-dependent groups, may be of relevance to other disorders characterized by childhood adversity, such as trauma-related or psychotic disorders.</p><p>The neurobiological effects of childhood adversity on emotional processing are under-investigated in addiction. Our data confirm that environmental factors, specifically early adverse experiences, influence variations in naltrexone response. It is possible that differences in childhood adversity might account for some of the variability in outcome in alcohol-dependent patients treated with naltrexone. Early life experiences have been shown to affect the endogenous opioid system in preclinical models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref></sup> and the present data offer convergent evidence that the effects of childhood adversity on endogenous opioids are an important indicator of responsiveness to pharmacological treatments acting on MOR transmission in humans. We suggest that behavioral interventions that promote emotion regulation strategies for traumatic experiences or pharmacological interventions that normalize cortical&#x02013;limbic connectivity may be effective in groups with high levels of childhood adversity.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of MOR blockade on different types of substance dependence</title><p>Previous fMRI studies have shown altered limbic activation in response to naturally evocative,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> negative emotional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> and substance-related<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref></sup> stimuli in substance-dependent groups. We observed greater task-related activation in the right amygdala during the processing of aversive relative to neutral images under placebo in individuals recovering from alcohol dependence. Heightened reactivity in this region is consistent with previous investigations measuring brain response to negative IAPS images in individuals with alcohol dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Similar to our alcohol group, participants from the above studies were characterized by only one drug dependency. The lack of discriminatory response between aversive and neutral images was specific to our alcohol/drugs group, possibly reflecting an emotional desensitization following prior exposure to adverse events, an attentional disengagement to aversive images (although we consider this unlikely as our task does not tap into attentional resources) or altered MOR availability/density associated with abstinence from repeated drug exposure (for example, cocaine;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref></sup> opiates;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">81</xref></sup> alcohol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref></sup>) and/or individual differences in environment factors. Although speculative for the present study, these possibilities each deserve more detailed investigation in substance-dependent groups, including use of positron emission tomography to elucidate whether associations between MOR binding potential and limbic activation differ during negative emotional processing between alcohol-dependent patients with and without combined drug dependence.</p><p>Our data further showed that naltrexone normalized the pattern of activation in the amygdala for aversive relative to neutral images in our alcohol/drugs group (that is, there was only an effect of treatment at the group level when interacting with the content of the images presented). These data demonstrate that naltrexone-induced functional alterations during negative emotional processing are specific to groups characterized by distinct patterns of drug dependencies that can persist in prolonged abstinence. Activation of stress-induced neurocircuitry contributes to the &#x02018;dark side' view of addiction, in which recruitment of brain &#x02018;anti-reward' systems (for example, within motivational circuits of the extended amygdala), an opponent process to hyperactivation of the brain reward system, provides strong motivation for negatively reinforced drug seeking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref></sup> Increased activation in response to aversive images could also lend vulnerability to craving and relapse via stress-induced reinstatement of emotion-processing circuitry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref></sup> However, a relative normalization of response by naltrexone in our alcohol/drugs group is likely due to a kappa-antagonist effect being more potent in individuals with increased dynorphin-dependent KOR activation. The latter is associated with negative emotional states, higher sensitivity to stress and/or more severe psychopathology as a consequence of combined drug taking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref></sup> Stress-induced activation of the dynorphin/kappa-opioid system has dysphoric-like effects that are thought to mediate negative emotional states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">87</xref></sup> However, KOR blockade has shown consistent anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in both humans and animals, including attenuation of a stress response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">89</xref></sup> Evaluation of the potential therapeutic benefits of selective kappa-opioid antagonism in the treatment of addiction and comorbid stress-related mood disorders thus may form an important area of new research. Increasing activation of the HPA axis with mu-opioid antagonism (including adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin and cortisol levels) is also a potential mechanism for reducing craving and withdrawal symptoms in alcohol addiction.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment implications</title><p>Naltrexone significantly reduces return to heavy drinking (to 83&#x00025; of the risk of placebo) and decreases drinking days by about 4&#x00025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref></sup> In individuals with opioid dependence, the efficacy of naltrexone treatment is largely heterogeneous and most effective in subgroups that complete treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">91</xref></sup> However, medication compliance and retention rates remain poor (28&#x00025;), particularly during early stages of recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">92</xref></sup> This is likely explained by unwanted side effects such as sedation (for example, daytime sleepiness) and gastrointestinal problems (for example, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref></sup> Extended-release naltrexone has thus been developed and used, with success, to improve adherence over and above other pharmacotherapies used in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence (for example, acamprosate, buprenorphine).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">93</xref></sup></p><p>Encouragingly, cognitive behavioral therapy with adjunct naltrexone treatment has shown to reduce return to drinking in alcohol-dependent adults, thus suggesting beneficial, synergistic effects of concurrent therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">94</xref></sup> Cognitive behavioral therapy also has the potential to improve functional abnormalities during emotional processing (in the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, for example), as shown in patients with depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">96</xref></sup> Interventions that combine naltrexone and coping skills have shown to improve treatment outcome in alcohol and cocaine dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref></sup> Coping skills therapies with a particular focus on relapse prevention may also help naltrexone-treated patients better manage their emotions after non-substance using strategies are implemented. As the current treatment length of naltrexone is recommended for 6 months,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> coping skills for childhood adversity should be addressed and evaluated as part of a longer-term therapeutic process for addiction recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitation of our analyses is its use of a retrospective self-report measure of childhood adversity. Measurement of an emotional or traumatic event may be unreliable as recollection is likely to be influenced by several confounding factors including memory biases, memory repression and current mood; however, retrospective recall of physical and sexual abuse is associated with more false negatives than false positives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">100</xref></sup> suggesting a greater tendency for adults to under- rather than to overestimate the occurrence of an abusive experience.</p><p>Secondly, our study only investigated the effects of naltrexone on the processing of aversive images compared with neutral images. Comparison with positive or rewarding non-alcohol and -drug-related images would have allowed us to investigate if the valence of emotional processing had a differential treatment effect, or if motivational salience had the same effect irrespective of emotionality.</p><p>Lastly, childhood adversity is a robust risk factor for other disorders in which emotional problems pervade. Major depressive disorder, for example, is associated with abnormal responses to negative emotional stimuli in similar brain regions observed here.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">96</xref></sup> It is possible that variations in anxiety and depression could also drive abnormalities in negative emotional processing in substance use disorders, or that more severe comorbidity has a particularly potent effect for enhancing emotion-processing circuitry. Although we cannot preclude this possibility from the current data, levels of anxiety and depression were consistent in groups across the experimental medicine sessions (and therefore exerting the same influence on emotional processing at both time points), and sensitivity to stress did not differ between the patient groups at baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Problems with emotion regulation may predate substance dependence, or may serve to exacerbate susceptibility to relapse during addiction recovery. Furthermore, loss of brain reward and recruitment of brain stress systems produces negatively reinforced motivation for compulsive drug seeking and addiction. The present study demonstrates that the effects of naltrexone on cortical activation and cortical&#x02013;limbic connectivity are dependent on variations in childhood adversity (that is, the more abuse experienced, the greater the ameliorative effect of naltrexone). Pharmacotherapy with naltrexone may also have some ameliorative effects on negative emotional processing in the amygdala in individuals with combined alcohol and drug dependence, but not alcohol dependence alone, possibly because of alterations in endogenous opioid transmission or the KOR antagonist actions of naltrexone. Childhood adversity was higher in individuals with combined alcohol and drug dependence compared with individuals dependent on alcohol only and should thus be an important consideration by treatment strategies for addiction. We conclude that childhood adversity is one environmental factor that influences pharmacological response to naltrexone. More tailored treatment approaches are required that take into account such early experiential factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>ICCAM platform collaborators: David Nutt, Anne Lingford-Hughes, Louise Paterson, John McGonigle, Remy Flechais, Csaba Orban, JF William Deakin, Rebecca Elliott, Anna Murphy, Eleanor Taylor, Trevor Robbins, Karen Ersche, John Suckling, Dana Smith, Laurence Reed, Filippo Passetti, Luca Faravelli, David Erritzoe, Inge Mick, Nicola Kalk, Adam Waldman, Liam Nestor, Shankar Kuchibatla, Venkataramana Boyapati, Antonio Metastasio, Yetunde Faluyi, Emilio Fernandez-Egea, Sanja Abbott, Barbara Sahakian, Valerie Voon and Ilan Rabiner.
