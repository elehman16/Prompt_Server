The objective of glaucoma management is to preserve visual function by providing significant and sustained decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) by means of pharmaceuticals, office-based laser procedures, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and conventional surgical procedures.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></p><p>Pharmaceutical therapies for ocular hypertension (OHT) and glaucoma include several classes of drugs. Prostaglandin analogues (PGAs) reduce IOP by targeting the prostaglandin F (FP) receptor to increase outflow of aqueous humour, primarily through the uveoscleral pathway.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the USA, latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost are the most commonly prescribed PGAs used to target the FP receptor.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although current PGAs are considered the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for pharmaceutical reduction of IOP, new classes of PGA molecules with enhanced tolerability and additional therapeutic benefits are being evaluated. One area of investigation is prostaglandin E (EP) receptor agonists. The EP3 receptor is found in the trabecular meshwork and ciliary muscle,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and has been demonstrated to augment reduction in IOP following the application of FP agonists in monkeys.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Prodrug ONO-9054 is an isopropyl ester derivative of the biologically active free acid ONO-AG-367 and is a highly selective and potent agonist of both prostaglandin EP3 and FP receptors in vitro<italic>.</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Due to its dual receptor activity, the drug has potential to produce a more potent reduction of IOP than drugs that target the FP receptor.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Although variable, IOP is often more elevated in the early morning hours.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> Thus, therapeutic efficacy of topical glaucoma medications should be effective at controlling IOP during this time. The objective of this crossover study was to assess the tolerability and the effect of morning (AM) versus evening (PM) dosing on IOP lowering of ophthalmic solution ONO-9054 in patients diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or OHT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twelve subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of bilateral OHT or chronic OAG aged 18&#x02013;80&#x02005;years were enrolled.

Most adverse events occurred in the PM dosing group, although they were all considered mild. Notably, there were no ocular adverse events in the AM dosing group; ocular adverse events were only reported in the PM dosing group. Dry eye has been reported for several pharmacological treatments of OAG,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and visual function is known to be significantly better in the mornings than in the evenings due to regeneration of the tear film while the eyes are closed.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As such, the dryness reported here is likely to originate from the active compound potentiating dryness accumulating throughout the day. There is a possibility that the frequency of adverse events reported in this study may have been augmented because of the twice-daily dosing schedule used to implement the crossover design. Subjects received vehicle twice daily&#x02014;once as placebo and once carrying ONO-9054. Ocular irritation may have been exacerbated as this administration was double what subjects would usually experience on a once-daily schedule.</p><p>The most common local side effect of FP receptor agonists is mild to moderate ocular hyperaemia: rates of 5&#x02013;20% with latanoprost, 35&#x02013;50% with travoprost and 15&#x02013;55% with bimatoprost have been reported.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Given the small population of the current study, comparisons with previously published rates would be unreliable; two (17%) subjects in both the AM and PM groups experienced hyperaemia and the incidence of ocular hyperaemia was similar in both dosing schedules. There were no meaningful pharmacokinetic differences between AM and PM dosing.</p><p>IOP displays diurnal variation. Given that IOP is often highest when measured on awakening, there is a possibility that the most serious IOP-related damage occurs early in the morning, before patients have the opportunity to instil medication into their eyes. Administration of ONO-9054 led to reductions in IOP over the 14-day dosing period irrespective of whether it was administered AM or PM. ONO-9054 produced substantial IOP lowering as early as day 2 of the study. Similar peak and trough IOP values were observed with either AM or PM dosing.</p><p>After 14&#x02005;days, ONO-9054 achieved IOP reductions comparable with those of bimatoprost, latanoprost and travoprost reported after 1&#x02005;month.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For exploratory purposes, this study which was designed to provide a gross comparison of AM and PM dosing included only 12 subjects. A crossover study design has benefits compared with a parallel design in reducing variability by using within-subject comparisons. Typically, such a design would be expected to have a greater power than the equivalent parallel design; however, no sample size assumptions were made and the effects of AM and PM administration of ONO-9054 were not compared statistically. Data for maximum reductions in IOP from baseline and subjects with IOP &#x02264;16&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg indicate that PM dosing may have had a slightly greater effect on IOP lowering than AM dosing, although a thorough examination of efficacy would require further study in more subjects. Many patients do not take glaucoma treatments in the prescribed manner despite the availability of effective topical therapies. Non-adherence in patients with glaucoma has been reported to range from 64% to 80% depending on the definition used.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Therefore, effective treatments for OHT and glaucoma will need to combine acceptable tolerability, pharmacodynamic activity and ease of administration. It is acknowledged that the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not representative of all patients with OAG. However, this was considered to be an appropriate population to study for this exploratory early phase study.</p><p>In conclusion, both AM and PM once-daily dosing of ONO-9054 provided a sustained reduction in IOP with minimal hyperaemia and few adverse tolerability effects in this population studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figures</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bjophthalmol-2015-307000-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1024" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank study staff and participants.
