In epidemiologic investigations, exposure to increased levels of ambient air O<sub>3</sub> has been associated with exacerbations of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia, generally 24&#x02013;48 hr after exposure occurs (<xref rid="b9-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b31-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Peden 2001</xref>). Controlled chamber exposures to O<sub>3</sub> cause an influx of neutrophils to the airway and a decrease in lung function, although these two effects do not correlate with each other, indicating that separate mechanisms account for these effects (<xref rid="b9-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al. 2004</xref>). O<sub>3</sub> exposure also causes increased responsiveness to allergen in allergic asthmatics (<xref rid="b31-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Peden 2001</xref>). We have recently observed that O<sub>3</sub> exposure can also result in increased expression of CD11b, CD14, CD16, CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR on airway dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages (<xref rid="b3-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2004b</xref>). It has been suggested that the action of O<sub>3</sub> on airway neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages accounts for much of the disease outcomes associated with O<sub>3</sub> exposure. These inflammatory events also mimic the type of inflammation that occurs with acute viral and bacterial infection and exacerbations of asthma and COPD (<xref rid="b26-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Maneechotesuwan et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b30-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Pauwels 2004</xref>).</p><p>Together, these observations suggest that O<sub>3</sub> challenge may be a useful controlled human disease model for screening novel anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical agents in phase I proof-of-concept trials. <xref rid="b20-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al. (2005)</xref> tested the utility of a 0.25-ppm O<sub>3</sub> challenge as a drug efficacy screen, using a single pre-treatment dose of the established anti-inflammatory agents fluticasone propionate (FP) and oral prednisolone as test agents in a randomized three-arm crossover study in 18 healthy subjects comparing the effect of these two treatments with that of placebo on O<sub>3</sub>-induced airway inflammation. <xref rid="b20-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al. (2005)</xref> reported that, compared with placebo, pretreatment with 2 mg inhaled FP and 50 mg oral prednisolone resulted in a significant reduction in post-O<sub>3</sub> sputum neutrophils per milliliter (by 62% and 64%, respectively) and myeloperoxidase (MPO; by 55% and 42%, respectively). These results demonstrated that corticosteroids do inhibit the proinflammatory actions of O<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to extend these observations by comparing the effect of a single administration of a high dose of inhaled FP (2 mg) with a dose that is employed in clinical practice for asthma and COPD (0.5 mg) and placebo. Given the importance that monocytes, macrophages, and DCs likely have in the pathophysiology of O<sub>3</sub>-induced exacerbations of disease, we also examined the effect of these treatments on expression of CD11b/CR3, mCD14, CD16/Fc&#x003b3;RIII, CD64/Fc&#x003b3;RI, CD86/B7, and HLA-DR on monocytes, macrophages, and DCs recovered from airway sputum. Clara cell protein 16 (CCP16) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) are innate immune molecules and products of airway epithelial cells (<xref rid="b15-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Haczku 2006</xref>) that can be released to the circulation during lung injury (<xref rid="b20-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al. 2005</xref>). CCP16 is induced in the serum of subjects exposed to O<sub>3</sub> challenge (<xref rid="b11-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Blomberg et al. 2003</xref>). We have previously shown that SP-D levels in the lung are significantly altered after O<sub>3</sub> inhalation in mice (<xref rid="b21-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Kierstein et al. 2006</xref>), but whether similar changes can be detected in the human serum is not known. Thus, we evaluated CCP16 and SP-D for their potential utility as serum biomarkers for assessing the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on O<sub>3</sub> injury in the respiratory tract.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Seventeen (nine male and eight female) nonsmoking healthy volunteers (10 from the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology; 7 from Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center) between 18 and 50 years of age (age, 26.4 &#x000b1; 7.4 years, mean &#x000b1; SD; body mass index, 20&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited for this study. All subjects underwent a thorough physical examination and had no history of cardiovascular or chronic respiratory disease and were free of upper or lower respiratory tract infection at least 4 weeks before study participation. All subjects had a forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of at least 80% predicted for a normal population of similar weight and height. A positive urine pregnancy test resulted in exclusion of female subjects from the study. The use of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medication (e.g., aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), vitamins, antioxidants, and dietary supplements was not permitted for the duration of the study. All study participants were able to produce an adequate sputum sample (&#x02265; 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> total cells, &#x02265; 50% cell viability, &#x02264; 20% squamous epithelial cells) as measured on their first baseline visit (sputum with no O<sub>3</sub> exposure), and all were responsive to O<sub>3</sub> (defined as &#x02265; 10% increase in total and percent sputum neutrophils) (<xref rid="b20-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al. 2005</xref>) after exposure to 0.25 ppm O<sub>3</sub> for 3 hr with intermittent moderate exercise (ventilation<sub>expiratory</sub> = 12.5 L/min/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area) as measured on the second study visit. The study was approved by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the Institutional Review Board at the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center. Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects before their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, randomized, three-period crossover study conducted at two sites. Controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposures were performed in comparable chamber setups at both the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and the Rancho Los Amigos facility (<xref rid="b1-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2004a</xref>; <xref rid="b14-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al. 1998</xref>). All subjects underwent 3-hr exposures to 0.25 ppm O<sub>3</sub> with intermittent moderate exercise (15 min rest, 15 min exercise at 12.5 L/min/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area) at screening visit 2 and each study session thereafter (visits 3&#x02013;5). Based on FP half-life and washout of sputum neutrophils after O<sub>3</sub> exposure (<xref rid="b20-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al. 2005</xref>), O<sub>3</sub> exposures were separated by a minimum of 2 weeks to avoid carryover effects. FEV<sub>1</sub> and forced vital capacity (FVC) were also measured for the purpose of assessing subject safety. Sputum induction was performed at screening visits and at 3 hr after the conclusion of each O<sub>3</sub> exposure (i.e., post-exposure). Sputum was analyzed for total and differential leukocyte count and fluid-phase components and in a subset of subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 7) for cell-surface phenotypes and cell function by flow cytometry. The study design, including measurement time points, is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0116-000799">Figure 1</xref>. FP was provided as a metered dry powder inhaler (Diskus; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). Each Diskus device contained 60 &#x000d7; 0.5 mg doses of FP. A matching placebo Diskus was also provided. Subjects were randomized to receive one of the following treatment regimens: <italic>a</italic>) 0.5 mg FP (one inhalation of 0.5 mg FP plus three inhalations of placebo); <italic>b</italic>) 2 mg FP (one inhalation of 0.5 mg FP plus three inhalations of 0.5 mg FP); and <italic>c</italic>) placebo (one inhalation of placebo plus three inhalations of placebo). The study staff observed each subject using the Diskus during clinic visits to ensure that the device was used correctly.</p></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary function</title><p>We used both spirometry and impulse oscillometry (IOS) to assess lung function status in subjects. Spirometry was assessed at preexposure, immediately postexposure, and then at 1-hr intervals for 3 hr. IOS was assessed at pre-exposure, and then hourly for 3 hr beginning 1 hr postexposure. Airway resistance and airway reactance were determined by IOS (Jaeger MS-IOS and LAB Manager Software, version 4.53.2; Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany) using the recommended techniques of the manufacturer and as previously described (<xref rid="b33-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al. 2006</xref>). Real-time recordings of mouth pressure and flow signals pulsed through 5- to 35-Hz spectrum were superimposed on tracings of tidal breathing and displayed on a computer screen. Measurements of total respiratory resistance, resonant frequency (<italic>F</italic><sub>res</sub>), reactance at 5 Hz, and low-frequency reactance area (area of reactance integrated from 5 Hz up to <italic>F</italic><sub>res</sub>) were recorded at the 5&#x02212;, 10&#x02212;, 15&#x02212;, and 20-min time points after the IOS test challenge. Spirometry was performed according to current American Thoracic Society spirometry standards (<xref rid="b13-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Enright 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sputum induction and processing and fluid-phase analyses</title><p>Subjects provided an induced sputum sample during the screening visit and at 3 hr post-O<sub>3</sub> exposure. The sputum induction and processing methods have been previously described in detail (<xref rid="b2-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b4-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In brief, three 7-min inhalation periods of nebulized hypertonic saline (3%, 4%, 5%; Devilbiss UltraNeb 99 ultrasonic nebulizer; Sunrise Medical, Somerset, Somerset, PA) were followed by expectoration of sputum into a sterile specimen cup. Sputum cell aggregates (cellular mucus plugs) were macroscopically identified and manually selected from their surrounding fluid and treated with 0.1% dithiothreitol (DTT; Sputolysin, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Total cell counts and cell viability were determined using a Neubauer hemacytometer and trypan blue (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) exclusion staining. Differential cell counts were analyzed using the Hema-Stain-3 kit (Fisher Diagnostics, Middletown, VA). Aliquots of DTT-treated sputum supernatant were immediately frozen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for later analysis of MPO and total protein by multiplex assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). All soluble factors (cytokines and chemokines) in sputum (MPO, total protein) were analyzed by a contract laboratory (HFL, Fordham, UK) using validated commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. All compounds were validated in the presence of DTT. The limits of detection after dilution (to minimize potential effects of DTT and to achieve sufficient volume for measurements) were 40 &#x003bc;g/mL for total protein (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and 36 ng/mL for MPO (Immundiagnostik, Bensheim, Germany).</p><p>For a subset of samples, remaining cells were resuspended in Hank&#x02019;s balanced salt solution and kept on ice for immediate use in flow cytometric assays for selected cell-surface molecules and phagocytosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Systemic biomarkers</title><p>Venipuncture was performed at 4 or 5 hr after O<sub>3</sub> exposures to obtain serum for Multiplex systemic biomarker analysis of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), interferon-&#x003b3; (INF-&#x003b3;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1Ra, IL-17, eotaxin, and IL-12P40 using fluorometric custom-designed validated Multiplex kits (Pathway Diagnostics, Malibu, CA). CCP16 and SP-D were assayed using commercially available ELISA kits (Biovendor, Candler, NC) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining</title><p>All flow cytometry acquisitions and analyses (surface markers, phagocytosis) were performed as previously described (<xref rid="b6-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2000a</xref>) using a FACSort flow cyto-meter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and CellQuest Pro v5.3 software (Becton Dickinson).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell-surface phenotypes</title><p>Immuno-fluorescent staining and flow-cytometry methodology have been described in detail in previous publications (<xref rid="b2-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b4-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In brief, cells (100 &#x003bc;L, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/mL) were incubated with 10 &#x003bc;L fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies, washed in Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in DPBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry within 48 hr of fixation. Viable macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and DCs in sputum were initially identified and gated on the basis of light-scatter properties and positive expression for CD45 (pan-leukocyte marker). Cell populations were then confirmed by positive staining with CD16 (neutrophils), mCD14 (monocytes), HLA-DR (macrophages), HLA-DR/CD86 (DCs), and CD3 (lymphocytes). The acquired data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro v5.3 software, and results were expressed as a rightward shift from control in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on histogram analysis. Control cells were incubated with appropriately labeled isotypic control antibodies. Surface markers analyzed included markers of innate (CD11b/CR3, mCD14/LPS receptor, CD16/Fc&#x003b3;RIII, CD64/Fc&#x003b3;RI) and adaptive (HLA-DR/MHC class II, and CD86/B7.2 co-receptor) immune function. All monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Beckman Coulter Corporation (Miami, FL).</p></sec><sec><title>Phagocytosis</title><p>We analyzed phagocytosis using fluorescein isothiocyanate&#x02013;labeled IgG-opsonized <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> zymosan-A BioParticles (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as previously described (<xref rid="b2-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b4-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).

A study similar to this one in terms of the cohort characteristics, O<sub>3</sub> concentration, and ventilation rate also reported similar postexposure decrements in FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="b19-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al. 1999</xref>).

(2000)</xref>. FP did, however, inhibit inflammatory cell (neutrophils, PMNs) influx to the airways induced by a 3-hr exposure to 0.25 ppm O<sub>3</sub> in a dose-dependent manner. The lack of correlation between spirometry and airway inflammation after O<sub>3</sub> has been well documented (<xref rid="b10-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Blomberg et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b16-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Hazucha et al. 1996</xref>), so our finding with FP in this regard was not surprising.</p><p>We observed a significant inhibition of the percent PMNs present in airway sputum after O<sub>3</sub> challenge with either 0.5 mg or 2 mg FP pretreatment, and a significant reduction and a trend for reduction in the number of sputum neutrophils per milliliter post-O<sub>3</sub> with 2 mg and 0.5 mg FP, respectively. Furthermore, we showed that serum CCP16 is a valuable systemic marker of the inflammatory state of the lung and is responsive to the effects of inhaled FP. We also observed evidence of diminished neutrophil activation with 2 mg FP, as it decreased the expression of CD16, a marker of neutrophil activation, compared with placebo. This observation coincided with a reduced MPO/total protein ratio with 2 mg FP, supporting the notion of reduced neutrophil activation. Taken together with previously published results (<xref rid="b20-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al. 2005</xref>), our results indicate that O<sub>3</sub> challenge in healthy individuals is a useful model for screening novel anti-inflammatory agents designed for treatment of airway diseases that have elevated neutrophils as a principal component of their airway inflammation. These include a subtype of severe asthma with minimal airway eosinophils (<xref rid="b25-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Louis et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b36-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Wenzel 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b37-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Wenzel et al. 1999</xref>), as well as COPD during an exacerbation (<xref rid="b18-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b34-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Stockley 1998</xref>).</p><p>An important feature of our study design was that we limited volunteer recruitment to persons with documented responsiveness to O<sub>3</sub>, defined as a minimum of a 10% increase in air-way PMNs after a screening O<sub>3</sub> challenge, to enable the assessment of FP. <xref rid="b29-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Nightingale et al.

In our study, although there was a significant effect of O<sub>3</sub> alone on percent PMNs, a substantial number of persons examined failed to have an absolute neutrophil response (using neutrophils per milligram sputum as a measure) after placebo treatment. Thus, it is possible that <xref rid="b29-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Nightingale et al.&#x02019;s (2000)</xref> results were influenced by a study population that included a high proportion of O<sub>3</sub> &#x0201c;non-responders.&#x0201d; In contrast, <xref rid="b35-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Vagaggini et al.

(2001)</xref> study appeared to be O<sub>3</sub> responsive. Furthermore, the objective of the present study was not to test the efficacy of the O<sub>3</sub> model, but rather to determine whether clinically relevant doses of FP could be assessed to support subsequent larger studies in subjects with preexisting airway disease.</p><p>In addition to its effects on airway neutrophilia, we have recently reported that O<sub>3</sub> challenge (0.4 ppm, 2 hr) causes an increase in expression of cell-surface phenotypes CD11b, mCD14, CD16, CD86, and HLA-DR on sputum monocytes recovered from normal volunteers (<xref rid="b1-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2004a</xref>). We also reported an increase in the numbers of sputum monocytes (in addition to neutrophils), suggesting that O<sub>3</sub> exposure resulted in an influx of activated monocytes. These data are supported by a recent animal study showing that O<sub>3</sub> enhanced the expression of interstitial lung cell-surface molecules associated with antigen presentation and increased the number of antigen-presenting cells in the lung (<xref rid="b22-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Koike and Kobayashi 2004</xref>). In the present study, we found that 2 mg inhaled FP decreased the expression of CD11b, mCD14, CD16, CD64, CD86, and HLA-DR on sputum monocytic cells after O<sub>3</sub> challenge compared with placebo treatment. The 0.5 mg dose of FP decreased the expression of CD86 and HLA-DR on sputum monocytes after O<sub>3</sub> challenge compared with placebo. Given that these surface molecules are involved with mediating innate immune responses (CD11b and mCD14), acquired immune responses (CD16, CD64), and antigen presentation (CD86, HLA-DR), we speculate that O<sub>3</sub> exposure may play a role in modifying how airway cells respond to a number of pathologic agents in the airborne environment. It is unclear whether the effect of FP on O<sub>3</sub>-induced changes in monocytic cell populations is due to effects on monocytes present in the airway when exposure began, or on the subsequent influx of monocytes that are activated from the circulation. Decreased monocytic cell influx could be mediated by an effect of FP on production of monocyte-associated chemotactic factors or decreased adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells lining the postcapillary venules.</p><p>The use of CCP16 as a systemic marker for injury of the epithelium has been examined by several investigators (<xref rid="b11-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Blomberg et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b17-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Helleday et al. 2006</xref>). O<sub>3</sub> exposure is associated with increased serum levels of CCP16 (<xref rid="b11-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Blomberg et al. 2003</xref>). We likewise observed that O<sub>3</sub> exposure caused an increase in serum CCP16 and further showed that pretreatment with either 0.5 mg or 2 mg inhaled FP prevented the O<sub>3</sub>-induced increase in CCP16. We compared CCP16 with SP-D, an innate immune molecule produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells and Clara cells. We previously showed that SP-D plays a protective role in O<sub>3</sub>-induced injury of the lung (<xref rid="b21-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Kierstein et al. 2006</xref>), but whether release of this protein into the circulation could parallel the inflammatory airway changes was unclear. Our study showed that CCP16 is a superior serum marker for injury of the airway epithelium and is a more sensitive biomarker for the effect of inhaled FP on airway inflammation compared with SP-D or, indeed, compared with the wide range of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory mediators we investigated.</p><p>The apparent discrepancy we observed between serum SP-D and CCP16 was likely influenced by many factors, including changes in lung concentrations. We previously showed that intracellular SP-D mRNA and protein expression are very sensitive to corticosteroids, cAMP, and cytokine levels (<xref rid="b12-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al. 2004</xref>) and that SP-D in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid is subject to rapid break-down after O<sub>3</sub> exposure of mice (<xref rid="b21-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Kierstein et al. 2006</xref>). Although no formal comparisons have been made between local (pulmonary) expression of SP-D and CCP16, we speculate that the CCP16 molecule is more resistant to O<sub>3</sub>-induced breakdown than is SP-D. This is supported by the fact that CCP16 serum levels in a number of animal and human studies accurately reflected the extent of increases in capillary permeability after acute exposure to lipopolysaccharide, chlorine, or O<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="b23-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Lakind et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b28-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Michel et al. 2005</xref>). Thus, the discrepancy we observed between serum levels of SP-D and CCP16 after O<sub>3</sub> exposure may be due to different structure, regulation of expression, and sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub>-induced molecular changes. This discrepancy highlights the specific importance of CCP16 as a biomarker for lung injury and treatment effectiveness.</p><p>Overall, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that FP will inhibit acute airway inflammation due to O<sub>3</sub> exposure in a dose-dependent fashion that includes the therapeutic dose of 0.5 mg FP. Apart from percent PMNs, however, several of our find-ings with 0.5 mg FP did not reach statistical significance. This was likely due to an insufficient number of subjects examined at this dose. Subsequent studies using the 0.5 mg dose of FP will require a larger sample size. It is also possible that a more prolonged pre-treatment with FP before O<sub>3</sub> challenge would have resulted in a more pronounced effect of 0.5 mg FP on airway inflammation, but our single-use administration of FP provided adequate drug exposure over the challenge time. We also note that this study was conducted in normal healthy volunteers. We chose healthy volunteers to avoid the potentially high variation in baseline inflammation associated with subjects with preexisting airway disease. Lower variability in healthy subjects would reduce the need to examine a large cohort of subjects in this study and allow us to attain an initial proof of pharmacology for new anti-inflammatory chemical entities. One cannot rule out, however, that because asthmatics have been reported to have an increased pulmonary sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub> exposure (<xref rid="b7-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis et al. 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="b32-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Scannell et al. 1996</xref>), although we did not observe a statistically significant effect using a single administration of 0.5 mg FP on airway inflammation, this might have been observed in a cohort of asthmatics. As noted above, <xref rid="b35-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Vagaggini et al. (2001)</xref> reported a significant inhibition of O<sub>3</sub>-induced inflammation in asthmatics with treatment of 400 &#x003bc;g budesonide administered twice daily. Using endotoxin as an inflammatory stimulus, we previously observed that 440 &#x003bc;g FP for 2 weeks delivered via a metered dose inhaler twice daily inhibited the effect of endotoxin on neutrophilic airway inflammation in allergic asthmatics (<xref rid="b5-ehp0116-000799" ref-type="bibr">Alexis and Peden 2001</xref>). Thus, implementation of a longer treatment period in healthy individuals may have resulted in demonstration of anti-inflammatory efficacy of a single 500 &#x003bc;g dose of inhaled FP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We confirmed original observations that O<sub>3</sub>-induced airway neutrophilic inflammation was inhibited by a single administration of 2 mg FP and extended the findings by demonstrating decreased neutrophilic inflammation with the 0.5 mg FP treatment, as well. We also observed that both doses of FP inhibited the up-regulatory effect of O<sub>3</sub> on airway monocytic cell-surface phenotypes and that 2 mg FP inhibited serum levels of CCP16. Taken together, these observations suggest that brief treatments with inhaled corticosteroids by persons in anticipation of exposure to air pollution may offer protection against the inflammatory effects of ambient air O<sub>3</sub>, particularly for those individuals with preexisting airway disease. However, it is important to note that inhaled corticosteroids had no protective effect on the spirometric decrements induced by O<sub>3</sub>, suggesting this component of airway function, particularly in individuals with preexisting airway disease, remains susceptible to the modifying effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure. A second conclusion is that O<sub>3</sub> challenge with subsequent analysis of airway sputum and serum CCP16 is a good acute disease model for phase I screening of novel anti-inflammatory agents intended for use in asthma and COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Correction</title><p>In the original manuscript published online, Brad Harris was not included as an author.
