Current treatments for hypertension have side effects and poor adherence. Qigong has been studied as an alternative therapy for hypertension; however, the types of qigong used in those studies were diverse, and there have not been many well-designed randomized controlled trials. Our objective is to evaluate the effects of qigong on blood pressure, health status and hormone levels for pre- or mild hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Forty subjects with pre- or mild hypertension were randomized to either the qigong exercise group or the non-treated group. Participants in the qigong group conducted qigong exercises 5 times per week for 8 weeks, and participants in the non-treated group maintained their current lifestyle, including diet and exercise. The use of antihypertensive medication was not permitted. The primary endpoint was a change in patient blood pressure. Secondary endpoints were patient health status (as measured by the MYMOP2 questionnaires) and changes in hormone levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 40 participants that were randomized, 35 completed the study. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased after qigong treatment compare to baseline only in the qigong group (p&#x0003c;.001 in SBP, p&#x0003c;.0001 in DBP). In the non-treated group, there was no significant difference in blood pressure. Change of blood pressure between the qigong and the non-treated group was significant (p&#x0003c;.01 in SBP and DBP). The score of MYMOP2 showed a more significant decrease in the qigong group than the non-treated group (p=.035). Any differences in the hormones renin, angiotensin, cortisol, or norepinephrine were not significant between the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Qigong appears safe and has a positive effect on blood pressure and health status in pre and mild hypertension patients. Further long-term studies with a larger number of subjects are warranted.</p></sec></body></article>
