The objectives of the present study were to test the hypotheses that letrozole treatment, initiated prior to selection of the preovulatory dominant follicle, will induce the growth of more than one follicle to a pre-ovulatory size, and will delay ovulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Post-pubertal beef heifers were given two luteolytic doses of PGF (12 h apart) and monitored by ultrasonography for ovulation. Five to eight days later, ovarian follicular wave emergence was synchronized by ultrasound-guided transvaginal follicular ablation (Day 0=wave emergence) and a luteolytic dose of PGF was given 60 and 72 h later. On Day 1, heifers were divided randomly into two groups (n=15/group) and an intravaginal device containing 1 g of letrozole or a blank device (control) was inserted. The intravaginal devices were removed on Day 7, or at the time of ovulation, whichever occurred first. Transrectal ultrasonography and blood sample collection were performed daily from the day of ablation to 12 days after subsequent ovulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean (+/-SEM) interval from device placement to ovulation was longer in letrozole-treated animals compared to controls (6.1+/-0.25 vs 5.1+/-0.26 days, respectively; P&#x0003c;0.01). Single dominant follicles were present in both groups. The day-to-day diameter profiles of the dominant follicles of the ovulatory wave were larger (P&#x0003c;0.05) and the maximum diameters greater in letrozole-treated heifers (14.6+/-0.51 vs 12.4+/-0.53 mm, respectively; P&#x0003c;0.01). The diameter profile of the corpus luteum (CL) that formed after treatment did not differ between groups; however, plasma progesterone concentrations were higher (P&#x0003c;0.01) in heifers treated with letrozole. Estradiol concentrations were reduced following letrozole treatment (P&#x0003c;0.05), although a preovulatory rise of estradiol occurred in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Administration of letrozole with an intravaginal device during growth of the ovulatory follicle delayed ovulation by 24 h and resulted in the formation of a CL that secreted higher levels of progesterone. A sustained-release intravaginal device may be useful for the development of an aromatase inhibitor-based protocol to control ovulation for herd synchronization and to enhance fertility by increasing circulating progesterone concentrations during the first 7 days post-ovulation in cattle.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aromatase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Letrozole</kwd><kwd>Ovarian function</kwd><kwd>Follicle development</kwd><kwd>Bovine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Estrogen-based protocols, as a treatment for synchronizing ovulation in cattle, have modernized breeding practices and allowed producers to reliably control the timing of ovulation, thus enabling efficient use of time, labour and resources by allowing pre-scheduled insemination. Estradiol-based protocols also allow wider application of superovulation and embryo transfer by enabling effective synchronization of follicular wave emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, increasing consumer sensitivity to the possible deleterious effects of estrogens in food and in the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] has led to new regulations about the use of estrogenic products in livestock. The European Union has already banned the use of estrogenic products in food producing animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], estrogens cannot be used for synchronization of estrus except by prescription and custom-compounding. In 2007, New Zealand and Australia banned use of estrogens in lactating dairy animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These policies have created a void in methods to control reproductive function for breeding management in cattle.</p><p>Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors prevent the body from producing its own estrogen. Letrozole, a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, is used as an adjuvant treatment for hormone-responsive breast cancer in post-menopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and has been used as a fertility treatment for women undergoing assisted reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The putative effect of letrozole on ovarian function in women is through elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion by removal of the negative feedback of estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Tests of this hypothesis in a bovine model, however, were not supportive of an effect on FSH. In cattle, a single intravenous dose given on Day 3 post-ovulation, or a 3-day regimen given on Days 1&#x02013;3, 3&#x02013;5 or 5&#x02013;7 post-ovulation did not induce an elevation in circulating FSH concentration but did increase mean plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. The effect on LH secretion resulted in a prolonged period of dominance of the extant dominant follicle and delayed emergence of the next follicular wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further, a luteotrophic effect was inferred from the observation that heifers treated with letrozole for 3 days had larger corpora lutea following treatment. Similar results were observed when letrozole was prepared in an oil-based vehicle and administered intramuscularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>To date, studies on the effects of letrozole on ovarian function in cattle have been focused on non-ovulatory follicular waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The present study was designed to determine the effect of an extended period of treatment with letrozole on the pre-ovulatory follicle in cattle. We hypothesized that letrozole treatment initiated before selection of the dominant ovulatory follicle and extended over the follicle growing phase will induce the development of more than one follicle to a preovulatory size, and delay ovulation. Additionally, we hypothesized that the CL resulting from ovulations after letrozole treatment will be larger and secrete more progesterone than those from control heifers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cattle</title><p>Hereford-cross beef heifers (n=30), 15 to 20 months of age and weighing between 235 and 405 kg (average 336 kg), were chosen from a herd of 51 heifers maintained in outdoor pens at the University of Saskatchewan Goodale Research Farm (52&#x000b0; North and 106&#x000b0; West). Heifers were fed alfalfa/grass hay and concentrate to gain approximately 1.3 Kg per day and had water ad libitum during the experimental period from October to December. Heifers were initially examined by transrectal ultrasonography (MyLab5 VET, Canadian Veterinary Imaging, Georgetown, Ontario Canada) to detect the presence of a CL (i.e., confirm post-pubertal status; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by University of Saskatchewan Protocol Review Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments and examinations</title><p>Heifers in which a CL was detected were given two luteolytic doses of PGF (12 h apart) and monitored by ultrasonography for ovulation. Five to eight days later, the two largest ovarian follicles were ablated by transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration to synchronize follicular wave emergence which was expected to occur 1 to 1.5 days later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Prostaglandin (500 &#x003bc;g cloprostenol, Estrumate, Schering-Plough Animal Health, Pointe-Claire, QC, Canada) was given intramuscularly at 60 and 72 h after follicular ablation to induce regression of the CL and shift from a non-ovulatory to an ovulatory follicular wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. At the time of follicular wave emergence (Day 0; i.e., 1.5 days after follicle ablation), heifers were assigned randomly to two groups and given an intravaginal device containing 1 g of letrozole (letrozole group, n=15) or a placebo (letrozole-free) intravaginal device (control group, n=15). Devices were inserted on Day 1 and were kept in place until Day 7 or until ovulation was detected, which ever occurred first.</p><p>Intravaginal devices were prepared using a Cue-Mate spine (Bioniche Animal Health, Bellville, ON, Canada) assembled with two blank (progesterone-free) silicone pods that were coated with a gel-based vehicle containing letrozole or vehicle only (control).

Briefly, letrozole was extracted from 250 mL plasma with 250 mL of 0.1M ammonium acetate followed by the addition of 5 mL methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) and vortexed for 15 s. The organic layer was removed and transferred to a fresh 15 mL plastic tube and dried by gentle nitrogen gas flow. The dried extract was reconstituted in 1 mL of 100% ethanol. Separation was accomplished by HPLC (Agilent 1200; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with an analytical column (50 &#x000d7; 2.1 mm, 3 mm particle size; Betasil C18; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) operated at 35&#x000b0;C. Mass spectra were collected using a tandem mass spectrometer (SCIEX 3000; Applied Bioscience, Foster City, CA, USA) fitted with an electrospray ionisation source, operated in the negative ionisation mode. Quantification was performed using Analyst 1.4.1 software provided by SCIEX (Applied Bioscience). The minimum and maximum values along the standard curve were 0.25 and 500 ng/mL, respectively.

The concentration of letrozole in plasma as a function of time (C&#x02013;t) data for each heifer was analyzed by non-compartmental techniques using a computer modeling program (WinNonLin Standard Edition Version 2.1, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Peak letrozole concentration in plasma (C<sub>max</sub>) and time to peak letrozole concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) were determined using observed values.

Letrozole treatment during the pre-ovulatory follicular wave resulted in a greater diameter of the ovulatory follicle. This observation is consistent with the results of previous studies in which larger dominant follicles were observed when letrozole treatment was administered during non-ovulatory follicular waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The hypothesis that letrozole treatment initiated prior to the onset dominant follicle selection would result in multiple ovulatory follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] was not supported by the results of the present study; single ovulations were detected in both groups. However, ovulation was delayed by 24 h in the letrozole-treated group. The larger ovulatory follicle diameter observed in the letrozole-treated heifers may have been affected by the length of the growing phase of these follicles due to delayed ovulation. However, ovulatory dominant follicle diameters in the letrozole-treated group were already larger than the control group when compared 5 days after initiation of treatment (Day 6 post-wave emergence). The stimulus driving the accentuated follicular growth is unclear. However, daily sampling has limitations when attempting to interpret gonadotropin concentrations and its correlation to ovarian dynamics. Perhaps changes in gonadotropin pulse-frequency would have been detected using more frequent sampling.</p><p>Estradiol concentrations were reduced following treatment with letrozole-impregnated intravaginal devices, and the preovulatory rise in estradiol concentrations occurred 24 h later than in the control group. However, the follicles maintained ovulatory capability. We infer that the delay in estradiol rise observed in the letrozole-treated group is responsible for the delay in ovulation in this group.</p><p>In the present study, a letrozole-impregnated intravaginal device was used to provide extended estradiol suppression during the ovulatory wave. The intravaginal route of administration provides the advantage of reducing animal handling and distress caused by daily injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The duration of estradiol inhibition was influenced by the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the intravaginal device, and accounts for the occurrence and timing of the estradiol rise observed in the letrozole-treated group. The half-life of letrozole observed following administration via an intravaginal device (33 h) corresponded to that reported previously after single intravenous administration in beef heifers (unpublished data). Hence, the profile of letrozole concentration over time obtained in the present study was affected primarily by the absorption characteristics of the formulation used in the intravaginal devices. Based on the plasma letrozole concentration profile, the intravaginal devices released letrozole for only 24 h post-insertion, and elimination and plasma clearance took place thereafter. Therefore, letrozole concentrations may have dropped below a critical level relatively rapidly, allowing for the pre-ovulatory estradiol rise to occur after only a 24 h delay. Bioavailability has been defined as the amount of a drug given by any route, other than intravenously, that reaches general circulation and is available at the site of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The low bioavailability observed with the intravaginal devices (16%) may be explained in part by the melting point of the gel-vehicle used. This gel-based vehicle is commonly used for intravaginal suppositories for women, in which body temperature is lower than that of cattle (37&#x000b0; vs 39&#x000b0;C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Rapid liquefaction of the letrozole-containing gel resulted in loss of the preparation through the vulvar opening during micturition, defecation, or ultrasound examinations (the latter was observed by the author).</p><p>Letrozole treatment during the growing phase of the ovulatory follicle resulted in the ovulation of a larger follicle. Although larger follicles did not result in larger CL, elevated plasma progesterone profiles were observed over the first 12 days post-ovulation in the letrozole-treated group. Preovulatory letrozole treatment may have affected the number or proportion of large luteal cells (granulosa cell origin) and small luteal cell (thecal cell origin) contained within the CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], resulting in an increase in progesterone production per CL volume. Small and large luteal cells are present in the bovine CL in a ratio of 7.6:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Small luteal cells respond directly to LH stimulus to secrete progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], while large luteal cells appear to be responsible for sustained secretion of progesterone in the absence of a stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Treatment with letrozole may have resulted in an increase in luteal cell numbers or an alteration in the proportion of small and large luteal cells within the CL and an increase in progesterone-producing capability per CL volume. In this regard, treatment of cows with equine chorionic gonadotropin resulted in increased density and number of large luteal cells which increased the capacity of the CL to produce progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Although we were unable to document the effect of letrozole treatment on gonadotropin secretion in the present study, previous studies have shown an increase in gonadotropin secretion after single or 3-day letrozole regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>In summary, letrozole treatment during the ovulatory follicle wave resulted in more rapidly growing dominant follicles and a larger ovulatory follicles, delayed ovulation (by 24 h) of a single follicle and formation of a CL that secreted higher levels of progesterone. The effects of treatment on gonadotropin concentrations are inconclusive, possibly due to inadequate sampling frequency. However, results confirmed that letrozole treatment effectively reduces estradiol production in cattle. Finally, the formulation used for the development of an intravaginal device containing letrozole impacts on the effect of treatment on ovarian function. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that a letrozole-releasing device capable of a more sustained drug release may delay ovulation even further, while allowing more than one follicle to develop to a pre-ovulatory size when treatment is initiated prior to dominant follicle selection. The effect of estradiol suppression during the pre-ovulatory stage of follicular development on oocyte competence and fertility needs to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A sustained-release intravaginal device has potential in the development of an aromatase inhibitor-based protocol for control of ovulation for herd synchronization.
