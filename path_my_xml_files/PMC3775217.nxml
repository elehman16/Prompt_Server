The World Health Organization has estimated the number of diabetic patients to be 171 million people in 2000, and the projection for 2030 is 366 million people.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Diabetes is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD); this process is done through an accelerated procedure of atherosclerosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] CVD are the main causes of death in the world. High prevalence of CVD has been seen in developed countries,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and 38% of mortality occurs due to heart diseases in Iran.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] An increased production of free radicals due to hyperglycemia is seen in type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Indeed, the balance between antioxidants and free radicals has been disturbed due to high levels of pro-oxidants in the body; therefore, complications of diabetes can be accelerated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Likewise, inflammatory biomarkers values such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) are increased in diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The aim of many studies included pro-oxidants decreasing and antioxidants increasing, which could improve the oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation status in diabetic patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>It seems likely that adequate intake of food groups such as vegetables, grains, and fruits containing flavonoids and polyphenols compounds are related to the prevention and management of obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Recently, among flavonoids, quercetin has earned the attention of many researchers. Quercetin has been distributed in a wide range of foods[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] such as onions, apples, and tea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In one study, intake of high levels of quercetin was associated with reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed different effects of quercetin as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-clotting, and vasodilatory properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] But, human and animal studies did not have consistent results,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] which may result from different physiology of species and also different levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory status. Also, the effects of quercetin supplementation were more visible in individuals with high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] On the other hand, in healthy subjects who had lower levels of oxidative stress and cytokine, intake of quercetin had no significant effect on TNF-&#x003b1;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Regarding lipid profiles, in a cross-sectional study, consumption of quercetin compared with other flavonoids was inversely associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] But the results of human clinical trials and experimental animal studies in this field were conflicting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, there is no study to examine the effect of quercetin supplementation on the cardio metabolic status of people with type 2 diabetes. According to the conflicting effects of quercetin on inflammation and cardiovascular risk factors, and lack of studies on diabetic patients with high oxidative stress and related problems such as nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] we assumed that quercetin supplementation could improve the metabolic and inflammatory status in people with type 2 diabetes.

Exclusion criteria included changing the dose and type of medication during the study, pregnancy occurrence and less than 70% of compliance. At the beginning and end of intervention, clinical (height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, blood pressure) and biochemical assessments (TNF-&#x003b1;, high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP, serum lipids, IL-6) were performed.

A permutated block randomization method was used to randomly allocate subjects into the supplement and placebo groups. Quercetin (Solaray, USA) was given to participants as a dosage of 500 mg per day. Placebo capsules were similar in appearance to quercetin, and contained lactose, which was produced in the School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.

Physical activity of the subjects was evaluated by the short International Physical Activity Questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipaq.ki.se">www.ipaq.ki.se</ext-link>) and was expressed as metabolic equivalent-minutes per week (MET-min/week).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Anthropometry and biochemical assessments</title><p>Anthropometric measurements were performed at the beginning and at the end of the study. Height was measured in a standing position without shoes by a stadiometer with the nearest 0.5 cm. Weight was determined with minimal clothing and without shoes by a Seca scale with a precision of 100 g. Waist circumference was measured in the middle bottom ribs and pelvic bones after a normal exhale. The most prominent part was considered to be the hip circumference measurement. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was measured with a sphygmomanometer (Rester) in a sitting position and after 5-10 min rest.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>In order to evaluate the biochemical variables, 12-h fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Until blood clot formation, the samples were kept at room temperature for 1 h and were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min to separate serums. Serums were maintained into specific batch at temperatures &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until the time of testing.</p><p>Lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides [TG]) was measured using the quantitative detection kit and photometric method (Pars Azmoon Inc., Iran) with fresh samples.

We observed that 10 weeks&#x02019; of supplementation with quercetin resulted in reducing the systolic blood pressure significantly, while it had no significant effect on the other variables.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Blood pressure</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are only three human studies that examined the effect of quercetin supplementation on blood pressure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Conquer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] examined the effect of quercetin supplementation on blood pressure in healthy subjects; these researchers reported that 1000 mg/d quercetin for 28 days could not have a significant effect on systolic and DBP. In contrast to this study, Edwards <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] found that supplementation with 730 mg quercetin/d for 4 weeks in pre-hypertensives and stage 1 hypertensive individuals reduced systolic and DBPs only in stage 1 hypertensive subjects significantly; but without significant differences between two groups. In order to show the blood pressure-lowering effect of quercetin, it seems likely that we need a degree of hypertension. Egert <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] have recently shown that 150 mg/d quercetin for 6 weeks in people with metabolic syndrome compared with the placebo group significantly decreased the systolic and DBPs.</p><p>So far, there is not study to examine the effect of quercetin in people with type 2 diabetes. Our data showed that quercetin supplementation for 10 weeks significantly reduced the systolic and DBPs in the supplement group, but, in comparison between groups, significant difference was observed only in systolic blood pressure (<italic>P</italic> = 0/49). This reduction in systolic blood pressure (&#x02212;8/8) was related to 14% reduction in mortality of stroke and 9% decrease in deaths from cardiovascular disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] Our outcome is worthwhile because, in association with mortality from cardiovascular diseases, systolic blood pressure is a higher serious risk factor than DBP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] Because of high oxidative stress in people with type 2 diabetes, vessels are affected and endothelial dysfunction can led to hypertension and atherosclerosis. A way in which flavonoids can lower the risk of heart disease is improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] DBP reductions in the placebo group were possibly due to changes in the level of physical activity or psychological placebo effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Inflammation</title><p>The anti-inflammatory effects of quercetin are clearly seen in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This property was different in human and animal studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] which may result from the different physiology of species and also different levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory status. Quercetin prevented generation of inflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; in cell cultures. This effect is linked to modulation of the NF-kB pathway.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, quercetin intake significantly decreased the serum concentration of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. This finding was consistent with the results of Rivera <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] which showed that a higher dosage of quercetin (10 mg/kg) in obese rats who had higher levels of cytokines could reduce the visceral production of TNF-&#x003b1; and increase adiponectin. While in another study, receiving 150 mg quercetin for 6 weeks in obese and overweight subjects compared with placebo had no significant effect on the serum levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and hs-CRP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Decreased bioavailability of quercetin and small numbers of subjects were probable reasons of our results in inflammatory mediators. Also, animal studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effect of quercetin is a dose-dependent effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] According to the short half-life of quercetin, if the supplements were divided into several doses with a lesser amount, quercetin would have a better effect. But, these patients receive several medications and quercetin intake as several capsules with less value for them was not acceptable. Of course, biochemical changes of quercetin after absorption could not be ignored.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] Also, contrary to our expectation, TNF-&#x003b1; had been decreased in the placebo group, which may have occurred due to the psychological effect of placebo intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Lipids profile</title><p>In human studies with different dosages of quercetin, no significant changes in blood lipids (HDL-C, LDL-C, TG) were seen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Only in one study in 2009 did quercetin consumption result in a significant decrease in HDL-C levels compared with placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Also, in the present study, in both the placebo and the supplemented groups, HDL-C decreased significantly, but this decrease was higher in the placebo group and there was no significant difference between the two groups.</p><p>In animal studies, serum levels of TG and TC were decreased after quercetin consumption, but this effect was seen in animals with higher blood lipids levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Also, in this study, we saw a reduction in TG levels in the supplemented group, but these changes were not significant. However, the following issue should be kept in mind &#x02013; high levels of blood lipids in our study population were controlled by medication (during the intervention period, the amount of drugs was fixed), and probably due to the normal levels of blood lipids, we did not see a hypolipidemic effect of quercetin. Regarding the fact that dyslipidemia is a common disorder in diabetes, and that the participant had a 3-year history of diabetes, progression of dyslipidemia during intervention such as decreased HDL-C can be attributed to disease progressive and disturb the metabolic status of these patients. In addition, this small reduction in HDL-c levels was not associated with increased TG/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Perhaps, this change resulted from the physiological and clinical status of diabetic patients.</p><p>Among the strengths of this study, we can point to the population study (women with type 2 diabetes). According to gender, the collaboration of women is better than men, and they cooperated with the researcher better. Also, contrary to developed countries, the prevalence of diabetes among Iranian women is more than that among men.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] Limitations of the present study were the high cost of the research project, the impossibility of compliance assessment by using measurement of plasma quercetin concentrations before and after study and lack of appropriate tools for assessment and analysis of dietary intakes in Iran.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Quercetin supplementation could cause a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure but had no effect on other cardiovascular risk factors and inflammatory biomarkers. Considering the biological effects of quercetin <italic>in vitro</italic>, we need more studies with a stronger design and sample size with different doses of quercetin. Because dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet includes high amounts of fruits and vegetables, it is a good source of antioxidants such as quercetin and fiber. Also, a study reported that the DASH diet was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, for future studies regarding the possible beneficial effects of diets rich in quercetin, such as the DASH dietary pattern among diabetes, is recommended.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>]</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful the sincere cooperation of the participants and the personnel the Center for Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> The Isfahan University of Medical Sciences provided the financial support for this study</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aghamollaie</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Eftekhar</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Shojaeizadeh</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammad</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakhjavani</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghafrani</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of a health education programe on behavior, HbA<sub>1</sub>C and health-related quality of patient</article-title><source>Acta Med Iran</source><year>2004</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>89</fpage><lpage>94</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hajianfar</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Bahonar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Entezari</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Askari</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Yazdani</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lipid profiles and serum visfatin concentrations in patients with type II diabetes in comparison with healthy controls</article-title><source>Int J Prev Med</source><year>2012</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>326</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22708029</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coutinho</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerstein</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Yusuf</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The relationship between glucose and incident cardiovascular events.
