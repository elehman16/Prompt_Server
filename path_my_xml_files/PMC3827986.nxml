However, unaccustomed and sudden exercise results in dull pain in the skeletal muscle within hours or days after exercise, which is referred to as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. DOMS is one of the symptoms of eccentric-exercise (ECC)-induced muscle damage. Muscle damage is characterized as disruption of the membrane by mechanical stress, infiltration of inflammatory cells to the injured tissue, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Pain resulting from DOMS leads to a decrease in exercise performance and muscle strength gains for up to three weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine; BCAAs) are abundant and catabolized in the skeletal muscle, and they help to inhibit protein breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and enhance protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. BCAAs have been reported in many studies to attenuate DOMS and muscle damage induced by exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Shimomura <italic>et al.</italic> reported that BCAA supplementation prior to squat exercises decreased DOMS within a few days after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of BCAA supplementation on DOMS together with the inhibition of muscle damage was also observed for a training program involving trained long-distance runners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and in cycling exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, a study by Jackman <italic>et al.</italic> found no attenuating effects of BCAA supplementation on DOMS in the quadriceps muscle with the knee extended or on inflammation during the recovery period following high-intensity knee extension exercise, but DOMS was attenuated when measured with the knee flexed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the positive effects of BCAA supplementation on DOMS and muscle damage were weak in high-intensity exercise. Previous studies have evaluated the combined effects of various nutrients and BCAA supplements on DOMS and muscle damage. Stock <italic>et al.</italic> examined the combined effect of leucine supplementation and a carbohydrate beverage on DOMS and serum muscle damage markers during the recovery period following squat exercises; however, no significant effects were found before or after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the combination of protein (free-form amino acids including BCAA) and carbohydrate supplements given before and after ECC had no effect on muscle damage, loss of strength, or muscle soreness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, combining BCAAs with other anti-inflammatory nutrients might be beneficial for alleviating DOMS and muscle damage.</p><p>Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), which is abundant in skeletal muscle, has been reported to have many physiological and pharmacological actions, including membrane stabilization, anti-oxidation, osmoregulation, modulation of ion flux, and control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, in addition to playing roles as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In particular, it was reported that taurine has a cytoprotective effect against free radical-mediated skeletal muscle injury induced by downhill running in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The authors also confirmed that oral taurine administration in rats reduces exercise- and drug-induced oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, a multi-nutrient supplement containing BCAA and taurine as well as some vitamin B and plant extracts improved inflammation and joint pain in middle-age individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that taurine might enhance the beneficial effect of BCAA on DOMS and muscle damage induced by exercise.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial whether a combination of BCAA and taurine supplements can provide an effective nutritional strategy for attenuating DOMS and muscle damage induced by high-intensity exercise in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and amino acid treatment protocol</title><p>This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted with 36 male college volunteers who did not have any musculoskeletal disorders and had not partaken in any regular resistance training prior to the study (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Subjects were orally administered two sachets containing a combination of BCAA (or placebo-1) and taurine (or placebo-2) after every meal for two weeks prior to exercise (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We chose this timeframe because previous studies showed a significant increase in muscular taurine concentration following two weeks of taurine administration in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but not after one week in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since the present study was designed as a double-blind trial, the duration of BCAA supplementation prior to exercise was matched to the two-week duration of taurine supplementation. All subjects were instructed to fill out a supplemental checklist after every meal. The BCAA and taurine sachets contained 3.2 g (9.6 g/day) of a BCAA mixture (Ile: Leu: Val&#x02009;=&#x02009;1:2:1; Aminofeel&#x000ae;, Seikatsu Bunkasya Co. Inc., Chiba, Japan) and 2.0 g (6.0 g/day) of taurine, respectively. The daily doses of BCAA and taurine were based on the doses used in previous studies, which examined the effectiveness of BCAA supplementation on DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and plasma taurine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The daily doses per body weight of BCAA and taurine were 145.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.3 (109.5&#x02013;181.5) and 95.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5 (80.3&#x02013;116.5) mg/kg (mean &#x000b1; standard error, range), respectively. The placebo-1 and -2 supplements were compounded to the same volume and color as the BCAA and taurine supplements, respectively, by using similar proportions of starch for the double-blind method (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Supplementation was continued in a double-blind manner until dinner on the third day after exercise. Evaluation using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and by assessing muscle damage markers was completed on the morning of the fourth day after exercise. No significant differences in physical parameters measured a week before starting supplementation were noted between the groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All subjects were sedentary men who were non-athletes. They were instructed to continue their normal activities and to abstain from any strenuous exercise for at least one month before the experiment. Moreover, they were instructed to continue their usual food intake, not to change the amount or frequency of dietary meat or seafood intake, and not to use any dietary supplements, anti-inflammatory drugs, or anything else that could affect muscle soreness and damage until the end of the study. They were also instructed to abstain from stretching or massage therapy during the experimental period.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A schematic illustrating the experimental protocol and time course of the present study.</bold> Participants were supplied with two kinds of sachets consists of combination of BCAA (or placebo of BCAA) and taurine (or placebo of taurine) from 2 weeks before exercise to the end of the experiment.

On the day of exercise, all subjects assembled at our laboratory at 07:00 after fasting overnight. Following blood sampling, they ingested their assigned supplements 15 min prior to performing ECC. After the exercise at 10:00, subjects were supplied with jelly-type food (160 kcal/180 g; Nihon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Toyama, Japan) to minimize protein catabolism due to fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The exercise protocol, designed to induce soreness in the elbow flexors, was modified from a previously published method of voluntary ECC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. During the week prior to initiating amino acid supplementation, the maximal voluntary strength of isometric contraction (MVC) in the non-dominant arm of each subject was measured at 1.57 rad (90&#x000b0;) of elbow flexion.</p><p>For the ECC protocol, subjects were seated on a bench with their arm positioned in front of their body and resting on a padded support, such that their shoulder was secured at a flexion angle of 0.79 rad (45&#x000b0;) and their forearm was maintained in the supinated position throughout the exercise. Subjects were repeatedly weight-loaded upon dumbbell lowering to achieve a 90% MVC (34.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3 Nm). Subjects performed six sets of five repetitions of elbow extension from the flexed position at 90&#x000b0; to the fully extended position slowly over 5 s, while maintaining a constant speed of movement by following a verbal metronome provided by the investigator. After each extension, the investigator returned the dumbbell to the starting position (90&#x000b0;) to prevent excess muscle activation induced by the weight. Subjects were permitted to rest for 3 s between repetitions and for 2 min between sets. The intensity of ECC at 90% MVC was determined on the basis of our preliminary experiments and likely induced natural muscle damage as all subjects found it difficult to lower the dumbbell at a constant speed during the later sets due to decreased muscle function. The subjects also required verbal encouragement from the investigator to maintain constant speed.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood parameters of muscle damage</title><p>Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein at seven different time points: prior to amino acid supplementation, before exercise, immediately after exercise, at one to four days after exercise (Day1&#x02013;4) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). On the day of exercise, blood was collected before supplement intake, and exercise was started thereafter. Immediately after exercise, blood was collected again. In the four days following exercise, blood was collected at 07:00 before breakfast and amino acid intake. Serum was centrifuged for 30 min after the formation of a solid clot, and the plasma was immediately separated. The serum activities of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase were analyzed and used as parameters of muscle damage, as described in the Japan Society of Clinical Chemistry consensus methods. Serum levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, were measured before exercise and on Day 2 after exercise by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Highly Sensitive 8-OHdG Check ELISA kit; Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Fukuroi, Japan) after purification with a 10-kDa filter (Nanosep&#x000ae;; Pall Corporation, NY, US). Additionally, plasma taurine and BCAA concentrations were measured using an automatic amino acid analyzer (JLC-300V; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) after de-proteination with a two-fold volume of 3% sulphosalicylic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

However, the attenuating effects of BCAA on the DOMS and muscle damage were occasionally limited, especially in case of intensive exercise. Consequently, more effective nutritional strategies need to be discovered. In the present study, the effects of BCAA supplementation combined with taurine on a highly intense ECC-induced DOMS and muscle damage were investigated via a randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial, because taurine was reported to decrease oxidative stress induced by ECC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In ECC-induced DOMS and muscle damage, subjective and objective parameters including VAS scores, CIR, and serum levels of LDH and 8-OHdG were significantly improved by the combination of BCAA and taurine supplementation. This combined supplementation also tended to improve serum CK and aldolase activities, but not significantly. These parameters, especially serum CK activity, have a high degree of individual biological variability, and it is difficult to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the small number of subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Overall, the present study demonstrated that combined supplementation with BCAA and taurine is beneficial for reducing ECC-induced DOMS and muscle damage. However, it was impossible to determine whether the combined effects were due to the synergistic effect of both BCAA and taurine or the sum of the individual effects.</p><p>Compared with the effectiveness of BCAA supplementation on exercise-induced muscle soreness and damage reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], BCAA supplementation alone was not sufficient to effectively inhibit muscle soreness and damage in the present study. This discrepancy might be due to differences in the exercise protocol (intensity and type) and the supplemental regimen (duration and dose). In a previous study by Shimomura <italic>et al</italic>., the authors recognized that the intensity was low in a squatting exercise where subjects used only their body weight because the changes in the levels of serum muscle damage markers, including CK and myoglobin, were very small over the three days following exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, repeated arm extensions with weight loads of 90% MVC in the present study caused a significant increase in serum muscle damage markers in the placebo group, thereby implying higher exercise intensity. The present findings with this higher intensity suggest that a combination of BCAA and taurine taken during high-intensity exercise may prevent severe muscle soreness and damage that cannot be attenuated by BCAA alone.</p><p>In addition to exercise intensity, the amount of oral BCAA intake is one of the important factors for preventing exercise-induced muscle soreness and damage. Shimomura <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that the BCAA dose should be adjusted according to body mass to at least 92&#x02013;100 mg/kg because the inhibitive effects of BCAA on DOMS and muscle damage were greater in females than in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The BCAA dose in the present study should be sufficient because daily BCAA supplementation at 9.6 g/day worked out to 145.67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.3 mg/kg. Furthermore, the overall BCAA intake was probably sufficient because amino acid supplementation was from two weeks before to three days after exercise throughout the whole experimental period. Therefore, both the amount per body mass and the duration of BCAA supplementation in the present study might be sufficient for attenuating DOMS and muscle damage.</p><p>However, plasma BCAA concentrations were not altered by the BCAA supplementation in the present study. The two-week duration of BCAA supplementation prior to exercise was used to match the duration of taurine supplementation because this study was a double-blind trial. Indeed, a previous study conducted with college swimmers found no differences in plasma BCAA concentration after supplementation with 12 g/day BCAA for two weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hamada <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the plasma BCAA concentration in healthy humans significantly and rapidly increased and peaked at 30 min after a single BCAA dose; however, the plasma concentration returned to the basal level within 1&#x02013;2 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] because of transport to the skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Since blood sampling in the present study was done before each BCAA supplementation, the plasma BCAA concentration should have already returned to the basal level by the sampling time.</p><p>Taurine content in the skeletal muscle is also thought to be important for preventing muscle damage; however, neither the optimal duration nor the total dose of taurine has been clarified. We previously confirmed in rats that two weeks of oral taurine administration significantly increases taurine concentration in both the skeletal muscle and plasma in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the present study, oral taurine administration at 6.0 g/day for two weeks significantly increased the plasma taurine concentration. Therefore, we suggest that the taurine concentration in the skeletal muscle in the present study might have been increased in line with the plasma level. However, a previous study with humans reported that seven days of oral taurine supplementation (5.0 g/day) did not change the taurine concentration in the skeletal muscle or in the plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This discrepancy between the present results and those of previous studies with humans might be due to differences in the supplemental protocol. Therefore, an effective protocol for taurine supplementation, including dose and duration, to increase muscle taurine concentration as well as plasma level should be clarified in the future. Interestingly, Galloway <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that BCAA concentration in the skeletal muscle after exercise was significantly increased by oral taurine administration for seven days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although the mechanism to increase the muscular BCAA pool is unclear, it is one of the possible reasons why taurine might enhance the inhibitive effect of BCAA on muscle damage induced by ECC.</p><p>Oxidative stress-induced muscle damage has been shown to be associated with muscle soreness, and exercise-induced free radicals cause oxidative damage to cellular DNA. Rad&#x000e1;k <italic>et al.</italic> confirmed that the levels of 8-OHdG, a product of DNA oxidation, in the biopsied quadriceps femoris muscle of humans were significantly increased after 24 h of ECC when DOMS was present, suggesting that DNA damage occurred at the time of developing muscle soreness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present study, significantly increased serum 8-OHdG levels were observed in the PLCB, BA, and TAU groups on Day 2 when DOMS peaked. The increased levels of plasma 8-OHdG were significantly decreased by the combined supplementation and tended to be lower than those achieved by taurine supplementation alone. Since we also observed in our previous study that taurine treatment significantly inhibited hepatic 8-OHdG levels in response to drug-induced oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], taurine might play a protective role in anti-DNA oxidation associated with DOMS in the skeletal muscle. To our knowledge, there is no evidence that BCAAs can suppress exercise-induced DNA damage in the skeletal muscle. However, patients with liver cirrhosis showed that chronic oral BCAA therapy significantly decreased urinary 8-OHdG excretion, suggesting that BCAAs could reduce oxidative stress-induced DNA damage in the skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This might be a possible reason for the combined effect of BCAA and taurine on DOMS and muscle damage through protecting against DNA damage.</p><p>In addition to oxidative stress, intramuscular inflammation has also been considered a possible cause of DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To attenuate DOMS, it is important to inhibit the acute inflammatory response triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines released from inflammatory cells following exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Indeed, polymorphonuclear leukocytes are activated after ECC-induced DOMS and muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Within several hours after exercise, circulating neutrophils rapidly invade damaged muscle. Thereafter, neutrophils within the damaged muscle are replaced by macrophages over the next 24 h and these macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A previous study reported that BCAA decrease the levels of Th1-derived cytokines (interferon-&#x003b3; and interleukin-2) after high-intensity exercise, including triathlon and long-distance running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, taurine is an important factor in the neutrophil-related inflammatory response because it scavenges hypochlorous acid excreted from activated neutrophils and forms the less toxic taurine-chloramine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Consequently, the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide, and cytokines, from macrophages and lymphocytes are suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In particular, PGE2 has been considered a critical inflammatory mediator because it is produced by macrophages, sensitizes muscle afferent nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and is associated with the production of bradykinin, a substrate known to mediate muscle pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Although taurine-chloramine and PGE2 were not measured in the present study, we speculate that taurine <italic>per se</italic> may suppress PGE2 production in the arachidonate cascade via phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], as both of these enzymes are activated by increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic>i</italic> levels and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, taurine might synergistically enhance the beneficial effects of BCAA for reducing DOMS and muscle damage via an anti-inflammatory/immune response. However, this hypothesis requires verification.</p><p>In terms of the &#x0201c;no pain, no gain&#x0201d; theory, the requirement of exercise-induced muscle soreness and an inflammatory response for muscle hypertrophy remains controversial. In the present study, the combination of BCAA and taurine suppressed DOMS and the levels of serum marker of oxidative stress. The general consensus is that muscle hypertrophy is induced during the recovery from damages to the microstructure of the muscle fiber and extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Because exercise-induced symptoms including the production of inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6; IL-6, and fibroblast growth factor-2), oxidative stress and DOMS usually occur during recovery, these responses have been suggested to be necessary for exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, even if DOMS and muscle damage were effectively attenuated by the combination of BCAA and taurine supplementation, there is a possibility that muscle hypertrophy can be also be suppressed, and previous reports have shown that supplementations of taurine or multi-nutrient including BCAA and taurine could attenuate the productions of reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, Flann <italic>et al.</italic> evaluated whether exercise-induced symptoms including muscle soreness and damage are necessary events for muscle remodeling in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. They showed that the volume and strength of the quadriceps muscle and the muscular mRNA expression of the myogenic insulin-like growth factor-IEa that contributes to muscle regeneration were caused independently of muscle soreness and increase serum CK levels. Thus, DOMS and inflammation are not always necessary for muscle hypertrophy to occur. Furthermore, if exercise-induced DOMS and inflammation are efficiently attenuated, subjects can avoid unnecessary pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirmed that a combination of 3.2 g BCAA and 2.0 g taurine, three times a day, two weeks prior to and three days after exercise attenuates some subjective and objective markers of DOMS and muscle damage induced by high-intensity ECC, which could not have been influenced by BCAA or taurine supplementation alone.
