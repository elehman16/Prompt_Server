with altered somatosensory input on the balance ability of chronic stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-six subjects with chronic stroke were divided into an
experimental group (n=14) and a control group (n=12). Both groups attended physical
therapy sessions five times a week for four weeks. The experimental group performed
additional, task-oriented training with altered sensory input three times a week for four
weeks. Limit-of-stability tests were conducted before and after the intervention. In
addition, all subjects were evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Korean
Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale before and after the intervention. [Results]
There was a significant interaction between time and group on BBS scores, on the total
surface area of the limit of stability, and on the surface area of the limit of stability
of the affected side. However, an analysis of covariance in which the baseline values of
each variable served as the covariates showed that only the post-intervention BBS score of
the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group.
[Conclusion] Task-oriented training with altered somatosensory input can improve
functional balance in patients with chronic stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Altered sensory input</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Task-oriented training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The onset of a stroke leads to various symptoms, such as sensory, motor, cognitive, speech,
and emotional disabilities. Among these disabilities, sensory and motor disabilities
generally occur due to sensory impairment and muscle weakness on the paretic side. Sensory
impairment reduces sensory processing ability, thereby reducing motor and balance responses.
Muscle weakness causes muscular imbalance between the paretic and non-paretic sides,
resulting in weight bearing imbalance and an asymmetric posture during standing. As a
result, functional activities such as sit-to-stand, standing, walking, and balance control
are limited<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A task-oriented approach is one method used to overcome limited functional activities.
Previous studies have reported that the application of this approach was effective in
improving functional activities in stroke patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shumway-Cook and Woollacott reported that movements are generated
by the interaction of various systems in the brain, organized with a focus on goals, and
limited by the environment<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because the
task-oriented approach focuses on goals and the environment, it may be a suitable method for
overcoming limited functional activities.</p><p>The effective integration of visual, somatosensory, and vestibular information is necessary
to maintain balance ability during functional activities<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients rely highly on visual information due to a lack of
somatic and vestibular senses<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is necessary to restore sensory integration
in stroke patients through the manipulation of somatic and vestibular senses. This study
tested the hypothesis that task-oriented training with altered sensory input would improve
balance ability in patients with chronic stroke.</p><p>In this study, the manipulation of somatic senses was conducted during task-oriented
training. The level of improvement in balance ability after alternate exercises on firm and
soft surfaces was identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The inclusion criteria for the subjects were: passage of at least six months after first
showing hemiplegia due to a stroke; score of 24 points or above on the Korean Mini-Mental
State Examination; and ability to walk at least ten meters independently. Among the stroke
patients undergoing rehabilitation in the hospital, 28 patients who agreed to participate
were initially selected. They were assigned to either an experimental group (n=14) or a
control group (n=14). Two subjects in the control group withdrew from the study due to lower
extremity pain. Therefore, the final cohort consisted of 14 patients in the experimental
group and 12 patients in the control group. This study was conducted after obtaining
approval from the Institutional Review Board of Jeonju University (jjIRB-2015-0705).</p><p>The general characteristics of the subjects were as follows. The experimental group
consisted of nine men and five women (age: 55.9 &#x000b1; 8.5&#x02005;years; body mass index: 24.8 &#x000b1; 2.6)
and the control group consisted of ten men and two women (age: 56.9 &#x000b1; 8.7&#x02005;years, body mass
index: 24.7 &#x000b1; 2.2). In terms of type of stroke, nine patients in the experimental group had
an infarction and five patients had a hemorrhage; seven patients in the control group had an
infarction and five patients had a hemorrhage. In terms of paretic side, eight patients in
the experimental group had hemiplegia on the right side and six patients had hemiplegia on
the left side; six patients in the control group had hemiplegia on the right side and six
patients had hemiplegia on the left side. The duration of onset was 15.8 months in the
experimental group and 15.6 months in the control group. There were no statistically
significant differences between the two groups in any of these characteristics
(p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>The experimental and control groups both received general physical therapy performed at the
hospital. The experimental group, in addition, received task-oriented training with altered
sensory input three times a week, for an hour each time, for four weeks. The intervention
was performed face to face by physical therapists at the hospital.</p><p>The details of the training are as follows<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>:</p><p>1) Sitting position: 1. Sit in a chair without a
backrest while keeping the feet on a firm surface. 2. Sit in a chair without backrest while
keeping the feet on a soft surface. 3. Sit on a ball while keeping the feet on the firm
surface. 4. Sit on a ball while keeping the feet on the soft surface.</p><p>2) Sit to stand: 1. Sit in a chair without a
backrest with the feet on a firm surface and perform the sit-to-stand motion repeatedly. 2.
Sit in a chair without a backrest with the feet on a soft surface and perform the
sit-to-stand motion repeatedly. 3. Sit on a ball with the feet on the firm surface and
perform the sit-to-stand motion repeatedly. 4. Sit on a ball with the feet on the soft
surface and perform the sit-to-stand motion repeatedly.</p><p>3) Standing position: 1. Perform bipedal standing
on a firm surface. 2. Perform bipedal standing on a soft surface. 3. Perform a semi-tandem
stance on the firm surface. 4. Perform a semi-tandem stance on the soft surface.</p><p>4) Walking: 1. Walk forward on a firm surface. 2. Walk forward on a soft surface. 3. Walk
forward on the firm surface, cross an obstacle, and then continue to walk. 4. Walk forward
on the soft surface, cross an obstacle, and then continue to walk.</p><p>This training was performed alternately on firm and soft surfaces to change the
somatosensory input. A 296 &#x000d7; 46 &#x000d7; 6&#x02005;cm kyBounder mat (kybun, Roggwil, Switzerland) made of
polyurethane was used as the soft surface. This training consisted of four conditions:
sitting position, sit to stand, standing position, and walking. The training in each
condition was performed for ten minutes with a 30-second break between the conditions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Warm-up and cool-down exercises, each of
which consisted of stretching for five minutes, were performed before and after the
intervention.</p><p>All of the subjects were evaluated before and after the four weeks of intervention. The
Berg Balance Scale (BBS), BioRescue (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez, France), and Korean
Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (K-ABC) Scale were used for the evaluation. The BBS
is a measurement tool to evaluate functional balance. It consists of 14 questions with a
maximum total score of 56 points; each question is scored on a 0 to 4 ordinal scale.
BioRescue was used to identify limit of stability. The subjects were instructed to move
their center of pressure in eight directions as much as possible while standing without
moving their legs, and the surface area and velocity of these motions were measured. The
mean value of three measurements was used for data analysis. The K-ABC was used to determine
the subjects&#x02019; level of self-confidence in their balance while they performed activities of
daily living. This tool consists of 16 questions, with the score for each question ranging
from 0 points (no confidence) to 100 points (complete confidence), for a maximum total score
of 1,600 points.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 23 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to verify whether the data were normally
distributed. The effects of time (baseline and post-intervention) and group (experimental
and control) on the BBS score, surface area of the limit of stability, and K-ABC score were
assessed using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Mann-Whitney U
test was performed to compare changes in BBS scores between the two groups. In addition, an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), in which the baseline values of each variable serve as the
covariates, was performed to control the baseline values between the experimental and
control groups. Statistical significance &#x003b1; was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The effects of the intervention are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

vestibular, and somatosensory systems. When sensory information is integrated, the relative
dependence of these senses is re-weighted according to changes in the sensory environment.
According to the sensory reweighting hypothesis, each sensory channel is multiplied by some
weight, and then the weighted variables are summed to produce a response modulated to the
relevancy of the incoming afferents<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
other words, the absence of a sensory cue leads to dependence on another reliable sensory
cue.</p><p>Changes in sensory input can occur in daily life depending on the situation. For example,
individuals&#x02019; visual input can decrease by not being able to see properly; their
somatosensory input can decrease by suddenly standing on a soft surface; or vestibular
sensory changes can occur with a limitation of head movement. When faced with these
situations suddenly, sensory input into the brain decreases and the degree of reliance on
other senses increases when the senses are integrated. As a result, the time required for
sensory integration is delayed, which eventually leads to reduced balance ability.
Therefore, while it is necessary to stimulate and train the reduced senses, the integrative
functions of the brain should improve with training consisting of repetition of these
situations.</p><p>When healthy individuals stand on a firm surface base under good light conditions, they
rely 70% on somatosensory information, 10% on visual information, and 20% on vestibular
information<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it has been
reported that stroke patients rely particularly on visual information to maintain
balance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, stroke patients
should be trained with altered sensory (visual, vestibular, and somatosensory) inputs during
balance exercises.</p><p>In previous studies, it has been reported that task-oriented exercises performed with
altered sensory input had greater effects on standing balance than task-oriented exercises
alone<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study also showed
that the post-intervention BBS score of the experimental group was significantly higher than
that of the control group.</p><p>Morioka and Yagi reported that after undergoing perception learning exercises to
discriminate the hardness of sponge rubber placed under the sole of the foot, the standing
balance of their subjects improved<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the present study, the results of alternate training on firm and soft surfaces in the
experimental group also led to improvements in the BBS score. This result may be due to the
changes in somatosensory input acting as perception learning. In addition, the similarities
between the task-oriented exercises used in this study and the BBS items might have
contributed to the improved BBS scores in the experimental group.</p><p>No statistically significant differences in the surface area of the limit of stability and
the K-ABC scores were found between the experimental and control groups. It is considered
that this result occurred because the present study&#x02019;s intervention period (four weeks) was
relatively shorter than the previous studies&#x02019; intervention periods (minimum of eight
weeks)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bohannon</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Measurement and treatment of paresis in the geriatric
