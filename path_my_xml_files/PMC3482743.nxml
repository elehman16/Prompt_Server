Hence, in the light of advancements in endodontics the debatable topic of number of sittings need to be taken to perform a root canal treatment should be reconsidered.</p><p>Single-versus multiple-visit root canal treatment has been the subject of long-standing debate in the endodontic community. In fact, the attempt to complete root canal treatment in one visit has been documented since the end of the nineteenth century.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>A one visit root canal treatment is attractive to a patient because it saves time and would probably reduce the cost of the procedure. In addition one visit treatment would be expected to be less stressful to the anxious patient. The patient is not disturbed by the additional anesthetic injections, the replacement of the rubber dam, the initial placement and later removal of intracanal medication and seals, and the time spent by the clinician in refreshing his memory and tactile sensation regarding prepared canal anatomy, tooth length etc. Furthermore, the problems of intervisit leakage, loss of temporary seal, or any of the accidents that can and do occur between the visits are solved. Perhaps the most important advantage is the prevention of root canal contamination and/or bacterial regrowth that can occur when the treatment is prolonged over an extended period.</p><p>The disadvantages of single visit procedures are also obvious. It eliminates some of the controls available in the multiple visit procedures, such as culturing to check the effectiveness of the biomechanical preparation and ability to apply &#x0201c;tincture of time&#x0201d;, to reevaluate tissue responses following treatment procedures and in the event of a flareup, the emergency procedures for drainage are complicated, since artificial fistulation or the removal of fillings is needed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>This randomized controlled trial aims to re-establish the relationship between the incidence and/or severity of post- operative pain and the number of treatment appointments using &#x02018;crown down&#x02019; technique with rotary NiTi instruments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects and patients</title><p>The study and informed consent forms were approved by committee on human research. Patients were recruited from the regular pool of patients visiting the endodontic department for root canal treatment.</p><p>Patients who were pregnant, taking antibiotics or corticosteroids at the time of treatment, with immunocompromised, complicating systemic disease or below 18 years of age were excluded. Oral and written informed consents were obtained from all participants. Only one tooth with a single root of each patient was included, and the pulpal vitality determination was based on both the results of electric pulp tester (Analytic Technology Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). The vitality of pulps was ultimately confirmed by direct clinical observation of hemorrhage in the canal, without considering the clinical diagnosis as being a normal pulp, reversible pulpitis, or irreversible pulpitis. All teeth had completely formed foramina and no calcified canals, which were preliminarily evaluated by preoperative periapical radiographs. Any tooth with periodontal disease or periapical radiolucency of more than 0.5 cm was excluded.</p><p>A total of 200 patients aged 20&#x02013;60 years, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to either one- or two- visit treatment by biased coin randomization, a dynamic randomization method, which was specially designed to get the same number in both groups, and the sequence, tossing coin and allocation were operated by a graduate student who was blind to the nature of the study. One hundred patients received one-visit treatment (Group1), and 100 patients received two-visit treatment (Group 2).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Pain measurement</title><p>The clinicians were trained to use a modified Heft Parker visual analog scale.</p><p>Patients were instructed to place a mark on the horizontal scale to represent the intensity of pain experience; furthermore, they were asked to use the verbal descriptors as a guide. Patients recorded their pre-operative pain level by using a VAS in the presence of a clinician to ensure that they understood the instructions. After treatment, the patients were given the VAS forms and contacted by telephone at each post-obturation interval to remind them to complete and return the forms. After receiving the VAS forms, the data was recorded for the remaining four intervals, which corresponded to post-obturation periods of 6, 12, 24, and 48 hrs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Procedure of root canal treatment</title><p>The standard procedure for both groups at the first visit included local anesthesia, rubber dam isolation, pulp extirpation and standard access preparation. Following canal patency confirmation when an electronic apical location &#x02018;0&#x02019; reading was achieved by a size 10 K-file, canals were prepared with a combination of hand files and ProTaper engine-driven rotary nickel-titanium files (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's instruction. RC Prep (Premier Dental Products Co., Philadelphia, PA, USA) was used as a lubricant. Irrigation was performed with 2.5% NaOCl after each instrument in all cases. Apical enlargement was accomplished by the finishing instruments, which ranged from F1 to F5 depending on the initial diameter of the root canals. At the first visit, all teeth were prepared to working length and dried with paper points. Canals in Group 1 were filled with ProTaper universal gutta-percha (Dentsply Maillefer) and AH plus sealer (Dentsply DeTrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany), using a lateral compaction technique, and restored with temporary restorative material, Cavit-G.</p><p>Following instrumentation, teeth in Group 2 a sterile dry cotton pellet was placed in the pulp chamber and the access was temporarily sealed using Cavit-G. Patients in Group 2 returned for the second visit 1 week later when the root canals were filled and teeth temporarily restored using the same technique and materials as in Group 1.</p><p>Although, no systemic medication was prescribed, the patients were instructed to take 600 mg ibuprofen only if they experienced intolerable pain. They were asked to record the maximum pain level before they took the analgesics. Any patient with intolerable pain was requested to visit the clinician for emergency treatment. Forty-eight hrs after obturation, all the patients returned to the clinic with the VAS forms and reported the occurrence of post-obturation pain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data thus obtained was submitted for statistical analysis. The VAS data was analyzed-using independent- sample <italic>T</italic>-test to compare the incidence of pre and post- operative pain at all the time intervals amongst the two groups. Differences were considered significant when probabilities were &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twelve patients (six patients from Group 1 and six from Group 2) were excluded from the study because they did not attend the recall visit and could not be contacted. None of the patients experienced flare-ups. Data were obtained from the remaining 188 patients [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Ninety four patients had root canal treatment performed in one visit (Group 1) and 94 had treatment completed over two visits (Group 2).

In one case, residual bacteria are eliminated or prevented from repopulating the root canal system by introducing an interappointment dressing during the root canal treatment.</p><p>The second approach is aimed at eliminating the remaining bacteria or rendering them harmless by entombing them in a complete and three-dimensional obturation, finishing the treatment in one visit, to deprive the microorganisms of nutrition and the space required to survive and multiply.</p><p>In 1978, Ether and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and in the same year Soltanoff <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] examined incidence of pain while comparing the single and multiple visit endodontic procedures and concluded a significantly higher number of patients with no pain in the group that had the multiple-visit procedure than in the single-visit group.</p><p>On the contrary James B. Roane <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] concluded a 2 to 1 higher frequency of pain reported following treatment completed in multiple visits as compared to that reported for those completed in one visit. Eleazer and Eleazer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] compared flare up rate in endodontic treatment of pulpally necrotic molars and concluded that single visit endodontics is more advantageous over multi visit treatment.</p><p>Mulhern <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and Di renzo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] in their studies and in a recent study conducted by C.Wang <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] on 100 vital teeth, no statistically significant differences were found between the pain levels of teeth treated in single and multi visit group.</p><p>From the above discussed literature it is clear that although results of some studies are in the favor of single visit root canal treatment in terms of pain incidence and others favor multi visit procedures but the majority of literature published on the comparison between single and multi visit root canal treatment deny any significant difference in the level of post obturation pain between the two.</p><p>In this <italic>in vivo</italic> study, no statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of pain between single and multi visit procedures.</p><p>A comparison between post-obturation pain levels of vital and non vital teeth treated in single and multiple visits was also done. On the statistical analysis again no significant difference was found in the pain levels. It is generally thought that non vital cases require a medication in the canal between appointments to kill most bacteria but the expectations of benefits from intracanal medicaments may be exaggerated. For the medications to be effective, they must make direct contact with bacteria, which is quite an unlikely occurrence for those bacteria sheltered in dentinal tubules. Also, increase in the number of bacteria entering the root canal through a temporary barrier between the visits is a possibility. As such there is no assurance that the medication will certainly eradicate all the bacteria.</p><p>There has been considerable debate in the literature as to the degree of effectiveness of intracanal medicaments after thorough instrumentation. L.R.G. Fava[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] conducted a study on 60 symptomatic upper central incisors, in which half of the teeth were obturated immediately and the other half were dressed with a calcium hydroxide paste and obturated at a later appointment. The author concluded no difference in pain incidence between the two groups. In this <italic>in vivo</italic> study no intra canal medicament was used in the two visit group.</p><p>Cavit-G has been found to provide a good bacterial tight seal when used as a temporary restorative material in between the visits to close the access preparations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In this <italic>in vivo</italic> study Cavit-G was a temporary restorative material to provide an effective bacterial seal in the multi visit group.</p><p>It is well known that pain perception is a highly subjective and variable experience modulated by multiple physical and psychological factors. Pain reporting is influenced by many factors other than the experimental procedure. In this study a modified Heft-Parker VAS was used. This is a bounded scale with absolute values at each end and word descriptors of pain levels placed in ascending order along the horizontal axis. The patient is instructed to place a mark on the scale corresponding to the current level of pain and has a visual reminder of previous reports for comparative purposes. Heft and Parker state that the unequal spacing of words on the scale represents an accurate reflection of how patients perceive spacings between the different pain word descriptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the results of this study and scientific literature, it is clearly evident that multi visit endodontics does not reduce the incidence of pain. The clinicians have also found that there is no evidence that in a single visit root canal treatment, quality of root canal treatment gets compromised. On the contrary, the evidence points in the direction of less pain with the single visit root canal treatment. Although single visit root canal treatment is encouraged, it is certainly does not mean that all of the endodontic cases be easily treated with single visit root canal therapy. One should carefully evaluate the case before making the decision to go for single visit or multi visit root canal treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source
