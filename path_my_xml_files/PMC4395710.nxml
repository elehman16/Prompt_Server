of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with virtual reality training on the
balance of children with cerebral palsy. [Subjetcs and Methods] Children with cerebral
palsy between four and 12&#x02005;years of age were randomly allocated to two groups: an
experimental group which performed a single session of mobility training with virtual
reality combined with active transcranial direct current stimulation; and a control group
which performed a single session of mobility training with virtual reality combined with
placebo transcranial direct current stimulation. The children were evaluated before and
after the training protocols. Static balance (sway area, displacement, velocity and
frequency of oscillations of the center of pressure on the anteroposterior and
mediolateral axes) was evaluated using a force plate under four conditions (30-second
measurements for each condition): feet on the force plate with the eyes open, and with the
eyes closed; feet on a foam mat with the eyes open, and with the eyes closed. [Results] An
increase in sway velocity was the only significant difference found. [Conclusion] A single
session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation combined with mobility training
elicited to lead to an increase in the body sway velocity of children with cerebral
palsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Static balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The term cerebral palsy (CP) refers to permanent, mutable motor development disorders
stemming from a primary brain lesion that causes secondary musculoskeletal disorders which
limitations regarding activities of daily living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence of CP ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 among every 1,000 live
births, with little or no difference among western countries<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor impairment is the main manifestation of this condition and
causes difficulties for CP subjects with in the biomechanics of the body<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, functional mobility (how an individual moves in the surrounding environment in
interactions with society)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> is an
important physiotherapeutic goal for children with CP, as walking with or without assistance
favors physical development and allows such children with CP to participate in
activities<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Approximately 90% of children with CP have compromised gait performance due to excessive
muscle weakness, altered joint kinematics and reduced postural reactions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, such children have a reduced
capacity to participate in games and sports with sufficient intensity to develop adequate
cardiorespiratory fitness<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Indeed, exercise programs that include aerobic and muscle
strengthening components have often been contraindicated for individuals with CP, as greater
exertion was believed to result in an increase in muscle tone and reductions in the both the
gamut of movements and overall function<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. While there is current evidence of the
physiological benefits of aerobic exercise for children with CP, the influence of these
benefits on functional capacity remains unkown<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Continual, intensive physical therapy is considered the gold standard in the treatment of
individuals with CP, but achieves varying results. Different approaches have been employed
to favor selective motor control, coordinated muscle action during gait<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and physical
fitness<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent such approaches that are currently being studied are gait
training on a treadmill as and as mobility and balance training using a virtual reality
system.</p><p>Postural control involves coordinating balance (stability and orientation of the body)
among different body segments<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
requiries interactions between motor control and the visual, vestibular and somatosensory
systems<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The maintenance of postural
control without alteration of the support base is determined by the ability to maintain the
center of body mass within the limits of stabilty<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many patients with neurological disorders have considerable
difficulty maintaining the visual, vestibular and somatosensory systems in harmony for
adequate postural stability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A body is
in equilibrium when at rest (static balance) or during stable movements (dynamic balance).
In a stable system, movements do not significantly deviate from the desired trajectory even
when submitted to perturbations<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor
impairment in children with CP exerts a negative impact on their performance of activities
of daily living, which is more evident in the standing position due to their greater demand
for postural control<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The development of novel therapeutic modalities for use in combination with conventional
physical rehabilitation is important for the optimization of functional capacity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this context, noninvasive brain
stimulation become a topic of the interest among researchers. Indeed, significant
improvements have been reported following short periods of cerebral stimulation in
individuals with brain lesions<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) is a promising low-cost technique, that is easy to administer and well tolerated,
which has minimal adverse effects<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. When
used in combination with physical therapy, tCDS may potentiate neuroplasticity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is therefore important to determine
the effects of novel techniques, such as tDCS and virtual reality, on the static and dynamic
balance of patients with neurological disorders.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a single session of tDCS
over the primary motor cortex combined with virtual reality training on the balance of
children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A cross-sectional, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was carried
out. This study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of University
Nove de Julho (Brazil) under process number 69803/2012 and was conducted in accordance with
the ethical principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki. The study is registered
with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials under process number RBR-9B5DH7. All parents
or guardians agreed to the participation of their children by signing a statement of
informed consent.</p><p>The study took place at the Movement Analysis Lab, University Nove de Julho, Sao Paulo,
Brazil, from March 2013 to July 2014. Twenty children with CP were recruited from
specialized outpatient clinics and the physical therapy clinics of the university. The
following were the inclusion criteria: levels I, II or III of the Gross Motor Function
Classification System (GMFCS); independent gait for at least 12 months; age between four and
twelve years; and degree of comprehension compatible with the execution of the procedures.
The following were the exclusion criteria: history of surgery or neurolytic block in the
previous 12 months; orthopedic deformities; epilepsy; metal implants in the skull or hearing
aids. All children who met the eligibility criteria (n = 12) were submitted to an initial
evaluation and randomly allocated to an experimental group (virtual reality training
combined with active tDCS) and control group (virtual reality training combined with placebo
tDCS). Block randomization was used and stratified based on GMFCS level (levels I&#x02013;II or
level III). Numbered opaque envelopes were employed to ensure the concealment of the
allocation. Each envelop contained a card stipulating to which group the child was
allocated.</p><p>Stabilometric analysis was performed for the evaluation of static balance. For this, a
force plate (Kistler model 9286BA) was used. This force plate, which allows the recording of
oscillations in the center of pressure (COP). The acquisition frequency was 100&#x02005;Hz, captured
by four piezoelectric sensors positioned at the extremities of the force plate, at a
sampling frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz; the force plate&#x02019;s size is 400 &#x000d7; 600&#x02005;mm. The data were recorded
using the SWAY software program (BTS Engineering) and integrated and synchronized by the
SMART-D 140<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system. The children were instructed to remain in a stand barefoot
position on the force plate, with their arms alongside the body, with an unrestricted foot
base, heels aligned, and to look at fixed on a point marked at a distance of one meter at
the height of the glabellum (adjusted for each child). Children classified on level III of
the GMFCS used their normal gait-assistance device, which was positioned off the force
plate. A foam mat<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> measuring 40 &#x000d7; 60 &#x000d7;
5&#x02005;cm was used as a proprioceptive stimulus.</p><p>Measurements were taken under four conditions: feet on the force plate with the eyes open;
feet on the force plate with the eyes closed; feet on the foam mat with the eyes open; and
feet on the foam mat with the eyes closed. Three 45-second measurements were taken under
each condition, and the mean was used in the analysis. The order of the different conditions
was randomized to avoid the possible effects of motor learning. Between measurements, the
participants were given a one-minute rest period in the sitting position. Stabilometric
evaluations were conducted in a single session prior to and immediately following the
training protocol.</p><p>The children first received an explanation of the procedures, then remained at rest for 20
minutes. Two raters were in charge of the procedures to ensure blinding and the reliability
of the results. Rater 1 was in charge of placing the electrodes and the administration of
tDCS (active or placebo). Rater 2 supervised the virtual reality mobility training. Both the
children and Rater 2 were blinded to the allocation to the different groups.</p><p>The intervention consisted of a single session of tDCS using two sponge (non-metallic)
electrodes (5 &#x000d7; 5 cm) moistened with saline solution. The anodel electrode was positioned
over the primary motor cortex, following the 10&#x02013;20 International Electroencephalogram
System, and the cathode was positioned over the supra-orbital region on the contralateral
side<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the experimental group, a
1-mA current was applied to the primary motor cortex region for 20 minutes while the
children performed the virtual reality mobilty training. The device has a knob that allows
the operator to control the intensity of the current. In the first ten seconds, the
stimulation was gradually increased until it reached 1 mA, and it was gradually diminished
in the last ten seconds of the session. In the control group, the electrodes were positioned
at the same sites and the device was switched on for 30 seconds, giving the children the
initial sensation of the 1 mA current, but no stimulation was administered during the rest
of the virtual reality training. This is considered a valid control procedure in studies
involving tDCS.</p><p>Mobility training with virtual reality was performed for 20 minutes with simultaneous tDCS
(active or placebo). The children used their habitual braces and gait-assistance devices,
when necessary. The braces were placed by the physiotherapist and an assessment of the
gait-assistance device was performed and adjustments were made when necessary to achieve the
proper size.</p><p>Mobility training with virtual reality was conducted using an XBOX 360<sup>TM</sup> with a
Kinect<sup>TM</sup> (motion sensor) was used for mobility training. The Your Shape:
Fitness Evolved 2012<sup>TM</sup> game was selected for aerobic exercises (walking and
walking with obstacles). The children were instructed to stand at a distance of 2 to 3
meters in front of the motion sensor for the estimation of height and the calculation of the
body mass index. Training was performed in a specific room of the Human Movement Analysis
Laboratory of the University, measuring 250 &#x000d7; 400&#x02005;cm. A screen measuring 200 &#x000d7; 150&#x02005;cm was
projected on the wall and stereo speakers were used to provide adequate visual and auditory
stimuli.</p><p>The displacement of the center of pressure (COP) of the feet on the force plate in the
anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions was used to analyze body sway. Prior
to the analysis, the signals were filtered using a low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff
frequency of 10&#x02005;Hz. Body sway was determined based on the oscillation area of the COP,
displacement, mean sway velocity and oscillation frequency in the AP and ML directions. For
the oscillation area (cm<sup>2</sup>), was estimated using principal component analysis, was
used to calculate the area of the ellipse from the COP-AP and COP-ML data considered for 95%
of the data<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mean displacement (cm) was
calculated as the sum of the distances of all the consecutive points of the COP trajectory
divided by the number of points<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sway
velocity (cm/s) was calculated as on the total distance divided by the signal capture
time<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The displacement frequency (Hz)
was determined as the frequency of 80% of the spectral power of the COP<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the distribution of the data. For this
purpose, Repeated measures MANOVAs with the Bonferroni post hoc tests was used to determine
differences between the experimental and control groups considering the following factors:
group (experimental and control), treatment (pre-and post-treatment) vision (eyes open and
eyes closed), foot support (ground and foam mat) and direction of COP oscillation (AP and
ML). Levene&#x02019;s test was used to determine the evenness of variance between the groups. The
level of significance was chosen as 5% (p &#x0003c; 0.05). All statistical tests were performed
with using of the SPSS 20.0 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The analysis of the immediate effect of tDCS on oscillation area, displacement, oscillation

reality mobility training on the static balance of children with CP. The literature offers
studies on the effects of tDCS combined with other physiotherapy modalities for adults with
neurological disorders stemming specifically from a stroke and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as some studies involving
patients with CP. The findings of these studies indicate the considerable potential of this
form of stimulation in the treatment of neurological disorders and the investigation of
changes in cortex excitability<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Short-term tDCS is reported to have short-term effects, whereas long-term administration is
reported to have lasting effects on neuroplasticity<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. tDCS is a way of to modulating cortex activity to enhance and
prolong the functional gains achieved in physical therapy. Stimulation causes a change in
dysfunctional cortex excitability allowing that physical therapy to mold the functional
pattern of cortex activity through the activation of neural networks specific to the
activity in question<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to Minhas et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, a current
of 1 mA is adequate for children and was therefore used in the present study. The
positioning of the electrodes was based on the description given by Fregni et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, with the anode placed over the primary
motor cortex and the cathode placed over the supraorbital region. This configuration was
also used in previous studies involving the same CP population conducted by Grecco et
al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup> and Duarte et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present investigation, a statistically significant
difference between groups was only found with regard to body sway velocity. Comparing
children with typical development to those with CP, Gatica et al.<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> found a greater body sway velocity only with the eyes open
in the patients with CP, and a greater oscillation area only with the eyes closed. In the
present study, sway velocity was significantly greater in the ML direction in both groups
only with the eyes open when the foam mat was used as the support base. The control group
exhibited greater ML oscillation on the ground only with the eyes open, and the experimental
group exhibited greater AP and ML oscillations under both visual conditions (eyes open and
eyes closed) when the ground was the support base.</p><p>Cherng et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study
involving children with typical development and those with CP using a foam mat for the
proprioceptive stimulus of the feet. The children were evaluated three times under each
condition (eyes open, eyes closed and the use of a headset to alter the sensory
environment). No statistically significant differences between the groups were found in
static balance on the floor with the eyes open and with the closed. However, when the
sensory environment was altered, the children with CP exhibited a reduction in static
balance, with an increase in the oscillation area in comparison to the control group.</p><p>In a study involving children with CP and those with typical development, Donker et
al.<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup> evaluated static balance with the
eyes open, the eyes closed and real-time visual feedback of the COP. They authors found less
postural control in the group with CP, and body sway was more irregular when visual feedback
was provided, which confirmed the expected imbalance when one&#x02019;s attention is drawn to
another function. Rose et al.<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup> found
that children with CP exhibited greater body sway in comparison to children with typical
development with the eyes open, but found no significant differences between groups with the
eyes closed.</p><p>Damiano et al.<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study with
three groups of children: one with hemiparetic CP, one with diparetic CP, and one with
typical development. They authors found greater oscillation area in the AP and ML directions
in both groups of children with CP in comparison to the group with typical development,
while sway velocity was only greater in the group with hemiparesis.</p><p>Duarte et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a longitudinal
study of tDCS (active and placebo) combined with treadmill training for children with CP
over 10 consecutive days, with evaluations performed before, immediately after and one month
after the intervention. Statistically significant reductions in AP and ML COP area were
found with the eyes open and with the eyes closed in the group submitted to active tDCS,
which was maintained until to the follow-up evaluation. Salem et al.<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup> found an improvement in balance in the one-leg stance test
in a pilot study involving children with delayed motor development. In another pilot study,
Gordon et al. <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup> found a 7% improvement
in the Gross Motor Function Measure among children with CP.</p><p>tDCS studies generally have involved adults patients and have analyzed its of the effect on
the balance among stroke survivors<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>
or sedentary individuals with obesity<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Games facilitate improvements in static and dynamic balance during functional tasks by
stimulating the displacement of the center of body mass and changes in the support base<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, games are a viable option for aerobic exercise and
therefore promoting physical fitness, which in line with the recommendations of the American
College of Sports Medicine<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Practical guidelines for the use of virtual reality in the treatment of children with CP
were published in February 2012<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although there are few studies involving this population, the findings demonstrate
improvements in postural control, balance, upper limb function, selective motor control and
gait<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of tDCS combined
with virtual reality mobility training are promising with regard to improvements in balance,
as demonstrated in longitudinal studies with the techniques applied separately. We believe
that the results of the immediate effect of the combination of these two methods are of
considerable importance to future investigations in this line of research.</p><p>Based on the findings of the present study, a single session of anodal tDCS over the
primary motor cortex combined with virtual reality mobility training appears elicits to lead
to an increase in body sway velocity in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions on
stable ground with the eyes open and the eyes closed, however, an the increase in sway
velocity only occurs in the mediolateral direction with the eyes open and with the eyes
closed only occurred when proprioceptive information (foam mat foot support) was also
provided.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento
