Access to the central circulation may be required for the administration of hyperosmotic or vasoactive compounds, parenteral nutrition, rapid infusion of large volumes of fluid or for the continuous or intermittent monitoring of biochemical or physiological parameters. Central venous catheter insertion is also indicated when the insertion of a peripheral line is not possible. Traditionally, CVC insertions have been performed using the landmark technique. The internal jugular, subclavian and femoral veins are commonly used sites. Even with experienced operators, complication rates of up to 12.3% have been reported for CVC insertion using the conventional landmark technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] Considering the number of CVCs being inserted every day, this can amount to a large number of complications. Efforts to minimize and prevent the occurrence of complications should be a routine component of quality improvement programs.</p><p>There is an increasing body of evidence supporting the use of USG for CVC placement. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in USA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), in the United Kingdom[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] have recommended the use of USG guidance for CVC placement as one of the practices to improve patient care. In spite of these recommendations, the use of USG guidance when inserting CVCs has not gained much acceptance and is still used only sparingly, even in Western countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Advances in specialty care in India and the availability of portable ultrasonography (USG) units in hospitals have made the use of USG for bedside procedures, possible in many institutes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] Our aim was to study the impact of USG on success rates and mechanical complications of CVC insertion.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized study performed in the medical and surgical intensive care units (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>All patients admitted to the ICUs between April 2007 and September 2008 and requiring central venous access as part of their management were enrolled in the study. Indications for CVC insertion included difficult peripheral venous access, need for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and delivery of inotropic medications or antibiotics. Informed consent was obtained from the subject or relatives before enrollment. The exclusion criteria included age below 18 years and refusal to give consent for inclusion in the study.</p><p>Using a computer-generated randomization chart, the patients were randomized into two groups: in the first group, CVCs were inserted using the anatomical landmark technique (ALT group) and in the second group USG guidance was used for inserting CVCs (the USG group).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Interventions</title><p>Operators were categorized into two groups according to experience. Operators with less than 6 years of experience were classified as &#x02018;registrars&#x02019; and those with more than 6 years of experience in the field of anesthesia and critical care were classified as &#x02018;consultants.&#x02019;</p><p>The right internal jugular vein (IJV) was the first choice for cannulation. Other sites such as the left IJV, left or right subclavian (SCV) or femoral veins were cannulated only if the right IJV was not available for cannulation due to the presence of a previously inserted CVC or dialysis catheter.</p><p>Cannulation using the landmark technique was performed as per the standard guidelines [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>].[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Ultrasonography-guided catheters were inserted using a portable, software-controlled, USG system with a 13-6 MHz, 38-mm linear-array transducer (SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA). To maintain sterility, the lead and transducer were cleaned with antiseptic solution and the probe was covered with a sterile sheath and gel. The patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position and the neck was sterilized with an antiseptic solution. For IJV cannulation, the transducer was placed perpendicular to the vessels at the apex of the triangle formed by the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the clavicle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>]; for SCV cannulation, the transducer was placed slightly inferior to the middle third of the clavicle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>]. Although using transducer probe in the vertical plane has been recommended, we used it in the transverse plane as the vein and artery are best visualized in this plane and because the learning curve is less steep. The vein was identified by its large size and relation to the artery [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>] and confirmed by checking its easy compressibility and by visualizing non-pulsatile, continuous flow using color Doppler. The transducer was positioned so that the vein was visualized in the center of the USG monitor.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Insertion of a CVC in the right IJV using the anatomical landmark technique.

On the monitor, the needle could be seen either puncturing the vein or compressing the vessel. Once puncture of the vein occurred, we followed the modified Seldinger technique to insert a CVC. The position of the CVC was confirmed by a chest radiograph at the end of the procedure.</p><p>The procedure was considered a failure if the operator was unable to cannulate the vein within three attempts; an attempt being defined as the introducer needle's entry into the skin and its removal from the skin. If the initial method was unsuccessful after a maximum of three attempts, an alternative method was used, viz., USG was used if the insertion was being done by the ALT technique, help was taken from a more experienced operator or an alternative site was chosen.</p><p>At the end of the procedure, all data including patient demographics, reason for insertion of the CVC, level of operator experience, method of insertion, number of attempts and complications encountered were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The main outcome measure was the successful insertion of a CVC. Secondary outcome measures included the number of attempts and incidence of complications such as hematoma, pneumothorax, artery puncture, misplacement or nerve injury.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used SPSS, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois), for the statistical analysis. The means of continuous variables were compared using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and categorical variables were compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and Fisher's exact test. We estimated the relative risks (RRs) for complications between the two procedures using the two sites of cannulation and also estimated the 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the point estimates and the reduction in risk. Additionally, we estimated the age-, sex- and operator-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals around the point estimates for complications in the two groups. A <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 450 patients were enrolled for the study, 225 each in the ALT and USG groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>].

In the modern healthcare setup, radiological expertise is a precious commodity. With practice and training, nonradiologists can learn to use USG for such procedures as central line placement, leaving the radiology specialist free for other vital diagnostic and therapeutic duties. In this study, CVC cannulations with USG guidance were performed by anesthetists/intensivists.

This discrepancy may be explained by the difference in definitions; in the other studies, operators were classified as experienced if they had performed more than 25 cannulations, whereas we categorized operators on the basis of years of experience: i.e., &#x02018;registrars&#x02019; with 0&#x02013;6 years experience and &#x02018;consultants&#x02019; with more than 6 years of experience in the field of anesthesia and critical care.

As the aim of the study was only to examine the technical complications related to CVC insertion, the impact of USG on CVC-related infections was not studied. The time required for cannulation was not compared between the two groups as there is some controversy over whether the time required for setting up of the USG machine and sterilizing the transducer is to be included as part of the procedure time; however, it seems logical to assume that with increasing experience the time required to cannulate under USG guidance will come down.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Real-time USG-guided intervention is becoming an increasingly popular and valuable tool in the critical-care setting, where it can increase the accuracy, safety and efficacy of CVC insertion. Ultrasonography guidance reduces failure rates, is effective in eliminating multiple access attempts and reduces the risk of complications with IJV cannulation. A larger trial is required to study the role of USG in SCV catheterization. We recommend the use of USG to guide CVC insertion, especially in the IJV, and believe that it should become the standard of care in intensive care.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schummer</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Schummer</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Niesen</surname><given-names>WD</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakka</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanical complications and malpositions of central venous cannulations by experienced operators.
