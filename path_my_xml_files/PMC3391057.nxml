The public health benefit and safety of repeated administration of a given ACT are poorly studied. We conducted a randomized trial comparing artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ) and artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) in patients 6 months of age and older with uncomplicated malaria in Mali from July 2005 to July 2007. The patient received the same initial treatment of each subsequent uncomplicated malaria episode except for treatment failures where quinine was used. Overall, 780 patients were included. Patients in the AS+AQ and AS+SP arms had significantly less risk of having malaria episodes; risk ratio (RR) = 0.84 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and RR = 0.80 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), respectively. The treatment efficacy was similar and above 95% in all arms. Although all drugs were highly efficacious and well tolerated, AS+AQ and AS+SP were associated with less episodes of malaria.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to the World health Organization (WHO) 2010 report, in the 106 malaria-endemic countries, 225 million cases of malaria led to an estimate of 781,000 deaths in 2009.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Once a person develops malaria, the only means of reducing suffering and preventing death is by diagnosing and treating the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> To counter the threat of resistance of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> to monotherapies, and to improve treatment outcome, WHO recommends that artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) be used for the treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>The choice of the ACTs in sub-Saharan African countries was mostly based on the efficacy and safety data of a single malaria episode treatment that does not take into account the long-term impact on malaria incidence and safety, which may have a given ACT when used over and over to treat consecutive malaria episodes.</p><p>In addition, as the first generation ACTs are being rolled out, studies show that they may rapidly increase the prevalence of molecular markers associated with resistance to the partner drugs, i.e., lumefantrine, amodiaquine, or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>Although data are available for the use of ACTs during single-episode treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> there are limited data on safety and public health benefits in terms of overall incidence of clinical episodes during the use of the same ACT during repeated malaria episodes treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></p><p>To address these gaps this study aimed to evaluate the public health impact in terms of incidence of clinical episodes and the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ), and artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) when used repeatedly for consecutive clinical malaria episodes during as long as 24 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study site.</title><p>The study was conducted from July 2005 to July 2007 in Bougoula-Hameau, a peri-urban village of &#x0223c;5,000 inhabitants located in the South of Mali. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is hyperendemic with seasonal peaks that occur during the rainy season (June&#x02013;November).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design and procedures.</title><p>This was an open-label, randomized clinical trial comparing three different ACTs: AL, AS+AQ, and AS+SP.</p><p>When malaria was suspected finger-prick blood was taken for thick blood films.

Patients were closely followed both clinically and biologically to record any adverse event. Patients with &#x0003e; 200,000 parasites/&#x003bc;L or who had treatment failure during the 28-day follow-up period or who developed severe malaria were treated with quinine and/or hospitalized if necessary.

This study found that the risk of recurrent parasitemia (uncorrected PCR 28-day follow-up ACPR) malaria had a significant seasonal variation. We found significant recurrent parasitemia during the rainy season compared with the dry season. This study finding is consistent with a Ugandan study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> which also found significant seasonal variation in recurrent parasitemia despite the perennial malaria transmission pattern in that study setting. The significant recurrent parasitemia during the rainy season compared with the dry season could be explained by the high intensity of the malaria transmission during the rainy season compared with the dry season.</p><p>Our participants received quinine as a second-line treatment. However, it is unclear whether quinine, the same ACT, or a different ACT would be the optimal treatment. Given that nearly all recurrent parasitemia were caused by new infections, it might have been reasonable to retreat with the same ACT regimen, rather than with quinine.</p><p>The repeated treatment using the same ACT in this study showed a good safety profile. This finding is consistent with other studies that also reported a good safety profile of repeated treatment of ACT,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> even in chronically malnourished children with or without HIV infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Although AL was associated with a higher reinfection rate and hence higher malaria incidence rate, it did produce fewer side effects such as vomiting.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the consideration of asymptomatic parasite carriers from Day 7 during each 28-day treatment follow-up as treatment failures (as in the WHO treatment assessment guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), which were treated with quinine and counted as malaria episodes for new infections as determined by PCR. The overall malaria episodes may be similar if one considered only symptomatic parasite recurrence during each 28-day treatment follow-up and the clinical episodes occurring afterward. Although our sample size calculation assumptions expected differences equal or greater than 35%, we observed statistically significant differences in malaria incidence reduction of 16% and 20% with AS+AQ and AS+SP, respectively, compared with AL. This is probably because our original calculation was conservative and yielded a rather large sample size, resulting in smaller differences being statistically significant. In addition, the mean malaria incidence was higher than expected (two episodes expected but almost three episodes observed)</p><p>We show that ACTs that had very high and similar efficacy and safety by the standard 28-day drug efficacy test could have a different impact on malaria incidence over a longer period. In this era of high efficacy of ACTs, the choice of a first-line treatment policy should go beyond short-term efficacy and safety to include longer follow-ups and repetitive treatments with the same regimen. Additional studies will be required to assess the overall impact of the large-scale deployment of ACTs on malaria in the field.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank all the volunteers who participated in this study; Val&#x000e9;rie Lameyre and Brigitte Charron from Sanofi Aventis for providing some managerial support and monitoring the study; Mamadou Balla Ciss&#x000e9;, a pediatrician from Sikasso, Mali who served as the study medical monitor; the data management staff of the Malaria Research and Training Center, University of Bamako, Mali for managing the clinical date and the Regional Hospital of Sikasso staff, Mali for their great collaboration during the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial support: This work was supported by European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership (EDCTP) fellowship grant (2004.2.C.f1 to A.D.) and by Sanofi (A<italic>RTEN-L</italic>-00848) who provided the monitoring services, the study insurance, and the study drugs.</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="conflict"><p>Disclosure: None of the authors have any conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn id="FN3" fn-type="present-address"><p>Authors' addresses: Issaka Sagara, Malaria Research and Training Center, Department of Epidemiology of Parasitic Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy and Odonto-Stomatology, University of Bamako, Bamako, Mali and Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France, E-mail: <email>isagara@@icermali.org</email>.
