<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> Traumatic nipple is among the most common
problems of the breastfeeding period which leads to early cessation of breastfeeding. The
study aimed to compare the effects of the lanolin, peppermint, and dexpanthenol creams on
the treatment of traumatic nipples.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> This double-blind randomized controlled trial was
carried out on 126 breastfeeding mothers. The mothers had visited at the health centers
and children&#x02019;s hospitals in Sanandaj City. The selected participants were randomly divided
into the following three groups of lanolin, peppermint, and dexpanthenol cream groups.
Nipple pain was measured using the Store scale while trauma was measured with the Champion
scale. Analyses were carried out through the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test, Chi-square, ANOVA, and
repeated measures ANOVA by using SPSS software ver. 13.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> The result showed that the mean score of nipple
pain and nipple trauma at the prior to intervention stage, third, seventh, and fourteenth
days of intervention was not significantly different between three groups. But, repeated
measures ANOVA showed a significant difference in comparison of the four time periods of
intervention in each group.</p><p>

and growth in the first 6 months of birth.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>
Breast milk not only reduces the risk of incidence of many acute and chronic diseases such
as diarrhea and respiratory infections in breast-fed infants, but also it has numerous
benefits to mothers (for example, the reduced risk of breast cancer,uterus cancer, ovarian
cancer, and osteoporosis).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p> Among all the possible problems arising during the breastfeeding period, breast conditions
and those occurring in the early days of breastfeeding are most important.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Nipple problems include the development of
macroscopic lesions that occurs on the nipples and areola. These lesions may appear as
eroded skin, wounds, and fissure as well as clinical signs of erythema, edema, white or
yellow blisters, dark spots, and ecchymosis.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p> Traumatic nipples pose threats to mothers, infants and societies. The most common
consequences of traumatic nipples include infants&#x02019; deprivation of breast milk benefits and
it may lead to stress and dissatisfaction in mothers. Studies indicate that problems
occurring in the first days following birth may lead to the cessation of breastfeeding.
Moreover, according to the statement issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), less
than 40% of infants below 6 months of age are exclusively fed by breast milk.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> The incident of traumatic nipples varies between 29% and 76%, while nipple pain caused
from breastfeeding varies between 34% and 96%.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Few studies have been carried
out to study the treatments of traumatic nipples.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> It is estimated that 80% to 90% of breastfeeding women experience mild
nipple pain. If these pains remain untreated, 26% of nipple pains will develop into nipple
fissure and severe pain.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p> Unfortunately, treatment of traumatic nipple is complicated because of the repeated
sucking by the infant, infections caused by the entrance of microorganisms through the
nipple fissure, and constant exposure of nipple skin with the infant&#x02019;s oral flora.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p> Treatment of traumatic nipple dates back to the seventeenth century, but there is no
explicit statement on the most suitable topical treatment for traumatic nipples.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In this regard, complementary medicine,
especially herbal medicine, plays a major role in improving the quality of postpartum care.
Currently, 40% of common medicines are derived from plants and natural resources.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p> Among the available treatments, lanolin improves traumatic nipples through giving moisture
to the nipples. Lanolin penetrates to the skin and facilitates the absorption of medicines.
This composition is capable of absorbing up to 30% of water.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p> In 2008, Dennis indicated that the application of lanolin is effective for the treatment
of sore nipples. He stated that lanolin along with teaching the correct breastfeeding
technique is the best solution to the treatment of nipple fissure.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In contrast, Gartner showed that recovery of nipple fissure in
the lanolin group took longer.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In
another study, Dodd &#x00026; Chalmens carried out a comparison between the effects of hydrogen
dressing and lanolin on the treatment of traumatic nipples and showed that the hydrogen
dressing group experienced a significant decrease in pain as compared to the lanolin
group.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, no significant
difference was observed in wound healing between two groups.</p><p> Dexpanthenol is one of the skin healers which belongs to the family of B complex vitamins.
This medicine functions as a moisturizer by reducing water loss through the epidermis and
maintaining the softness and elasticity of the skin. Kusch indicated that dexpanthenol is
effective in the prevention of nipple pain.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Peppermint herb which is a native plant to Iran, is widely used for the
treatment of skin numbness, burns, scars, itching and inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In 2003, Ahluwalia made a comparison between the
contributions of peppermint, lanolin, and teabag to the treatment of traumatic nipples and
reported a significant decrease in pain and a significant increase in the nipple trauma
healing of the peppermint group.They concluded that peppermint increases tissue flexibility
and prevents fissure.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p> In another study, Sayyah Melli showed that the administration of peppermint juice was
three times more effective than breast milk in the prevention of nipple fissure. However,
lanolin was less effective than peppermint.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In 2014, Akbari indicated that peppermint essence can improve nipple
fissure in primiparous women.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p> After a vast review of the existing literature, no study was found to have confirmed the
effects of dexpanthenol and peppermint on the treatment of traumatic nipple in Iran, as all
of the studies in this country were conducted on the prevention of trauma.</p><p> Considering the high prevalence of traumatic nipple and its complications, the lack of any
agreed treatment for traumatic nipples, and the necessity of early treatment of traumatic
nipples with the lowest side effects, the present study was carried out to compare the
effects of lanolin, peppermint, and dexpanthenol creams on the treatment of traumatic
nipples</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This randomized controlled trial conducted to compare the effects of lanolin, peppermint,
and dexpanthenol on the treatment of traumatic nipples in breastfeeding mothers.</p><p> The target population included the breastfeeding mothers who visited at the Abbas Abad and
Farabi health centers and Sanandaj children&#x02019;s hospital in 2014. These centers were selected
for this study because the number of breastfeeding mothers visiting these centers was
high.</p><p> Based on the research by Ahluwalia et al.,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> the sample size was calculated to be 35 for each group by confidence
interval of 95% and statistical power of 80% and using the three-group comparison formula.
Finally, by considering a sample loss of 20%, 42 women were selected in each group.</p><p> The research samples were all of the breastfeeding mothers, who visited at the children&#x02019;s
hospital and health centers and who had no drug prohibitions. After obtaining the permission
of the Ethics Committee and the research deputy of Tabriz Medical Sciences University, the
samples were selected from breastfeeding mothers, who met the inclusion criteria and visited
at the Abbas Abad and Farabi health centers and Sanandaj children&#x02019;s hospital.</p><p> After explaining the research and its method and objectives to the mothers, the written
consent was obtained from all participants. Afterwards, the personal and social information
forms were completed and midwifery histories of the subjects were recorded. The forms and
records were completed based on the observation of the breastfeeding methods of the mothers
using the Store and Champion scales. The samples were finally selected based on the
following inclusion criteria: 1) primiparous mothers; 2) exclusive feeding with breast milk;
3) term infant; 4) infant with below two months of age; 5) obtaining the minimum score of 1
from the Store and Champion scales; 6) mothers free of any medical disorders; 7) lack of
sensitivity of mothers to lanolin, peppermint, and dexpanthenol; 8) infant weight of 2500 to
4000 grams; and 11) lack of any nipple disorders (flat and depressed nipples). The exclusion
criteria included the followings: 1) infants suffering from tongue and tooth disorders; 2)
using pacifiers, bottles, and plastic nipples for infants; 3) history of maternal
psychological disorders reported by mothers; and 4) mother or infant suffering from any
nipple-irrelevant condition that lead to cessation of breastfeeding.</p><p> Consort guidelines were followed in this research. The samples were randomly assigned into
the lanolin, peppermint and dexpanthenol groups. The allocation sequence was determined by a
computer-generated randomization scheme with the block sizes of 3 and 6 and the allocation
ratio 1:1:1. Then, the tubes were filled with 50 mL of lanolin, lanolin, or dexpanthenol by
the Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Tabriz School of Pharmacy. They were put in pockets and
numbered by the research supervisor.</p><p> The lanolin tube contained pure lanolin without additives. The peppermint tube contained
carbopol, methylparaben, triethanolamine, and glycerin along with 0.2% of peppermint oil,
and the dexpanthenol tube contained 5% B complex analogue. Every woman entering the study
received sealed, opaque pockets (of apparently similar sizes). Numbers ranging from 1 to 126
were printed on the pockets with identical uniform tubes. The pockets included three types
of cream: lanolin cream, peppermint cream, and dexpanthenol cream. The subjects were
randomly assigned into three groups receiving lanolin, peppermint, and dexpanthenol, and
neither the researcher nor the subjects were aware of the assignment sequence and the
position of each subject. That is to say, this study was a double blind trial.</p><p> The breastfeeding mothers were not allowed to use any other treatment method during the
study period and they were asked to report any case of sedatives consumption during the
study. The participants were asked to apply a thin layer of the cream to the traumatic
nipple and its areola three times a day immediately after breastfeeding for two weeks. The
participants had recontamination of hand washing with warm water and soap before applying
the cream.</p><p> The information was collected through four steps (prior to intervention and on the third
day, seventh day, and fourteenth day).</p><p> The participants, who were trained on completion of the Store and Champion scales in
advance, completed the scales on the third, seventh, and fourteenth days and submitted them
to the researcher on the fourteenth day (the appointment day). The researcher completed the
forms at least once. In addition, a follow-up appointment was set for all of the
participants one week after entering the research to record the intake of any sedatives or
development of any complication caused by the treatment. The patients were given a cell
phone number to be able to call and ask any questions related to the disease during the
daytime until 12 AM. The data collection instrument consisted of three parts.</p><p> The first part questioned the demographic and social information and the maternal history
of subjects. This questionnaire covered information such as the patient age, marriage age,
marital status, education, profession, residence location, midwifery information (including
the number of pregnancies, number of delivery, number of living children), history of
medical surgeries and history of breastfeeding (number of infants, duration of breastfeeding
period, sedatives received for breastfeeding pains, treatment effect, breastfeeding status,
and breast care during pregnancy, following birth and during breastfeeding). The positive
response (Yes) was assigned the 1 score while the negative response (No) was assigned the 0
score. The questionnaire was completed through interviews before the intervention. The
second instrument which used to collect data was the Storre scale. This scale was designed
to measure nipple pain. The breastfeeding mothers measured their pain using this scale and
its numerical scale. Score 0 was assigned to no pain and score 5 (the maximum score) was
assigned to the highest level of pain.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
The third instrument for data collection was the Champion scale. This scale was designed to
identify and rank nipple trauma. It is also used to assess the recovery of wound depth and
the extent of damage caused to the tissue. The breastfeeding mothers used this scale and its
numerical scale to assess the extent of nipple trauma and its recovery.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p> Lack of trauma was assigned the 0 score and larger numbers were recorded for deeper
traumas. The scale ended with the maximum score (being 5).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Champion scale (NTS) to assess Trauma healing of the nipple.
This tool has been used in various studies inside and outside the country, and its validity
have been confirmed by Champion.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Storr
scale (NSRS) to assess soreness healing of the nipple. This tool has been used in various
studies inside and outside the country, and its validity have been confirmed by
Storr.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The reliability of the Store
and Champion scales was measured using the test-retest method (r&#x0003e;0.7).<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The data was analyzed using SPSS software
ver.13 and the following test methods: test-retest method, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis method, Chi-square
test, ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA. The significance level was assumed to be
P&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> In this clinical trial, 150 breastfeeding mothers were assessed were assessed for

reaction was also observed in the three groups to nipples coated with the aforementioned
creams. That is to say, the infants easily started and continued drinking breast milk.
Therefore, no difference was made to the breastfeeding procedure and no complication was
observed. There was also no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms
of side effects when taking creams. </p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p> Research results revealed the equivalent effects of the 0.2% peppermint, lanolin, and
dexpanthenol creams on the treatment of nipple pain and trauma. A thin layer of these creams
was administered every 8 hours for two weeks. In the present study, according to the Store
scale, the pain of participants in the lanolin group declined by 0%, 78%, and 100% on the
third, seventh, and fourteenth days of intervention, respectively. Moreover, 2.4%, 80.5%,
and 100% of reduction were observed in the peppermint group in the aforementioned days and
2.4%, 88.1%, and 100% of decline were observed in the dexpanthenol group, respectively. The
results of the research by Dennis et al., were in line with the results of our study
regarding the effectiveness of lanolin.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In
the study by Abou-Dakn et al., 80% decline was observed on the seventh day and full recovery
was obtained on the fourteenth day.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
These findings are also consistent with our findings, but in their research the effect of
peppermint water on the treatment of nipple pain was reported to be more than lanolin cream.
Therefore, their study does not comply with our study in general and the difference in the
results was resulted from the fully uniform intervention in our study. Moreover, in their
research the groups were not equally exposed to intervention, because 100 patients in the
lanolin group, 50 patients in the teabag group, and 50 patients in the peppermint group were
undergone the intervention.</p><p> In the present study, according to the Champion scale, similar levels of improvement in
term of nipple trauma resulted from administration of the peppermint, lanolin and
dexpanthenol creams. In a study conducted by KuScu et al., the results of using dexpanthenol
for the treatment and recovery of trauma were similar to our results. That is to say,
dexpanthenol contributes to the healing of skin wounds through epithelialization and
granulation. It also leads to wound improvement by storing water through the
epidermis.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In the research by Dennis
et al., the patients were mainly complaining about pain and 78% and 71% of pain declines
were observed in the multipurpose ointment and lanolin groups on the seventh day of
treatment, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p> The results of their study are consistent with our study regarding the decreased pain
symptoms. Vieira et al., conducted a systematic review and concluded that administration of
lanolin with or without breast milk was the most effective intervention for the treatment of
traumatic nipples as compared with other the treatments such as breast milk, hydrogel,
adhesive polyethylene film dressings, a spray containing chlorhexidine with alcohol, and
distilled water.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In the other study by
Mohammadzadeh et al., the duration of trauma recovery in the lanolin group was higher than
the breast milk and control groups. Their study was not in line with our research. The
reason for the difference between our results and the above research was the limitations
that were found on this research.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p> For example, no scale was used to determine the scores for nipple trauma andthe ranking
was carried out under the supervision of a researcher, who was aware of the study groups.
Therefore, nipple trauma was assessed with more precision in our study.</p><p> One of the advantages of this study was the innovation in using 0.2% peppermint essence in
the form of cream for the treatment of traumatic nipples. Moreover, the recovery of patients
on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> days of treatment was also
followed.</p><p> Since no pre-term and abnormal infants were included in the study, the research findings
cannot be generalized to these infants. Moreover, this research was not carried out in
medical centers of villages, and other cities. Therefore, the trainings, the program
resulted from the native specifications of Sanandaj City, and its results may not be
applicable to other areas and cities of Iran.</p><p> The following recommendations are provided for future studies in this field.</p><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p> Since few studies have been conducted in Iran and the world on traumatic nipple
treatment, it is recommended to carry out further studies on this topic. Moreover,
Iranian studies have solely focused on prevention of trauma. </p></list-item><list-item><p>It is recommended to conduct studies on the possible maternal and neonatal side effects
of substances used for traumatic nipple treatment. </p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> The contribution of peppermint to the treatment of traumatic nipples is similar to that of
lanolin and dexpanthenol. Therefore, peppermint could be considered as an effective
alternative to the treatment of traumatic nipples in patients willing to use herbal
medicines.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> Hereby we express our gratitude to the personnel of Bessat Hospital, Abbas Abad and Farabi
