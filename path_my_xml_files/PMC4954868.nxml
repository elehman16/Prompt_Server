Here we investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of a training regimen which is hypothesized to promote emotional awareness, specifically mindfulness training (MT). We test the hypothesis that MT increases cooperative economic decision making using fMRI in a randomized longitudinal design involving 8&#x000a0;weeks of either MT or active control training (CT). We find that MT results in an increased willingness to cooperate indexed by higher acceptance rates to unfair monetary offers in the Ultimatum Game. While controlling for acceptance rates of monetary offers between intervention groups, subjects in the MT and CT groups show differential brain activation patterns. Specifically, a subset of more cooperative MT subjects displays increased activation in the septal region, an area linked to social attachment, which may drive the increased willingness to express cooperative behavior in the MT cohort. Furthermore, MT resulted in attenuated activity in anterior insula compared with the CT group in response to unfair monetary offers post-training, which may suggest that MT enables greater ability to effectively regulate the anterior insula and thereby promotes social cooperation. Finally, functional connectivity analyses show a coupling between the septal region and posterior insula in the MT group, suggesting an integration of interoceptive inputs. Together, these results highlight that MT may be employed in contexts where emotional regulation is required to promote social cooperation.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Decision making</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>Social cooperation</kwd><kwd>Interoception</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd><kwd>Ultimatum Game</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human altruism and social attachment have evolved to promote cooperation and prosocial behavior beyond bonds of kinship (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Trivers, 1971</xref>). The ability to regulate emotional reactions in economic and social exchanges is a fundamental component of cooperative behavior among humans. The core question addressed in the present study is whether psychological training, specifically mindfulness training (MT), may enhance cooperative economic decision making. MT cultivates nonjudgmental observation of thoughts and emotions (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>), and it remains unexplored whether practices of non-identification with arising states of mind may empower people to change behavior (such as economic decision making) as opposed to reinforcing automatic and habitual responding. In the nascent research field of probing behavioral and neural effects of MT, an important next question to address is whether MT allows individuals to maintain cooperative behavior when confronted with negative emotions. In other words, we ask the question whether individuals are able to inhibit reactions to negative emotions, such that a social exchange may maximize collective earnings. Indeed, recent reports suggest that compassion meditation decrease altruist punishment (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">McCall et al., 2009</xref>) and increase altruistic helping behavior (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the current longitudinal randomized controlled fMRI study using the Ultimatum Game, we compare a subject cohort who received 8&#x000a0;weeks of MT to a subject cohort who received 8&#x000a0;weeks of active control training (CT) in the form of physical relaxation training. Both interventions focus on training emotional coping and stress-reducing strategies but differ in the course content to achieve emotional balance and stress relief (see <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>).</p><p>The current study builds on prior work by providing an empirical structure for understanding the mechanisms by which MT reshapes the sense of fairness and cooperation in economic exchanges (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>). While cooperative behavior may provide a platform whereby social reputation invites norm-violating behavior (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004</xref>), an understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms by which MT potentially interacts with prosocial behavior may have clinical implications and benefits for patients with psychopathologies such as psychosis, which is characterized by an elementary lack of trust in others (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Gromann et al., 2013</xref>); social phobia (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Sripada et al., 2013</xref>); or in patients showing a failure to cooperate, such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) patients (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">King-Casas et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previous neuroimaging experiments have identified neural correlates of social exchange games (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">King-Casas et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>). For example, studies using the Ultimatum Game demonstrate that people reject unfair monetary splits even at a cost to themselves, e.g., offers of 20% are rejected about 50% of the time (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Camerer, 2003</xref>). Yet rational accounts predict that responders would accept any non-zero offer. Presumably, this reflects an emotional reaction to unfairness that overrides rational economic decision processes. The elevated rejection rate of unfair offers is associated with anterior insula activity that scales inversely with offer size and predicts whether an unfair offer is rejected (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>). The anterior insula is a brain area linking interoception (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Craig, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Craig, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Critchley et al., 2004</xref>) with emotional awareness (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2013</xref>). It has recently been proposed that interoceptive function also contributes to value-based decision making (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Gu and FitzGerald, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2014</xref>; but see <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Paulus, 2007</xref>).&#x000a0;For example, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al. (2011)</xref> show that experienced meditators are less likely to reject unfair offers during the Ultimatum Game and show a shift in activation during unfair offers from anterior to posterior insula, as compared with a non-meditator control group. Similarly, studies show a link between activity in the middle and posterior portions of the insula cortex and mindfulness training (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Farb et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2014</xref>) as well as compassion meditation (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Lutz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While no study has directly evaluated the effects of mindfulness training in a longitudinal design on cooperative behavior, recent work has studied the effects of compassion training on prosocial behavior (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Klimecki et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Leiberg et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2013</xref>). However, in these studies, direct effects of altruistic punishment during social exchange (for a review see <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2008</xref>) or specific effects of MT per se was not examined.</p><p>In the current study, we hypothesize that MT will promote cooperative behavior during social exchanges. A direct advantage of employing a longitudinal design is that it allows us to compute a <italic>cooperation index</italic> reflecting within-subject changes to cooperative and prosocial decision making. Specifically, we predict that MT will increase subjects' cooperation index in the Ultimatum Game. We further predict that MT will modify neural activity in anterior insula and scale inversely with offer size (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, based on previous research showing that the septal region during social exchange encodes altruistic, prosocial behavior, and unconditional trusting behavior (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Harbaugh et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Moll et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Krueger et al., 2007</xref>), we hypothesize that neural signatures in the septal region will be engaged as a function of MT in contrast to CT and provide neural support to the behavioral hypothesis of increased acceptance rates in the MT group.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifty-one healthy volunteers participated in the Ultimatum Game. The CT group consisted of 24 subjects (20 Caucasians; 4 Afro-Americans) and the MT group consisted of 27 subjects (22 Caucasians; 5 Afro-Americans). The CT group included 13 women and 11 men (mean age 31.1; st.d 9.8), while the MT group included 14 women and 13 men (mean age 32.2; st.d 10.4). The two groups did not differ in terms of mean age or gender distribution. One subject from the MT group was excluded from the analyses based on outlier behavior in the Ultimatum Game (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;3 SD from the mean).</p><p>The study was framed as a stress-management program lasting 8&#x000a0;weeks and recruitment procedures consisted of advertising for participants &#x0201c;who want to learn to deal with stress issues in everyday life.&#x0201d; This recruitment strategy was employed in order to reduce self-selection bias to ensure volunteers from a broad demographic range. Subjects were recruited with the understanding that the study consisted of comparing two equally valid stress reduction interventions. In addition, subjects were notified that they would be assigned to a stress reduction intervention in a random manner, which eliminated any self-selection effects between the two interventions. The study was advertised for staff and students around campus at Virginia Tech, Virginia, USA. This recruitment strategy resulted in 238 volunteers who signed up for the study. Of this initial number, 45 subjects were found to be ineligible (33 subjects were using psychiatric medication or had a medical history of psychiatric medication; 12 subjects were MRI ineligible due to either metal implants, claustrophobia, or subjects who had previously suffered from concussions that included a loss of consciousness for more than 10&#x000a0;min). An additional exclusion criterion for the study was prior experience (i.e. regular practice) with mindfulness meditation. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and none in the included cohort had a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. The non-selected volunteers were put on a waitlist to participate in future studies involving stress-management training. The subjects who were included in the current study were subsequently randomly assigned to receive either MT or CT. Subjects received compensation for their participation according to the following payment scheme: subjects were paid $20 for attendance in each of the 8 weekly group sessions independent of group modality (MT/CT). Subjects were paid according to the decisions they made on three randomly selected rounds during the Ultimatum Game to make sure that subjects made motivated choices during the task, which is a standard procedure in the field of neuroeconomics (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Montague and Berns, 2002</xref>). Subjects were informed about this payment method prior to the experiment. The subjects received compensation associated with the Ultimatum Game fMRI-task immediately after each scanning session. However, attendance compensation for the 8 weekly group sessions was paid in total upon study completion. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Review Board of Virginia Tech.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Experimental procedures</title><p>Participants played responders during 40 rounds of an anonymous version of the Ultimatum Game. Prior to scanning, participants were instructed in the task and were subsequently given a test to ensure that the nature and rules of the game were understood participants. The offers were splits of $20. On each round, the participants saw a bar graph with an offer (e.g. &#x0201c;Tom proposes: $9 you $11 Tom&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Different names were used on every trial both in the pre-training scanning session as well as in the post-training scanning session. The offer screen was of 4&#x000a0;s duration. Next, the participants were presented with the choice: &#x0201c;Accept ($9) Reject ($0),&#x0201d; which was presented for 3&#x000a0;s in which subjects made a response using a button-box. A red box placed around one of the choices indicated that a decision was made. Finally, a jittered inter-trial interval was presented (4&#x02013;14&#x000a0;s). Participants had a button-box in each hand and were instructed to press with either left or right hand corresponding to the preferred choice, which was presented on left and right side of the screen. The position of the &#x0201c;accept&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;reject&#x0201d; choices on either left or right side was held constant within subjects and counterbalanced across subjects. Participants were presented with the 40 offers/trials in a predetermined fashion: 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$19:1, 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$18:2, 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$17:3, 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$16:4, 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$15:5, 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$14:6, 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$13:7, 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$12:8, 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$11:9, 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;$10:10. The sequence of offer presentations was randomized across participants.</p><p>The stimuli were presented at a screen resolution of 1024&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;768 pixels. Stimuli were presented and responses collected using NEMO (Human Neuroimaging Lab, Baylor College of Medicine). The stimuli were back-projected via an LCD projector onto a transparent screen positioned over the subjects' head and viewed through a tilted mirror fixed to the head coil.</p><p>Prior to the experiment, participants were told that the offers presented had been made by proposers in a previous experiment, i.e. that the offers were real, and that proposers would be paid according to the decision made by the participants. This served as a cover story to enhance the ecology of the game, i.e. that the choices made by subjects had actual consequences for partners on each round of the game. In reality, all the proposals were predetermined similar to other neuroimaging studies using the Ultimatum Game (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Crockett et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Koenigs and Tranel, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Knoch et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Subjects were scanned both before the 8-week training intervention and immediately (i.e. 1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days) after the intervention was completed.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Psychometric data</title><p>All volunteers completed the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (I-PANAS-SF) and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and post-intervention. The I-PANAS-SF is a 10-item version of the mood-assessing PANAS inventory, with similar psychometric properties (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Thompson, 2007</xref>). The FFMQ is a self-report instrument targeting five aspects of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2008</xref>). We report only the total FFMQ score due to data loss of the original hard-copy data, and the fact that only the electronically stored total scores were available for the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Procedure for MT</title><p>The MT consisted of 8&#x000a0;weeks of practice of mindfulness using a modified version of a mindfulness program titled Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>). The modification consisted of reducing the required home practice, which is 45&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min daily in the canonical MBSR program (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>), to 20&#x000a0;min daily. This modification was made to match the daily homework in the active control group and to enhance adherence to the program. A certified MBSR instructor taught the MT program. A structured group format (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) was applied whereby participants attended weekly group sessions that introduced them to formal meditation practices and to moment-to-moment, and non-judgmental awareness. Each group session lasted 2.5&#x000a0;h. The MT program also included a full day of meditation between the sixth and seventh meeting sessions. Participants were required to attend at least seven of the eight group sessions and the full-day session to be considered compliant with the training protocol. In addition to group meetings, participants were asked to practice meditation on non-class days for 20&#x000a0;min a day with the assistance of guided meditation CDs. The formal meditation practices included breath monitoring, body scans, and attention to sounds, thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Participants were instructed to maintain a daily log of practice completion, which was collected by the course instructors at every weekly session. In addition to class attendance, participants were required to complete at least 50% of the recommended daily homework.

The weekly sessions were 2.5&#x000a0;h in duration and included 30&#x000a0;min of stretching and exercise. These exercises could be easily completed in comfortable clothing. Some positions could be performed while seated. The exercises were followed by a group discussion for 30&#x000a0;min, with participants sharing their experience on a particular topic and giving updates from previous weeks. Sometimes, the group was asked a question to facilitate conversation, and group members would take turns to answer it. After the group discussion, the facilitator would introduce a new topic; topics included time management, physical activity, sleep, healthy eating, organization, communication, and future goal setting. The facilitator provided information gathered from online sources about each topic. On non-class days, participants were expected to complete their stretching and exercises daily (20&#x000a0;min/day) with the aid of guided practice CDs, and to reflect on the topic for the week. The CT program also included a full day of physical relaxation exercises between the sixth and seventh meeting sessions.

Following pre-processing, a general linear model (GLM) was applied to the fMRI time-series where each stimulus onset, which is offer onset including the 4&#x000a0;s epochs following the offer, was modeled as boxcars and convolved with SPM8&#x02019;s canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) (<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Friston et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>A parametric design was used (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Buchel et al., 1998</xref>) that allowed us to model linear hemodynamic responses using the subject-specific 40 monetary offer trials.

Residual effects of head motion were corrected by including the six estimated motion parameters for each subject as regressors of no interest. The mean images from the first level analysis were entered into a second-level, random effects (RFX) analysis accounting for the between subject variance. An ANOVA model using the beta-estimates of the pre- and post-training regressors for each subject according to group modality (MT and CT) for each of the polynomial expansions was applied.

Specifically, subjects were subdivided into two categories according to their change in acceptance rates pre- to post-training: 1) subjects who displayed decreased acceptance rates pre- to post-training; 2) subjects who displayed increased acceptance rates pre- to post-training. This procedure yielded 4 regressors for each group MT and CT, respectively: 1) pre-accept increase, 2) pre-accept decrease, 3) post-accept increase, 4) post-accept decrease.

The PPI employed a regressor representing the deconvolved time series of neural activity within a 5-mm sphere centered on left septal region (MNI coordinates: &#x02212;&#x000a0;4 4&#x02013;6), which constituted the physiological variable, a second regressor representing the psychological variable, specifically the first-order linear parametric regressor that scales with unfair offer sizes, and a third regressor representing the cross-product of the previous two (the PPI term). The model also included motion parameters as regressors of no interest. The PPI was carried out in each subject and entered into random-effects analysis separately for each of the two groups. These two groups were the 17 subjects in the MT group and the 10 subjects in the CT group that displayed an increasing cooperation index (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S2</xref>) and both time points (pre and post) were included in the analysis.

Accordingly, subjects displaying a decreased cooperation index should exhibit elevated anterior insula activity post-training, presumably reflecting the responders' negative emotional response associated with unfair offers (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>). To formally test this conjecture, we computed each subject's cooperation index as a between-subject statistical regressor separately for MT (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) and CT (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24) against the first-order linear parametric regressor as an ROI analysis in bilateral anterior insula (see <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>).

In order to account for the variability in acceptance rates between the two groups, we subdivided subjects into those who exhibited an increasing cooperation index post-training vs. those who displayed a decreasing cooperation index. This subdivision yielded 17 subjects, or 65% from the MT group, who displayed an elevated cooperation index post-MT, whereas 10 subjects, or 41% exhibited an increasing cooperation index in the CT group (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S2</xref>).

It is noteworthy that the cooperative MT group and the cooperative CT group did not differ significantly in either age or gender.</p><p>The key contrast based on this subdivision is the interaction between training condition and time: [(Post-MT&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;Pre-MT)&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;(Post-CT&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;Pre-CT)].

Based on our previous study (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>) where we identified increased posterior insula activity in the presence of an unfair offer in expert meditators, we speculated that the MT group might exhibit an increased connectivity between these two brain regions in the context of unfair offers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a functional connectivity analysis with psychophysiological interactions (PPI) (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Friston et al., 1997</xref>) using the left septal region as the seed region. Specifically, we assessed if the physiological coupling between the septal regions and the posterior insula changed relative to a modulation in the psychological parameter.

The results expand previous work (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>) by employing a randomized controlled design using MT and active CT to study the impact an 8-week behavioral intervention (MT or CT) exerts on decision-making processes in the context of the Ultimatum Game (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Guth et al., 1982</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bolton and Zwick, 1995</xref>). MT showed a profound effect on subjects' acceptance rates in the Ultimatum Game. Subjects in the MT group were, after 8-weeks of training, willing to accept significantly more unfair offers than subjects in the CT group.</p><p>Ultimatum Game behavior resulted in collectively higher earnings for MT subjects (responder role) as well as for their social partners (proposer role). However, when playing a CT subject, there were no increases in collective earnings (<xref rid="f0050" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S6</xref>). Thus, personal as well as social partners' monetary earnings increased with MT, which suggest a prosocial benefit of MT.</p><p>Further validation that MT was responsible for this behavioral profile was substantiated by individual FFMQ scores showing 1) a higher score in the MT group compared to the CT group in the post-training condition, 2) a positive correlation between increasing acceptance rates from pre- to post-training and FFMQ scores in the MT group but not the CT group (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S1</xref>&#x000a0;A), and finally, 3) a correlation between weekly home practice and the FFMQ in the MT group but not the CT group (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S1</xref>B).</p><p>The behavioral findings in this study resonate with recent results that have demonstrated changes in decision making in the Ultimatum Game following both affect induction (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Harl&#x000e9; and Sanfey, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Harl&#x000e9; et al., 2012</xref>) and emotional reappraisal (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">van't Wout et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Grecucci et al., 2013</xref>). Similar results have been obtained with neurophysiological techniques, such as TMS (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Knoch et al., 2006</xref>). However, our study extends these findings in important ways by demonstrating that MT over the course of 8&#x000a0;weeks leads to prosocial behavioral changes compared to CT.</p><p>On a neural level, we found that anterior insula in the pre-training condition in both groups was elevated in the context of unfair offers in accordance with previous findings (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>). Post-training, we observed that those subjects who displayed a decreasing cooperation index exhibited increased anterior insula activity (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). This result suggests that regulation of the anterior insula in the context of social exchange promotes an increased ability to accept unfair monetary offers. This notion is reflected in anterior insula activity where we found that the regression slope in the MT group was significantly lower compared with the CT group. Previous results support this result where it was found that anterior insula was attenuated when presented with unfair offers in a meditation group (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>). These findings fit nicely with theoretical accounts of mindfulness practice, whereby MT does not reduce negative emotions from arising (i.e. note that the MT group exhibit a significant correlation between acceptance rates and anterior insula activity; <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) but rather enables an increased ability to effectively regulate emotions by not acting on them (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chiesa et al., 2013</xref>). This observed pattern in the anterior insula cannot be ascribed to pre-existing behavioral (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S3</xref>) or neural differences (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S5</xref>) but seems to arise as a result of the training intervention. As we found a neural bifurcation in the anterior insula during unfair offers in the CT and MT subgroups, it rules out the possibility that these effects merely reflect repetition effects.</p><p>Why did some subjects in the MT group fail to show a transfer of the MT regimen to an elevated behavioral acceptance rate of unfair offers? One plausible explanation might be a lack of interest during training. However, data from home practice (two sample <italic>t</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.67, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.5) and class attendance (two sample <italic>t</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;1.2, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.2) showed equal training engagement in the subjects in the MT group that displayed an increased cooperation index compared to those who displayed a decreased cooperation index. An alternative explanation could be that subjects in the MT group that showed a negative cooperation index compared to those in the MT group who showed a positive cooperation index started off with lower mindfulness scores as assessed by the FFMQ. However, the data did not show evidence of such a pattern (two sample <italic>t</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.25, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.7).

The septal region is a limbic region that has been associated with a range of social behaviors. For example, the septal nuclei contains neuropeptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Loup et al., 1991</xref>) that are involved in pair bonding (<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, studies have shown that administration of oxytocin in humans increased cooperation in an economic social exchange paradigm (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Kosfeld et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, this region is involved in unconditional economic trust in the social domain (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Krueger et al., 2007</xref>) and altruistic and prosocial behavior (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Harbaugh et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Moll et al., 2006</xref>). In one study, the septal region encoded the automaticity of empathy irrespective of emotional directionality, suggesting that even negative emotions activate the septal region and may drive empathic prosocial motivation and subsequent prosocial behavior (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Morelli et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the activation of the septal nuclei was found in a linear parametric regression analysis computing elevated responses as the size of unfair offers increased, that is, as the size of monetary gain to one-self decreased. This suggests that the septal nucleus encodes the voluntary decision to effectively donate a larger monetary reward to a social partner and thus suspends fairness goals. Hence the data do not support an alternative interpretation, namely, that the septal regions and adjoining head of the caudate&#x02014;which has been consistently involved in anticipation of rewards (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Lohrenz et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005</xref>)&#x02014;compute the decision to maximize monetary rewards for oneself, and thus reflect actions based on self-interest.</p><p>Previous studies have implicated the DLPFC in reducing subjects' willingness to reject unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Knoch et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>). In the subset of participants who primarily accepted unfair offers (i.e. those subjects with increased cooperation index), we found increased activity in bilateral DLPFC for CT only, but not for MT (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="graphic">Fig. S4</xref>). This activation pattern might reflect the higher cognitive demands in order to overcome the emotional tendency to reject an unfair offer (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Knoch et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sanfey et al., 2003</xref>). By contrast, the MT group did not recruit the DLPFC to overcome the urge to reject an unfair offer. This result is consistent with studies on meditation on pain processing that found that pain activation was found for meditators within the dorsal ACC, thalamus, and insula. In contrast, controls showed stronger activation in several areas including bilateral dlPFC (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Grant and Rainville, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2010</xref>; for a review, see <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chiesa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We observed elevated connectivity between the septal region and the posterior insula during the processing of unfair offers, which was unique for the cooperative MT group. The posterior insula seems to be connected to somatic and visceral inputs and outputs, assisting the interpretation and modulation of the autonomic signals ascending from the body. A model proposed by <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Craig (2009)</xref> argues that the anterior insula is involved in social motivational and cognitive conditions, whereas the posterior part is involved in visceral interoceptive representations. This model is in line with recent findings in the domain of mindfulness, whereby the right posterior insula is involved in focused attention to internal experiences (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;lzel et al., 2008</xref>), and momentary self-reference (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Farb et al., 2007</xref>). Previous results (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>) showed activation in the posterior insula suggesting that expert meditators particularly during unfair offers were better able than controls to maintain interoceptive awareness presumably by attending to internal bodily states. This is consistent with the present findings and suggests that MT interact with interoceptive processes in the posterior insula and drives the cooperation index change in the MT group.</p><p>In summary, the results from this study suggest that MT modulates behavioral decision strategies during presentation of unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game. The results further provide evidence that the underlying neural mechanisms by which prosocial behavior may be acquired is through a striatal network including the septal region, however future work should try to disentangle the exact role of MT in the underlying self-interested rational vs. prosocial motives of Ultimatum Game behavior. In addition, the results point to effects of MT as an enhanced ability to regulate anterior insula activity, which may be responsible for increased collective earnings during social exchanges. Future research should aim to delineate the potential clinical implications of MT in patients with psychopathologies such as psychosis, which is characterized by an elementary lack of trust in others (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Gromann et al., 2013</xref>), social phobia (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Sripada et al., 2013</xref>), or patients with perturbed abilities to cooperate such as BPD patients (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">King-Casas et al., 2008</xref>). Research into the clinical efficacy of MT and other therapeutic approaches may carry major public health significance.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. S1</label><caption><p>A) Positive correlation in the MT group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) between the cooperation index, which is computed as the within-subjects measure of the difference in percent acceptance rate of monetary offers from pre-intervention to post-intervention, and the delta value of each individuals' FFMQ score [post-MT&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;pre-MT].
