A major challenge is to provide good health care for older people. To achieve this, relevant clinical evidence is required. However, older people, in particular the frail, are difficult to enrol in clinical research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Patient recruitment is usually one of the most challenging aspects of clinical research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and there are particular difficulties involved in enrolling older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], who are more likely than young adults to have factors which might exclude them from studies, such as coexistent chronic diseases, cognitive impairment, limited mobility and polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recruitment and retention of frail, older people is resource intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Higher costs associated with transportation and time commitment can also be specific barriers to the recruitment of frail and older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Because of these challenges, many intervention studies of older people target individuals who have fewer co-morbidities, are less frail, are on fewer medications, and with less disability than their peers who will be subsequently treated with the study treatment if found beneficial.</p><p>Some researchers have described reasons for non-participation in research studies and how these might be overcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The use of flexible recruitment protocols using multiple methods probably enhances recruitment in primary care studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In order to ensure that recruitment to future studies of older people is improved, it is important for researchers to share their experiences of challenges and success. Therefore, in this paper we describe the challenges, process and outcome of recruiting older people at-nutritional risk to a multi-centre, community based, randomized control trial looking at the efficacy of interventions that include a nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this randomized control trial of daily oral testosterone and nutritional supplement drink versus placebo in community dwelling older people at-risk of under-nutrition is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The hypothesis, based on positive results in a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], was that this combined anabolic treatment would reduce the rate of hospital admissions, an important clinical endpoint, in this vulnerable group of older people.

This included some preliminary screening questions (i.e. recent weight loss and estimated weight and height). They were also provided some brief information about the study. If participants appeared eligible, information about the research study was posted by the research officer to interested participants.

The majority of these (3592 [89%]) were identified by case note review in New South Wales, and of these 336 met initial inclusion criteria regarding age and co-existent medical conditions, and were sent written material about the study. These subjects and an additional 431, largely identified in response to newspaper advertisements, radio and TV appearances by the investigators, and in a few cases after referral by friends or others, were then contacted for screening by phone (total n&#x02009;=&#x02009;767).</p><p>At screening, 210 (27%) of the 767 participants were found to be ineligible, while 487 (64%), declined to take part. Detailed reasons for potential New South Wales participants&#x02019; identified by case note review ineligibility or declining to take part are not available. Reasons for ineligibility and decision to decline participation for the other 431 potential participants are detailed in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The most common reasons for ineligibility were not meeting the weight criteria (40%) and co-existent exclusionary medical conditions (32%), including cardiovascular disease, prostate cancer and breast cancer. The majority of those who declined to take part (58%) did so for non-specific reasons after reading the information sheet. Potential participants often commented or seemed to suggest to the research officer at screening that they did not think they were malnourished (even when apparently satisfying the study weight criteria for this), while others seemed to be put off by the length and detail of the information sheet. A variety of other specific reasons were given for declining to participate, including being unwell at the time of screening, not wishing to take additional medications and advice from general practitioners and others.</p><p>Fifty four participants were recruited and consented. One (recruited after referral by a friend) withdrew just before commencing the study and 53 started the study. Twenty seven (51%) were recruited through newspaper advertisements, with radio program appearances by investigators (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16, 30%) and TV segments also contributing (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, 11%). Two subjects were recruited as a result of referral by health care professionals. No subjects were recruited as a result of case note reviews.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In spite of many factors militating against inclusion of older adults to this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we were able to recruit some older participants at-risk of under-nutrition, many of whom were frail. However, despite intensive recruiting and screening using a variety of methods, for four years, in the capital cities of three Australian states, we were not able to recruit the desired number of 200 undernourished/at risk older participants.</p><p>Recruitment methods that were most effective in this study were newspaper advertisements and appearances by investigators on talk-back radio programs. Websites, mailings, fliers, and referrals by health-care professionals were generally ineffective for recruitment of older adults. Screening hospital records and then contacting possible eligible participants so-identified was without success in recruiting participants. A higher recruitment rate may have been achieved by trying some other strategies such as directly approaching older people through senior community groups which can be time consuming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], or by providing incentives to general practitioners to identify eligible participants from their practice. For example, Ellish et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], investigated enrolment yields by type of activity and type of venue in older African Americans into a behavioural intervention study designed to increase eye examination. Highest enrolment rates were word of mouth (69%), flyers (67%) and senior centres (66%). In another study, Forster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] invited older people to a six-month randomised controlled dietary intervention which aimed to explore the relationship between diet and immune function. In their study, the most successful recruitment method was contacting recruits by letter on GP headed note paper using contacts provided from General Practice (90%).</p><p>It seems likely that difficulties we had recruiting participants were due to both the details of our particular study, and to difficulties in recruiting older, particularly unwell and frail participants for any research study. Factors related to this particular study probably contributed substantially to the low recruitment rate. Many potential participants were ineligible on the basis of co-existent medical conditions and not meeting the low body weight inclusion criteria for under-nutrition or risk of under-nutrition. The restrictions resulting from stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria for randomised controlled trails particularly limit recruitment in studies of older people. Masoudi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], have reported similarly low recruitment rates for clinical trials of heart failure in older people. The oldest patients and women are particularly unlikely to meet trial criteria.</p><p>More than half of potential participants we contacted declined to take part, most of them after reading the study information sheet. Reasons given for not taking part were many and varied (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and often non-specific, but included a number more likely to be factors in older people, for example feeling unwell at the time of contact with research officer, feeling that the study would involve too much effort for an already fatigued and unwell person, and not wanting to add to the number of existing medications taken. A factor particular to this study was a lack of recognition by potential participants that they might be under-nourished and therefore at risk of adverse outcomes, or potentially benefit from participation in a study directed at this problem. This highlights the general lack of recognition of the problem of under-nutrition in older people, both among older people themselves, and their professional and other carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We probably would have had a higher recruitment rate if studying a condition with a higher rate of recognition and concern among potential participants, for example cancer, pain, or obesity. Regarding the latter, and again highlighting the lack of recognition of under-nutrition as a problem in older people, we were surprised by how many older people contacted us after a media story or advertisement about the study asking how we might help them to <italic>lose</italic> weight, despite it being made clear in our information that we were looking to <italic>increase</italic> the nutritional state and weight of underweight, under-nourished people. Again, perhaps consistent with the low level of recognition of this problem, we recruited virtually no participants by approaching them (eg after case note review or referral from health care worker), and had much greater success when we were approached by potential participants who had become aware of the study through the media and recognised that they may have a problem.</p><p>In retrospect the information sheet (12 pages in length, 4544 words) was probably too complicated and long, and put a number of potential participants off. We might have had greater success with a a two-step process, with a shorter introductory information sheet one followed, for those expressing continued interest, by an in-person explanation and provision of the detailed information sheet mandated by our ethics committees. Attention to the layout of the information sheet is also important. Crawford Shearer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], reported documents printed in small font are difficult for visually impaired older adults. They also suggested that forms should be written in large font, divided in two sections and difficult terms should be expressed simply. Difficulty with the consent process, which involves long and complicated documents, is a common cited barrier in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], although we are not aware that that was the case in this study.</p><p>Reassuringly, the refusal rate in our study was similar to that reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In our study, many participants either did not want the pharmacological treatment or wanted to receive the nutritional supplement only. Some frail and older participants already being on multiple medications were concerned about the side effects of the proposed medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The inclusion of a pharmaceutical intervention in a randomized control trial can be a barrier to recruitment because the participants must be willing to be assigned randomly and accept treatments to which they may have been blinded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Also, they must be willing to risk being assigned to placebo where some or all of the intervention, such as the nutrition supplement in this study, is available outside the study.</p><p>Despite designing the study to include home visits to make it more convenient for participants to participate, a number of participants declined because they felt that they were concerned about the length of the study and the number of visits required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Older adults may lack understanding of the study protocols, have lower levels of education and be unwilling to make a time commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, some older persons find research studies intrusive through excessive interviews or collection of biological samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>There are other strategies reported in the literature that could improve the recruitment of older people to clinical trials. Wilding et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] suggested in their study that eligibility criteria should be more inclusive of those with lower cognitive functioning, mobility restrictions, and co-morbidities. They also suggested direct-mail recruitment methods and utilizing intermediaries to recruit institutionalized elderly. Kolanowski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], reported strategies that address participant and family barriers including early site evaluation and strong communication approaches with staff, participants, and families. It has also been reported that a face-to-face approach is more effective than recruiting from other sources and helped to reduce the uncertainty that older adults felt about participating in research study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In the process of recruiting to this study, a number of ethical challenges were addressed including informed consent, confidentiality, and voluntary participation. Media exposure was effective in recruiting participants into the study and in creating interest in the topic and therefore, is an appropriate strategy provided that it is implemented early in the study. The researchers could have employed some other strategies to improve recruitment to this clinical trial such as direct approach to older people through community groups and activities but this was difficult in terms or our resources and time availability. It is important in designing clinical studies of older people to allow for the difficulties of recruitment, the time commitment involved and to allocate sufficient resources to the multiple strategies that might be necessary to recruit sufficient subjects.</p><p>In summary, we were able to recruit sufficient participants to complete our study of under-nourished, older, community-dwelling older people, but not as many as planned, and the recruitment period extended over 4&#x000a0;years, despite our use of multiple recruitment methods. There were recruitment issues related to our particular study design, but others likely to apply to most studies of older people, particularly when frail or in poor health. Media appearances and advertisements were the most effective strategy with no success from direct approaches to potential participants we had identified. It is probably important that potential subjects identify themselves as having the condition under study and that they perceive it is a problem to them &#x02013; education is likely to help in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Multiple recruitment strategies are likely to be necessary to recruit adequate numbers in many studies involving older people. Simplification of the recruitment process as much as possible (eg not overwhelming subjects with long information sheets at first contact), establishing face-to-face contact with potential older subjects as early as possible in the recruitment process, and simplification of the study protocol to minimise burdens of the study on participants (for example reducing study visit numbers and requirements for investigations) are strategies that are likely to help with recruitment.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Appendix 1</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>ARE YOU UNDERWEIGHT?</title><p>Under-nutrition and weight loss in older people are common, but frequently overlooked.
