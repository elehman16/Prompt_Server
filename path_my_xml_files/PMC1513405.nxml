<bold>Background:</bold> In an accompanying paper published in <italic>PLoS Clinical Trials</italic> [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the investigators report the effects of treating uncomplicated malaria in young children in the Gambia with the combination of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, as compared to either treatment individually. As an addition to the main trial results, the researchers also wanted to find out how the different treatment regimens affected the ability of the malaria parasite to generate sexual forms (gametocytes) in the participants' blood, and to what extent the parasites are then transmitted to mosquitoes. The researchers also tested whether malaria parasites had a specific genotype, termed TYRG, comprising mutations in four distinct genes associated with resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and whether that affected transmission of the parasites back to mosquitoes.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> In this trial it was found that children treated with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were no more or less likely to carry sexual forms of the malaria parasite compared to children treated with chloroquine, over 28 days of follow-up. Transmission of the malaria parasites back to mosquitoes also did not differ significantly between children treated with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine versus chloroquine alone. Parasites bearing the TYRG genotype, associated with drug resistance, were more likely to be transmitted to mosquitoes from children treated with chloroquine/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine than from chloroquine treated children.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The addition of data about parasite transmission within the setting of a randomized trial is valuable and can provide information about the evolution of drug resistance. However, the results may not completely represent the current situation, as the trial was originally conducted in 2001 and levels of resistance may now be higher in the Gambia.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This follow-up study to a randomized trial provides additional evidence that treatment with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, as compared to chloroquine, does not reduce the extent to which malaria parasites can produce sexual forms and transmit them back to mosquitoes. The finding that parasites bearing the TYRG genotype are more likely than other parasites to be transmitted back to mosquitoes following chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment is also novel.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hallett RL, Dunyo S, Ord R, Jawara M, Pinder M, et al.

In some parts of Southeast Asia, multidrug-resistant parasites are prevalent and have greatly reduced the efficacy of the majority of monotherapy regimens. This has led to the implementation of combination therapies, including artemisinin-based treatment throughout the region [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, monotherapies such as chloroquine (CQ) and the antifolate fixed combination sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) have continued to be widely used. Parasites resistant to CQ are common and known to contribute to excess severe malaria cases [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and SP-resistant genotypes have spread widely across the continent from a few focal origins [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, despite there being few studies of multidrug-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> in Africa, it is likely that parasites harbouring mutations conferring resistance to both CQ and SP circulate in many areas. Policy changes towards the implementation of artemisinin-containing combination therapies (ACTs) are now occurring in many countries [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>One of the potential benefits of ACT use is that the artemisinin component has the demonstrated ability to reduce gametocyte carriage and thus transmission to mosquitoes [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other antimalarial drugs vary in their effect on gametocytes; CQ and other 4-aminoquinolines exert their effect on the parasite's haem-metabolising stages, which includes early-stage gametocytes. In contrast, antifolates such as SP are only effective during asexual development and will not affect parasites once these are committed to the sexual pathway [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The implementation of ACTs is costly and is currently beset with problems of supply due to the very rapid expansion in demand for artemisinin drugs in the last few years. Therefore, some African Ministries of Health have moved to combinations of established antimalarials as a first step away from monotherapies, in anticipation of a second switch to ACTs as soon as it is feasible. Senegal has implemented SP plus amodiaquine as first-line replacement for CQ monotherapy, with a move to amodiaquine plus artesunate planned for 2006. In the Gambia, where CQ monotherapy is no longer efficacious [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it has been replaced by CQ combined with SP (CQ/SP), with the longer-term goal being implementation of ACT.</p><p>Earlier studies in the Gambia had shown that CQ plus SP was as efficacious as SP alone as treatment for uncomplicated malaria in children and was more effective at providing rapid symptomatic relief [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in studies of the infectiousness to mosquitoes of treated Gambian children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, we have found that SP and CQ both permit substantial transmission during the first week following treatment [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as does the combination CQ/SP [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CQ-resistant parasites were already highly prevalent in the Farafenni area when these studies were carried out and displayed enhanced gametocyte carriage and higher intensity of mosquito infection than wild-type parasites in CQ-treated individuals [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, we have shown that mutant forms of the <italic>pfdhfr</italic> and <italic>pfdhps</italic> loci associated with SP resistance and carriage of gametocytes after SP treatment [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were also common [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We were concerned therefore that the combination CQ/SP would selectively enhance the transmission and circulation of multidrug-resistant parasites. Such an enhancement may persist for some time after treatment, given the long half-life of SP, and the longevity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> gametocytes.</p><p>In 2001, we conducted a single-blind, randomised, controlled trial of CQ versus SP versus CQ/SP in Gambian children aged 6 mo to 10 y presenting to Farafenni Hospital with uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria. We report in the accompanying paper [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] the therapeutic efficacy of the regimens used, and the identification of a four-locus parasite genotype that was associated with treatment failure and may represent a multidrug-resistant phenotype in the Gambia. Posttreatment gametocyte carriage and infectiousness of gametocyte carriers to mosquitoes are examined here. We also evaluated the contribution of parasites carrying a multidrug-resistant genotype to transmission success in each treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was a single-blind, randomised, controlled trial to compare efficacy of treatment of children with uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria with CQ, SP, or CQ/SP. Full details of the participants and interventions are described in the accompanying paper [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objectives were to measure posttreatment gametocyte prevalence and density in each of the three treatment groups and to assess how this related to infectiousness to mosquitoes. Within the SP group, the effect of time after treatment was also examined, because gametocyte samples were collected on three different follow-up days. Secondary measurements included the contribution of genetically defined drug-resistant parasites to mosquito oocyst burden and the effect of drug group on transmission success.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcomes measured were gametocyte carriage and density on defined follow-up days, and the proportion of mosquitoes infected. The number of oocysts was counted in each infected mosquito midgut. For all infections used for mosquito feeding, the genotype at drug resistance-associated loci was determined at three time points: pretreatment, and posttreatment in the gametocyte-positive blood feed sample and in the mosquito midguts arising from successful infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample Size and Randomisation</title><p>The sample size, randomisation, and blinding are described in the accompanying paper [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Posttreatment Follow-Up</title><p>Follow-up procedures relating to efficacy endpoints are described in the accompanying paper [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In order to fulfill the transmission objectives, children were collected from their homes either on day 7, 10, or 14 after treatment and taken to the Medical Research Council Field Station in Farafenni, where they were clinically examined and finger prick blood samples were obtained for thick blood film preparation and packed cell volume estimation. The blood films were stained with Field's stain and examined immediately for malaria parasites. Children with gametocytes were requested to provide 3.0 ml of venous blood for mosquito infectivity experiments as previously described [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For those who had received CQ or CQ/SP, this happened on day 7 only. Among the SP-treated group, children were assigned a gametocyte screening day according to the day of the week they were recruited to overcome the logistical problems that would be caused by a nested second randomisation. Thursday and Friday recruits receiving SP were screened for gametocytes on day 7, Tuesday and Saturday recruits were screened on day 10, and Monday and Wednesday recruits were screened on day 14. Recruiting did not occur on Sundays. SP-treated children who were screened on day 10 or 14 were not visited on day 7 and therefore were not subject to follow-up equivalent to that of SP-treated children screened on day 7 or of children in the other treatment groups, all of whom were screened on day 7.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Membrane-Feeding and Mosquito Dissection</title><p>Venous blood samples were obtained from children with a packed cell volume of &#x0003e;20%, who had been free of peripheral gametocytes at the time of recruitment (day 0) but who were gametocytaemic (limit of detection, 5 gametocytes/&#x003bc;l) when screened on day 7, 10, or 14. Specific consent for the procedure was obtained from the parents or guardians. If no children fulfilling these criteria were available as donors but cages of mosquitoes had been prepared, children who had been gametocyte positive on day 0 were selected. Membrane-feeding was performed as described elsewhere [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In brief, venous blood in citrate-phosphate dextrose was centrifuged, and the plasma was removed. After being washed, the red blood cell pellet was split into two aliquots of 300&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;l each. These were resuspended to a packed cell volume of 33% in, respectively, the original autologous plasma and in pooled AB serum from European donors with no history of malaria exposure (control serum). Each suspension was then fed to approximately 50 3- to 5-d-old female <named-content content-type="genus-species">Anopheles gambiae</named-content> mosquitoes (obtained as F<sub>1</sub> progeny of wild-caught gravid females) via an artificial membrane attached to a water-jacketed glass feeder maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C. Mosquito midguts were dissected out 7&#x02013;8 d later, and the number of malaria oocysts on each one was recorded. Each oocyst-positive midgut was retained in a separate tube of 95% ethanol.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Parasite Genotyping</title><p>DNA was extracted from day 0 bloodspots on filter paper and from the remainder of the venous blood sample taken for membrane-feeding by boiling with chelex-100 [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Oocyst DNA was obtained from infected mosquito midguts as follows: each sample was rehydrated in 500 &#x003bc;l of a 1:1 mix of ethanol and TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA) before being incubated at 56 &#x000b0;C overnight in 200 &#x003bc;l of 6% chelex containing 20 &#x003bc;g of proteinase K. Samples were then boiled for 30 min and 5 &#x003bc;l of the supernatant was used in PCR amplifications [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing assay was used to detect polymorphisms at loci associated with CQ and SP resistance in all PCR-positive DNA extracts [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

For some analyses, where mixtures of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasites were detected, they were scored as resistant to reflect the expected phenotype of the infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>All data were double entered and verified using Epi-Info, version 6 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States). Clinical, parasitological, and entomological data entered in Epi-Info were transferred to Stata 8.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, United States) for statistical analysis. Categorical variables were compared among groups using odds ratios and significance tested by the Fisher exact test. Gametocyte densities counted in thick films and oocyst density on mosquito midguts were compared between treatment groups in pairwise fashion. The ratio of the arithmetic means was calculated, and generalized linear models with a logarithmic link function and negative binomial distribution family were fitted to the data. This models the logarithm of the (arithmetic) mean gametocyte density, or oocyst density as previously described [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

CQ/SP has been the recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the Gambia since 2004. SP alone has had a measured parasitological efficacy of approximately 90% over 28 d in the Gambia [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, both SP and CQ/SP are characterized by substantial rates of posttreatment gametocyte emergence [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and because alleles of <italic>pfdhfr</italic> and <italic>pfdhps</italic> associated with SP failure are present in the Farafenni area, we expected that parasites resistant to both drugs would be frequently transmitted following combination treatment.</p><p>In this study, CQ/SP treatment was followed by little reduction in posttreatment prevalence and density of gametocytes, compared to CQ alone. Only at the day 28 follow-up point was gametocyte carriage in the CQ/SP-treated group significantly lower than in the CQ group. However, gametocytes occurred more frequently and at higher density in the SP group throughout posttreatment follow-up and particularly at day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0010015-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that CQ/SP-treated children may be infectious for a shorter period of time following treatment than those treated with SP alone. This may be the result of more rapid asexual parasite clearance by CQ/SP [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], combined with the activity of CQ against early developing gametocytes [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Gametocyte carriers from all three treatment groups were infectious to <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> in experimental feeding. Remarkably, the high gametocyte densities observed among the SP-treated group at day 7 in particular did not translate into substantial infectiousness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0010015-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Gametocyte carriers in the SP group identified at day 10 or 14 were significantly more infectious to mosquitoes, suggesting that gametocytes circulating at day 7 after SP treatment, but not CQ or CQ/SP treatment, have not attained sufficient maturity to infect mosquitoes efficiently. One explanation for this observation is that, because SP appears unable to kill even the earliest developing gametocyte stages sequestered in the host tissues at the time of treatment [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], many of the emergent gametocytes seen on day 7 are not as yet fully mature, although morphologically they appear so. In contrast, CQ will kill genotypically sensitive gametocytes in the early stages of development, and so day 7 emergent gametocytes are those that were already some way to maturity at the time of treatment. However, this does not explain why the significant numbers of CQ-resistant parasites were not also less infectious at day 7 in the CQ treatment group, because their early development is expected to be unimpaired by drug. An alternative hypothesis is that SP treatment in some way perturbs the gametocyte sex ratio, so that the accumulation of one sex is delayed, thus preventing fertilization until sufficient of both sexes are present in the gametocyte population. It remains unclear why the maturity of gametocytes was a particularly important factor in the infectiousness of children who had also harboured gametocytes at day 0.</p><p>Resistance-associated alleles at five of the seven loci examined were more common among gametocyte carriers than among noncarriers in a randomly selected group of pretreatment isolates, as was the <italic>pfdhfr</italic> &#x0201c;triple mutant&#x0201d; haplotype of 51-I, 59-R, and 108-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0010015-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The multilocus genotype TYRG (<italic>pfcrt-</italic>76T, <italic>pfmdr1</italic>-86Y, <italic>pfdhfr</italic>-59R, and <italic>pfdhps-</italic>437G) was also more common among gametocyte carriers, and among children donating gametocytes for feeding experiments, than among noncarriers, although this was not statistically significant. In the accompanying paper, the TYRG genotype was found to be weakly associated with parasitological failure after SP treatment, but not after CQ/SP treatment [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The presence of the TYRG multilocus genotype among either gametocytes membrane-fed to mosquitoes, or among <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> oocysts present in infected mosquito midguts was associated with significantly higher oocyst burdens in the CQ/SP combination group. This was independent of feed type or the presence of gametocytes prior to treatment, and was much stronger than the association between this genotype and treatment failure [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. TYRG carrying parasites thus appear to enjoy a substantial survival advantage, which leads to favourable transmission under CQ/SP treatment. In contrast, TYRG genotypes were less successfully transmitted than other genotypes in both monotherapy arms; in the CQ treatment group, this difference was statistically significant. This supports the view that drug-resistant parasites are likely to be less fit, relative to other genotypes in the population, in the absence of the particular drug or combination of drugs that has led to their selection [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Our data did not provide clear evidence of within-host selection for the TYRG genotype, as we have previously observed in CQ-treated patients [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This is probably due to the fact that some of the alleles, particularly <italic>pfcrt-</italic>76T and <italic>pfdhfr-</italic>108N, were at a high starting prevalence and so wild-type alleles were rare.</p><p>Taken together, our analyses of therapeutic and transmission endpoints of this clinical trial demonstrate that multidrug-resistant parasites enjoyed a survival advantage in terms of their likelihood of transmission to mosquitoes, but that the particular genotypes encountered in the Gambia did not threaten the therapeutic efficacy of CQ/SP [<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010015-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
