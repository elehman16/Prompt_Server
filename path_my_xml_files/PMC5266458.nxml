</p><p>To improve the quality of care in Nigeria&#x02019;s primary health-care facilities, 3 organizations: Saving One Million Lives Initiative, Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme on Maternal and Child Health (SURE-P MCH), and PharmAccess Foundation, collaborated to implement a pilot health-care quality improvement project in primary health-care facilities in rural communities.</p><p>PharmAccess Foundation, a Dutch group of organizations, is dedicated to making quality health care accessible in Africa.

Facilities with supportive and committed facility managers recorded higher improvements, as was the case in the Anambra State treatment A facilities that were managed by registered nurses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2333392816662581">Figure 3</xref>). However, facilities with only 1 or 2 self-driven personnel achieved little without the facility manager&#x02019;s support. Overall, the responsiveness of the WDCs and staff was attributed as major success factors.</p><fig id="fig3-2333392816662581" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Overall scores for treatment A and treatment B control facilities at end line by state.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2333392816662581-fig3"/></fig><p>At baseline, malaria diagnosis was primarily based on the patient history of symptoms, without supporting laboratory investigation, leading to high records of malaria treatment errors. This was linked to the fact that only 30% of primary health-care facilities had either standing orders or guidelines for the management of malaria, indicating lack of adequate drug administration, guiding procedures, and monitoring. The guidelines were made available at all treatment A facilities and led to improvements in malaria management.</p><p>Despite observed improvements, deficiencies existed in the security of patients and staff, infection control, waste management, occupational health, and fire safety. This was because they were capital intensive and beyond the capacity of the facilities to improve by itself.</p><sec id="section12-2333392816662581"><title>Contextual Relevance of Study</title><p>The most important and consequential level of care, the primary health care, is left to the weakest tier of government&#x02014;the Local Government Authority (LGA).<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333392816662581" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These LGAs lack adequate funding, manpower, and effective reporting lines, resulting in poor coordination and integration between levels of care and a weak and disorganized health system with varying outcomes based on the local situation,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333392816662581" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-2333392816662581" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr19-2333392816662581" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> as observed in this study. Unless efforts to improve quality assurance are supported by a national policy framework, only scattered examples of quality excellence without comprehensive improvement will be exhibited.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2333392816662581" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
</p><p>On a superficial level, the study showed facilities cannot be stimulated to improve or sustain improvements without external support due to resource constraints. However, the degree to which facilities imbibe a quality improvement culture depends on the presence of a regulatory environment that promotes this culture and patient&#x02013;community engagement.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2333392816662581" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2333392816662581" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> These 2 factors were largely missing in this pilot, therefore, the study only speculated on the effect of their presence.</p></sec><sec id="section13-2333392816662581"><title>Limitations</title><p>Variance in data collection resulted in dropping all facilities in Bauchi State during the baseline assessment stage because of security issues in the state. In addition, a period of 9 months may not be sufficient to effectively observe sustained quality improvements but can provide information sufficient to demonstrate what is needed to improve quality of care at the primary care level in rural areas.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section14-2333392816662581"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the pilot phase of the project met its objectives having demonstrated the potential of quality improvement in primary health-care facilities in rural Nigeria.</p><p>Despite the success within the short duration, we suggest that quality improvement needs to be a continuous cycle and requires an investment in people, processes, infrastructure, equipment, and materials, as well as periodic evaluations and feedback for sustainable improvement.</p><p>The main challenge for the SafeCare methodology, as for any quality improvement program or institution, is its long-term sustainability. Thus, we recommend a shift in focus toward building more local capacity to ensure local ownership and lower costs.</p><p>Lessons learnt from this pilot study showed that increased community engagement, as well as government support in the establishment of structures and processes, is required for improving quality of health care eventually leading to strengthening the health system.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2333392816662581"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> The program concept was developed by the World Bank and SURE P MCH/SOML team inclusive of David K Evans, Felipe Alexander Dunsch, Ezinne Eze-Ajoku and Mario Macis.
