In a pilot study (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 healthy adults), we showed that a meal containing a high antioxidant spice blend attenuated postprandial lipemia by 30% compared to a low spice meal. Our goal was to confirm this effect in a larger sample and to consider the influence of acute psychological stress on fat metabolism. Further, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> methods to evaluate the inhibitory effect of spices on digestive enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a 2 x 2, randomized, 4-period crossover design, we compared the effects of 14.5&#x000a0;g spices (black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, ginger, oregano, paprika, rosemary, and turmeric) vs. placebo incorporated into a high fat meal (1000&#x000a0;kcal, 45&#x000a0;g fat), followed by psychological stress (Trier Social Stress Test) vs. rest on postprandial metabolism in 20 healthy but overweight adults. Blood was sampled at baseline and at 105, 140, 180, and 210&#x000a0;minutes for analysis of triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. Additional <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses examined the effect of the spice blend and constituent spices on the activity of pancreatic lipase (PL) and secreted phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>). Mixed models were used to model the effects of spices and stress (SAS v9.3).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Serum triglycerides, glucose and insulin were elevated following the meal (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Spices reduced post-meal triglycerides by 31% when the meal was followed by the rest condition (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.048), but this effect was not present during stress. There was no effect of the spice blend on glucose or insulin; however, acute stress significantly increased both of these measures (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; mean increase of 47% and 19%, respectively).

In fact, ppTG concentrations (measured 4&#x000a0;hours post meal) are more strongly correlated with carotid intima-media thickness than fasting triglycerides or low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Elevated ppTG and ppG responses promote atherogenesis, in part, via increases in inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and the production of small dense LDL-C[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For this reason, dietary interventions that attenuate post meal spikes in triglycerides and glucose are clinically important for reducing CVD risk.</p><p>There is growing evidence that food-derived polyphenols (from cocoa, red wine, tea, and culinary spices) are protective against chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a pilot study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), we showed that adding a 14&#x000a0;g blend of commonly used spices (black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, ginger, oregano, paprika, rosemary, and turmeric) to a high fat, high carbohydrate meal reduced ppTG concentrations by 31% and insulin by 21% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This finding is especially interesting given that spices provide very few calories and are relatively easy to incorporate into common foods. However, replication of this finding is important, given the small sample size of the pilot study. In addition, a recent study testing a similar spice blend showed no effect on ppTG in adults with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy of a culinary spice blend to blunt ppTG following a high fat meal in healthy, but overweight/obese adults.</p><p>We also considered the contribution of acute psychological stress to the metabolism of a high fat meal, in the presence and absence of spices. We have previously shown that exposure to brief psychological stressors, presented under controlled, laboratory conditions, blunts the clearance of triglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Others have found that acute stress increases blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], likely a function of enhanced insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and that greater number of prior day stressors is associated with reduced post meal fat oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We addressed these aims using a 2 x 2 design in which high fat, high carbohydrate meals were presented with and without spices, and in the presence and absence of laboratory stress tasks.</p><p>Finally, we conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to explore digestive enzyme inhibition as a potential mechanism of action for the spice blend. Dietary polyphenols are found in the blood only in trace amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and there is growing evidence that their beneficial effects on postprandial metabolism take place in the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, we tested whether the spice blend, or its component spices, had a measurable, inhibitory effect against enzymes critical for fat digestion in the small intestine (pancreatic lipase [PL] and phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> [PLA<sub>2</sub>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized, controlled, 4-period crossover study with at least one week separating testing sessions. Participants were randomized to the following conditions, presented in counterbalanced order: 1) spice meal&#x02009;+&#x02009;rest, 2) spice meal&#x02009;+&#x02009;stress, 3) control meal&#x02009;+&#x02009;rest, and 4) control meal&#x02009;+&#x02009;stress. A computer generated randomization scheme was developed in advance for the four treatment conditions. The randomization scheme used a balanced block size of 4 to ensure even distribution among groups. Eligible participants were assigned to treatments at the baseline visit by the study coordinator. Due to the nature of the treatment conditions (e.g. spice and stress), blinding of the individual collecting blood samples was not possible. Statistical analyses were conducted without knowledge of treatment assignment for each individual. Participants were not informed in advance of the visit whether they would have a &#x0201c;stress&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;rest&#x0201d; visit, and identical environmental conditions were used prior to the stress/rest period. Samples were labeled only with subject id, period, and time point identifiers, such that outcomes assessment was blinded. Premenopausal women (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) were scheduled during the first 7&#x000a0;days of the menstrual cycle. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Pennsylvania State University and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy but overweight or obese men and women completed this study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 women). Inclusion was limited to those who were aged 30&#x02013;65 y, free from any serious illness (including any inflammatory conditions, liver or kidney dysfunction, a history of heart disease), had body mass index of 25&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, resting blood pressure (BP)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;160/100&#x000a0;mmHg (if BP was &#x02265;140/90, approval for study participation was requested from the participant&#x02019;s physician), fasting glucose &#x0003c;126&#x000a0;mg/dL, and willingness to discontinue all dietary supplements during the study. Additionally, potential participants were excluded if they used tobacco products, were training for athletic competition (&#x0003e;2&#x000a0;h aerobic activity a week), or used medications relating to birth control, hormone replacement therapy, lipid lowering, BP lowering, and psychosis or depression, with the exception of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p><p>Interested individuals (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;118) were screened by phone after answering advertisements from community bulletin boards and email lists. Thirty-one met the initial criteria and were scheduled for a clinic screening; 2 cancelled their visits therefore only 29 were screened in the clinic. At the screening visit, inclusion criteria were checked via blood sampling for a complete blood count and chemistry panel, measurements of weight and height, and BP assessment according to JNC 7 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Twenty-four individuals passed the clinic screening and were approved to participate but only 22 started the study. Two participants were withdrawn during the study due to exceeding limits for BP (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) and emotional response to the stress task (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). Thus, data are reported for 20 healthy participants, including 6 women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedures</title><p>In the 48&#x000a0;hours prior to each testing session, participants consumed one meal per day (provided) which matched their treatment assignment for the laboratory session (e.g. a meal containing spices was consumed vs. a meal without spices&#x02009;+&#x02009;placebo capsules). Because of the distinctive flavors in the spice meal, true blinding of the participants was not possible. Instead, participants were told that the purpose of the study was to compare the effects of antioxidants provided in meals vs. antioxidants provided in capsules. The placebo capsules provided with the control meal contained only crystalline methylcellulose, a commonly used placebo. Participants were asked to avoid foods containing antioxidants in the 48&#x000a0;hours prior to visits, and a list of such foods was provided. Participants self-reported compliance with food restrictions on the morning of each visit. Participants also fasted overnight and consumed a standardized, low antioxidant breakfast (white bagel and nonfat spread were provided) approximately 3&#x000a0;hours prior to arrival at the clinic and 4&#x000a0;hours prior to the baseline blood draw and test meal. Following intravenous (IV) catheter insertion and the baseline blood sample, participants were given 30&#x000a0;minutes in which to consume the test meal followed by a stress or rest condition. The second blood sample was collected via the IV catheter approximately 75&#x000a0;minutes after the test meal was completed (105&#x000a0;minutes after the fasted baseline blood draw). Additional blood samples were collected at 140, 180 and 210&#x000a0;minutes after the baseline blood draw.

The test meal was designed to include large doses of fat (~43&#x000a0;g) and carbohydrates (~98&#x000a0;g) which are known to cause substantial postprandial changes in glucose, insulin and triglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Additional specifics about the fatty acid composition of the meal can be viewed in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. The control meal was prepared without spices, and placebo capsules were consumed with the meal. The spice blend (14.5&#x000a0;g/meal) was incorporated into the various meal items (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The spices were donated by the Characterized Samples Program at the McCormick Science Institute (Hunt Valley, MD). Spices were weighed with a balance accurate to 0.01&#x000a0;g (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH). The palatability of this blend was previously tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Subjects listened to gentle music during a 20&#x000a0;min rest period which preceded the stressors and a 10&#x000a0;min recovery which followed them. To prevent habituation, the topic for the speech task and the numbers for the serial subtraction were changed for the second stress visit. BP and HR were monitored repeatedly throughout each task using a standard BP cuff (Dinamap Pro 100 oscillometric monitor, GE Medical Systems).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>Whole blood was transferred into serum separator tubes, allowed to clot, and centrifuged.

HDL-C was estimated according to the modified heparin-manganese procedure (CV&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2%). LDL-C was not interpreted because calculated LDL-C is not accurate in the presence of ppTG. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay using <sup>125</sup>I-labeled human insulin and a human insulin antiserum (Quest Diagnostics).

The organic solvent was removed under vacuum and the remaining aqueous phase was freeze-dried. Lipase from porcine pancreas (PL, type II) and 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (4-NPB, 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

However, a sample size of 20 was recruited to provide additional power to observe differences between the stress and rest conditions. The mixed models procedure (PROC MIXED, SAS v9.3, Cary, NC) was used to test the fixed effects of treatment (spice or placebo), condition (stress or rest testing session), task (baseline, speech preparation, speech task, math and recovery) and their interaction. Metabolic endpoints were analyzed as change from baseline (value minus baseline value) with doubly repeated measures models using unstructured and compound symmetric covariance structures for time points and visits, respectively. BP and HR were modeled with subject treated as a random effect. Data were tested for normality and glucose was transformed by square root to achieve normality. Least-squares means and standard errors are reported. Model selection was based on optimizing fit statistics (evaluated as lowest Bayesian Information Criterion). Baseline values were included as covariates in these models. The last three hemodynamic measurements of the resting and recovery periods were averaged. For the speech preparation, speech delivery, and math tasks, measurements were taken every minute and averaged by task. Stress analysis was completed for N&#x02009;=&#x02009;19, as one participant found the procedure to be too aversive. For <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition experiments, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was determined as the extract concentration which inhibited enzyme activity by 50%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Participants were normotensive and free of chronic disease, although they were overweight/obese and had moderate hyperlipidemia (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

However, this pattern was only evident when the postmeal period involved an extended rest period. When participants engaged in a 25&#x000a0;min long battery of performance-based, standardized, stressor tasks during the postmeal period, this beneficial effect of spices was not evident. We have previously demonstrated the triglyceride lowering effect of spices in a small pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], while others found no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This latter, null finding was likely due to the minor postprandial change in triglycerides induced by the test meal that contained ~25&#x000a0;g of fat. The 43 and 50&#x000a0;g fat meal challenges used in our protocols provided a magnitude of change large enough for differences to be ascertained. An ~50&#x000a0;g fat dose is recommended for clinical trials evaluating ppTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and it is ecologically valid, considering the pervasiveness of high fat meals in Western diets. Notably, we did not replicate an earlier finding from our pilot study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, males only), in which a very similar spice blend attenuated insulin levels by ~21% in the postprandial period.</p><p>To explore the mechanism for ppTG lowering, we examined the inhibitory effects of the spice blend and the component spices against two intestinal digestive enzymes that are important for fat metabolism, pancreatic lipase (PL) and phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>). In concert, the spices inhibited 50% of enzymatic activity at concentrations of less than or equal to 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL. Cinnamon was the most potent inhibitor of both enzymes, inhibiting the activity of both by 50% at concentrations less than 8.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL. Turmeric and cloves were also potent inhibitors of both enzymes. These results suggest that inhibition of enzymes required for lipid absorption, resulting in reduced chylomicron release into circulation, may be at least one mechanism by which the spice blend reduced post meal triglycerides.</p><p>The polyphenolic constituents of other food products, such as cocoa, have been shown to inhibit lipase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], thus the <italic>in vitro</italic> lipase inhibition produced by the spice blend may be due to its high polyphenol content. The component spices in the blend may also have interacted additively or synergistically <italic>in vivo</italic> to produce the effect observed. For example, although we found that black pepper had little inhibitory activity against PL or PLA<sub>2</sub><italic>in vitro</italic>, it is known to slow gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, black pepper may have prolonged the residence time of the more inhibitory spices (eg. cinnamon, cloves, turmeric) in the upper GI tract and provided prolonged time for inhibition. Alternatively, flavonoid and polyphenolic compounds (large amounts of which are present in the spice blend) have been shown to reduce chylomicron formation in human intestinal cells via reduced intracellular cholesterol synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This observation suggests that these compounds may also down regulate chylomicron synthesis independent of enzyme inhibition and fat absorption.</p><p>As expected, exposure to acute social stress increased BP and HR. It also increased post meal glucose and insulin and prevented the triglyceride lowering effect of the spices. Although acute psychological stress has long been known to interfere with triglyceride clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and increase ppTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], these data are the first to suggest that acute stress reverses some of the beneficial effects of dietary polyphenols on lipid metabolism. Lipolysis and subsequent triglyceride synthesis are promoted via glucocorticoid receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], suggesting a mechanism through which stress-induced cortisol release could impact triglyceride response. Future research is required to identify the underlying mechanism(s) that mediate this effect.</p><p>Stress induced increases in postprandial glucose have been previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], however these are the first data to show this effect in the absence of disorders known to influence either glucose concentrations (diabetes) or stress reactivity (post-traumatic stress disorder). We observed dramatic elevations in glucose (47%) following stress vs rest with lesser increases in insulin response (19%). This finding supports the theory that stress diminishes peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin, blunting the uptake of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Clinicians should be aware of the influence of stress on glucose levels which could be particularly relevant to diagnostic oral glucose tolerance testing for diabetes mellitus.</p><p>It is interesting that HR was higher during the stress tasks (but not at rest or recovery) when the spice meal was consumed. This increase was not anticipated, and given its observation only during the stressful tasks, it is difficult to interpret. Increased sympathetic activity, which results in increased HR, is the major pathway for food induced augmentation of energy expenditure or thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Like the well-studied capsaicin compound from hot peppers, constituents of ginger, black pepper and garlic (all contained in the spice blend) stimulate catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Others have postulated a thermogenic effect of pungent spices, and ginger has previously been implicated as a thermogenic augmenter in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], however, not consistently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This study is the first of which we are aware to demonstrate increased sympathetic activity in humans following a blend of these spices.</p><p>The 2x2 design of this study provides insight into both the individual effects of stress and spices on postprandial metabolism and also their interactive effect. Unfortunately, true blinding was not possible given the strong flavors and vivid coloring present in the spiced meal and the obvious designation of stress or rest. However, statistical analyses were conducted in a blinded fashion and participants were not informed prior to study visits which conditions they would be experiencing on a given test day. While the sample was reflective of a common phenotype in the United States (overweight but disease free), the study was not powered to explore differences by sex, genetic makeup or lifestyle differences&#x02014;all of which are known to influence postprandial metabolism on some level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Post meal triglycerides are an important indicator of cardiovascular risk and a potential target for therapeutic intervention. We have shown that the post meal triglyceride response can be blunted by the inclusion of a culinary spice blend in a high fat meal. Further, we have shown data that support an inhibitory role of spices against enzymes responsible for lipid digestion in the small intestine. These data suggest that the regular inclusion of spices in the diet may help attenuate the effect of large fat loads on cardiovascular risk. However, the impact of psychological stress negates any influence of the spice blend on triglycerides, and further, increases blood glucose and insulin. These findings suggest that stress management may be a more potent intervention for cardiovascular risk management than inclusion of spices. Nevertheless, spices do beneficially affect the postprandial TG response when stress is not an underlying pretense. Finally, the complex interactions between stress and meal type provide further evidence that the frequent daily occurrences of meal times and sympathetic arousal need to be studied in concert.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12967_2014_360_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Macronutrient and fatty acid profile of the control meal.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p>Cindy E McCrea and Sheila G West contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>SGW has received research and travel support and an honorarium from the McCormick Science Institute (Hunt Valley, MD).
