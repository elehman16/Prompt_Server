Preventing PTSD is a major humanitarian and public health challenge <xref rid="pone.0070084-Medicine1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that early, trauma-focused, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces the prevalence of chronic PTSD among survivors with acute PTSD (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0070084-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070084-Bryant2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>).

Subsequent meta-analyses of risk factors for PTSD <xref rid="pone.0070084-Brewin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-Ozer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> are based on that approach. Central tendency statistics assess groups as a whole by examining change to their arithmetic mean over time. Their use implies that the mean (and dispersion around the mean) accurately and parsimoniously describes the sample studied and its reference population.</p><p>When multiple latent sub-populations are present, however, the progression of the mean does not provide an accurate picture <xref rid="pone.0070084-GalatzerLevy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-Ursano1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, in which case exploring heterogeneities of symptoms' progression better discerns underlying &#x02018;longitudinal&#x02019; phenotypes. Uncovering these phenotypes may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of PTSD and its early prevention.</p><p>Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) uses maximum-likelihood estimation to uncover discrete longitudinal mixture distributions and identify latent subpopulations, or classes. Predictors of those classes, as well as the rates of change over time, can be modeled within the same framework. Studies using LGMM-based techniques to model latent subpopulations by their symptom severity have identified common patterns of response to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and predictors of these patterns <xref rid="pone.0070084-GalatzerLevy2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070084-GalatzerLevy3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

In this study, the CAPS was administered during clinical assessments only, and thus was not useful as a measure of symptom trajectories. We use it to evaluate the concurrent validity of the PTSD Symptom Scale (below).</p><p>
<italic><underline>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV</underline></italic> (SCID) <xref rid="pone.0070084-First1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> is a widely used structured clinical interview for evaluating the presence of DSM-IV symptoms and diagnostic status. In this study, the SCID was administered during the clinical assessments only. We utilized this scale to examine the prevalence of anxiety disorders and Major Depressive Disorder current and lifetime diagnoses broadly in this sample and as they relate to individuals who fall into the modeled trajectories. Because the entire sample did not receive a clinical interview, however, this data is only presented on the subset that did.</p><p>
<italic><underline>The PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS)</underline></italic> quantified PTSD symptoms at all time-points. The PSS is a structured, diagnostic instrument that follows DSM-IV 17 PTSD symptom criteria <xref rid="pone.0070084-Foa3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The PSS interviewer version (PSS-I; <xref rid="pone.0070084-Foa3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>) was used during telephone interviews, with items dichotomized into present vs. absent statements about each PTSD symptom criterion (score range: 1 to 17). The self-administered version of the PSS (PSS-SR; <xref rid="pone.0070084-Foa4" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>) was used during clinical assessments. This version uses a 1&#x02013;4 symptom severity score for each item. A score of two or more was considered an endorsement of the presence of a symptom (score range: 1 to 17). The PSS-SR total scores during the <italic>clinical interviews</italic> were highly correlated with concurrent CAPS total scores (at one month: <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.77, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001; at five months: <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.84, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001). Measurement equivalence between telephone-based PSS-I and clinically administered PSS-SR scales was established by examining the correlations between the proximal five months clinical interviews and seven months telephone interviews. The Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed a strong relationship between the scores (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.75, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001). Additionally, telephone-based PSS-I scores at seven months correlated significantly with the five months <italic>CAPS</italic> total score (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.76, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001). Based on this evidence of measurement equivalence, we conducted our analysis utilizing both PSS-I dichotomous scores and in-person PSS-R dichotomized symptom scores.</p><p>
<italic><underline>The Kessler-6 (K6)</underline></italic> is a brief 6-item self-report instrument that measures general distress. It was administered during telephone interviews. The K6 items are rated on a five-point scale from zero (&#x0201c;none of the time&#x0201d;) to four (&#x0201c;all of the time&#x0201d;), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 24. The K6 strongly discriminates between community cases and non-cases of DSM-IV/SCID disorders with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.87&#x02013;0.88 for all disorders with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores of 0&#x02013;70 and 0.95&#x02013;0.96 when disorders had GAF scores of 0&#x02013;50 <xref rid="pone.0070084-Kessler4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>

Among 957 who were followed 125 (13.1%) received efficacious CBT and we tested the relationship between receiving treatment and the identified trajectories.</p><p>We identified three latent classes of symptom change: A large class characterized by a precipitous drop in symptoms from one to five month (Rapid Remitting, 56%), a class characterized by a slow linear decline of symptoms over 15 months (Slow Remitting, 27%) and a class characterized by a failure to remit and no reduction in symptoms (Non-remitting, 17%).</p><p>We also examined demographic and symptom levels at 10-days as predictors of symptom trajectory classes and found that the Non-remitting class was predictable by older age, higher levels of initial hyperarousal symptoms and, less consistently, elevated avoidance symptoms. Testing the robustness of these and other putative predictors requires in-depth classifier analyses of this and other longitudinal.</p><p>Examining the relationship between receipt of treatment and the three classes we, firstly, found no evidence that receiving treatment affected class membership and secondly found that, within classes, treatment accelerated the rate of recovery in the <italic>Slow Remitting</italic> class alone and had no effect on the two other classes.</p><p>As such, these findings indicate the early CBT is effective &#x02013; or necessary - for a subset of symptomatic trauma survivors. The finding concerning unnecessary CBT for rapid remitters replicates a previous finding of our group <xref rid="pone.0070084-Shalev1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and other groups <xref rid="pone.0070084-Roberts2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, <italic>the occurrence of a non-remitting and treatment resistant group is a novelty</italic>. Importantly, in both non-remitting and rapid remitting groups, treatment was followed by an apparent improvement, but such improvement did not differ from the spontaneous recovery of those untreated within each group. The relatively small proportion of subjects in the non-remitting group emphasizes the contribution of the latent trajectory approach to discerning pertinent outcome groups within entire cohorts. These findings have broad relevance for understand the natural course of PTSD, the differential effects of treatment, and the heuristics of further discovery.</p><p>
<italic>Regarding the Natural Course of PTSD</italic>, our findings indicate that heterogeneities in individuals' symptom trajectories following trauma are not random events, but rather cluster into typical, minimally overlapping subsets. Our findings also suggest that the resulting subsets are highly informative with regard to the occurrence and the severity of chronic PTSD. These populations appear to be more informative and less error prone then the use of diagnostic status as an outcome. Firstly, we find the 91% of individuals who qualify for a PTSD diagnosis at 15-months fall into the <italic>Non-Remitting</italic> trajectory. Further, among those who meet PTSD criteria at 15 months those in the non remitting group have significantly higher symptom severity Differences in symptom severity at fifteen months suggest that individuals on the slow and rapid remitting group who still meet PTSD symptom criteria might be on their way to recovery.</p><p>Our work differs from previously reported studies (i.e. <xref rid="pone.0070084-Bonanno2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-deRoonCassini2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>) in that it does not include survivors without initial significant elevations in symptoms. As a previous analysis of these data has shown <xref rid="pone.0070084-Shalev1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-Hepp1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, such individuals are very unlikely to develop PTSD. The current results reflect, therefore, symptom trajectories among survivors at high risk &#x02013; rather than among entire cohorts of individuals exposed to potentially-traumatic events. In the context of the current study, we strove to identify heterogeneous responses among those who are initially highly symptomatic, to attempt to predict these sub-populations, and to examine the differential effects of treatment as it relates to these sub-populations.</p><p>From a <italic>treatment and prevention</italic> perspective, the finding of an <italic>unremitting and treatment-resistant</italic> trajectory is equally important. First, the majority of patients with chronic PTSD at 15 months (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;129 of n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;192; 67.2%) come from this small group. Second, symptom levels of those who remain with 15 months' PTSD in the non-remitting group are significantly and meaningfully higher than those of the other classes (30.1% higher than in the slow remitting group and 52.7% higher than the rapid remitting group), evoking the question of fundamental differences between the resulting conditions (e.g., potential for further recovery, neuro-cognitive underpinning). It is therefore important to further explore this group, in this and subsequent studies.</p><p>Looking at ways to predict this group, the non-remitting group in this work separated from the other groups as early as 10 days after the traumatic event (symptom levels and confidence intervals do not overlap). However, this post-hoc observation is not yet mature for clinical use as a predictor nor is it informative about underlying neuro-behavioral mechanisms. Attaching biographical information (e.g., prior trauma, childhood adversity) as well as neuropsychological, biological and recovery-environment factors to this trajectory may lead to better &#x02013; and specific - understanding of this catastrophic course of early PTSD symptoms.</p><p>The non-remitting group should also be amenable, as such, to longitudinal neuro-cognitive and neuro-imaging studies looking into putative changes in the ways the CNS transmutes an initial reaction into chronic, entrenched disturbance. Finding analogous trajectories in PTSD-related biomarkers would buttress this &#x02018;irreversible acquisition&#x02019; trajectory in biological findings. Recent and similar trajectories in animal models of conditioned fear provide encouraging evidence to the existence of such analogies <xref rid="pone.0070084-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-GalatzerLevy4" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Better understanding the dynamics of non-remission may hold a key for further discovery other mental disorders with identifiable onset and non-remitting course in a subset of patients.</p><p>Our unexpected finding of treatment (CBT) resistance in this group makes these patients eager candidates for other treatment approaches. However, <italic>even when effective</italic>, novel therapies for small proportion of survivors are unlikely to generate a significant signal in studies of entire affected groups. This highlights the importance of identifying pertinent subpopulations for assessing treatment effects: one treatment could be highly effective in the aggregate while ineffective for a minority &#x02013; and vice versa. Indeed, the use of LGMM has already revealed informative description of distinct courses of recovery in randomized clinical trials of depression, in which it differentiated the effects of treatment from that of natural recovery and placebo <xref rid="pone.0070084-GueorguievaR1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-Thase1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-Uher1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These efforts are in line with the emergence of trait-sanctioned therapies for medical conditions (e.g., receptor-specific therapies for breast cancer, multiple myeloma).</p><p>The <italic>slow remitting</italic> trajectory is similarly interesting. The unique effect of treatment on members of this cluster suggests a special sensitivity to the effects of CBT, and thus might allow a better allocation of patients to early treatment. It would be interesting as well to explore the reasons for such responsiveness via exploring membership in this trajectory class.</p><p>The finding of positive treatment effect in this otherwise progressively remitting class is also in line with a previous and very intriguing observation from epidemiological studies <xref rid="pone.0070084-Kessler3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, according to which early treatment (though studied retrospectively) accelerated recovery but did not reduce the overall burden of PTSD. Granted, accelerating recovery by months or years has profound clinical and personal implications. Nonetheless, the putative category of &#x02018;recover-able&#x02019; trauma survivors is extremely interesting to follow as it may optimally teach us about recovery mechanisms that may not exist in the other two groups, and how to engage them. Again &#x02013; studying recovery in entire cohorts may not be sensitive enough.</p><p>The finding of a <italic>rapidly remitting subgroup</italic> is in line with previous CBT studies, in which patients with less than full Acute PTSD symptoms recovered with or without treatment <xref rid="pone.0070084-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070084-Shalev1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Identifying who will follow this course has broad public health implications, as it could lead to the better allocating survivors to therapy and better use of treatment resources.</p><p>Further, our observation can inform the <italic>heuristics of uncovering the pathogenesis of PTSD</italic>. The finding of pertinent classes of symptom trajectories challenges the use of central tendency statistics to enhance discovery in the area of nascent PTSD. Central tendency statistics may collapse heterogeneous populations and obfuscate the identification of relevant subpopulations. To take advantage of the methodology presented here, future studies should collect multiple data points at timing and intervals that are critical for understanding the underlying problems, and with an eye towards imputation of missing cases (e.g., by collecting enriched initial assessments).</p><p>We found some indication that current depression differentiates trajectories. These data are limited, however, because full clinical assessments were not conducted on the entire cohort. This is potentially valuable information as it indicates that depression symptomatology in the acute phase may be predictive of chronic posttraumatic stress. This finding is consistent with other findings in the literature that have demonstrated that depression, in part, influences the development and maintenance of PTSD <xref rid="pone.0070084-King1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Finally, despite evaluating the same construct (PTSD symptoms) and establishing measurement equivalence, the use of different versions of the PSS at different time points should be seen as limitation of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work uncovered one of, possibly, several symptom trajectory scenarios in recent trauma survivors. Rape survivors, or victims of repeated or protracted violence, may have different longitudinal paths. This may also be true in deployed combatants, whose survival in a battlefield may require a suppression of initial symptoms, and result in their delayed emergence <xref rid="pone.0070084-Milliken1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Nonetheless the approach outlined here emphasized a robust methodology for uncovering systematic clustering patterns within response heterogeneities. Its ultimate challenge will be its ability to better inform clinical and biological studies of the pathogenesis of trauma and stress-related disorders and uncover robust predictors of symptoms persistence and chronicity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0070084-Kessler1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
