function of upper extremities and activities of daily living in patients with acute
stroke. [Methods] A total of 37 patients with acute stroke in intensive care units, were
assigned to the experimental group (n=19) and control group (n=18). The experimental group
performed passive range of motion exercise twice a day, for 4 weeks, immediately after a
pretest; the patients in the control group performed the range of motion exercise in the
same manner for 2 weeks beginning 2 weeks after the pretest. The functions of upper
extremities (edema, range of motion), manual function, and activities of daily living of
both groups were measured before and at four weeks after the intervention. [Results] The
experimental group showed a significant decrease in the edema of upper extremities
compared with the control group. It also showed a significant increase in the range of
motion, function of upper extremities, and the activities of daily living compared to the
control group. [Conclusion] Passive range of motion exercise in the early stage can
improve the function of upper extremities and activities of daily living in patients with
acute stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Range of motion</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability among persons
age over 70 in North America<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite the
advancement in medical technology and improved awareness of the general public of health
issues in South Korea, acute stroke reigned as the number two cause of death in 2011<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Over 90% of stroke survivors suffer various
impairments, such as clouded consciousness, hemiplegia, and declined sensation, depending on
the extent of damage in the brain and the cause<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>; 10% of stroke patients fully recover after the acute phase
treatment, 15&#x02013;20% die, and the remaining 70&#x02013;75% do not recover completely and live with
permanent hemiplegia<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegia caused
by acute stroke leads to stiffness, paralysis, weakened muscular strength, and consequently
reduced range of motion (ROM) and function of the upper extremities, negatively affecting
activities of daily living (ADL), such as eating, dressing, washing, and balancing<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Improving the functions of the upper extremities requires rehabilitation of not only
proximal functions but also minute functions, and in the case of hemiplegia, rehabilitation
of the affected side becomes even trickier due to over-reliance on the unaffected side and
complete neglect of the affected part<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakening of one of the upper extremities
induces physical pain, edema of upper extremities, and joint contracture that may limit ADL.
Therefore, an appropriate amount of therapeutic exercise and maintaining the correct
positioning are essential in improving ADL and functions of the upper extremities.</p><p>The most important factor in predicting recovery through remedial exercise is the initial
degree of paralysis. Relatively speaking, the recovery is easier in the initial stages of
the paralysis before the limiting paralysis symptoms occur, so partaking in remedial
exercise in the first 3&#x02013;4 days or at least within the first 7 days increases muscular
flexibility and lymph circulation and reduces edema<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. While the benefits of early
remedial exercise are clear, they are not widely applied because most patients hospitalized
in neurosciences intensive care units (NSICUs) are in critical conditions in which their
lives are threatened and are unable to express their symptoms with clarity themselves,
making it difficult for the medical professional to consider remedial options<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, acute stroke patients do not
start their remedial efforts until 10&#x02013;14 days after the stroke; however, earlier therapeutic
measures can minimize the amount of permanent impairments due to the stroke and the time
required for recovery and ultimately help more patients return to a normal life<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several therapeutic measures can be administered to improve the upper extremity functions
of stroke patients. Functional electrical stimulation requires specialized facilities
furnished with appropriate equipment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
and is difficult to perform on acute stroke patients who tend to be confined to their beds
in unstable conditions. Constraint-induced therapy can be applied to patients who are
conscious with some ability to move for 6 hours a day for 2 weeks and is focused on
improving the nerve functions around the affected area. It is problematic to administer in
the NSICU, and forced movement of the affected areas can cause the patients emotional
discomfort<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with the
previous options, ROM exercise does not require specialized equipment or the patient to be
conscious in order to participate, making them an appropriate remedial method for nurses to
apply in the NSICU even in the case of patients who have recently suffered a stroke. Yang et
al. (2006) reported about the effects of manual joint ROM exercise targeting affected areas
on alleviation of edema in the hands and stiffness of the upper extremities in acute stroke
patients. However, recent studies found that hemiplegic patients have impairments of
sensation and mobility even on their unaffected sides and that the activities of the
unaffected sides have an impact on the shrinkage of the affected area. Therefore,
application of therapeutic exercise to both sides of the upper extremities is important<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study aims to evaluate the effects of earlier passive ROM exercise administered in the
NSICU on the function of upper extremities and ADL in patients with acute stroke and the
validity of such exercise as an appropriate nursing intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The following criteria were used to recruit participants diagnosed with acute stroke
within the previous 72 hours from among patients who were hospitalized in the NSICUs of
three university hospitals located in Seoul and Gyeong-gi Province, South Korea: below G3
in a muscle strength test; no existing conditions that would disrupt medical treatment; no
amputations, disfigurements, external wounds, or other deformations with regard to either
upper extremity; and patient or guardian consented to the patient&#x02019;s participation in the
study. Subjects chosen based on the criteria above were assigned to either the control or
experimental group through a random coin toss. Power analysis was performed to detect the
likelihood that the study would yield a significant effect. In total, 18 participants for
each group were needed to detect the average difference between the two groups with an
effect size of 0.50, alpha set at 0.05, and power of the test at 0.80<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The projected dropout rate was set at 30%, considering
factors such as average length of stay in the neurosurgical intensive care unit and
transfers to other hospitals, and for the initial stage of the study, 25 participants for
the experimental group and 26 for the control group were recruited. At the end, the study
group consisted of 37 participants in total, with 19 in the experimental group and 18 in
the control group. There was no significant difference in general characteristics or
symptoms relating to the disease between the groups (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Characteristics</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp (n=19)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cont (n=18)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000b1;SD or N</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000b1;SD or N</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.2&#x000b1;14.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.0&#x000b1;16.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (Male/ Female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glasgow Coma Scale score</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.3&#x000b1;3.0 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.3&#x000b1;3.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis (Hemorrhage/ infarction)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected extremities (Right/ Left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected lesion<sup>*</sup> (RtCb/Lt Cb/Cbll)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/11/1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/8/1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMT (affected)<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8&#x000b1;3.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0&#x000b1;6.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 0 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 1 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 2 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 3 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMT (unaffected)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.7&#x000b1;4.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.4&#x000b1;1.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 4 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Brunnstrom recovery stage</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1&#x000b1;10.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3&#x000b1;5.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Exp=Experimental group, Cont=Control group, MMT=Manual Muscle Test, Cb=Cerebral,

researcher with 12&#x02005;years of experience in an NSICU based on a related study<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> and expert advice and were then reviewed
and validated by a professor of rehabilitative medicine, a professor of nursing, and a
physical therapist. In order to minimize the study&#x02019;s margin of error, the researcher and
one assistant learned the ROM exercise routines and adjusted each move to a level
comfortable for patients through clinical trials before beginning the study. The patients
in the experimental group performed the passive ROM exercise twice a day &#x02212; once in the
morning and once at evening &#x02212; 5 days per week for 4 weeks; for each of these
15-minute-long sessions, each move of the exercise routine was repeated 10 times. The
duration of each session was determined based on Suh&#x02019;s (1999) 4-week study on exercise
that improved flexibility and stability of body posture<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise routine was sequenced in a way that the active
upper extremities were worked out before the paralyzed side, and consisted of: shoulder
joint exercise (forward and side elevation of the upper extremities, internal and external
rotation of the shoulder) elbow exercise (bending and extending), wrist exercise (flexion,
extension, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation), and finger exercise (flexion and
extension)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The control group
followed the existing remedial guidelines and partook in the ROM exercise following the
same procedure as the experimental group 2 weeks after their diagnosis. The range of
movement for the exercise was limited to the point of joint resistance for patients who
were unconscious, and within the range of comfort for patients who were conscious.</p><p>A tape measure was used to measure upper extremity edema; the circumference of the index
finger, wrist, and elbow on both sides was measured twice (in&#x02005;mm) and then averaged<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Only the ROM of the paralyzed upper
extremities was measured, as the unaffected side demonstrated a normal ROM. The angle of
flexion, extension abduction, pronation, and supination of the shoulder; the flexion,
pronation, and supination of the elbow; and the flexion, extension, radial deviation, and
ulnar deviation of the wrist were measured. For measuring the ROM, a plastic goniometer
(Koreametics, 2007) was used. In an anatomically neutral position, the angle of each joint
was measured twice(&#x000b0;), and the values were then averaged<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The manual function test (MFT) was performed using a measuring
procedure especially designed for evaluating MFT. The procedure consisted of 4 moves from
the exercise routine mentioned above (front and side elevation of the upper extremities,
touching of the occiput with the palm, and touching of the dorsum with the palm), 2
verification categories (holding and grasping), and 2 categories testing for the level of
control over the fingers (moving a cube and the pegboard test). Under these categories
were 32 subtests, and one point was given for each subtest performed by the patient for a
total of 32 points. The final score was multiplied by 3.125 to convert it to a score out
of 100 points and designated the MFT score<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reliability was expressed by Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of 0.94.</p><p>From the procedure for evaluating the functional capacity of a patient in rehabilitation,
developed by Granger, Cotter, Hamilton, Fielder, and Hans (1990) and adapted by Park and
Sohng (2005), 6 categories for self-care for an acute stroke patient were used to measure
the ADL<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Included in the self-care categories were eating, personal
hygiene, bathing, dressing oneself (top and bottom), and using the toilet, with scores
ranging from 7 to 42. Higher score indicated higher level of independence, and the
reliability of the measure was good, with a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of 0.95.</p><p>The present study meets the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (1975,
revised 1983) and received Institutional Review Board approval from C University
hospitals, located in three different locations in Seoul and Gyoeng-gi Province, South
Korea. The study took place between 4 November 2007 and 31 August 2008. Pretest
measurements of general characteristics, remedial stage, and the level of upper extremity
functions for both groups of participants were performed by Research Assistant A, who was
not aware of which group the participants belonged to. Research Assistant B, who did not
have any knowledge of the pretest measurements, administered the ROM exercise to the
experimental group, which included patients with mobile upper extremities to those that
were paralyzed, in the order of the shoulders, elbows, wrists, and fingers. Without giving
any information about the rest of the study, the same treatment was given to the control
group 2 weeks later. Research Assistant A measured the level of upper extremity function
(upper extremity edema, ROM, acute stroke upper extremity function) and ADL of both groups
2 and 4 weeks after the initial test. To be able to continue with the exercise after the
study without the researcher&#x02019;s supervision, patients and their guardians were provided
with training on how to conduct the ROM exercise, and were given brochures and video clips
for reference.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed using the SAS V 8.2 software. Pretest general
characteristics, disease-related attributes, level of upper extremity functions (upper
extremity edema, articular ROM), acute stroke upper extremity functions, and ADL were
tabulated into frequencies, percentages, averages, and standard deviation. In order to
ensure homogeneity, consecutive data were tested for normality using the t-test or
Wilcoxon signed-rank test; the x<sup>2</sup>-test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used for
used for discrete data. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate the pre- and posttest
differences of the two groups, and posttest validation was done by Bonferroni test. ANCOVA
was used for shoulder flexion, extension, and ulnar deviation when there were pretest
differences between the two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>For the experimental group, the circumference of the finger on the affected side decreased,

<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study investigated the effects
of bilateral passive ROM exercise on the level of upper extremity function and ADL based on
exercise routines that could be administered by a nurse to an acute stroke patient in the
NSICU independent from the constraints of time, place, available equipment, or the
consciousness of the patient; 15-minute exercise routines were performed twice a day, 5
times a week, for 4 weeks<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke is a general term that refers to cerebrovascular diseases caused by irregular supply
of blood to the brain, and most stroke patients experience paralysis, especially in the
upper extremities<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Poststroke
neurological recovery normally takes place in the first month, and functional recovery
progresses at a slower pace, occurring between 6 and 12 months after the stroke event<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, although full recovery of the affected
upper extremities is often a challenge due laxity or stiffness, as well as reduced
rotational capacity of the torso, which limits the mobility of other body parts or induces
pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most important factor in
predicting a stroke patient&#x02019;s recovery is the degree of initial paralysis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and quick application of remedial measures
is essential in ensuring the minimum amount of functional impairments for the patient and
ultimately achieving recovery<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
severe and unstable conditions of the patients who enter the NSICU require intensive and
collaborative care from various clinical departments, and introducing remedial treatments in
the early stage of a stroke has been a challenge.</p><p>In this study, applying ROM exercise to immobile stroke patients in the experimental group,
who were vulnerable to increased edema due to limited blood and lymph circulation, within 72
hours of their diagnosis resulted in a reduced level of edema as measured at 2 and 4 weeks.
On the other hand, patients in the control group who started remedial exercise 2 weeks after
their diagnosis showed a higher level of edema, which stayed in the high range even after
the remedial exercise. This suggests the effectiveness of applying ROM exercise immediately
after acute stroke diagnosis. This study observed that the circumference of the fingers
decreased over the course of 4 weeks, which was longer than the 2-week duration used in a
previous study by Tang et al. (2006) that proved ROM exercise to be effective, and so we
recommend that the ROM exercise be continued for 4 weeks for more impact. According to the
results of this study, the circumferences of the fingers, wrist, and elbow on the unaffected
side in the experimental group patients decreased consistently, while those in the control
group showed significant decreases in the second half of the study period, between weeks 2
and 4. Taking into consideration a previous study that concluded cerebrum lesions can affect
the same side of the body, this indicates that not conducting exercise on the unaffected
side affects the severity of edema<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The ROM of the affected shoulder as measured by flexion, extension, abduction, pronation,
and supination increased at 2 weeks in the experimental group, while the control group
demonstrated no change. Further improvements were shown in the following 2 weeks between
weeks 2 and 4 in the experimental group, while the control group showed some improvements in
flexion, abduction, pronation, and supination but no change in extension. The experimental
group showed significant improvements in the affected elbow&#x02019;s flexion, extension, and
supination, as well as in the flexion, extension, and ulnar and radial deviation of the
affected wrist; the control group showed no difference between the pre- and post-test
values. The ROM for the elbow and the wrist in the experimental group improved over the
course of 4 weeks, while those in the control group started improving at 2 weeks. This
suggests the necessity to start the ROM exercise early in the NSICU. Because the flexion of
the shoulder and movements, such as shrugging, affect the recovery of manual functions<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, a reduced range of supination increases
the amount of shoulder pain. The increased stiffness of internal and external rotation
reduces the ROM<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the increased ROM
due to the ROM exercise as demonstrated in this study is clinically significant.</p><p>The function of the upper extremities improved noticeably in the experimental group
compared with the control group, and the difference was noted through the frontal elevation
of the upper extremities. However, other categories helpful in understanding the functional
recovery of the hand were either difficult to measure or showed no change. Based on the
proximal-distal theory, which states that mobility of the arm enabled by adjustment of the
shoulders leads to functional improvement of the elbow, wrist, and fingers<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, consistent remedial exercise over a
longer period of time and observation are needed. Because losing the function of the upper
extremities affects the protection reaction and posture, and the older population in
particular relies heavily on their upper extremities for balancing, recovery of the
functional capabilities of the upper extremities is extremely important<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The self-care skills observed in this study, especially eating and dressing oneself (top),
showed significant improvement in the experimental group compared with the control group,
confirming the results of a precedent study<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> that concluded that early-stage remedial exercise were effective in
improving ADL. ADL of an acute patient with hemiplegia demands a lot from the unaffected
side, and improving the functions of both sides through exercise contributes greatly to
improving the patient&#x02019;s quality of life. The participants of this particular study showed
low scores for ADL, owing to the fact that acute stroke patients with hemiplegia tend to
rely on those around them for ADL at least partially if not entirely. This causes economic
and emotional stress in those close to the acute stroke patients, which could be relieved by
improving the patient&#x02019;s upper extremity functions so that they can return to their daily
lives.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gladstone</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Hakim</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Toward wisdom from failure: lessons from neuroprotective
