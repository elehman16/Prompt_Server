We performed a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial of 2&#x02005;g mesalazine twice daily versus placebo for 3&#x02005;months in patients with Rome III criteria IBS-D. Primary outcome was daily average stool frequency during weeks 11&#x02013;12; secondary outcomes were abdominal pain, stool consistency, urgency and satisfactory relief of IBS symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were randomised after a 2-week baseline stool diary.

This chronic condition also impacts on patients&#x02019; quality of life and their performance at work and home.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The diarrhoea subtype particularly impairs quality of life by limiting patients&#x02019; diet and the ability to travel or eat out.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Around two-thirds of patients with IBS show anxiety or depression and multiple somatic symptoms,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> but how much is cause and how much is effect of the distressing symptoms remains unclear and likely varies from case to case. IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) may develop after inflammation due to bacterial gastroenteritis (postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS))<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in whom the immune response can be prolonged.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Recent studies have also shown &#x02018;immune activation&#x02019; in the mucosa of patients with IBS-D without an infectious origin. Increased numbers of mast cells and release of mast cell mediators such as mast cell tryptase, serotonin and histamine have been reported in some<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> but not all series.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Other immune cells such as T lymphocytes and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) containing enterochromaffin cells have been reported as increased in PI-IBS.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Numerous recent studies have suggested impaired mucosal barrier in IBS,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which by allowing access of luminal bacterial products to the mucosal immunocytes might cause immune activation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These studies suggested that an anti-inflammatory treatment might be beneficial, an idea that has been supported by some small pilot studies that appeared to show improvement in abdominal pain, stool frequency and consistency, especially in patients with PI-IBS.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> One study showed a reduction of mast cells following treatment of mesalazine in 10 unselected patients with IBS,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> but like the other studies, it was too small to be sure of its significance. Our aim was therefore to assess the effect of mesalazine as a treatment for IBS-D and to also assess its impact on mast cell numbers and mediator release in an attempt to predict treatment response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a multicentre, two-arm, parallel group, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial comparing mesalazine with placebo in patients with IBS-D. Eligible participants were randomised to receive either mesalazine or placebo 2&#x02005;g once a day for a week, and if they tolerated the dose, it was increased to 2&#x02005;g twice a day for 11&#x02005;weeks. There were four visits altogether (weeks &#x02212;2, 0, 6 and 12) and telephone visits in between (weeks 1, 3 and 9) to ensure tolerance and compliance with medication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2015309122F1">figure 1</xref>). Participants were required to complete weekly stool diaries for 12&#x02005;weeks. We collected stool and sigmoid biopsy samples before and at the end of trial (EOT) to look for biomarkers, but for practical reasons this was only performed on those patients recruited in Nottingham. The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT01316718) and European Union clinical trials register with EudraCT number 2010-018340-14. Initial recruitment into this trial was slow, and it was felt that the eligibility criteria for IBS-D were too demanding. We therefore modified the eligibility criteria for IBS-D (see section &#x02018;Participants&#x02019;) following registration with the clinicaltrials.gov to reflect the fact that, as others have found, the bowel habit of patients with IBS-D is less abnormal than patients' recall suggests.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><fig id="GUTJNL2015309122F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design.

The participant, supervising doctor and/or study nurse were unaware of the treatment allocation. The randomisation was based on a computer-generated pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, created by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (NCTU) in accordance with their standard operating procedure and held on a secure server. Allocation was stratified by the recruiting centre. The supervising doctor or study nurse obtained a randomisation reference number for each participant by means of a remote, internet-based randomisation system developed and maintained by NCTU. The sequence and decode of treatment allocations were concealed until all interventions were assigned and recruitment, data collection and all other trial-related assessments were completed and study files locked. The NCTU Data Manager and the Nottingham University Hospitals Trust Trials pharmacy had access to the treatment allocation. All data collected were entered into a secured online database set up by NCTU.</p><p>A trial management group was set up to oversee the operational aspects of the trial. The group met regularly to review progress of the trial and address any urgent issues. The Data Monitoring and Ethics committee undertook the safety monitoring functions of the trial and provided recommendations to the trial steering committee over the course of the trial. A trial steering committee was set up to ensure the study was well executed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Our previous study on patients with IBS-D gave a mean stool frequency of 3.1 (SD 2.0). Tuteja and colleagues reported mesalazine decreasing stool frequency by 1.4 bowel movements per day.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study had 80% power to detect such an effect at the 1% two-sided &#x003b1; level.</p><p>Much smaller numbers were needed to assess the effect of mesalazine on mast cell numbers and tryptase release. Corinaldesi <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> reported a 36% decrease in mast cell numbers from mean 9.2 (SD 2.5), which requires just 16 patients in each group to show such a decrease with a power of 90% at the 5% &#x003b1; level. We therefore decided to assess the biopsies on patients recruited in Nottingham only in order to ensure uniform processing.</p><p>We aimed to randomise at least 125 patients to allow for 20% dropout rate, but owing to recruitment ongoing at multiple sites and patient requests, we actually recruited 136.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients with IBS-D were recruited from gastroenterology clinics at the Nottingham University Hospitals, seven other secondary care hospitals in the UK and via the Trent Primary Care Research Network from 1 April 2011 to 31 May 2013. The patients were required to meet the modified Rome III criteria for IBS-D,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> defined as a stool frequency of &#x02265;3/day for &#x0003e;2&#x02005;days/ week and &#x02265;25% of stools to be of type 5&#x02013;7 and &#x02264;25% type 1&#x02013;2 according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> as assessed from their screening stool diaries. The unmodified Rome III criteria require &#x02265;25% of stools to be of type 6&#x02013;7, but we found this excluded around one-third of otherwise typical patients who met Rome III criteria based on recall, hence the modification. To exclude other causes of diarrhoea, we required normal colonoscopy and colonic biopsies, normal full blood count, serum calcium and albumin, C-reactive protein and negative serological test for coeliac disease. Lactose intolerance was tested by asking patients to consume 568&#x02005;mL (1 pint) of milk after an overnight fast and performing a lactose breath hydrogen test if they developed pain or diarrhoeal symptoms within 3&#x02005;h. If the stools were watery and frequent, patients underwent a 7-day retention of selenium<sup>75</sup>-labelled homocholic acid taurine test or a trial of cholestyramine to exclude bile acid malabsorption. If any of these tests were positive, patients were excluded from the study. Most patients have continued to be followed up, and no new diagnoses have emerged. Other inclusion criterion was age 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years. Exclusion criteria were prior history of major abdominal surgery, liver or kidney impairment or chronic ingestion of any anti-inflammatory drugs or medications that could affect the gut motility. All childbearing female patients tested negative on the pregnancy test during the randomisation day and had to agree to adequate contraception during the trial. Patients who were on long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants were included if they were on a stable dose for 3&#x02005;months and willing to keep the dose unaltered throughout the trial. During the screening period of 2&#x02005;weeks, patients were only allowed a maximum of two doses of 4&#x02005;mg loperamide per week. Once randomised, patients were allowed to take loperamide to control their symptoms as we hypothesised that mesalazine would take at least six&#x02005;weeks to exert its effect on the gut, assuming that it acts by altering the immunocytes within the mucosa. However, during the last two&#x02005;weeks of the trial when the bowel movement endpoints were assessed, the patients were not allowed any loperamide or antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Investigational medical product</title><p>The mesalazine used for this study was a licensed slow release granule formulation of 2&#x02005;g (PENTASA, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) and a matching placebo granule formulation (QPharma AS, Sweden). In order to maintain blinding, active and placebo granules were packed in matching, unidentified, trial-specific foil sachets (Ferring Pharmaceuticals). Newcastle Specials at Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust carried out final labelling and release of blinded trial treatment packs. All sites involved had appropriate licences in place.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Data collection</title><p>Baseline demographics were collected at visit 1 (screening visit) including age, gender and ethnicity. Data for Hospital and Depression Scale<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> (HADS) and score from the Patient Healthy Questionnaire 15<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> (PHQ15) were collected at visit 2, after randomisation and at final visit 4 (EOT). We used a 7-day weekly stool diary throughout the trial to provide information on the stool form based on BSFS, abdominal pain severity, urgency of defecation and abdominal bloating. The latter three symptoms were scored between 0 (no symptom) and 10 (extremely severe).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Compliance</title><p>Compliance was defined a priori as taking &#x02265;75% of the medication throughout the 12&#x02005;weeks. Each patient was given two boxes of medication during the 12-week study, each box containing 100 sachets. The amount of medication taken was calculated from the number of medication sachets returned at EOT. Compliance with medication and baseline characteristics of compliers (defined as taking &#x0003e;75% of the medication throughout the 12&#x02005;weeks) and non-compliers were similar in both groups (see online supplementary table S5).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>The primary clinical outcome was stool frequency in the last two&#x02005;weeks of trial follow-up (weeks 11 and 12). Secondary outcomes were abdominal pain, urgency and stool consistency. These were averaged over the last two&#x02005;weeks of the trial follow-up. At the end of each week, patients were asked, &#x0201c;Have you had satisfactory relief of your IBS symptoms this week?&#x0201d;. Satisfactory relief of IBS symptoms at EOT was defined as answers to &#x02018;yes&#x02019; on both weeks 11 and 12 of stool diary. Information provided for &#x0003c;10 of 14&#x02005;days of stool diary was recorded as missing. All completed an assessment of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and multiple somatic symptoms were recorded using the Patient Health Questionnaire-12 Somatic Symptom Scale (PHQ12-SS).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Mechanistic outcomes</title><p>The primary mechanistic endpoint was to assess the mast cell numbers from the percentage area stained at week 12. The secondary endpoint was to assess mast cell activation in biopsy supernatants and to relate these to symptoms. Mast cell activation was defined as elevation of any mediator component including mast cell tryptase, chymase, carboxypeptidase A3 and/or histamine.</p></sec><sec id="s2h3"><title>Stool samples and sigmoid colon biopsies</title><p>These were collected at week 0 and EOT from patients recruited in Nottingham. Stools collected were analysed for calprotectin. A commercially available calprotectin ELISA kit (Buhlmann, Sch&#x000f6;nenbuch, Switzerland) was used for extraction and quantification of stool calprotectin. Normal range for stool calprotection is defined as &#x0003c;50&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/g.</p><p>Sigmoid biopsies were collected for immunohistochemistry for mast cell tryptase, CD3, CD68 and 5-HT. Tissues were processed and stained in the histopathology laboratory in Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, UK. While other cells were individually counted per mm<sup>2</sup> mast cell, numbers were assessed from the percentage area stained in the area of interest as this was felt to more accurately reflect mast cell activity by including mast cells, which were degranulating and hence indistinct. A further set of biopsies was maintained in culture, and supernatants collected were assayed for mast cell tryptase, chymase, carboxypeptidase A3 and histamine. The biopsy tissues were incubated immediately in Hanks&#x02019; medium at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 30&#x02005;min before storing at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until assays for mast cell mediators were performed by the Immunopharmacology Group at the University of Southampton.</p><p>See supplementary file for details of methods for immunohistochemical staining for mast cell tryptase, CD3, CD68 and 5-HT staining and measurement of mast cell mediator release.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analysis and presentation of data was in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidance, using Stata V.13. Balance between the trial arms at baseline was examined using appropriate descriptive statistics.</p><p>The general approach for between-group comparisons was to analyse participants according to allocation without imputation of missing data. The primary data set comprised participants with completed stool diary for at least 10&#x02005;days out of 14. We used a generalised linear mixed model to compare mesalazine group and placebo group for the primary outcome, with adjustment for the baseline value of the outcome, and study centre as a random effect. Additionally, we adjusted for any variables showing imbalance at baseline in secondary models. We compared the characteristics of participants who did and did not adhere to the study medication before estimating the treatment effect if the medication was actually taken using complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis. We investigated the effect of missing primary outcome data using multiple imputation. The secondary outcomes were assessed using similar models as for primary outcome, or logistic or Poisson regression as appropriate dependent on outcome type.</p><p>We conducted a number of prespecified subgroup analyses for each of the following three outcomes: (1) stool frequency during weeks 11&#x02013;12, (2) number of days with any stool consistency scoring 6 or 7 during weeks 11&#x02013;12 and (3) mean score of worst pain for each day averaged over weeks 11 and 12. We investigated whether there were any differences in between-group effects according to the following baseline variables: (1) anxiety, (2) stool frequency, (3) abdominal pain and (4) mast cell activation. These subgroup analyses were conducted by including appropriate interaction terms in the regression models, and as the study was not powered on the basis of detecting any such subgroup effects, these are considered exploratory and would require confirmation in future research.</p><p>The primary mechanistic hypothesis to be investigated was that treatment with mesalazine reduces inflammation, which in turn reduces clinical symptoms. The aim of this type of analysis is to estimate how much of any observed treatment effect can be attributed to a variable that is thought to be an intermediate on the causal pathway, or mediator. After summarising inflammatory markers at baseline and 11&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; follow-up by trial arm using appropriate descriptive statistics, we examined change in these markers (stool calprotectin, mast cell tryptase, mast cell percentage area stained) and change in stool frequency using scatterplots.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient flow</title><p>A total of 221 patients were screened for this trial, of whom 85 were excluded from the study and 136 were randomised 1:1 to receive either mesalazine or placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2015309122F2">figure 2</xref>). The commonest reasons for exclusion were (a) failure to meet the required severity of diarrhoea on the 2-week diary during the initial 2-week screening period and (b) patients not able to commit their time to the study due to the multiple visits to hospital. In total, 116 patients completed the study, of whom 115 (57 treatment and 58 control) had primary outcome data available.

We analysed the effect of mesalazine only after 12-weeks treatment as we felt that mesalazine was a disease-modifying treatment rather than symptomatic treatment and early reports suggested benefit was most obvious after 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Our study showed that mesalazine did not improve bowel frequency after 12-weeks treatment compared with placebo in unselected patients with IBS-D. As with other studies in IBS, we found a strong placebo effect on bowel symptoms and also on the total Hospital Anxiety and Depression and Somatic scores (PHQ12-SS), suggesting that patients felt better in general after taking part in the trial. We found no evidence that the improvement in HADS or PHQ12-SS correlated with changes in bowel habit, suggesting these are independent features and not causally related.</p><p>Despite lack of benefit in unselected patients, we had a preplanned subgroup analysis of the primary outcome of stool frequency in patients divided according to severity. This suggested that a group of patients who had the greatest bowel frequency did benefit from mesalazine. Our clinical findings seem consistent with another recent report.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> There was no significant improvement in other IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and stool consistency. There is strong evidence from our study that mesalazine treatment increases the number of days with urgency by about 20%. There have been previous case studies reported of mesalazine worsening diarrhoea in colitis.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This may represent an allergic response to the drug as we did find an increase in T lymphocytes.</p><p>Raised mast cell numbers in the gut mucosa have been implicated in all subtypes of IBS<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> but mainly in IBS-D. Mast cells contain many mediators including histamine, serotonin and proteases such as tryptase.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recently, there has been an interest in tryptase from both mast cells and endogenous pancreatic secretion<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> as it has been shown to activate proteinase-activated receptor 2, which is found on afferent nerves and can lead to increased sensitivity of bowel distension.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our study, the mast cell percentage area stained in patients with IBS-D was not elevated compared with those in our previously studied healthy subjects. We were not able to confirm the gender difference in mast cell count of patients with IBS-D previously described by others,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> nor did we find any gender effect on other immune cells such as CD3, CD68 and 5-HT containing enterochromaffin cells.</p><p>Similarly, the supernatant tryptase levels in patients with IBS-D were not significantly elevated compared with healthy control. Median (IQR) tryptase levels for IBS-D versus healthy control were 4.3 (1.8&#x02013;8.9) and 6.7 (3.8&#x02013;11.4) ng/mL, p=0.07. Surprisingly, supernatant histamine levels in our study were lower in patients with IBS-D compared with healthy control, being mean (SD), 0.7 (0.6) and 1.1 (0.8) ng/mL, respectively, p=0.02. There was no correlation between baseline tryptase/histamine/chymase/CPA3 with clinical symptoms. Supernatant levels of tryptase and histamine were not altered following treatment of mesalazine. We found no apparent association between mast cell percentage area stained and supernatant levels of the mast cell mediators examined whether those released by all mast cells (tryptase, histamine) or restricted to a subpopulation (chymase, carboxypeptidase A3). This suggests that the overall degree of mediator release from colonic mast cells is independent of mast cell numbers and factors other than mere numbers determine mediator release. We were not able to confirm either increased mast cell numbers nor increased mast cell tryptase release from biopsies as some<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Interestingly, the subgroup of patients (group A) who had raised calprotectin level (&#x0003e;100&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/g) have significantly less psychological distress than the group with stool calprotectin level &#x02264;100&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/g (group B). We speculate that in subgroup A symptoms are secondary to occult local gut inflammation while subgroup B's symptoms are driven primarily by distress, which causes gut symptoms secondarily. Unfortunately, numbers were too small to answer the question of whether subgroup A responded better to mesalazine. Stool calprotectin could therefore be used as a screening tool to allow more detailed studies of the mucosa in IBS-D in the future.</p><p>One uncontrolled study has suggested that mesalazine might be effective in treating patients with PI-IBS,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but the only randomised controlled trial of mesalazine in this condition was negative, though possibly underpowered.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In our post hoc analysis, a small subgroup fulfilling criteria for PI-IBS appeared to benefit from mesalazine, but our study was also underpowered. Interestingly, the study of the outbreak of enterohaemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O104:H4 infection in Germany suggests that mesalazine treatment substantially reduced the incidence of PI-IBS,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> which further supports this idea that a larger and more adequately powered study specifically focused on PI-IBS would be worthwhile.</p><p>Although mesalazine has been available to use for many decades with good safety profile, our adequately powered study has showed it does not help the majority of patients with IBS-D. The fact that certain subgroups might benefit emphasises that there is still a need for better phenotyping of this heterogeneous group of patients when evaluating new treatments.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite strict entry criteria, our population was still heterogeneous. In retrospect, we would have been better if we had stratified by postinfectious onset. We did consider this but felt that this would make the trial very difficult to recruit to. We could overcome this in future studies by having a great many more recruitment sites and screening around five times as many participants, given that PI-IBS accounts for only around 20% of all cases of IBS-D, but this would require more resources than we had available to us. It is worth noting that there is an appreciable loss to follow-up (15.5%) but not out of line with other similar IBS studies. Dropouts are mostly likely due to failure of treatment and so unlikely to account for our negative result.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Research recommendations</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Our data suggest that it is unlikely that future trials of mesalazine in unselected IBS would be fruitful.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If there is a subgroup that benefit, it is likely to be those with PI-IBS and a trial of such carefully selected patients would be worthwhile, particularly those with more severe diarrhoea.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Future work on the role of mast cells needs to better characterise the patients since the majority of unselected IBS do not have elevated mast cell numbers. It may be that as others have reported it is the number of activated mast cells that are important<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and better markers of activation would be useful rather than the current gold standard of electron microscopy, which is expensive, time consuming and prone to sampling error.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Finally, the release of mediators from biopsies does not link well to symptoms or mast cell numbers. The dominant factor for release is likely to be crushing and tissue injury by the biopsy process that is not well standardised and may overwhelm other factors that would be of more interest. We need a better way of assessing in vivo activity of the mucosal cells.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This randomised placebo-controlled trial in 115 unselected patients with IBS-D showed that mesalazine 4&#x02005;g/day was no better than placebo in relieving the symptoms of abdominal pain or disturbed bowel habit. However, contrary to the previous small study (n=10), mesalazine did not reduce mast cell percentage area stained. A small subgroup with PI-IBS appeared to benefit, but this requires a larger adequately powered study to confirm this finding.</p><p>Further phenotyping of the heterogeneous group of patients with IBS and diarrhoea is needed to allow better evaluation of new treatments</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2015-309122-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1241" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Special thanks to the Efficacy and Evaluation Mechanism (EME) programme for funding this study, Ferring Pharmaceuticals Limited for sponsoring the trial drug/placebo and the Immunopharmacology group and Laurie Lau from the University of Southampton for assisting in sample analysis.
