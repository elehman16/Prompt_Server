Participants: Eighty-eight screen-workers with early non-specific WRULD; six drop-outs. Interventions: A ten week postural exercise program versus regular physiotherapy.

Functional outcome: Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand- Dutch Language Version (DASH-DLV). Quality of life outcome: EQ-5D.</p><p>Economic measures: health care costs including patient and family costs and productivity costs resulting in societal costs.

No significant differences between the groups concerning effectiveness at one year follow-up were found. Effectiveness scores slightly improved over time. After one year 55% of participants were free of complaints. After one year the postural exercise group had higher mean total health care costs, but lower productivity costs compared to the physiotherapy group. Mean societal costs after one year (therefore) were in favor of postural exercise therapy [- &#x020ac;622; 95% CI -2087; +590)].

Due to expectations of increasing intensity of computer screen-work, the prevalence of WRULD among screen-workers is expected to increase even more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>WRULD can result in decreased productivity, increased medical consumption and consequently increased costs. A recent study estimates the total yearly costs due to specific and non-specific WRULD in the Netherlands at about 2.1 billion Euros, consisting of medical costs, costs due to decreased productivity, absenteeism related to WRULD and disability pensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>It can be assumed that WRULD is associated with a decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Of all WRULD complaints, it is estimated that specific disorders are responsible for about 13-37% of them. The majority concerns non-specific WRULD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In the Netherlands non-specific WRULD is treated within various medical and paramedical disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Postural exercise (PE) therapy according to Mensendieck/Cesar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and regular physiotherapy (RP) are two treatments in the Netherlands used for patients suffering from WRULD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Very little reliable research is available regarding the effectiveness of exercise and other treatments in non-specific WRULD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The same goes for cost-effectiveness studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in which the quality of life rarely was used as an outcome measure in musculoskeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The high prevalence, costs and decreased quality of life signify a large impact of non-specific WRULD.</p><p>Beyond effectiveness studies, cost-effectiveness studies in relation with quality of life are needed in patients with non-specific WRULD to be able to improve health care and to lower the costs.</p><p>As the department of rehabilitation of the Maastricht University Hospital acts as a tertiary referral centre for non-specific WRULD complaints a cost-effectiveness study among computer screen-workers with early stages of non-specific WRULD was set up.</p><p>In the current study we tested if postural exercise therapy according to Mensendieck/Cesar is cost-effective with respect to pain, disability and quality of life as when compared to regular physiotherapy in computer screen-workers with early stages of non-specific WRULD, both from a health care and societal perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A prospective randomized clinical trial was set up among computer screen-workers with early non-specific work-related upper limb disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recruitment took place by advertisement in local newspapers, by personal contact with occupational physicians of large industries and by mailing to general practitioners in South Limburg. Screen-workers fulfilling the inclusion criteria were invited to take part in this study. Selection and diagnosis were performed by an independent occupational physician familiar with the diagnosis of "non-specific WRULD" who was blinded to allocation sequence.</p><p>Within two weeks after eligible patients were selected and invited to participate by the occupational physician, baseline assessments were performed at one of two locations, either the Maastricht University Hospital or the Institute for Rehabilitation Research in Hoensbroek, a small town in the south-eastern region of the Netherlands.</p><p>Participants were randomized to the PE group or the RP group in strata depending on the duration of the complaints (cut-off point six weeks). Blocks of four were generated for each stratum by means of a computer generated random sequence table.</p><p>Randomization was concealed because a research assistant, who was not involved in the selection of the participants, allocated participants to groups using a list of random numbers which was generated before commencement of the trial. Because both interventions were active, blinding of participants and therapists was not possible. In both groups, the ten week intervention started within one week after baseline measures were completed. Outcome measures were collected at baseline and at three, six and twelve months where the same questionnaires were completed using a computer under the supervision of a research assistant. The research assistant instructed participants about the questionnaires, which had to be completed by using a computer in the participant's usual manner. The computer workstation was custom-made for this purpose for each participant. Only the pain outcome measure was assessed by the participants filling in the forms by pen during four sequential working days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the research assistant was blinded to group allocation, all outcome measures were self-reports so they were not blind. The completion of the questionnaires by the participants took approximately one hour each time.</p><p>This research project was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Maastricht.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Computer screen-workers with early non-specific WRULD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Early non-specific WRULD were defined as pains and tingles in upper back, neck, shoulders, arms or hands related and restricted to computer screen-work, not yet present during other daily activities and not labelled as a specific diagnosis such as tennis elbow. Computer screen-workers were defined as those employees performing computer work, with or without the use of a mouse, for at least twenty hours per week and at least four hours continuously per day. Computer screen-workers were chosen because they represent a homogeneous group who are at risk for developing non-specific WRULD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>To be eligible for this study, participants had to fulfil the following inclusion criteria:</p><p>- were computer screen-worker at the time of first complaints and being employed in present job for at least three months</p><p>- had non-specific WRULD with symptoms existing longer than two weeks but shorter than three months</p><p>- aged between 20 and 45 years</p><p>Excluded were patients not fulfilling the inclusion criteria and patients with non-specific WRULD during other daily activities such as teeth brushing and car driving, patients with specific WRULD (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, golfers elbow, tendonitis de Quervain), patients with other diseases of musculoskeletal system (e.g. fibromyalgia, hyper mobility syndromes), pregnant patients, patients who were on sick leave and patients who already had received therapy for their complaints or who had received postural exercise therapy during the last five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>One group of participants received PE therapy, in the Netherlands known as Mensendieck and Cesar. PE therapy according to Bess Mensendieck and Maria Cesar do not differ basically and both therapies and their training programs have been assimilated since the fusion of both societies in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. PE therapy according to Mensendieck/Cesar is in use in the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and France. PE therapy promotes a method of body posture- and movement education by exercises in which the integration of body and mind takes place in order to improve consciously poor body posture and bad movement habits in relation to daily life activities. The core of the therapy is to make use of feedback from muscle-, joint-, tendon- and ligament positions by means of audio- (verbal instructions), visual (mirrors and video records) and proprioceptive registered signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is hypothesized that this feedback, repeatedly offered to and transformed in the central nervous system, will lead in the long term to automatic improvement of postural and movement habits with generalization to daily activities aiming at decrease of complaints. Training in patient specific daily life activities such as computer work forms a part of this therapy. The four therapists involved in this study were trained in treating patients with non-specific WRULD.</p><p>The other group of participants received RP and was treated by four physiotherapists who attended a WRULD-course. They did not make use of applications or massage techniques. Active muscle training and fitness exercises were part of the therapy. The focus was on improvement of muscle condition for long-lasting static postures.</p><p>All participants in both treatment arms received ten weeks of therapy according to protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The PE group received in total one and a half hours more therapy compared to the RP group, although the last group received six more sessions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Therapy schedules</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Weeks</th><th align="left">Postural Exercise therapy (PE)<break/>Per week</th><th align="left">Regular Physiotherapy (RP)<break/>Per week</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1-3</td><td align="left">2 &#x000d7; 1 hour</td><td align="left">3 &#x000d7; 1/2 hour</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">4-6</td><td align="left">1 &#x000d7; 1 hour</td><td align="left">2 &#x000d7; 1/2 hour</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">7-8</td><td align="left">1 &#x000d7; 1/2 hour</td><td align="left">1 &#x000d7; 1/2 hour</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">Exercises at home</td><td align="left">Exercises at home</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">Final session 1/2 hour</td><td align="left">Final session 1/2 hour</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total hours treatment</td><td align="left">10 1/2 hours</td><td align="left">9 hours</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Treatments were paid for by health care insurance companies.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>At baseline, besides the effectiveness measures (see further) sex, age, number of working hours and level of education were assessed.</p><p>Participants were labeled as "highly educated" if they had at least a bachelor's degree.</p><p>As this syndrome is related to work, the number of working hours was registered. Because onset and course of non-specific WRULD are influenced by physical, psychosocial and personal risk factors, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] variables assessing these risk factors were measured at baseline.</p><p>The following variables were assessed:</p><p>1. The validated Groningen Fitness Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] was used to measure individual self-reported fitness level.</p><p>2. The Dutch version of the Job Stress Survey (JSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] was used to measure job stress experienced at the work place.</p><p>3. The Dutch version of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale of Frost (MPS-F) measures (neurotic) perfectionism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>4. The Dutch version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) measures state-respectively trait anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]</p><p>5. The Dutch version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) has been used to measure to which extend people who suffer from pain experience catastrophizing thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Effectiveness measures</title><p>As a primary outcome measure we used the horizontal numerical visual analogous ten cm scale (VAS) according to Jensen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] to measure pain at baseline and pain in course of time at the location with the highest pain intensity. In our research project pain was measured at each measurement moment by the participants themselves by hand during four sequential working days/four fixed times a day (at 11, 14, 17 and 20 o' clock) to get a relevant impression about the existence of pain during the whole working week. The final VAS outcome measure was recalculated as the average of sixteen ratings over the four days. In addition, self-perceived WRULD at each follow-up moment was assessed by a dichotomous variable which was the answer to the question: "do you still perceive non-specific WRULD complaints, yes or no?"</p><p>As a secondary outcome measure we used the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand- Dutch Language Version (DASH-DLV) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to measure physical function and symptoms and the disabilities to fulfil daily life activities. At least 27 out of 30 items must be completed to calculate a score from 0 till 100. A lower score indicates a lower disability rate.</p><p>To measure the generic quality of life we made use of the EQ-5D of the EuroQol Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This questionnaire is in use in cost-effectiveness studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The questionnaire consists of five questions regarding the dimensions mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each question has three response categories ranging from no problem, some problems and many problems. Using a standardised algorithm, the end score of the EQ-5D is a utility, falling within a value scale of zero (dead) to one (perfect health) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The EQ-5D is used to calculate the quality adjusted life year (QALY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The QALY was corrected for differences in baseline utility using regression-correction. A regression analysis was performed with the utility-score during the follow-up measurement as the dependent variable and the baseline utility-score as independent variable. For correction, the Beta of this equation is multiplied with the individual baseline utility-score.</p><p>All scales are commonly used internationally and are reliable and validated.</p><sec><title>Economic outcome measures</title><p>Costs are defined from the societal perspective. These are subdivided into health care costs (including out of pocket costs for the patient and family) and productivity costs. Only costs related to WRULD are included in the analyses. Costs are determined by multiplying the volume reported on each cost item by the estimated costs per unit (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Out of pocket costs for patient and family were directly measured in the payment. A questionnaire measuring health care costs and costs for patient and family has been used. Missing items in this questionnaire are interpreted as being zero if there simultaneously were markings in cost items elsewhere in the cost questionnaire. The health care costs comprise items like GP visits, home care, medication etc. The costs for the patient and family consist of the reported devices and domestic home care.</p><table-wrap id="T2"

Data concerning absenteeism are collected in a questionnaire concerning employment and absence through illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Productivity costs are calculated according to the friction-cost method, indicating that almost everyone is replaceable in the labour process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A friction cost period of 22 weeks or 154 days is adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In the cost calculation one general cost price per lost hour of productivity is used for all patients. The number of days absent from work is related to the number of working days and working hours reported by the individual patient. Economic data are gathered three times during the one year follow-up period by the questionnaires, each time measuring the last two months prior to the questionnaires. These assessments took place at the same time as the effectiveness measures. The costs are based on these questionnaires and extrapolated to the costs during the full one year follow-up period.</p><p>The handbook of Oostenbrink et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] is used as a guideline for determining the cost prices.</p><p>Those cost prices of health care services not mentioned, being ergo therapy, psychology and care by occupational doctor are obtained from professional organizations. Prices of medication are obtained from the Dutch College of Health Insurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Cost prices of devices are obtained from the reporting of patients. If the cost price of a relevant device is not reported by the patient, a suitable minimum, maximum and mean cost price is estimated. Cost price estimates of devices are obtained from an organization specialized in devices for ergonomic work places. For some of the cost items there was one mean cost price, for other items a mean cost price is calculated based on a minimum and maximum cost price. All cost prices are indexed to 2005 by using the price index numbers of the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>The costs prices of health care practitioners consist of all costs directly and indirectly attributable to the unit (these are the costs of personnel, medical staff, material, medical apparatus, medical supporting departments, accommodation and overhead).</p></sec><sec><title>Cost-effectiveness measures</title><p>In the cost-effectiveness analyses the VAS, self-perceived WRULD and DASH-DLV are related to the health care costs. The QALY is related to the societal costs including productivity costs, in a cost-utility analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The expected improvement in pain in the PE group was set at 60% and for the RP group at 40%, implying a minimal clinical relevant difference of 20%, correlating with 20 mm difference on the horizontal VAS-scale. These expected improvements in pain were based on past clinical experience in our department of rehabilitation of the Maastricht University Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. With an alpha of 0.05 and a 1-beta of 80% in total n = 94 computer screen-workers were needed to provide sufficient power to answer the research questions.</p><p>Data were analyzed by a blinded statistician using SPSS 13.0 for Windows (version 13.0; SPSS inc. Chicago, Ill.)</p><p>Data were checked for missing values and normality. Missing values have been replaced by mean imputation and by LOC-F (Last Observation Carried Forward) method. Each follow-up moment was analyzed separately and the analyses were carried out according to the intention to treat principle. Differences in baseline characteristics and baseline values of the outcome measures between PE and RP group were tested with an independent samples t-test (&#x003b1; = 0.05). In the event of significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics, adjustments were made in the statistical analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The primary effectiveness measure, the horizontal VAS according to Jensen, has been analyzed at each follow-up moment by a t-test. Scores on DASH and EQ-5D questionnaires have been dealt with in the same way. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test has been used to analyze the answer on the question put dichotomously: "do you still experience non-specific WRULD complaints, yes or no".</p><p>The costs of both patient groups were compared by the bootstrapping method making use of confidence intervals in percentiles. By bootstrapping samples of the same size as the original data are drawn with replacement from the observed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In our study thousand bootstrap samples/replications were drawn.</p><p>The economic evaluation concerns cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) are calculated based on the measured costs and outcome parameters. Health care costs are related to the medical outcome parameters and societal costs, including productivity costs are related to the QALY. Bootstrapping is performed and the simulated ratios indicate the uncertainty of the ICERs of the observed data. The ICERs resulting from bootstrapping are plotted on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) indicating the probability for a range of ceiling ratios (society's maximum willingness to pay for one unit of effectiveness) that the cost-effectiveness of the PE treatment is acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> presents all cost prices with some items having a minimum and maximum cost price. Due to uncertainty concerning the cost price estimates two deterministic sensitivity analyses are performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These prices are varied simultaneously, once as minimum and once as maximum cost prices in the sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analysis with minimized cost prices, the productivity costs are based on 28.33 (28'20") contract hours divided over five working days a week. These contract hours are based on data of the CBS concerning the average working hours of the total working population in the Netherlands in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This minimizes the productivity costs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>313 potential participants reacted or on the advertisements or were recruited by occupational physicians.

When the willingness to pay for an additional unit of effect on one of these outcome parameters is zero, the PE treatment tends towards inferiority. At three months after baseline there is a probability of only 1% that the ICER is acceptable at a ceiling of zero. At one year after baseline the probability that the PE treatment is cost-effective is about 46 to 48% for these three parameters. When the limit on the ICER is increased the PE treatment tends towards dominance concerning the change in VAS pain intensity achieved after three months (probability increases to 92%) and the number of patients with self-perceived WRULD-complaints after one year (probability increases to 60%). The other CEACs in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> still tend towards inferiority of the PE treatment, even when the willingness to pay increases. The cost utility analysis concerns the incremental QALY compared to the incremental societal costs during the one year follow-up period. As shown by Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> the probability that the PE treatment is cost-effective is about 82 to 87%, depending on the ceiling ratio.

The study of Meijer (2006) shows that there is no difference in cost-effectiveness between two groups which were treated by multidisciplinary intervention respectively usual care.</p><p>This cost-effectiveness study, comprising WRULD-related health care costs including costs for the patient and family and productivity costs resulting in societal costs, is as a randomized controlled trial in computer screen-workers with early stages of non-specific WRULD the first of its kind. There was only a small rate of missing values in this research making the chance of bias low. The low percentage of dropout (less than 10%) was the reason to perform only an intention-to-treat analysis and no per-protocol analysis. Moreover this patient group concerns patients with early non-specific WRULD complaints of which is assumed that their dropout would not imply a significant impact on the results.</p><p>The results failed to show PE therapy according to Mensendieck/Cesar is more effective in computer screen-workers with early non-specific WRULD with respect to the effectiveness outcome measures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In both groups there are small improvements over the one year follow-up period while after one year 55% of the participants reports to have no complaints any longer. The small effects on the outcome measures possibly can be explained by the fact that only patients with beginning complaints were included and therefore showed low scores on the scales. Despite the finding that there was no difference between groups we did not change the principle of conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis since our trial was based on the expectation of a difference in effectiveness between treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our study shows wide confidence intervals on both effectiveness and cost differences between the two treatment arms. Due to uncertainty surrounding our estimate of treatment effects arising from the negative results and small size of our trial, interpretation of the ICERs should be undertaking with caution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the results of the bootstrap run on the incremental costs per VAS. Given the fact that the bootstrapped ICERs are scattered around the origin, the confidence intervals of the ICERs presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">8</xref> are difficult to interpret.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Result of the bootstrap run based on the incremental costs per VAS: Incremental cost-effectiveness plane</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-10-103-4"/></fig><p>Non-specific WRULD is 'work-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, this research did not include a work-related effectiveness measure. Suffering from beginning complaints and according to the inclusion criteria, all participants were still at work at start of the treatment. Consequently "return-to-job" was not a useful effectiveness measure for this particular patient group.</p><p>Regarding cost-effectiveness, mean total health care costs including costs for the patient and family did not differ significantly between both groups at one year follow-up. This despite the fact that during the intervention period when most health care costs were made and mainly consisted of the costs of the treatments, these costs were higher in the PE group having one and a half hours more therapy compared to the RP group. On the other hand, productivity costs after one year were lower in the PE group. Productivity costs were based on 28.33 (28'20") contract hours divided over five working days a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, our participants worked much more hours per week (ca. 38 hours per week). Productivity costs were calculated according to the friction cost approach, but this research did not take into account all of the possible productivity costs items from this approach. For example the productivity costs during the work due to decreased work performance called presenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] were not questioned in this research. These observations probably reflect an underestimation of the productivity costs measured in this study with possibly consequences for the outcome.</p><p>The mean societal costs one year after baseline were in favor of the PE therapy group, mainly attributable to the higher productivity costs in the RP group.</p><p>From the health care costs perspective at three months follow-up only with respect to the VAS the PE strategy had a high probability of acceptable cost-effectiveness. At one year follow-up the PE strategy had only regarding the self-perceived WRULD a- not the 60% exceeding- probability of acceptable cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Considering societal costs in relation to QALYs, the PE treatment had a probability of over 80% to be cost-effective over a wide range of cost-effectiveness ceiling ratios.</p><p>However, differences were marginal, possibly because this study only concerned computer screen-workers with early stages of non-specific WRULD and already no significant differences between the groups were found in the effectiveness of both therapies themselves.</p><p>As our preference concerns the societal perspective and the QALYs we tend to prescribe postural exercise therapy according to Mensendieck/Cesar for computer screen-workers with early stages of non-specific WRULD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, although our trial failed to find significant differences in VAS, QALYs and ICERs based on VAS and QALYs at one-year follow-up, CEACs suggest that the postural exercise therapy according to Mensendieck/Cesar has a higher probability of being cost-effective compared to regular physiotherapy; however further research is required.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>WRULD: work-related upper limb disorders; VAS: visual analogous scale; DASH-DLV: disabilities arm, shoulder and hand - Dutch language version; EQ-5D: Euro-Qol - 5 dimensions; QALY: quality adjusted life year; PE: postural exercise therapy; RP: regular physiotherapy; JSS: Job Stress Survey; MPS-F: Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale of Frost; STAI: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; PCS: Pain Catastrophizing Scale; GP: general practitioner; LOC-F: Last Observation Carried Forward; ICER: incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; CEAC: cost-effectiveness acceptability curve; CBS: Centraal Bureau van de Statistiek (Central Bureau of Statistics); CI: confidence interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MVEB: first writer of all head chapters, interpretation of data.
