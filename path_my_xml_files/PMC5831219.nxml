The TRACES pharmacobiological substudy aims to establish a therapeutic strategy in hemorrhagic (H) Cesarean section (CS) with respect to the intensity of fibrinolysis by using innovative assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p id="Par2">The TRACES trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, TA dose-ranging study that measures simultaneously plasmatic and uterine and urine TA concentrations and the plasmin peak inhibition tested by a simultaneous thrombin plasmin generation assay described by Van Geffen (novel hemostasis assay [NHA]). Patients undergoing H CS (&#x0003e;800&#x000a0;mL) will receive blindly TA 0.5&#x000a0;g or 1&#x000a0;g or placebo. A non-hemorrhagic (NH) group will be recruited to establish plasmin generation profile. Venous blood will be sampled before, at the end, and then at 30, 60, 120, and 360&#x000a0;min after injection. Uterine bleeding will be sampled after injection. Urine will be sampled 2&#x000a0;h and 6&#x000a0;h after injection. The number of patients entered into the study will be 114&#x000a0;H&#x02009;+&#x02009;48 NH out of the 390 patients of the TRACES clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">To explore the two innovative assays, a preliminary pilot study was conducted. Blood samples were performed repeatedly in patients undergoing either a H (&#x0003e;800&#x000a0;mL) or NH (&#x0003c;800&#x000a0;mL) CS and in non-pregnant women (NP). H patients received TA (0&#x02013;2&#x000a0;g). Dose-dependent TA plasmatic concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS quantification. Plasmin generation and its inhibition were tested in vitro and in vivo using the simultaneous thrombin&#x02013;plasmin generation assay (STPGA). The pilot study included 15 patients in the H group, ten patients in the NH group, and seven patients in the NP group. TA plasmatic concentration showed a dose-dependent variation. STPGA inter-assay variation coefficients were&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20% for all plasmin parameters. Inter-individual dispersion of plasmin generation capacity was higher in H and NH groups than in NP group. Profile evolution over time was different between groups.

Tranexamic acid (TA) (Exacyl&#x000ae;, Sanofi, France), an antifibrinolytic drug, reduces bleeding and transfusion need in major surgery and trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In ongoing PPH following vaginal delivery, a high dose of TA decreased PPH volume and duration and maternal morbidity, while early fibrinolysis was inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a large international, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a uniform unique 1-g dose, TA reduced maternal mortality due to bleeding but did not succeed in reducing the hysterectomy rate or the global rate of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the high mortality due to recruitment in low resources countries, TA avoided 150 deaths out of the 10,051 treated patients compared to the 10,009 placebo patients. This beneficial impact occurred when TA was administered 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h after PPH onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. TA efficiency and optimal dose in hemorrhagic (H) CS has to be determined. A dose-ranging study is needed to assess the optimal TA dose to be administered. Pharmacokinetics studies conducted in the 1980s identified TA (p-aminomethyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid [AMCHA]) in its trans-form (AMCA) as 6&#x02013;10 times more potent than its precursor epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In healthy non-hemorrhagic (NH) volunteers, doses of 2.5&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/kg were tested intravenously and orally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recently, well conducted pharmacokinetics studies have been performed after TA administration in adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and pediatric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] cardiac surgery. Studies used a single bolus in the range of 10&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/kg. Others used repeated boluses or a continuous infusion during and/or after cardiopulmonary bypass. A minimal concentration able to prevent in vitro-induced fibrinolysis has been evaluated and seems lower in neonates than in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Several factors may explain the high degree of heterogeneity observed among these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These first results using concomitant clinical and pharmacological effects evaluation suggest that the higher doses used in cardiac surgery, and considered as efficient, could be reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is of interest regarding the side effects (seizures and visual disturbances) that seem more frequent in higher doses series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. On the contrary, the Crash2 study in trauma using a unique dose of 1&#x000a0;g demonstrated the absence of excessive thrombotic or renal failure in the TA-treated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In active PPH, nausea and visual disturbances were also noted after the higher dose of 4&#x000a0;g then 1&#x000a0;g per hour over 6&#x000a0;h.

Fibrinogenolysis is induced by two potential enzymes: thrombin and plasmin. Thrombin divides fibrinogen to fibrin monomers, which are then stabilized to fibrin clot by activated factor XIII. Fibrin formation is the final step of plasmatic coagulation. Plasminogen links to native fibrin in a tertiary complex tPA-fibrin-activated plasminogen (i.e. plasmin).
