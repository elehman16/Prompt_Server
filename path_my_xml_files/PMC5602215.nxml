</p><p>The SCAT3 combines patient background information with tasks that target a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and physical deficits that commonly result from a concussion, and it has been widely used to assess the acute effects of sport-related concussions on the sideline.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The recommended process for the sideline administration of the SCAT3 requires a 10-minute rest period for the athlete before commencing the assessment.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The premise for this recommendation is to mitigate the potential effects of postexercise fatigue on SCAT3 performance because exercise alone without the presence of a concussion may induce changes that make clinical interpretation difficult during sideline assessments. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of exercise on SCAT3 performance in professional male athletes. We hypothesized that the athletes would endorse slightly more symptoms (eg, fatigue) and perform worse on the physical components of the SCAT3 (ie, modified Balance Error Scoring System [BESS] and tandem gait) after exercise. We also hypothesized that the cognition scores on the SCAT3 would not differ between conditions.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967117727261"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2325967117727261" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants of this study were composed of active male professional athletes, aged &#x02265;18 years, from the Newcastle Knights rugby squad and the Newcastle Jets football (soccer) squad (N = 82).

A 3-week test-retest interval was used because of the limited availability of the professional athletes and to reduce possible practice effects. Prior work among adolescent and young adult athletes has suggested poor to moderate test-retest reliability for the SCAT3 components among noninjured controls when tested 7 days apart (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.42-0.64).<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> A single male physician (J.H.L.) administered all tests during both testing sessions.</p><p>In condition 1, the SCAT3 was administered to the participants when they were rested. In condition 2, participants completed a 5-minute physical exertion protocol in which they achieved a minimum of 75% of their age-predicted maximal heart rate, subsequently rested for 5 minutes, and then completed the SCAT3. During National Rugby League game play, players can be removed from play, assessed, and returned if it is determined that they did not sustain a concussion (with no interchange charged to the team). However, this complete evaluation must take place within a 15-minute assessment window. Thus, the medical staff is encouraged to allow a 5-minute rest period before commencement of the SCAT3 to ensure that the remaining 10 minutes of the interchange window can be used for assessment. Therefore, we chose a 5-minute rest duration in our study to reflect this common clinical practice.</p><p>Each condition was randomly assigned to participants such that they were undertaken in a counterbalanced manner (ie, 50% of participants performed condition 1 in their first session and condition 2 during their second session, while 50% of the sample performed condition 2 in their first session and condition 1 in their second session) to control for order effects. In condition 2, participants used a stationary exercise bicycle to complete a cardiovascular workout. Participants were requested to exercise to 75% of their maximum heart rate and to maintain that level of intensity for a period of 5 minutes. The participants&#x02019; heart rate was monitored via a standardized cardiac monitor combined with manual palpation to record the time that it took for them to reach 75% of their maximum heart rate and to ensure that they maintained this level of intensity for 5 minutes. The cardiac monitor was used in conjunction with manual palpation of the heart rate to minimize any potential measurement error that may have resulted from the use of either method alone (ie, the cardiac monitor was used as a verification tool). The participants were required to achieve a heart rate of &#x0003e;75% maximum on both manual palpation and cardiac monitoring to satisfy the requirement of our study. Participants were then asked to rate the level of intensity of their workout using the Borg RPE scale. The 2 conditions were completed a mean 3.5 &#x000b1; 2.6 weeks apart (median, 3.0 weeks; range, 1-12 weeks).</p></sec><sec id="section8-2325967117727261"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Continuous variables are presented as means and SDs; categorical variables are presented as absolute values or percentages of the total. At-rest SCAT3 performance was compared with postexercise SCAT3 performance among all participants on each subtest using paired-samples <italic>t</italic> tests.

To classify the clinical meaningfulness of SCAT3 performance at rest and after exercise, we calculated the frequency of participants in each condition who were classified as broadly normal, below/above average, unusually high/low, or extremely low/high using previously published normative reference data.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> We then examined the proportion of participants who were broadly normal compared with those who were not in both testing conditions using the Fisher exact probability test for each SCAT3 component. The proportion of participants reporting the presence (ie, greater than zero) of each of the 22 symptoms in the 2 testing conditions was also assessed using the Fisher exact probability test.</p><p>Additionally, to assess the effect of concussion history on SCAT3 performance in both conditions, we used a 2-way, mixed-effects analysis of variance to identify significant interactions or main effects of concussion history (yes or no) and test condition. To examine the association between self-rated exertion level and postexercise performance, postexercise SCAT3 scores were compared between participants who rated their exertion as &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; or lower (6-12 on the Borg RPE scale) with those who rated their exertion as &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; or higher (13-20 on the Borg RPE scale) using independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests. Initial screening to determine if a history of concussions, migraines, learning disorders, or mental health problems were potential modifiers indicated no effect of any of these factors.

The effect sizes for the differences in modified BESS performance and tandem gait speed were fairly small, and the differences were not significant when taking into account multiple statistical comparisons.</p><p>Interestingly, a significantly greater number of symptoms were reported in the postexercise condition than in the at-rest condition, suggesting that exercise may induce symptoms in some athletes. This is consistent with a previous study that observed a significant increase in the number of symptoms reported immediately after a bout of exercise.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The individual symptoms that were provoked by the exercise protocol in our study included &#x0201c;feeling slowed down&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;fatigue or low energy.&#x0201d; Similarly, Lee and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> reported that &#x0201c;fatigue or low energy,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;feeling slowed down,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pressure in the head&#x0201d; were commonly reported among athletes engaged in a standardized exercise protocol. In a study involving uninjured male collegiate athletes, vigorous exercise was associated with increased reporting of balance problems and numbness and tingling.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> When assessed within 10 minutes of completing an exercise protocol, uninjured collegiate athletes also endorsed significantly more symptoms than their baseline (rested) symptom total, but these effects largely dissipated within the subsequent 24 hours when symptoms were reassessed.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Additionally, a 30-minute bout of aerobic exercise has been shown to affect the mechanisms responsible for executive control, potentially leading to improved cognitive functioning.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Thus, if cognitive performance improves as a result of exercise performed during sports, potential SCAT3 result changes on the sideline may be caused by the effect of exercise (although this effect has not been shown on the simple cognitive tests on the SCAT3). Regardless, this further supports the notion of a brief rest period before SCAT3 administration. Also in line with these findings, a systematic review has reported that exercise appears to induce concussion symptoms acutely after an injury and concussion-like symptoms in uninjured participants but that the symptoms appear to persist for only a short duration of time.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Such findings contribute to the generally accepted notion that the symptoms listed on the SCAT3 are not specific to a concussion,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> are common in patients with clinical conditions (eg, migraines, anxiety disorders, depression, and bodily injuries), and may be increased by fatigue.</p><p>The proportion of participants who were considered broadly normal on the modified BESS, as defined previously by H&#x000e4;nninen and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> among professional ice hockey athletes, was significantly greater at rest than after exercise. In fact, after exercise, fewer than half of the study participants were considered broadly normal on the modified BESS. Additionally, a small effect size suggested that the mean number of modified BESS errors was somewhat greater after exercise than at rest, aligning with prior research that has documented more BESS errors immediately after a fatigue protocol.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Prior research has documented a similar postexercise decrement on the modified BESS, but with a longer period of rest (20 minutes) the BESS scores returned to similar levels as baseline.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>
</p><p>The sample of professional athletes who participated in this study performed worse in the at-rest condition compared with the professional Finnish ice hockey players who were used to create normative data for the SCAT3<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> on a number of the tests. Therefore, the Finnish norms might not be appropriate for other athlete groups. Specifically, 10% of the professional athletes in our study at rest and 12% after exercise obtained substantially low SAC scores. In contrast, tandem gait performance in both conditions was broadly normal for greater than 90% of the professional athletes in this study. While approximately 7.8% of professional ice hockey athletes were classified as unusually low on the modified BESS, 24.4% and 35.3% of the professional athletes in our study were classified as unusually low in the at-rest and postexercise conditions, respectively. Because the interrater reliability of the modified BESS is low,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> differences in how test administrators interpreted errors may have contributed to the discrepancy between studies. Finally, as the tandem gait test&#x02019;s primary outcome variable, test time, is a more objective measure than observer-rated errors, it may possess a higher degree of translatability across different sports and test administrators.</p><p>Based on the results of our study, a rest period of more than 5 minutes may be necessary and appropriate for tests of physical function, such as the modified BESS and tandem gait, but less necessary for components of the SCAT3 that probe cognitive abilities such as memory and concentration. Similar to our findings, prior work has found that high-intensity exercise contributes to worse performance on the single-leg stance component of the modified BESS and the tandem gait test.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, the test-retest reliability of the SCAT3 may differ based on the amount of time between tests.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Specifically, the reliability of the SAC and BESS is higher among uninjured adolescent and young adult athletes when the 2 tests are administered within 1 week of each other compared with when they are administered approximately 6 months apart.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117727261" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In our sample, relatively modest test-retest correlations were found, perhaps because of the different conditions in which participants were tested despite tests occurring, on average, around 3 weeks of each other. Therefore, in addition to the effect of exercise on SCAT3 performance, clinicians should consider the duration of time since the baseline examination because practice effects may dissipate if test-retest intervals exceed 1 month.</p><p>The generalizability of these findings to other professional male athletes and the application of the results to a real-world, game-day SCAT3 sideline assessment may be limited. A majority (59%) of the professional athletes rated their exertion levels as light or lower, while only 4% perceived the exercise protocol as very hard or harder. Furthermore, reported fatigue scores and reported exertion levels were not associated. These observations may be because our study design incorporated a brief exercise protocol. Specifically, 5 minutes of activity on an exercise bicycle, at 75% age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited, is unlikely to reflect the exertion involved in match play for the majority of athletes. Although participants selected a range of different Borg RPE scale scores during the exercise protocol, no significant differences were found for each rating category on SCAT3 performance. Although this lack of difference between groups indicates that the perceived level of exercise had no effect on SCAT3 performance, some athletes likely felt as if they did not experience a noticeable level of physical exertion. Thus, the generalizability of our findings to on-field SCAT3 assessments may be limited. Future studies may better assess the effects of a more &#x0201c;game-like&#x0201d; exercise protocol aimed to increase the intensity and duration of exercise.</p><p>This study was also limited in that we were unable to obtain information regarding participants&#x02019; previous SCAT3 completion. That is, we did not have data on how many times each participant had completed the SCAT3 and the extent to which his current performance may have been improved by possible practice effects.</p><p>In conclusion, the interpretation of in-game (sideline) SCAT3 results should consider the potential effects of fatigue on an athlete&#x02019;s performance, particularly if preseason baseline data have been collected when the athlete was well rested. Specifically, exercise appears to affect symptom reporting, balance, and gait more so than the cognitive components of the SCAT3, and medical providers involved in the sideline care of athletes should consider these potential exercise-induced changes during the interpretation of test performance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967117727261"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflicts of interest or source of funding: W.P.M. receives royalties from ABC-CLIO, Springer Publishing, and Wolters Kluwer and receives philanthropic research support from the National Hockey League Alumni Association through the Corey C.
