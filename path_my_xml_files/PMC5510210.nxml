Studies show that consumption of foods with a higher fiber content affects weight regulation [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], enhances satiety [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and reduces energy intake [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, there is growing interest in fermentable fibers, such as inulin-type fructans (ITFs), and the impact they have on the human body. ITFs are linear polysaccharides composed mainly of &#x003b2;-(2&#x02192;1) fructosyl&#x02013;fructose linkages [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They are practical to use as nutritional supplements because of their non-viscous and readily dissolvable nature, which makes them easy to prescribe for consumption. They are classified as prebiotic, stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and hence increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).</p><p>Animal studies show that higher SCFA production increases levels of circulating appetite, inhibiting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and peptide YY (PYY) [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Data from human studies show that consuming fermentable fibers, such as ITFs, can also increase concentrations of GLP-1 [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and PYY [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and reduce levels of ghrelin [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a hormone that enhances appetite and leads to increased food intake [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Taking these findings together, one can postulate that ITFs are likely to affect appetite and satiety, and consequently energy intake. Results from the limited number of human studies available, however, are inconsistent. Karalus et al. [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that 10&#x000a0;g of ITFs did not affect food intake or satiety sensations compared to controls in acute settings. Another acute study using a smaller dose of ITFs, 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;g/day in a beverage, failed to elicit any impact on satiety sensations, but resulted in reduced food intake in women only [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When looking at a higher dose, 21&#x000a0;g/day of ITFs for 12&#x000a0;weeks resulted in reduced body weight and reduced self-reported energy intake coupled with a positive impact on plasma satiety hormones [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cani et al. [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that 16&#x000a0;g/day of ITFs led to enhanced satiety and reduced energy consumption, while in a small (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) short-term study, Cani et al. [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that 16&#x000a0;g/day of a different ITF led to increased GLP-1 and PYY but failed to affect satiety ratings.</p><p>Collectively, these studies potentiate that ITF fibers may exert a desirable effect on appetite and/or food intake, but inconsistencies in findings warrant further investigation. Thus, and to contribute further to the understanding of the potential impact of ITF fibers on appetite, we carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the impact of short-term supplementation of ITF fiber (16&#x000a0;g/day) on appetite sensations and subsequent food consumption in a homogeneous female population.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Subjects</title><p>Participants were recruited by flyers, posted advertisements on school boards, and by word of mouth across various Kuwait University campuses. Apparently healthy, college-age female participants aged 18&#x02013;25 years were recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria included participants who could not adhere to the study protocol and those who were planning to start new dietary practices during the study duration. Forty participants were needed for the study, based on previously published sample size estimates for visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with an additional 25% in sample size to account for potential loss of participants during the study duration. We screened 55 participants for eligibility, 40 of whom met the inclusion criteria and were recruited. All participants were then randomly assigned to either the fiber or control group (simple randomization). All participants were informed about the details of the study, and provided their signed written consent. Of the 40 participants enrolled, 36 completed the study. This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approval for the study was granted by Kuwait University Research Sector.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, short intervention study. It consisted of a 1&#x000a0;week adaptation period and a testing day. The fiber used was Frutafit&#x000ae; IQ (kindly donated by Sensus, Roosendaal, the Netherlands), which is a native inulin/oligofructans with average chain monomer length of 8&#x02013;13 and with excellent dispensability and wettability. During the study, 16&#x000a0;g of ITF fiber was provided daily to participants in the fiber group using an opaque water bottle with 330&#x000a0;ml of artificially flavored water (fiber group). Artificially flavored water in identical, opaque water bottles, devoid of fiber, was provided to the control group as a placebo. Study participants were instructed to consume the flavored water daily each morning between 7 and 8am with the breakfast meal. Potential adverse effects, including stool frequency, diarrhea, bloating and flatus, nausea, and stomach and intestinal discomfort, were assessed daily using a questionnaire. Participants were asked to fill out a daily VAS between 1 and 2pm and before lunch to assess the impact on appetite sensations in free-living conditions [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To reduce variability associated with free-living conditions, participants were instructed to consume the fiber, breakfast, and lunch, and to take the VAS at the specified hours. All questionnaires were collected together on the test day. In addition, and to correctly assess the impact on appetite sensations, VAS questionnaires were administered during the test day at set intervals in a controlled environment. Energy consumption was determined by pre- and post-weighing of breakfast and lunchtime meals.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>Weight</title><p>The body weight of the participants was measured while wearing regular clothes, without shoes, to the nearest &#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;kg at the beginning and end of the study. Participants were asked to wear the same clothes during the end visit to reduce variability in weight associated with changing their attire. Height was measured to &#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.25&#x000a0;cm at the beginning of the study using a wall-mounted stadiometer.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2004"><title>Visual analogue scale</title><p>Participants were asked to fill out a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS for 7 consecutive days before typical lunch meals to examine the causal impact of consuming ITF fiber on perceived appetite sensations with and without fiber in free-living settings. In addition, VAS was administered during the test day, after an overnight fast, at set intervals after breakfast was finished (i.e. 20, 50, 95, 155, 200, 245&#x000a0;min post-breakfast). The VAS questions were &#x02018;How strong is your desire to eat?&#x02019;, &#x02018;How hungry do you feel?&#x02019;, &#x02018;How full do you feel?&#x02019;, &#x02018;How satisfied do you feel?&#x02019;, and &#x02018;How much do you think you could eat right now?&#x02019;, with terms anchored at either end of the 100&#x000a0;mm scale to indicate minimum or maximum response.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2005"><title>Timeline protocol</title><p>Participants arrived on the test day having fasted overnight (no food or drink after midnight).

Once breakfast was finished, participants waited for 20&#x000a0;min before they filled out the first VAS to assess appetite-related sensations (20&#x000a0;min mark).

Several animal studies have suggested that consumption of fermentable fibers can increase GLP-1 and proglucagon expression and improve glucose homeostasis [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, very few, mostly inhomogeneous studies with variable fiber doses have investigated the impact of ITFs or inulin supplementation on appetite, hunger sensations, and food intake in the adult population. In our study, when participants consumed 16&#x000a0;g/day of ITFs in the morning, the average ratings in their &#x02018;desire to eat&#x02019;, &#x02018;hunger&#x02019;, and &#x02018;prospective food consumption&#x02019; were significantly lower compared to the control group. In addition, the fiber group reported higher &#x02018;fullness&#x02019; ratings just before lunch, suggesting a potential impact from the fiber. However, because the adaptation period was a free-living phase, it is difficult to conclude that the observed benefits, although suggested, are due solely to the ITFs since the amount of food consumed from breakfast to lunch is unknown. However, looking at the data from the test day, where settings and food intake were controlled, it appears that consuming 16&#x000a0;g of ITFs in the morning lowered the desire to eat, hunger, and the interest in food consumption, and enhanced fullness and satisfaction for much longer compared to placebo. This is consistent with the findings of Cani et al. [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], who found that 16&#x000a0;g of ITFs promoted satiety in healthy humans.</p><p>The impact on appetite of the participants was due to ITF consumption since both groups consumed equal amounts of energy at breakfast (235&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;kcal vs 230&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;16&#x000a0;kcal) and were housed in exact conditions with minimal physical disturbances. The residual impact of the ITFs on appetite sensations may explain why the fiber group consumed 21% fewer calories from food at lunch, since most sensations were favorably different until 155&#x000a0;min post-breakfast, and shortly before lunch was served at 200&#x000a0;min. It is worth noting that the reduced consumption of food by the fiber group meant that they had more time to interact at the table during lunch, which may have led to a pattern of increased liquid consumption, a naturally anticipated response when liquids accompany meals. It would have been more ideal to provide water in place of juice, considering that liquid calories are less likely to elicit a precise dietary compensation response because swallowing does not trigger the internal satiety signal that masticating does [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>One reason for previous studies failing to show a positive impact of fiber supplementation on VAS domains could be the use of inhomogeneous subject populations, in particular, a wider physiological age difference. Hess et al. [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Harrold et al. [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and Verhoef et al. [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] included subjects with age ranges from 18&#x02013;65, 1&#x02013;64, and 20&#x02013;60 years, respectively. The innate physiological response and magnitude of appetite and energy regulation complexes for older and younger people can be quite different. Anorexigenic signals in older adults prevail over orexigenic signals, contributing to prolonged satiety and inhibition of hunger [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which can easily affect VAS reporting in a mixed population of wide physiological age ranges. It is, therefore, suggested that more homogeneous subject populations be used when investigating the impact of fiber on appetite and energy regulation [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We designed our study to be practically homogeneous; thus, we enrolled college-age females, which may explain the agreement found in our study with that of Cani et al. [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], where fiber intake had a significant impact on satiety in 21&#x02013;39-year-old participants.</p><p>Another possible reason for the inconsistency of the results of previous studies may be the different doses of ITFs used. The study by Karalus et al. [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported no significant benefits on appetite ratings or weight of supplementing the diet with 10&#x000a0;g ITF fiber. The likely explanation for this is the low fiber doses used in the study. The 10&#x000a0;g dose of ITFs is not likely to produce any marked impact on appetite and hunger sensations [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The 16&#x000a0;g of inulin used in our study is likely to be an effective dose to produce meaningful change in appetite sensations, as this amount has been shown to produce favorable changes in appetite sensations [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and in appetite-related hormones and peptides [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest an impact on weight in the short term. After a week of supplementation, the fiber group saw no significant increase in body weight compared to its baseline, but the control group had a significant increase from its baseline. This is consistent with the findings of Parnell and Reimer [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], where supplementation with ITFs resulted in a significant reduction in weight in the fiber group while the control group experienced a significant weight gain.</p><p>Participants consuming the fiber reported a higher incidence of bloating and flatulence, which was anticipated [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although the incidence was higher among fiber consumers, the fiber was tolerated as no dropouts were reported as a result of supplement use.</p><sec id="S0004-S2001"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The lack of control for enrolment in relation to menstrual cycle may have been a limitation owing to the impact that the menstrual cycle has on appetite hormones [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and weight fluctuations. Future studies should consider scheduling enrolment within the first 14&#x000a0;days of each participant&#x02019;s monthly menstrual cycle (follicular phase) to increase consistency and avoid unwanted fluctuations in hormones that may lead to changes in appetite sensations and energy intake. Finally, the study participants consisted of only college-age females, with a narrow age range, and therefore the results may not be generalizable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 16&#x000a0;g/day of ITF fiber in the morning was found to reduce hunger, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption, and to increase fullness and satiety in acute settings, leading to reduced food intake at lunch. These results suggest that ITF fiber is potentially a useful adjunct dietary supplement for curbing appetite and possibly aiding weight management.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0006"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Slavin</surname><given-names>JL.</given-names></name></person-group>
