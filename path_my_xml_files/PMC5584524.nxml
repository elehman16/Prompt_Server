In this context, we define expert elicitation as the process of encoding expert opinion on a quantity of interest, together with associated uncertainty, as a probability distribution. When availability for face-to-face expert elicitation with a facilitator is limited, elicitation can be conducted remotely, overcoming challenges of finding an appropriate time to meet the expert and allowing access to experts situated too far away for practical face-to-face sessions. However, distance elicitation is associated with reduced response rates and limited assistance for the expert during the elicitation session.

In many cases, experts are invited to provide quantitative judgements on unknown model parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the context of HTA, we define expert elicitation as the process of a subject expert specifying a quantity of interest and associated uncertainty around it, which can be encoded as a probability distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This enables the probabilistic handling of quantities to address parameter uncertainty.</p><p id="Par13">Expert elicitation is, however, not without risks: not only is guidance scarce for its use in HTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], contributing to increased methodological anxiety, but also an impressive body of literature exists on the biased nature of human judgement of probability. Possible common biases may relate to the training or experience of the expert, or even their current mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Motivational biases may include group thinking (when the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational outcome), misinterpretation, wishful thinking, impression management (experts displaying high confidence to protect their public image despite having little actual knowledge on the topic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and experts with the best exposure to the relevant topic wanting to formulate opinions to influence the outcome, irrespective of their true belief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The dominant theory in the elicitation of probabilities is that of <italic>cognitive biases</italic>. In the 1970s, Tversky and Kahnemann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] initiated a biases and heuristics research programme, which explored probability judgements. In their early work, they concluded that the instinctive strategies employed by humans to make probability judgements, referred to as heuristics, lead to systematic and predictable error. They concluded that humans were unlikely to achieve acceptable performance in probability elicitation. Their work was widely cited, discussed and adopted by many disciplines.</p><p id="Par15">However, research interest is now slowly moving beyond the &#x0201c;heuristics and biases&#x0201d; research programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Evidence suggests that although the heuristics described by Tversky and Kahnemann are reproducible, the bias introduced by such strategies could be drastically reduced by changing the task characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, in a study where experts provided estimates to technical questions in both their area of expertise and in areas in which they were not experts, Mullin found that, as experts, participants &#x0201c;were far more serious and cautious about the tasks than as non-experts&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Finally, an accepted way to increase the robustness of elicited estimates against bias is to combine the opinions of multiple experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Even if the risk of bias associated with probabilistic judgement can be significantly reduced, elicitation amplifies the complexity by requiring multiple summaries from the expert to specify a single distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], increasing the burden of the task. Given the enormous potential for a facilitator to reduce bias in expert elicitation, typical recommendations on conducting expert elicitation support a degree of face-to-face interaction with the expert during the elicitation session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The role of the facilitator is to make sure that the questions are clear to the expert, that the expert&#x02019;s belief is accurately recorded, and the facilitator may even point out fallacies in the expert&#x02019;s judgement and allow the expert to revise their opinion. Furthermore, experts may feel more responsibility to complete a session with a facilitator than to complete an anonymous questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Conducting a face-to-face elicitation requires a significant commitment of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (trained facilitator, travel costs, time); especially when multiple experts are involved. It can be very time consuming, especially in disease areas where there are few experts, who are geographically dispersed, with busy schedules. Moreover, during face-to-face elicitation, the facilitator needs to be careful not to impose their beliefs, or biases, onto the expert&#x02019;s belief.</p><p id="Par18">Previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] highlighted the critical impact that expert availability has on elicitation, where low availability for face-to-face sessions led to recruitment taking a very long time. Besides ensuring that the question and task are clear to the expert; and the expert&#x02019;s response is appropriately encoded to reflect their belief, expert elicitation in the HTA context usually has relatively short timeframes, especially for those HTAs informing national and local decision-making. Thus the time available for face-to-face meetings may be limited and might prevent getting estimates from certain experts.</p><p id="Par19">The use of self-administered internet or email-based (distance) elicitation provides an opportunity to reduce time necessary for scheduling sessions, and reduce costs associated with travelling for the sessions, while reaching experts who are farther away. The expeditious nature of HTAs makes distance elicitation a very attractive solution, and examples of its use in HTA are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It also ensures that all experts receive exactly the same information on which to base their judgements and there is no bias introduced by a facilitator. The downside is the difficulty of formulating the question in a way that experts understand (without additional prompts), and a likely low response rate as with any survey (due to lack of motivation to respond or the cognitive burden of the exercise). However, in a recent ecological study that used self-administered elicitation together with facilitated elicitation, Baker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found little difference between expert estimates that could be explained conclusively by the mode of administration.</p><p id="Par20">Essentially, with distance elicitation, more experts can be reached in a shorter time, however usually at the cost of very low response rates, particularly when the target respondents are clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">For any elicitation, it is expected that all experts would have the required substantive expertise (knowledge on the relevant topic), but the level of normative expertise (the ability to make quantitative judgements) would vary greatly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There is a risk that participants using distance elicitation, who have the intended expertise but not the skills to adequately formulate their opinion or even use the provided elicitation tool, do not complete the task. However, if they are assisted by a facilitator, they would be able to provide their opinion as probability distributions. This could lead to a possible bias in any aggregation of the individual distributions.</p><p id="Par22">The aim of the study was to assess the practicality of a self-administered elicitation tool by exploring whether the elicited beliefs of the experts were influenced by the mode of elicitation (face-to-face with a facilitator vs. distance self-administered). Response rates among experts agreeing to participate, and time taken to complete the task, were also compared for the two modes. We hypothesised that, although potentially victim to a lower response rate, the distance approach would produce a higher number of complete responses, due to a larger potential sample than face-to-face elicitation.</p><p id="Par23">The objectives of the study were to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par24">develop a tool for the self-administration of an elicitation task;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">qualitatively compare probability distributions elicited from experts via face-to-face interviews with those elicited via email;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">compare feasibility of the two modes of administration in terms of trading off response rates and time taken to complete elicitation for access to more experts.</p></list-item></list>

Consequently, the elicitation was aimed at a group of health professionals that were numerous: general practitioners (GPs).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The EXPLICIT elicitation tool</title><p id="Par39">An elicitation tool was necessary for the elicitation sessions, which experts could use by themselves with some assistance (in face-to-face elicitation) or no assistance (in distance elicitation). Among the readily available elicitation tools, none was directly usable in this study, as they were generally intended for specific fields or covered only the encoding part of the elicitation. The tools, briefly described below, were used to help develop a bespoke elicitation tool. Devilee and Knol 2012 reviewed available elicitation packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]., and found limited support available in the tools for experts, including a lack of preparation of the expert for the elicitation task.</p><p id="Par40">Tools to be used with a facilitator include the SHELF (SHeffield ELicitation Framework) tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which uses R and provides visual representations based on summaries provided. Although it could be used for individual face-to-face elicitation, it is mainly intended for group elicitation. The Bias Elicitation in Evidence Synthesis (BEES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] tool is a graphical interface for bias elicitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], limited to the elicitation of 67% confidence intervals on a log scale. Elicitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and Expert CALIBRation (EXCALIBUR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] are specifically intended to be used in environmental risk assessment, and provide limited ways in which to specify distributions and, most importantly, require a great deal of specific knowledge to deploy and use.</p><p id="Par41">More recently, tools have been developed for remote elicitation. The MATCH Uncertainty Elicitation Tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] was developed as a web-based interface for SHELF. Pibouleau et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] describe another web-based interface for the hybrid encoding method, while others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] have reported using Excel-based questionnaires that were circulated by email. Sperber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] improved on this concept by integrating visual and quantitative feedback and a short introduction to the elicitation context.</p><p id="Par42">The elicitation tool needed for this study had to fulfil several requirements:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par43">be able to be used by the expert in the absence of a facilitator;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">be used on different platforms;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">ensure the preparation of the expert for the elicitation session (i.e. ensure the expert is given the required information and training to complete the elicitation task);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">ensure that good elicitation practice is observed;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">control for potential risks of bias in the elicitation.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par48">To fulfil these requirements, an Excel-based tool (<bold>&#x0201c;EXPLICIT&#x0201d;, EXPert eLICItation Tool</bold>) was developed. EXPLICIT was based on the Excel template used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which allowed for visual feedback to the expert and real-time fitting of smooth parametric distributions to the histogram based on the expert&#x02019;s summaries.</p><p id="Par49">However, the previous tool was designed to be operated by a facilitator during the elicitation session. The role of the facilitator included explaining the context and instructing the expert on how to express his/her uncertainty, and ensure that the summaries the expert gave were coherent and had face validity. These steps were subsequently implemented in the EXPLICIT tool.</p><p id="Par50">EXPLICIT prepares the expert for the elicitation task, displays the questions, records the answers, provides visual feedback to the expert, and checks the consistency of the estimates.</p><p id="Par51">EXPLICIT has three sections: introduction, training and questionnaire. The introductory section contains general information about the tool and the study, and an electronic consent form. The training section contains:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par52">short introduction to probability assessment including:</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">explanation of probability, proportions, uncertainty, probability distributions;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">examples of probability distributions given in response to a fictional question;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par55">instructions on how to provide expert opinion using EXPLICIT and an opportunity to complete an <bold>example question</bold> (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par56">summary screen, where the expert is made aware of common potential biases and is encouraged to control for them.</p></list-item></list>

</p><p id="Par57">While many encoding methods can be implemented in EXPLICIT, the method implemented for this study was the hybrid method (previously described as &#x0201c;four complementary intervals&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). It was chosen as it allows for intuitive understanding of what the distribution represents since it is based on the probability density function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The hybrid method is more flexible than fixed interval methods (like the histogram technique), so allows the recording of distributions for both proportions and scalar quantities. A review of practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] showed that it has often been applied in HTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], experts have expressed a preference for the hybrid method compared to the histogram method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">In the hybrid method, three estimates of the quantity of interest are initially elicited: the lower limit &#x0201c;L&#x0201d;, the upper limit &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; and the mode &#x0201c;M&#x0201d;; the intervals M-L and H-M are each divided in half and the expert is asked to allocate the probability of the event in question to each of the resulting four intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par59">The questionnaire section collects elicited summaries, verifies their consistency, encodes them as a histogram and ensures that the expert is satisfied with the representation of their estimate (i.e. face validity).

Even among the experts who explicitly agreed to participate, some dropped out of the study before completing the elicitation session. Recruiting through snowballing was more successful than approaching potential participants through the official research and training organisations. Some participants commented that this might be because official channels were saturated with various requests and many GPs would ignore messages not directly related to their activity. Another possible barrier to recruitment in the early stages was the lack of incentives for the participants. Towards the end of the recruiting period, a new invitation to participate was circulated where the focus was changed from the methods explored to the drinking behaviours topic, which recognised the potential for learning more about representing uncertainty. This might have contributed to more participants joining the study towards the end. Nonetheless, our approach to sampling, as well as the relatively small number of respondents, limit the generalisability of the findings.</p><p id="Par91">It took longer to obtain data from the email participants than it took to schedule meetings in the face-to-face arm contrary to the hypothesis that email would result in more responses more quickly. A possible explanation is that the email participants were less motivated to engage in and complete the elicitation, because the objective and its deadline were perceived as very abstract. In contrast, by scheduling a time for the elicitation session, the objective was clearer for the participants in the face-to-face group. These findings seem to confirm the evidence collected previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] regarding practical issues with the duration of expert recruitment.</p><p id="Par92">Our findings show that it took longer for experts to complete the elicitation session by email than in face-to-face sessions. Participants in the email arm spent more time on both the training part and the questionnaire sessions than the face-to-face arm. The differences were, however, only a few minutes. Facilitation may have helped by increasing the confidence of the participants in the face-to-face arm. All of the sessions (whether face-to-face or distance) were completed in a reasonable time. One of the possible reasons for the good rate of successful elicitation sessions was the elicitation tool, which achieved a good balance of instructions and tasks, while also managing the cognitive burden of the exercise.</p><p id="Par93">The individual distributions elicited in the face-to-face and distance arms were comparable. The distributions elicited by email were more uncertain, with wider intervals; however the means were more grouped together than in the face-to-face arm. It is unclear if this was an effect of different approaches, or a difference in the participating experts, for instance, the difference in familiarity with statistics as rated by the experts. When combining individual distributions for each arm, the aggregated distributions were still comparable. These findings were similar to existing studies exploring self-administered elicitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We did not perform further quantitative comparisons of the distributions; however, given the context of a decision model used for HTA purposes, the ultimate practical comparison should have been a comparison of model outputs when the model is informed by each of the distributions.</p><p id="Par94">Because of the computer-assisted nature of the task, it was possible, in theory, to favour the recruitment of experts who had better computer literacy, but not necessarily &#x0201c;better&#x0201d; expertise. However, to compensate the impact of selection bias, the elicitation question addressed a relatively common phenomenon that most GPs were believed to be able to express in a quantitative way. A &#x02018;Think Aloud&#x02019; analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] would have provided deeper insight into the interaction with the tool and respondents&#x02019; choices; this was not done as part of the study, but such a protocol is been prepared for the future development of EXPLICIT.</p><p id="Par95">Another potential source of bias is the recording of inconsistent distributions. This is a risk especially with distance elicitation. EXPLICIT limited the possibility of this situation occurring by doing several real-time consistency checks to the summaries introduced by the experts. However, EXPLICIT does not prevent the expert from building a highly skewed distribution, even when common sense might suggest a normal distribution. Arguably, for facilitated sessions, such situations could be discussed between the facilitator and the experts, leading to a more consistent distribution, but this was not possible for email elicitations.</p><p id="Par96">Finally, distance elicitation does not have to be completely devoid of facilitation. This study attempted to isolate the impact of facilitation by only providing it in the distance arm through the elicitation tool. It would be possible, however, to provide facilitation by phone or in a video-conference to an expert. Scheduling phone calls to take the expert through the elicitation exercise might also increase the chances of obtaining the responses in a timely manner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par97">Outcomes were comparable between the face-to-face and email elicitation groups. Recruiting is, however, a key issue and the potential experts must be vigorously pursued, especially in a time-limited HTA context, regardless of whether the session is conducted face-to-face or remotely; this is an even more critical issue if the experts are scarce. Remote self-administered elicitation can be a viable approach when experts are not immediately available for a face-to-face session and EXPLICIT can be used successfully to achieve this, possibly at the expense of poorer response rates and additional time needed for the elicitation sessions.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BEES</term><def><p id="Par6">Bias Elicitation in Evidence Synthesis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EXCALIBUR</term><def><p id="Par7">Expert CALIBRation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EXPLICIT</term><def><p id="Par8">EXPert eLICItation Tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p id="Par9">General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SHELF</term><def><p id="Par10">SHeffield ELicitation Framework</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p id="Par11">United Kingdom</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the experts who agreed to participate in the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par98">This paper presents independent research funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) for the South West Peninsula.
