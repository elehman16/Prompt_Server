Background</title><p>A biological incident can be described as an overt or covert natural, accidental or deliberate release of a biological agents (<xref rid="A25607R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="A25607R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Occurrence of natural or intentional infectious disease emergencies (bioterrorism) is a significant challenge for healthcare providers. Nurses play a key role in this regard. So, they should have the necessary skills to prepare and protect themselves, their patients and families from becoming infected (<xref rid="A25607R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The competency of all nurses and healthcare providers should be evaluated to provide safe care, protect people, and maintain the credibility of nurses (<xref rid="A25607R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Gebbie and Merrill define competency as a &#x0201c;combination of knowledge, attitude, and skills demonstrated by the healthcare personnel&#x0201d; (<xref rid="A25607R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Competencies are actions which are visible in the implementation of a task. On the other hand, competencies are applied skills and knowledge that enable people to perform work. The traditional approach to education and training is to determine what contents should be learned and taught, and then assess if the content has been learned. A research in education supports the transition to competency-based training, which is alignment of training with the outcomes and assessment of personnel performance in relation to specific work conditions (<xref rid="A25607R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The initial set of emergency preparedness competency was developed by the Columbia university school of nursing in 2002. These competencies were subsequently approved and adopted by CDC (center for disease control and prevention) (<xref rid="A25607R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Health resources and services administration assists awardees in shifting from content-focused training toward competency-based training. For example, hospital staff would be expected to be able to describe and demonstrate their roles in emergency response instead of acquiring content knowledge about smallpox or anthrax (<xref rid="A25607R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Nurse&#x02019;s educational competency for mass casualty incidents (MCIs) was developed by the International nursing collation for mass casualty education (INCMCE) (<xref rid="A25607R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Competency can be achieved not only via formal training, but also through experience, performance support systems, and service trainings. In formal training programs, acquiring competency may have require that classroom experience be complemented by opportunities for practice (<xref rid="A25607R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The studies carried out in this regard show that there is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of training interventions for emergency preparedness (<xref rid="A25607R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Based on the world health organization (WHO) reports , pandemic swine influenza and the future risk of inducing surge of pandemic avian flu (WHO, 2005) (<xref rid="A25607R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="A25607R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Also, the chance of influenza transmission increases in epidemics. Because of concerns about the ongoing pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and the potential for transmission in crowded settings such as the Hajj, and Umra (<xref rid="A25607R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In Iran, a country with a lot of refugees, frequent visits to crowded cities and holy places of pilgrimage increase the risks. So, it is necessary to increase the surge capacity as well as competence and preparedness of healthcare personnel. Nurses are in a key position of the healthcare system and are first points of medical contact (<xref rid="A25607R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Miller and Jackson examined the effectiveness of a multimedia instructional module versus a traditional lecture method in the education of pharmaceutical students and their survey results showed that the two methods of teaching had similar effect (<xref rid="A25607R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Some researchers like Jenkins et al. (<xref rid="A25607R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Gallagher et al. (<xref rid="A25607R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) found that an electronically-based teaching method was more efficient than traditional-lecture based. Gallagher et al. (<xref rid="A25607R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) compared two delivery web-based formats with traditional classroom instruction in gerontology for gerontological courses in dental hygiene curricula.</p></sec><sec id="sec129018"><title>2.

Materials and Methods</title><p>In a quasi-experimental study, the effect of education on nurse&#x02019;s competency in biological incidents was assessed (biological incidents knowledge and attitude). At first, a biological incidents curriculum was planned using the 3-round-Delphi method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24574">Figure 1</xref>). In a descriptive survey, curriculum development we are used via 3-rounds of Delphi&#x02019;s method by e-mail, fax and post and face to face follow-up, with expert group collaboration. Two open-ended questions were used in the first round and a semi-structured framework was created based-on the previous round results. Then, preparedness domains, topics and hours necessary for each topic were identified. The results showed that there were three main domains for preparing nurses against biological incidents including overviews, treatment and caring; then safety and prophylaxis and finally required preparedness management. The experts&#x02019; consensus achievements were 35 course topics in the three main domains determining 34 hours equal to 2-code courses (<xref rid="A25607R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The training objectives (cognitive and affective domains) were taken into account via Bloom&#x02019;s taxonomy. A part of the designed curriculum was used to provide training content for two methods of teaching (lecture and multimedia-CD) with a pretest/posttest program.</p><fig id="fig24574" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Delphi&#x02019;s Method for Curriculum Development</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="traumamon-20-25607-i001"/></fig><sec id="sec129019"><title>3.1.

Discussion</title><p>Both methods of teaching resulted in positive shifts in knowledge and attitude. The results showed that the two employed methods of teaching were effective in preparedness (cognitive and affective domains) as well as in competency, i.e., the scores of both groups improved after the interventions. The two interventions had similar effects. Aly et al. (<xref rid="A25607R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and Jeffries et al. (<xref rid="A25607R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) also reported the same findings. Aly et al. compared instructional multimedia program versus lecture for teaching the undergraduate orthodontic curriculum (<xref rid="A25607R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Jeffries et al. also compared the efficacy of an interactive multimedia CD-ROM with usual methods of education on the skill of performing a 12-lead ECG Electrocardiogram in baccalaureate nursing students in a required senior-level critical-care course at a large Midwestern university in the United States. There were no significant difference in pretest scores between the two groups and no significant differences by group in cognitive gains, student satisfaction with their learning method, or perception of self-efficacy in performing the skill. General results revealed that both groups were satisfied with their educational method and were the same in their ability to display skills in live properly, simulated patient. This evaluation study is an initial step to assess recent and potentially more cost-effective education methods and their effects on student learning consequences and behaviors, including the transfer of skill acquisition via a computer simulation to a real patient (<xref rid="A25607R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Miller and Jackson examined the effectiveness of a multimedia instructional module versus a traditional lecture in the education of pharmaceutical students (<xref rid="A25607R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). There are some other surveys in which an electronic teaching method compared with a traditional lecture method. Gordon et al compared simulator-based teaching with traditional instruction method among clinical medical students (<xref rid="A25607R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Howerton et al. compared computer-assisted instruction (CAI) with lecture method, using recent hardware and advanced software techniques in university of north Carolina (UNC) for dental students passing introductory radiology course (<xref rid="A25607R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Also, Halloran assessed the differences in the success between a control group taught by Traditional Classroom Lecture (TCL) and an experimental group using computer-managed (CMI) and keypad questions in nursing education (<xref rid="A25607R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Moreover, Cropleycompared the use of Traditional Lecture Method (TLM) and CAI in teaching congenital heart disease (CHD) to associate degree nursing (AND) students. The finding of the study showed that both TLM and CAI are same effective when teach students about CHD. This study have the same results that found in the 1999 study (<xref rid="A25607R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Finally, Jenkins et al. compared CAI versus TLM for medical students in the teaching of dermatological morphology. However, some researchers found that electronically-based teaching method was more efficient than traditional-lecture based (<xref rid="A25607R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Gallagher et al. compared two delivery web-based formats with traditional classroom instruction in gerontology for gerontological courses in dental hygiene curricula (<xref rid="A25607R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Abutarbush et al. evaluated traditional instruction versus a self-learning-computer module in teaching veterinary students that how to insert nasogastric tube in horses (<xref rid="A25607R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In a study by Terndrup et al. (<xref rid="A25607R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) screensavers were developed and tested in an emergency ward for rotating senior medical students and medical interns. Screensavers were designed as &#x0201c;billboards&#x0201d; to attract the subjects&#x02019; attention towards the educational domain. Five rotating images sequenced at five second intervals incorporated a teaser question in an interactive toolbar. The interactive toolbar was linked to a website that provided content on smallpox and anthrax for hospital-based specialties. The results showed that screensavers and website combination deployed on computers significantly increased the percentage of correct responses to five standardized bioterrorism questions in the emergency department. Screensavers and websites can be used to increase awareness of bioterrorism (<xref rid="A25607R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In other studies, Song et al. (<xref rid="A25607R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and Terndrup et al. (<xref rid="A25607R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) also compared the efficacy of web-based diabetes self-management education for recently diagnosed patients with type II diabetes as an alternative to the lecture-method group. The results revealed the superiority of the web-based program over lecture-method for diabetes self-management education (<xref rid="A25607R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A25607R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). As to the global appeal to distance learning effects, there was a project sponsored by the agency for healthcare research and quality (AHRQ) to develop a competency-based education approach called &#x0201c;noncontinuous education&#x0201d; as a method for educational hospital staff, the skills demanded to respond to bioterrorism or other broadly general health incidents. Competency-based education increases the relationship between training and workforce applicability. The concepts of non-continuous education have borrowed from the U.S. navy&#x02019;s afloat training practice and management system. A Naval ship is similar to a hospital in disaster emergency training in that you just could not stop a ship through a training day and then let it go again; similarly, hospitals cannot stop their normal functions to take part in an operation (<xref rid="A25607R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, multimedia CD and traditional lecture were effective methods on nurses&#x02019; teaching curricula that increase their knowledge and create positive shift in their attitude. The two methods had equal effects on improving competency and preparedness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all participants (nurses, managers and supervisors of Jamaran and Baqiyatallah hospitals) for their cooperation.
