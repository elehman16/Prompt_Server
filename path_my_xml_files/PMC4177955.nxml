Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and the rate of thromboembolic events with prophylactic enoxaparin sodium.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>Patients were eligible who had measurable, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and normal bilirubin. All patients received anticoagulation. Docetaxel (35 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and irinotecan (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were administered once a week for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest (Arm A) alone or with the addition of cetuximab (Arm B). The primary endpoint was response rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 87 eligible patients were enrolled and treated. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 74% of patients in Arm A and 76% in Arm B. The principal grade 3/4 toxicity was diarrhea. Response rates were 4.5% in Arm A and 7% in Arm B. Median PFS and OS were 3.9 and 6.5 months in Arm A and 4.5 and 5.4 months in Arm B.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Docetaxel/irinotecan combination is associated with considerable toxicity. Objective responses were infrequent and addition of cetuximab in an unselected population was not beneficial, but PFS and OS were comparable with those achieved with other regimens.

Measurable disease, defined as at least 1 primary or metastatic lesion measurable in at least 1 dimension within 4 weeks before randomization, was required. Patients were required to have ECOG performance status of 0 to 1, ability to provide informed consent, no concomitant medical problems that could interfere with the ability to receive therapy, absolute neutrophil count &#x02265;1500 cells/&#x003bc;L, and platelet count &#x0003e;100,000/&#x003bc;L. Estimated creatinine clearance &#x0003e;60 mL/min was required. Patients were eligible who had normal bilirubin, and AST and ALT&#x0003c;2.5&#x000d7; the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase could be 4&#x000d7; ULN if transaminases were normal.

The protocol and consent form were approved by the institutional review boards.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment Plan</title><p>CT scan of the chest and abdomen were obtained within the 3 weeks before initiating treatment. Laboratory studies, CA19-9, ECG, chest x-ray, and HIV screening were completed within 2 weeks of initiating treatment.</p><p>Patients received enoxaparin sodium (Sanofi-Aventis), 40 mg subcutaneously, from start of treatment through completion of protocol therapy as prophylaxis against visceral and deep venous thrombosis, unless they were already receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients received dexamethasone (8 mg) orally 12 hours before and 12 hours after docetaxel to reduce the risk of docetaxel-induced fluid retention. Dexamethasone (10 mg) was also given orally as premedication along with antiemetics. Oral antiemetic therapy was prescribed and patients were instructed on the intensive use of loperamide in the event of diarrhea.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><sec><title>Treatment Arm A: Combination Chemotherapy</title><p>Docetaxel (35 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) (Sanofi-Aventis) was administered intravenously over 60 minutes. After the completion of the docetaxel infusion, irinotecan (Pfizer) was administered intravenously over 30 minutes at a dose of 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Chemotherapy was administered once a week (days 1, 8, 15, and 22) for 4 consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks rest.

Dose modifications were to be made to docetaxel dosing for hypersensitivity, neutropenia, or hepatic toxicity. For patients who retained no fluid but suffered excess dexamethasone toxicity, dexamethasone could be tapered to eliminate the 12-hour prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy doses. Modifications to irinotecan dosing were mandated for neutropenia and diarrhea. If treatment was held in week 4 due to toxicity, therapy was also held week 5 and the subsequent cycle started 1 week early.

Secondary endpoints were PFS, OS, toxicity, the rate of thromboembolic events when prophylactic enoxaparin sodium is administered, and the proportion of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer whose tumors overexpress EGFR. A comparison between arms was not formally planned due to limited power.</p><p>The overall accrual goal for E8200 was 92 patients (84 eligible patients); 46 patients each (42 eligible patients per arm) were to be randomized equally to the irinotecan/docetaxel and the irinotecan/docetaxel plus cetuximab arms. We expected a 5% hypersensitivity rate in the cetuximab arm, thus an additional 3 patients were added to the accrual goal of both arms in an attempt to ensure at least 40 eligible treated patients on Arm B.</p><p>A true response rate of &#x02265;20% in either arm would provide evidence of activity. For both arms, the null hypothesis was that the true response rate is &#x02264;5%. The trial had a 2-stage design in each arm.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> At the initial stage, 22 patients were to be entered on each arm. If at least 2 responses were seen among the first 20 eligible patients of an arm, 24 additional patients were to be entered on that arm. If at least 4 responses were observed among the 42 eligible patients on either arm, then the specified treatment would be considered promising. A toxicity monitoring plan was in place throughout the period of accrual.</p><p>This analysis reports on the data as of May 21, 2008.

Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for OS and PFS.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> OS was defined as time from registration to death from any cause. PFS was defined as the shorter of: (a) the time from registration to progression or (b) the time from registration to death without documentation of progression given that the death occurs within 4 months of the last disease assessment, or registration, whichever is more recent. These cases are censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, or registration. Data from the 87 eligible and treated patients were used to conduct all analyses in this report with the exception of the analyses related to toxicity, which used data from all 91 treated patients irrespective of eligibility (46 Arm A, 45 Arm B).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>The trial accrued 94 patients between July 2003 and April 2006.

An exploratory analysis of baseline thrombosis status and outcome was undertaken. Baseline thrombosis was defined by the presence of any of the following at baseline: (a) visceral thrombosis present on CT, (b) splenic vein occlusion present on CT, (c) history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or (d) indication of thrombosis or embolism on the baseline toxicity form. Complete data were available for 79 of the 87 eligible and treated patients.

One patient among the 44 eligible and treated in Arm A (2.3%) had a confirmed complete response. This patient was alive at last follow-up. A substantial number of patients were not evaluated for response, largely due to clinical deterioration. One patient on each arm began nonprotocol therapy before restaging.</p></sec><sec><title>CA19-9</title><p>The median CA19-9 level at registration was 1075 U/mL. Patients who had elevated baseline CA19-9 versus normal baseline CA19-9, and those with CA19-9 above the median versus all others, exhibited shorter PFS and OS. Seventy-nine of the 87 (91%) patients had at least 1 follow-up CA19-9 evaluation reported.

Significant differences in the expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1, ribonucleoside reductase subunit M1, and excision repair cross-complementing gene-1 expression have been documented in pancreatic cancer, and are related to prognosis.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In this context, our demonstration that docetaxel/irinotecan combination therapy has modest activity in treatment-naive metastatic pancreatic cancer may provide another option in future trials of pharmacogenomically determined therapy in this disease.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study was response rate, and the response rates observed were low. Nonetheless, the rate of CA19-9 decline, time to progression, and survival results of the present study suggest activity. The median PFS of 3.9 and 4.5 months in Arms A and B, respectively, compare favorably to the historical experience with gemcitabine or gemcitabine/erlotinib.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Diarrhea, neutropenic infection, and treatment-related death were observed in each arm of the study and median survivals were not equivalent to those achieved with FOLFIRINOX; thus, the regimen cannot be recommended in unselected patients outside of a clinical trial.</p><p>The median OS in the cetuximab arm seemed less favorable than the OS in Arm A. Given the small size of the current study, which was not powered for comparisons between the arms, conclusions regarding the significance of this observation cannot be drawn; possible explanations include differences in use of second-line therapy with gemcitabine or gemcitabine/erlotinib driven by investigator bias or the patients&#x02019; toxicity profiles, and chance. The possibility of accelerated disease progression following cetuximab withdrawal cannot be discounted. Such disease acceleration following discontinuation of an EGFR inhibitor has been described in non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Docetaxel and irinotecan combination therapy produces a low objective response rate, and is associated with considerable toxicity. The regimen may add to treatment options for comparison in pharmacogenomically driven trial designs. The addition of cetuximab did not seem to add survival benefit to this regimen in this unselected patient population; addition of cetuximab may also have increased toxicity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supported by Grant CA-23318, awarded by the National Cancer Institute, DHHS; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Sanofi; and Pharmacia.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Dr Burtness reports having served as a consultant for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sanofi-Aventis, Imclone, Lilly and Pharmacia.
