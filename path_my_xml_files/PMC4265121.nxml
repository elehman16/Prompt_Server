Eligibility criteria included type 1 diabetes (WHO criteria) for at least 6&#x02005;months, insulin pump therapy with good knowledge of insulin dose adjustment by carers, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) below 108&#x02005;mmol/mol (12%). Exclusion criteria were any physical or psychological disease likely to interfere with the normal conduct of the study and data interpretation or current treatment with drugs likely to interfere with glucose metabolism.</p><p>Participants attended the clinical research facility for two overnight periods, 2&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks apart, with identical study protocol performed on both occasions. On one occasion, participants underwent closed-loop therapy using diluted insulin (20&#x02005;IU/mL) and on the other occasion closed loop with standard insulin strength (100&#x02005;IU/mL).

Plasma glucose levels were maintained between 70 and 145&#x02005;mg/dL for 72% and 83% of the time using closed loop with standard and diluted insulin, respectively, and mean glucose was 122&#x02005;mg/dL during both interventions. No episodes of hypoglycemia requiring treatment occurred over 22 study nights.</p><p>The present study builds on previous observations in older children and adolescents about benefits of overnight closed-loop therapy using the model predictive control at the clinical research facility<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and in the unsupervised home settings.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In the present study, we document good glucose control in younger children, who may greatly benefit from closed-loop therapy. Similar results in terms of proportion of time spent in the target range and in hypoglycemia were obtained in this age group as compared with older children and adolescents.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The daily management of diabetes in a young child is complicated by amplified responsiveness to insulin, increased risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia, high glucose variability and unpredictability of food intake and physical activity. While the avoidance of hypoglycemia is a crucial concern, chronic hyperglycemia and glucose variability have been suggested to be equally detrimental for brain development and may affect cognition.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Children younger than 4&#x02005;years were found to spend more than 4&#x02005;h/day with glucose levels greater than 250&#x02005;mg/dL when continuous glucose monitoring was applied.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Similarly, no evidence of improved glycemic control with insulin pump therapy has been demonstrated in younger children<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> possibly owing to the small number of studies targeting this age group.</p><p>Closed-loop insulin delivery using a proportional-integral-derivative approach in children younger than 7&#x02005;years was investigated by Dauber <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> documenting reduced overnight exposure to hyperglycemia as compared with conventional insulin pump therapy. Although closed loop was not associated with improvements in the time spent in target or with reduced frequency of hypoglycemia, the study was the first to evaluate closed-loop therapy in younger children.</p><p>The novelty of our study is the use of diluted insulin to enhance the accuracy of delivery of small insulin doses. When compared with standard insulin strength, diluted insulin during closed-loop therapy tended to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia as evaluated by the low blood glucose index (p=0.050) and time spent in hypoglycemia less than 70&#x02005;mg/dL (p=0.161). Sensor-based assessment of hypoglycemia showed a significant reduction in the time spent in hypoglycemia below 63&#x02005;mg/dL (p=0.028) and the low blood glucose index (p=0.026) suggesting that sensor errors attenuated the differences when outcomes were measured by reference plasma glucose.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Sensor accuracy data are sparse in this young age group. Episodes of asymptomatic self-resolving mild hypoglycemia tended to be lower during closed loop using diluted insulin (p=0.09).</p><p>We observed a tendency towards reduced glycemic variability during closed loop with diluted insulin. The median CV of glucose was 20% during closed loop with diluted insulin versus 32% when standard strength insulin was used (p=0.075). Other measures of glucose variability confirmed this trend (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJDRC2014000040TB1">table 1</xref>). These CVs are lower than those reported by Tsalikian <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> who observed a median CV of glucose between 35% and 45% in children younger than 4&#x02005;years using continuous glucose monitoring, and by Slover <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> during sensor-augmented pump therapy. Glycemic variability has been inconsistently associated with the risk of vascular complications in diabetes.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In younger children, increased glycemic variability along with chronic exposure to hyperglycemia have been recently found to be associated with changes in the brain's white matter.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>We chose a dilution so that the volume of insulin scales from 10&#x02005;U/day of standard strength insulin to 50&#x02005;U/day of diluted insulin, a common amount applicable in adults. The latter converts to basal insulin delivery of about 1&#x02005;U/h, a rate at which accuracy of insulin pump is assessed and optimized. A greater dilution may further increase accuracy by limiting the effect of microbubbles and to overcome tissue pressure build-up but greater dilutions may be an issue in children requiring a larger amount of insulin due to pain at the cannula site.</p><p>The strength of the study is the randomized study design. The lack of control therapy is a limitation motivated by practical reasons to reduce burden for young participants and taking into account existing evidence of suboptimal glycemic control with frequent hyperglycemic excursions<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and undetected hypoglycemia<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> in younger children on standard therapy. We carried out a post hoc analysis and although detailed information on children's schedule at home, that is, the time of evening meal/bedtime the night before the study was not available, our data showed that glucose control during conventional pump therapy in the home settings appeared inferior to that obtained during closed-loop therapy using standard as well as diluted insulin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJDRC2014000040TB2">table 2</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the present exploratory study suggests that closed-loop insulin delivery using the model predictive control approach is safe and efficacious to maintain overnight glycemic control in young children with type 1 diabetes. Closed-loop therapy using insulin dilution tended to reduce hypoglycemia and glycemic variability as compared to closed loop with standard insulin strength. The use of insulin dilution to enhance accuracy of insulin delivery may be explored in larger studies. Difficulties related to the use of insulin dilution, that is, the need to prepare diluted insulin every 7&#x02013;14&#x02005;days and the availability of specific software on insulin pumps to avoid dosing errors, may also need to be taken into account. Our findings support research into closed-loop therapy in preschool children, who may greatly benefit from this novel therapeutic approach.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the study volunteers for their participation and to staff at the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility for their help in conducting the studies.
