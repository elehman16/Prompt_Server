We previously provided evidence to support this recommendation by completing a single-arm clinical trial in which we provided institutionalized seniors with bread fortified each day with 125&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (5,000&#x000a0;IU) of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

Here we report the long-term follow-up of study subjects at 1 and 3&#x000a0;years after discontinuing the clinical trial.

At the end of the one-year supplementation protocol (consumption of bread buns fortified with 5,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> per daily serving) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], 33 patients were assessed by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (January 2005). Initial and final bone mineral density (BMD) data were available for 33 subjects. These patients were retested by DXA one and three years after the vitamin D protocol was discontinued (January 2006 and January 2008, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>In the original study, all subjects received 125&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (5,000&#x000a0;IU) vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/day and 800&#x000a0;mg calcium carbonate/day (320&#x000a0;mg of elemental calcium) for 1&#x000a0;yr.</p><p>Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur was measured at baseline and after 12&#x000a0;months of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

Serum intact PTH was measured by an enzyme-amplified &#x0201c;two-step&#x0201d; sandwich-type immunoassay (DSL, Webster, Texas, USA) with an inter-assay CV ranging from 6.0 to 6.3% (normal range for adults 40-70&#x000a0;years of age, pg/ml). The BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and trochanter were measured by dual energy x-ray absorbtiometry (Hologic, Delfi A and Delfi W). The calibration of bone densitometer was performed by scanning the European Spine Phantom. All measurements were performed by the same experienced technician.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago). Data are expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD. The distributions of all variables were tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Descriptive statistics (mean and SD) were determined for all variables. Effects of the follow-up after the vitamin D protocol was completed were examined using the paired t-test versus the &#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d; values for each subject, which in the context of the present follow-up report are those values obtained at the end of the 1-yr intervention with vitamin D-fortified bread. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to explore the impact of sex and age on outcome variables (lumbar and hip BMD, concentrations of serum calcium, 25(OH)D, and PTH).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characteristics of the population</title><p>Thirty-three older nursing home residents were included into the follow-up study, which represents the population of participants having completed the Vitamin D fortified bread intervention.

Until the end of this follow-up, there was no compelling reason to provide more vitamin D. Although it was reassuring that at follow-up Year 1, the serum 25(OH)D was appropriate for the group, the data at follow-up Year 3 show that 25(OH)D had not established its new plateau. Previous studies suggests that when vitamin D supplementation is stopped, the serum 25(OH)D concentrations exhibit an apparent half-life of two months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the decline in serum 25(OH)D observed here exceeded 1&#x000a0;year (i.e. the decline exceeded six of the presumptive 2-month half-life); therefore, the apparent half life can be substantially longer than what has been previously estimated. One reason for a longer apparent half-life of the decline in serum 25(OH)D, compared to a tracer 25(OH)D compound, is because firstly, unmetabolised vitamin D is released from tissue stores built up during vitamin D supplementation, and secondly, there is a background of newly acquired vitamin D from the environment or diet that continues to be generate 25(OH)D.</p><p>At one year after the end of the clinical trial, the group as a whole met the 50&#x000a0;nmol/L criterion for serum 25(OH)D as recently established by US Institute of Medicine. While this was apparently reassuring, the further decline in 25(OH)D shown here emphasizes the need for sustained awareness and monitoring of vitamin D status in nursing home residents. Follow-up reports after discontinuation of vitamin D and calcium supplementation are sparse. One report of a similar population that was provided lower doses of vitamin D, showed that bone turnover markers had returned to baseline by two years after discontinuation, but serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The present report is to our knowledge the longest follow-up after discontinuation of vitamin D, and it does show a sustained biochemical benefit to the one-year point, in that the serum 25(OH)D exceeded 50&#x000a0;nmol/L. However, by follow-up Year 3, the benefits of vitamin D fortification, were essentially gone. At follow-up Year 1, PTH had increased significantly from the end-of-vitamin D baseline. At follow-up Year 3, there was evidence that bone loss had progressed at the hip, but since there was no reference group in this study, the bone loss may reflect the normal age-related decline. The strength of this study is in its 3-yr characterization of the progression of the decline in 25(OH)D in older adults who had before-hand, received enough vitamin D to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations that most would consider to be in the optimal range. Among the weaknesses of this work is the lack of a reference group against which to compare the variables studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In retrospect, it is unfortunate that the serum 25(OH)D concentrations eventually returned to the osteomalacic levels present before the subjects initially entered the bread-fortification clinical trial. Lessons learned here are, firstly, that vitamin D nutritional status exhibits a long half-life in the body, whereby follow-up testing even at 1&#x000a0;year after a change in dose may not reflect a true plateau (i.e. steady-state) value; and secondly, that when a need for nutrient is established, even if this recognition is as part of a research protocol, then the appropriate action is to institute corrective measures beyond the extent of the research protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows: VM principal investigator, study concept and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of the data, drafting of the manuscript; RV study concept and design, analysis and interpretation of the data; critical revision of the manuscript.
