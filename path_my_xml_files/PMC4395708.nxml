rehabilitational sliding machine training and ergometer bicycle training on the balance
and gait of patients with stroke. [Subjects] Forty patients with hemiplegia resulting from
stroke were divided into a sliding training group (STG, n=20) and ergometer bicycle
training group (ETG, n=20). [Methods] STG and ETG respectively performed rehabilitational
sliding training and cycle ergometer training in 30 minute sessions, five times a week,
for a total of eight weeks. [Results] The balance and gait ability of both groups
significantly improved. Both groups showed improvements in balance and gait ability, and
the ETG showed anterior and posterior ranges of the limit of stability following standing.

at increasing a patient&#x02019;s balance and gait ability during nontreatment time in their daily
time without therapist.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitational sliding training</kwd><kwd>Ergometer bicycle training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with hemiplegia resulting from stroke adopt an asymmetric position that places a
smaller load on the lower extremity of the paretic side in a standing position due to
factors such as reduction of muscle strength, impaired sense of balance, excessive stretch
reflex, joint contraction of the antagonistic muscles, and decrease in motor control
ability. An asymmetric posture triggers gait disturbance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, patients who are hemiplegic resulting from stroke
have difficulty with balance and gait because of problems with the lower extremities. As a
result, they have disability in standing and in their gait, and their postural sway in a
standing posture is twice as high as that of healthy people of the same age range<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also their limit of stability, defined as
the maximal distance the center of gravity and move while maintaining balance without
detaching the feet from the ground, decreases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is essential to increase the lower extremity muscle strength in order to maximize the
functional recovery of stroke patients and heighten their quality of life<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. There has been much research on the balance
and gait ability of patients related to their lower extremity muscle strength, movement, and
function. In order to increase the muscle strength of stroke patients&#x02019; lower extremities,
weight equipment<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, an elastic band<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and isometric equipment<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> have been employed. Using a tilt table
composed of a rail system and a carriage with wheels, Trees et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a weight load exercise for four burn patients who
had difficulty with weight load training in a standing position, and reported improvement in
their lower extremity muscle strength. Byun et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> used a sliding rehabilitation machine to treat patients with
hemiplegia resulting from a stroke and reported that the patients&#x02019; muscle strength,
spasticity, gait ability, balance ability, and activities of daily living improved. Bicycle
exercise, which is a cyclic leg exercise, enhances leg muscle strength, and this increase in
muscle strength improves the body&#x02019;s activity ability and elicits a balanced development of
the body<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Leg exercise using a bicycle
in a sitting position is a bilateral method, which integrates assistive positive training,
and induces alternating movement of the paretic side leg with the help of the nonparetic
lower limb<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Limb-loaded cycling demands
the coordinated movement of a weight between the paretic and nonparetic sides and the
generation of physical strength by the lower limbs during an extended period, and it
provides weight load ability through the practice of gait techniques<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined the effects of training using a sliding rehabilitation machine, that
enhances lower leg function, which is important for stroke patients&#x02019; balance and gait
performance, and the effects of ergometer bicycle exercise, similar to the basic rhythmic
gait pattern, one of the important conditions for gait by stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 patients of a rehabilitation doctor practicing at N
Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea, who were diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from
stroke. They were randomly and equally assigned to a rehabilitational sliding machine
training group (STG: 10 males, 10 females) or an ergometer bicycle training group (ETG: 12
males, 8 females). The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of the STG were 51.4&#x000b1;40.6&#x02005;years,
167.0&#x000b1;9.5&#x02005;cm, and 64.1&#x000b1;13.1&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eleven of the patients had right hemiplegia,
and nine had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 14.8&#x000b1;6.1 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age,
height, and weight of the ETG were 50.1&#x000b1;7.8&#x02005;years, 169.2&#x000b1;9.2&#x02005;cm, and 65.2&#x000b1;11.3&#x02005;kg,
respectively. Eight of the patients had right hemiplegia, and 12 had left hemiplegia. The
onset period was 14.3&#x000b1;3.4 months.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality of the
vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, the ability to
understand and perform the exercise as instructed by the researcher, and a score of 24 or
higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination&#x02013;Korean version. All the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided their written, informed consent prior to their
participation in the study, in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The STG performed rehabilitational sliding machine training, 30 minutes per session, five
times per week, for a total of eight weeks, according to a researcher&#x02019;s instruction. For the
experiment, their weight was propped up by a lower limb support, and knee joint flexion and
extension exercise was made possible with friction at a minimal level. In addition, for the
stability of the patients, their ankles and body were fixed with safety belts. The slope of
the tilt table was fixed at 30&#x000b0;, before training was conducted.</p><p>The ETG performed ergometer bicycle training 30 minutes per session, five times per week,
for a total of eight weeks. Training was conducted for 30 minutes, so as not to exceed 40%
of subjects&#x02019; heart rate reserve, using a MOTOmed Viva 2. MOTOmed features are detailed
biofeedback, software controlled therapy programs, and motivation and training games.</p><p>The subjects of the two experimental groups received training after hearing the order,
&#x0201c;Please start&#x0201d;. At an early stage of training, the researcher provided help to ensure that
the subjects maintained a proper posture during the training. If a subject showed a sense of
fatigue, abnormalities of breathing, or changes in facial complexion, or complained of pain,
training was immediately stopped.</p><p>For the measurement of balance ability, a biofeedback analysis system (AP1153 Biorescue,
France) was used to determine the anterior. And posterior ranges of the limit of stability
during standing. The time required to walk 10 meters was measured using the 10-meter walking
time test in order to assess the subjects&#x02019; gait ability.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (IBM, IL, USA).
After the general characteristics of the subjects had been determined, the paired t-test was
used to compare the differences in the anterior. And posterior ranges of the limit of
stability during standing, and the 10-meter walking times between pre- and post-intervention
within each group. The significance of the difference between the two groups was
investigated using the independent t-test. Statistical significance was accepted for values
of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The anterior and posterior ranges of the limit of stability during standing, their

significant correlations between gait ability and the senses related to balance and balance
ability. A decrease in postural sway observed in some patients with brain damage did not
reflect that they had a good balance ability, but was the result of fear of falls after
brain damage, and was an adaptive response to unstable balance. Stroke patients with a small
range of postural sway in static standing balance have low stability and a high risk of
falling<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study
aimed to look at the effects of lower limb training using sliding and ergometer bicycle
training on balance in a standing position. According to the analysis of anterior and
posterior ranges of the limit of stability in a standing position, STG and ETG showed
significant differences within group from the pre intervention values at post intervention,
and there were significant differences (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Enhancement of stroke patients&#x02019; gait ability in the process of recovering their function is
a major goal of physical therapy, because gait is a crucial requirement for functional
independence. Stroke patients&#x02019; gait is generally slow, requires excessive effort, and
exhibits difficulties with coordination. Gait speed can not only be used to measure gait
ability but also to evaluate independence and physical function, independent life, social
activities, and functional health. This study carried out 10-meter walking to measure stroke
patients&#x02019; gait. According to the analysis of the time required to walk 10 meters from the
pre intervention values at post intervention, STG and ETG showed within group significant in
the 10 meters walking time improvements differences but there was no significant difference
between the two groups.</p><p>Ergometer bicycle exercise is similar to walking in that it involves repetitive alternating
flexion and extension as well as alternating contraction of the antagonistic muscles, and it
enhances muscle strength. Lower limb muscle training was conducted for stroke patients for
three weeks, and it was effective at improving their balance and gait performance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We consider training using a sliding rehabilitation machine and an ergometer effective at
increasing a patients&#x02019; balance and gait ability during day time and nontreatment time
without their therapist. If research is proceeded with that applies diverse training methods
focusing on stroke patients&#x02019; muscle strength, initiation, timing, the order of exerting
muscle strength, ability to swiftly produce force so as to affect their maintenance of force
and balance, and coordination, and compares the results, it will provide diverse grounds for
patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wagenaar</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Beek</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Hemiplegic gait: a kinematic analysis using walking speed
