Phase 2/3 group patients were classified according to prior relapse, breakthrough, or non-response (null response, partial response, non-classifiable non-response) to PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV. Eight patients in the Phase 1 group received short-term (&#x02264;14&#x000a0;days) simeprevir.</p><p>Treatment comprised simeprevir 150&#x000a0;mg once daily (QD) plus PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV for 12&#x000a0;weeks followed by PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV for 12 or 36&#x000a0;weeks (using response-guided therapy [RGT] to determine total treatment duration in Phase 2/3 prior relapsers or breakthrough) or 36&#x000a0;weeks fixed (Phase 2/3 group non-responders and Phase 1 group). The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response 12&#x000a0;weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Phase 2/3 group: SVR12 rate was 69.6% (87/125) overall; 92.7% (51/55), 60.0% (6/10), 64.3% (18/28), and 36.7% (11/30) in patients with prior relapse, viral breakthrough, partial response, or null response, respectively. SVR12 rates were similar for patients with HCV GT1a (66.0% [33/50]) and GT1b infection (72.0% [54/75]) and among HCV GT1a-infected patients with/without a baseline Q80K polymorphism (66.7% [8/12] and 65.8% [25/38], respectively). The majority of RGT-eligible patients (prior viral relapse or breakthrough) met RGT criteria (89.2% [58/65]); of these, 89.7% (52/58) achieved SVR12. Overall, 16.0% (20/125) of patients experienced on-treatment failure and 14.4% (18/125) experienced post-treatment failure (15 relapses, 3 missing data). Phase 1 group (simeprevir-na&#x000ef;ve and -experienced patients combined): SVR12 rate was 37.5% (6/16).

Simeprevir 150&#x000a0;mg QD with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV led to a high SVR rate among prior relapsers with HCV GT1 infection.

This combination led to sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 38&#x02013;66% in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (GT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], 14% in patients who had relapsed after PegIFN-based therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and 9% in prior non-responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This suboptimal efficacy against HCV GT1 infection, together with long treatment durations (typically 48&#x000a0;weeks) and high rates of treatment discontinuations and dose reductions due to adverse events (AEs), made PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV an unsatisfactory regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have significantly improved treatment options for chronic HCV infection; firstly, in combination with PegIFN and RBV and, more recently, as IFN-free DAA combination regimens. Simeprevir, an oral, once-daily (QD) HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor with antiviral activity against HCV GT 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], is approved in combination with PegIFN and RBV for chronic HCV GT1 and GT4 infection with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in the USA and European Union (EU). Simeprevir is also approved as part of an IFN-free combination with sofosbuvir (a QD pangenotypic HCV nucleotide-analogue non-structural protein 5B [NS5B] polymerase inhibitor) for HCV GT1 infection in the USA, and GT1, GT4, and HCV/HIV co-infection in the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Prior to the availability of IFN-free therapies, in two Phase 2 studies, SVR rates of 81&#x02013;86% and 67&#x02013;80%, respectively, were achieved in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve and treatment-experienced patients (prior non-responders, partial responders, and relapsers to therapy with PegIFN/RBV) with HCV GT1 infection treated with simeprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV (PILLAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and ASPIRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). In three Phase 3 studies in HCV GT1-infected patients, simeprevir for 12&#x000a0;weeks combined with 24 or 48&#x000a0;weeks of PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV achieved significantly higher SVR rates compared with 48&#x000a0;weeks of PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV (treatment na&#x000ef;ve: 80% vs. 50% in QUEST-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and 81% vs. 50% in QUEST-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; prior PegIFN relapsers: 79% vs. 36% in PROMISE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). Furthermore, nearly 90% of patients met response-guided treatment (RGT) criteria and were eligible to shorten the duration of PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV treatment to 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Here we report the results of a Phase 3 study that provided access to simeprevir in combination with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV to HCV GT1-infected patients who had failed PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV in the placebo group of one of the Phase 2/3 simeprevir studies mentioned above. In addition, a group of 16 patients who had been exposed to a DAA for up to 14&#x000a0;days in a Phase 1 study were included. This allowed evaluation of the efficacy and safety of simeprevir in a population that was well characterized in terms of prior response to PegIFN/RBV therapy. IFN-based treatment is still the standard of care in certain countries where IFN-free regimens are not yet available.

Grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 9 (6.4%) patients and Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia in 1 (0.7%) patient.</p><p>Grade 3 ALT or AST AEs were experienced by 2.1% (3/141) of patients during the simeprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV treatment phase (ALT, 2 patients; AST, 1 patient). Grade 3 ALT and AST events were not considered to be related to the study drug. No Grade 4 ALT/AST AEs were reported during treatment with simeprevir.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>This open-label study was designed to provide access to simeprevir treatment in combination with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a and RBV for a well characterized treatment-experienced patient population with HCV GT1 infection in terms of baseline characteristics and prior response to PegIFN/RBV, after they had completed participation in a prior study and at a time when current therapeutic IFN-free alternatives were not yet available.</p><p>The Phase 2/3 group comprised a high proportion of prior relapsers (44.0%); null responders and partial responders (each approximately 25%) to PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV. Fewer than 10% of patients had experienced viral breakthrough. The SVR12 rate (primary efficacy endpoint) was 69.6% (87/125); all patients who achieved SVR12 also went on to achieve SVR24. The majority (89.2%) of patients eligible for RGT met RGT criteria and received a shorter 24-week duration of PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV therapy. The SVR12 rate in this group of patients was 89.7%. There was a small difference in the number of patients (50/51 [98.0%]) who qualified for shorter treatment duration using the original RGT as compared to those who qualified for shorter treatment duration with the modified criteria in the same group of patients (45/51 [88.2%]) retrospectively. SVR12 was achieved in 45 of 50 (90%) patients who qualified for shorter treatment duration with the original RGT versus 41 of the 45 (91.1%) patients from the same group who qualified for shorter treatment with the modified RGT retrospectively.</p><p>The virologic response for non-responders in the Phase 2/3 group (50%) was comparable to the overall SVR12 rate reported with simeprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV (54%) and telaprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV (55%) in a previous non-responder HCV GT1-infected population in the ATTAIN study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>While the HCV geno/subtype influences response to HCV therapy and higher rates of virologic failure are seen in GT1a-infected patients compared with GT1b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the SVR12 rates in HCV GT1a- and GT1b-infected patients in the Phase 2/3 group of the present study were comparable (66.0% and 72.0%, respectively).</p><p>Phase 3 studies evaluating the combination of simeprevir with PegIFN/RBV indicated lower SVR rates in HCV GT1a-infected patients with a Q80K baseline polymorphism compared to those without Q80K polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the Phase 2/3 group of this study, no difference in SVR12 rates was observed among GT1a patients with and without a Q80K polymorphism (66.7% and 65.8%, respectively).</p><p>The proportion of patients with on-treatment failure in the Phase 2/3 group was 16.0%. The incidence of viral breakthrough was &#x0003c;10% and 10/12 patients with viral breakthrough were prior null responders to PegIFN/RBV treatment. Consistent with the simeprevir resistance profile observed in HCV GT1-infected patients who failed simeprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV in Phase 2/3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the majority of patients with failure had emerging mutations at NS3 amino acid positions 80, 122, 155, and/or 168 at the time of failure. The impact of these treatment-emergent NS3 mutations on retreatment options is not clear. Although they represent the dominant viral population at the time of virologic failure, these NS3 mutations are rapidly replaced by fitter wild type viruses. In half of patients with failure, and treatment-emergent NS3 mutations at time of failure, in Phase 2/3 simeprevir/PegIFN studies, these mutations were no longer detected at the end of the studies after a median follow-up time of 28&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>This observation raises the possibility that patients who fail simeprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV could be retreated with a simeprevir-containing regimen. However, the rapid development of IFN-free combination DAA regimens has provided more effective retreatment options, which are recommended by current treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with the established association between improved response (SVR) to PegIFN/RBV and presence of the <italic>IL28B</italic> rs12979860 CC genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a higher SVR12 rate was seen in patients with CC genotype (85.0%) compared with the CT (66.7%) and TT (66.7%) genotypes in the Phase 2/3 group. SVR12 rates were also somewhat higher among patients with less severe fibrosis and in patients with HOMA-IR &#x0003c;2. The latter finding supports previous reports which suggest an association between lower virologic cure rates and elevated HOMA-IR, a surrogate marker of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The tolerability profile of simeprevir in the current study was comparable to that reported in the previous Phase 2/3 studies investigating simeprevir in combination with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV in patients with HCV GT1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Fatigue (32.6%), neutropenia (22.7%), and influenza-like illness (22.0%) were the most common AEs and all are known to be associated with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV treatment. The majority of AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were also no unexpected observations in terms of the frequency or severity of the reported events of special/clinical interest. Decrease in neutrophil and precursor count was the only graded treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality for which Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities were observed in &#x0003e;10% of patients (19.3%).</p><p>In the Phase 1 group, half of the patients (8/16) had not been previously exposed to simeprevir in a Phase 1 study and, of these, the majority (6/8, 75%) were prior non-responders to PegIFN/RBV treatment. The SVR12 rate was 37.5% (6/16); all patients who achieved SVR12 also went on to achieve SVR24.</p><p>Equal proportions of patients with and without prior exposure to simeprevir achieved SVR12 (3/8 patients each). Among the 8 subjects who were not previously exposed to simeprevir, 2 of the 6 prior non-responders to PegIFN/RBV treatment achieved SVR12, one prior relapser achieved SVR12, and one treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patient did not achieve SVR12. Patients with prior simeprevir exposure were treatment-na&#x000ef;ve or prior relapsers to PegIFN/RBV. Given the small sample size in these subgroups, it is difficult to draw conclusions for a comparison of the SVR rates to historic controls.</p><p>Multiple factors may have contributed to the lower virologic response rate in the Phase 1 group. Missing data at the SVR12 assessment time point was the reason for post-treatment failure in 12.5% of subjects (2/16) in the Phase 1 group. In addition, among the group of 8 patients in the Phase 1 group who had not previously been exposed to simeprevir, 1 patient (prior non-responder) discontinued treatment early at Week 36 due to AEs and 2 patients discontinued treatment early due to consent withdrawal (one prior non-responder on Day 5 and one simeprevir-na&#x000ef;ve patient at Week 16). None of these 8 simeprevir-na&#x000ef;ve patients had the favorable baseline <italic>IL28B</italic> CC genotype. Among the group of 8 patients in the Phase 1 group who had previously been exposed to simeprevir, 2 subjects discontinued treatment early due to AEs. One of these 8 simeprevir-experienced patients had the favorable <italic>IL28B</italic> CC genotype and this patient achieved SVR12. Of note, the R155K substitution was found emerging in 6/8 patients during previous short-term exposure to simeprevir in the Phase 1 study and was still detected in 2 patients using population sequencing at baseline in the current study but may have still been present as minority substitution in other patients at baseline. The presence of this substitution could have also impacted the treatment response in this group of simeprevir-experienced patients.</p><p>The proportion of patients with on-treatment failure (18.8%) was similar to that of the Phase 2/3 group. The incidence of viral breakthrough was &#x0003c;10% and 10/12 patients with viral breakthrough were prior null responders to PegIFN/RBV treatment.</p><p>A limitation of the study was the small sample size in the Phase 1 group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16). In addition, when the Phase 2/3 group was analyzed according to response to prior treatment, patient numbers were relatively low in some of the groups (viral breakthrough, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10, partial responder, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28, null responder, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;30). Similar limitations in terms of patient numbers also applied to other subgroups, for example, grouping according to <italic>IL28B</italic> genotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with simeprevir 150&#x000a0;mg QD in combination with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV for 12&#x000a0;weeks allowed the majority of RGT-eligible patients to achieve SVR12 while the shortening <strike>of</strike> treatment to 24&#x000a0;weeks in total. As previously described, simeprevir with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV achieved a lower SVR rate among patients with HCV GT1 infection who were prior non-responders, compared to different patient populations that have previously been described in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The safety profile of simeprevir with PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV in this small study was consistent both with that described in the approved labels for simeprevir and with that reported in previous large Phase 3 studies.</p><p>These results provide yet further evidence to support the added potency that simeprevir offers as part of an IFN-containing regimen. However, the role of simeprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV as the primary treatment for patients with HCV GT1 infection has diminished since the recent development of IFN-free DAA combinations, which provide a shorter, more effective, and better tolerated treatment across most patient populations.</p><p>Retreatment of virologic failures to simeprevir plus PegIFN&#x003b1;/RBV will require regimens which include 2 or more DAAs without cross-resistance such as an NS5A inhibitor and NS5B inhibitor. Highly effective retreatment options are currently available for patients who have failed prior IFN-free or IFN-containing DAA HCV therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
