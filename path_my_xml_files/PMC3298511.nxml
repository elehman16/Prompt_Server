The first line of therapy to relieve symptoms of persistent asthma is inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, when an ICS alone is unable to control persistent asthma, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] guidelines recommend step-up treatment with an ICS combined with a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA).</p><p>The most recent ICS/LABA combination therapy indicated for the treatment of persistent asthma is mometasone furoate/formoterol delivered via metered-dose inhaler (MF/F-MDI; Dulera<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Zenhale<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Schering Corporation, a subsidiary of Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ). Previous studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of MF/F-MDI 100/10 &#x003bc;g twice daily (BID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], MF/F-MDI 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and MF/F-MDI 400/10 &#x003bc;g BID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in subjects previously receiving low-, medium-, or high-dose ICS monotherapy, respectively. A long-term safety study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] also demonstrated that MF/F-MDI 200/10 and 400/10 &#x003bc;g BID were well tolerated with safety profiles similar to equivalent doses of a commonly prescribed ICS/LABA combination, fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S; Advair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Seritide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). However, this 1-year safety study was not powered to compare MF/F and FP/S with regard to efficacy. The objective of the current study was to investigate, using an evaluator-blinded, noninferiority design, whether the effects of MF/F-MDI 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID on lung function are noninferior to those of FP/S 250/50 &#x003bc;g BID (delivered via dry powder inhaler [DPI]). In addition, if noninferiority was demonstrated, the trial was designed to investigate whether the onset of action with MF/F-MDI was faster than that with FP/S-DPI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a multicenter, 12-week,<sup>1 </sup>open-label, evaluator-blinded, active-controlled, noninferiority efficacy and safety trial in subjects (aged &#x02265;12 y) with uncontrolled persistent asthma previously treated with medium-dose ICS with or without a LABA.

Although stable lung function was demonstrated during the open-label run-in period, subjects were still uncontrolled at baseline (ie, total ACQ score &#x02265;1.5), indicating that medium-dose MF alone was suboptimal for treating this subject population. Two key observations can be taken from the lung function results regarding the efficacy of MF/F over 12 weeks of treatment. First, treatment with MF/F-MDI 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID was noninferior compared with FP/S-DPI 250/50 &#x003bc;g BID based on FEV<sub>1 </sub>AUC<sub>0-12 h </sub>at week 12 (LOCF). Second, a significant (&#x02265;200 mL from baseline) bronchodilator effect of the MF/F combination was observed as early as 5 minutes postdose, which was superior to FP/S through 30 minutes on day 1. This result was expected given the known characteristics of these ICS/LABA combination constituents. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and FP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] monotherapy in improving lung function outcomes in patients with asthma. Although LABA monotherapy should not be used to treat asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], formoterol and salmeterol have also been shown to be effective in improving lung function outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, formoterol is associated with a faster onset of action than salmeterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. As such, it does not seem surprising that MF/F was associated with a faster onset of action than FP/S in the current study.</p><p>As recently reviewed by Murphy and Bender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], several surveys have indicated that rapid onset of action is a highly desirable attribute of asthma therapy from a patient perspective. The perception that controller medication is working immediately is a strong predictor of overall treatment satisfaction and may lead to improved medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, although the present study demonstrated greater improvements in pulmonary function 5-30 minutes postdose for the MF/F-MDI group compared with the FP/S-DPI group, it did not measure corresponding symptom scores during that time period. Thus, the clinical relevance of the faster onset of action with MF/F-MDI compared with FP/S-DPI has not been determined.</p><p>At week 12 (LOCF), a MID in total ACQ score was achieved in both treatment groups and both treatments also shifted patients to the "controlled" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] ACQ score range. Other secondary efficacy results (eg, improvements in the AQLQ[S] total score) further indicated that MF/F-MDI 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID is noninferior to FP/S-DPI 250/50 &#x003bc;g BID and that both treatments improved asthma outcomes compared with baseline measurements.</p><p>A review of the safety data indicated that both treatments were well tolerated. The number and type of AEs reported in this study were not unexpected and did not raise any new safety concerns with regard to MF/F-MDI or FP/S-DPI. The most common treatment-related AE reported was dysphonia, which is a known side effect of ICS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>This study was originally scheduled for 1 year and was stopped early due to protracted enrollment period, which resulted in a longer than expected study duration. At the termination of the study, 12-week data were available for 81.3% of patients (579 of the 712 patients originally enrolled in the study), and 40% of noncompletion occurred after the termination of the study. Therefore, most of these discontinuations were a product of early trial termination. Yet because the mean times to administrative discontinuation were approximately 80 days in each treatment group--close to the 85-day treatment duration scheduled for a 12-week study--and because a large proportion of subjects (81.3%) remained in the trial long enough to qualify for the Week 12 observed cases evaluation window, the integrity of the population for noninferiority evaluation was not compromised. Similarly, the proportions of discontinuations owing to reasons other than administrative are similar to those for other MF/F-MDI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>This trial was of 12 weeks' duration and, as such, does not provide insight into the longer-term efficacy and safety of MF/F-MDI. The longer-term safety of MF/F-MDI has been demonstrated by Maspero et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The trial was of an open-label design and is, therefore, subject to the typical limitations inherent with open-label study. However, an open-label randomized design with frequent, uniform study visits and robust clinical endpoints, such as that used for this study, can be appropriate for comparing similar treatments to determine noninferiority. In this context, it is of interest to note the primary analysis of FEV<sub>1 </sub>AUC at endpoint favored MF/F-MDI by 20 mL over FP/S-DPI in a design setting that usually favors the comparator marketed product. While the study was open-label, subjects were expected to be more familiar with the treatment administration of FP/S-DPI than the use of the MF/F-MDI test product.</p><p>An important consideration with this noninferiority design was the demonstration of assay sensitivity. Thus, the subject's own treatment was discontinued at screening, and a run-in period was carried out during which subjects had to demonstrate a degree of asthma deterioration on MF monotherapy. The results show that the study population was appropriately treated with combination therapy and provided assurance that the study population was sensitive enough to detect a potential difference between the MDI and DPI formulations by demonstrating that subjects were responsive to changes in treatment. Therefore, the results indicate that subjects not well controlled on ICS monotherapy will improve lung function and asthma control to the same degree when treated with either combination. It is also important to note that the current study was adequately powered to test for superiority of the onset of action endpoint, and previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have demonstrated the superiority of MF/F compared with placebo, MF, and/or formoterol for various efficacy assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that MF/F-MDI 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID is noninferior based on FEV<sub>1 </sub>AUC<sub>0-12 h </sub>and superior in onset of action to FP/S-DPI 250/50 &#x003bc;g BID over 12 weeks of treatment. Both combinations were safe, improved asthma control, and demonstrated similar results for other secondary study endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>David I.
