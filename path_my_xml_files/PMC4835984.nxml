The prevalence is expected to double between 2005 and 2030 and the greater proportion of this increase would be in the low to middle-income countries of Asia, Africa and South America [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite advances in methods of diagnosis and treatment protocols, poorly controlled T2DM responsible for high incidence of morbidity that extensively disturbed the quality of life in addition to high expenditures each year [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Understanding of mechanisms underlies the pathogenesis of disease enable better targeting of changes that led to good glycemic control and improvement in overall outcomes.</p><p>Oxidative stress is the loss of the normal balance between prooxidants and antioxidants represent important implicated mechanism in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], patients with type 2 diabetes are vulnerable to increase oxidative stress due to the excessive production of free radicals especially reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired antioxidant defense mechanism [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Poorly glycemic control leads to hyperglycemia which results in increased production of ROS which causes membrane damage due to peroxidation of membrane lipids and protein glycation [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; for this reason, the targeting of oxidative stress is necessary in diabetic patients. Many studies have shown that the use of antioxidants, as well as herbal agents, might help control the oxidative stress [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The use of herbal medicinal plants especially those used in folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes is common in Iraqi diabetic patients, among these, the use of cinnamon [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Cinnamon is one of the most widely used spices in the food and beverage industry, worldwide has also been well recognized for its medicinal properties for a long time. Traditional medicine has used cinnamon extracts for ailments such as arthritis, diarrhea, and menstrual irregularities. The dry bark of cinnamon trees is rich in botanical source of polyphenolics and has been used to improve general health and treat a variety of disease conditions including diabetes [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition to anti-diabetic properties, cinnamon is known to have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Cinnamon lowering effect of glucose level may be due to many mechanisms; many <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have showed that cinnamon increases glucose entry into cells by enhanced insulin receptor phosphorylation and the translocation of glucose transporter glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The active compound responsible is believed to be poly-phenolic compound [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another possible mechanism that explains the hypoglycemic effect of cinnamon is an increase in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (alpha) and (gamma) receptors thereby increasing insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that cinnamon possesses an inhibitory effect on intestinal glucosidases and pancreatic amylase. Ceylon cinnamon is the most potent inhibitor of pancreatic amylase and intestinal sucrase [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A clinical study has demonstrated its ability to delay gastric emptying as well as lowering the postprandial glucose level [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Thus, cinnamon considered an important anti-diabetic spice, and different studies involving cinnamon administration have produced contrasting results. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was to analyze the effect of cinnamon powder on fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and oxidative state in Iraqi patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was carried out on 26 patients with T2DM who attend the Specialized Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes-AL-Risafa, Directoratc of Health-Baghdad were enrolled in this study.

The separated Hb then passes through the flow cell of the filter photometer, where changes in the absorbance at 415 nm are measured. Samples are required to hemolyze the blood and remove Schiff base. Samples are first diluted with hemolysis reagent and then incubated at 18-28&#x000b0;C for a minimum of 15 min [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Measurement of serum Malondialdehyde (MDA)</title><p>MDA is a by-product of lipid peroxidation and its measurement is based on the reaction of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) with MDA forming TBA-2 MDA adducts.

Khan <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) showed that administration of 1, 3 and 6 g per day of cinnamon improve blood glucose and lipid profile in type 2 diabetic people [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and suggest that using cinnamon with a diet of diabetics may reduce incidence of risk factors associated with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Mang <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that administration of 3 g of cinnamon aqueous extract a day to type 2 diabetic patients on oral hypoglycaemic treatment resulted in significant reduction of the initial FPG values. However, the trial failed to demonstrate a significant lowering of HbA1C or plasma lipids [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Crawford showed that administration of 1g of cinnamon to diabetic patients for 90 days lowered the HbA1c by 0.83% as compared to 0.37% reduction in patients receiving usual care alone [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial Akilen <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of cinnamon on diabetics on oral hypoglycemics by administering 2 g of cinnamon daily over a period of 12-week. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c level. The study also demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure, FPG, body mass index and waist circumference at 12 weeks of treatment [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Other study done by Suppapitiporn showed the effect of cinnamon <italic>cassia</italic> powder in type 2 diabetics on oral therapy consisting of metformin or sulphonylurea in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. After a 12-week period, HbA1c was decreased nonsignificantly in treated patients [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recently, Anderson <italic>et al</italic>. found that diabetic individuals received cinnamon 500 mg/day for 2 months showing a significant decrease of both FPG compared the placebo control group, insulin sensitivity, assessed by homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, was also significantly improved by administration of cinnamon extract [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, there is a highly significant reduction in fasting glucose level after 6 and 12 weeks of cinnamon use indicating the good glucose lowering effect of cinnamon powder while in placebo group there is no reduction a result which corroborate cinnamon effect. Many studies investigated the mechanism(s) of cinnamon as hypoglycemic agents, as reviewed by Medagama (2015); it may be due to its action at different levels of the insulin-signaling pathway [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Besides its action on insulin receptor phosphorylation and translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane as mentioned above, studies showed that cinnamon administration increases the level glucagon-like peptide 1 [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, cinnamon may increase the expression of PPAR and increasing insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; Adisakwattana <italic>et al.</italic>, showed that cinnamon may be useful for the control of blood glucose level in diabetic patients through inhibition of intestinal a-glucosidase [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; Anand <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that cinnamon inhibits gluconeogenesis and stimulate glycogen synthesis thus, improving glucose metabolism [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; finally, cinnamon may delay the gastric emptying and caused reduction in post-prandial blood glucose [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress is one of the important factors in diabetes that plays an important role in vascular complications [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], evaluation of such changes markers may enable to determine the optimum time of targeting these changes. Nowadays, natural antioxidants are considered the preferred choice for the replacement of synthetic ones; these natural antioxidants can be formulated as food stuffs and can help prevent oxidative damage occur due to many diseases including type 2 DM [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has been found that polyphenols, the natural dietary antioxidants found in cinnamon have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Specific antioxidant phytochemicals that have been identified in cinnamon include epicatechin, camphene, eugenol, gamma-terpinene, phenol, salicylic acid, and tannins [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Rao and Gan reviewed the antioxidant effects of cinnamon; they reported that cinnamon increased GSH level, also increase the activity of SOD [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In recent study, and Saifan showed that administration of cinnamon aqueous extract to obese diabetic rat resulted in improvement of activity of tissue antioxidant enzymes [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Finally, Roussel <italic>et al</italic>. show that administration of 250 mg of an aqueous extract of cinnamon 2 times per day for 12 weeks to subjects with impaired fasting blood glucose resulted in increasing the level of plasma thiol group while plasma MDA level decreased compared to that of placebo, they found that antioxidant effects were larger after 12 than 6 weeks [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results obtained in this study showed that there is significant improvement in oxidative stress markers after 6 weeks, while highly significant increase in GSH level of diabetic patients after 12 weeks of cinnamon administration, at the same time, plasma MDA level highly significantly decreased after 12 weeks indicating the antioxidant effect of cinnamon in time-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec
