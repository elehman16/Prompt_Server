To compare the clinical outcome of patients presenting with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis who were seen by a doctor, with patients who were given treatment following a diagnostic algorithm. <italic>Design</italic>. Randomized controlled trial. <italic>Setting</italic>. Out-of-hours service, Oslo, Norway. <italic>Intervention</italic>. Women with typical symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were included in the trial in the time period September 2010&#x02013;November 2011. They were randomized into two groups. One group received standard treatment according to the diagnostic algorithm, the other group received treatment after a regular consultation by a doctor. <italic>Subjects</italic>. Women (n = 441) aged 16&#x02013;55 years. Mean age in both groups 27 years. <italic>Main outcome measures</italic>. Number of days until symptomatic resolution. <italic>Results</italic>. No significant differences were found between the groups in the basic patient demographics, severity of symptoms, or percentage of urine samples with single culture growth. A median of three days until symptomatic resolution was found in both groups. By day four 79% in the algorithm group and 72% in the regular consultation group were free of symptoms (p = 0.09). The number of patients who contacted a doctor again in the follow-up period and received alternative antibiotic treatment was insignificantly higher (p = 0.08) after regular consultation than after treatment according to the diagnostic algorithm. There were no cases of severe pyelonephritis or hospital admissions during the follow-up period. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Using a diagnostic algorithm is a safe and efficient method for treating women with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis at an out-of-hours service. This simplification of treatment strategy can lead to a more rational use of consultation time and a stricter adherence to National Antibiotic Guidelines for a common disorder.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>After-hours care</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>algorithms</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>amdinocillin (mecillinam)</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>general practice</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Norway</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>primary health care</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>urinary tract infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lower urinary tract infections in women are very common and account for a significant percentage of consultations in primary health care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A search in relevant medical literature has not revealed any previous studies assessing the use of a diagnostic algorithm as part of the treatment scheme.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our study demonstrated that the use of a diagnostic algorithm is a safe and efficient method for identifying women eligible for treatment without seeing a doctor.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This simplification of treatment strategy can contribute to shorter waiting time for the patient, better adherence to antibiotic guidelines, and a more rational use of consultation time in outpatient clinics.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec disp-level="1" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Uncomplicated cystitis accounts for approximately 95% of all consultations related to urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary health care [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Several strategies have been explored to increase adherence to antibiotic guidelines for the treatment of acute urinary tract infection with variable results [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. No antibiotic treatment, symptomatic treatment by the use of NSAIDs, cutting back on treatment length, and wait-and-see prescriptions are methods that aim to decrease the overall use of antibiotics. These strategies have a combined interest in preventing further development of antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;9</xref>]. However, refraining from antibiotic treatment increases the length of arduous symptoms [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Norwegian guidelines for the treatment of symptoms of acute cystitis in women have concluded that treatment can be given without a urine dipstick test. For repeated episodes of symptoms of cystitis, treatment can be given without seeing a physician, the suggested procedure being telephone contact with the medical secretary. Women suffering from recurring cystitis should see a doctor for examination and a urine culture [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The out-of-hours service in Oslo uses a questionnaire to identify patients who qualify for a simplified routine of diagnosing and treating uncomplicated cystitis, the objective being a safe, time-, and cost-saving procedure.</p><p>Mecillinam is the antibiotic of choice in treating cystitis according to the diagnostic algorithm. This is a Scandinavian agent. This choice is based on epidemiological findings of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E.coli</italic>) as the predominating bacterial agent [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>E.coli</italic> has a relatively low rate of resistance towards mecillinam [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref>]. It is also found to have a relatively low resistance driving effect, which has caused increased focus on the possibility of use in the context of the increasing load of multi-resistant bacteria [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common disorder, but current diagnostic strategies in general practice show considerable variation. Population-based before-and-after studies have proved that use of a diagnostic algorithm significantly decreases the use of urine analysis, urine culture, and office visits. At the same time it also increases the number of patients receiving recommended antibiotics. Randomized controlled trials were sought to evaluate the use of a diagnostic algorithm in identifying women with uncomplicated cystitis [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of the study were:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>to compare the clinical outcome of patients presenting with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis who were treated after a regular consultation by a doctor with patients who were given treatment following a diagnostic algorithm;</p></list-item><list-item><p>to compare safety and rate of complications in the two groups.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><p>Since 2007 the out-of-hours service in Oslo has used a diagnostic algorithm to identify patients with an uncomplicated cystitis.

This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that we found an insignificant tendency for shorter duration of symptoms in the algorithm group.</p><p>A strict adherence to the algorithm to identify inclusion and exclusion criteria is necessary in order to ensure safe use of the algorithm. No cases of serious pyelonephritis or hospital admission were reported in the two groups.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0007"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The study has been carried out in a setting with a high number of unselected patients with uncomplicated cystitis. During the follow-up, nearly all patients were successfully contacted regarding clinical cure, but a follow-up urine specimen was more often not received. All follow-up contacts were made by the same clinician.</p><p>With a mean age of 27 years in our patient population, the study is less representative of the elderly segment of included patients. In a young study population STIs are more common and it has been noted that adolescent females with symptoms of UTI could benefit from testing for both STI and UTI [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A Swedish study conducted in general practice found a prevalence of 4% of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> among young women with symptoms of UTI; this is comparable to the prevalence of 3% in the general population of women in the same age group [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Symptoms of STIs determine exclusion in the diagnostic algorithm; however, it is possible that some patients had a co-infection or a primary STI. There were no patients in the control group diagnosed with an STI. In addition, equal symptomatic and bacteriological outcomes in the two arms make a significant number of STIs less probable.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the doctor who treated the control patients was able to consider the urine dipstick findings when choosing antibiotic treatment. One could speculate this this would result in the doctor choosing an alternative regimen to ensure an effect against non-nitrate-producing organisms. Our findings did not show such a change in treatment choice. It is possible that the treating physician did not consider the nitrate status of the urine dipstick findings.</p><p>Urine samples were spontaneous samples taken at the time of consultation, thus a number of women had not kept the urine in the bladder for at least four hours, which is regarded as necessary to demonstrate significant bacteriuria. This may explain why the studied population showed a lower percentage of significant bacteriuria than previous studies [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There was no significant difference between the groups as to proportion of significant bacteriuria in the primary urine samples.</p><p>Whether it is feasible from a resistance point of view to keep mecillinam as the treatment of choice according to the diagnostic algorithm, or whether variation among the recommended treatment regimens would be more beneficial should be considered. In Norway recommended treatment regimens include mecillinam, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim. Ciprofloxacin is not a recommended agent for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in Norway [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0008"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first randomized controlled study to assess whether an algorithm-based care is equivalent to doctor-based care in treating uncomplicated cystitis.</p><p>An article referring to a telephone-based nurse evaluation and treatment algorithm concluded that algorithm-based care could allow for successful management of uncomplicated cystitis. [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies have been performed to evaluate symptoms or a group of symptoms as a prognostic indicator of the presence of a UTI with variable findings.</p><p>A review article evaluated which data from the history and clinical findings gave significantly increased diagnostic precision with regard to acute uncomplicated cystitis. It was found that a combination of dysuria and increased frequency of urination without increased vaginal secretions gave a 96% chance of a UTI [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another study found the prognostic value of symptoms and clinical findings to be low in regard to how well they predicted a UTI [<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Recently the results of a self-reporting questionnaire to assess UTIs and differential diagnosis was published and found to be applicable for clinical studies and practice for diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI. The study was, however, not a randomized controlled trial and could not provide a comparison with a control group for symptomatic and bacteriological outcome [<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0009"><title>Implications/conclusion</title><p>This simplification of treatment strategy can give a shorter waiting period for the patient, better adherence to antibiotic guidelines, and more rational use of consultation time in outpatient clinics.</p><p>We conclude that our algorithm is a feasible and safe way to handle young women with symptoms of an acute cystitis, and that the strategy can be transferred to other out-of-hours services.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the nursing staff, doctors, administration, and patients at the out- of-hours service in Oslo.</p><p>The full study protocol can be obtained from Marianne Bollestad, email: <email>marianne.bollestad@medisin.uio.no</email></p></ack><sec><title>Source of funding</title><p>National Centre for Emergency Primary Health Care, Norway.
