Implementing initiatives promoting healthy eating and physical activity in childcare settings has been identified as a priority to prevent excessive child weight gain. Despite this, few trials have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of interventions to support population-wide implementation of such initiatives. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention in increasing the implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices by centre-based childcare services.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study will employ a parallel group randomised controlled trial design. A sample of 128 childcare services in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to participate in the trial. 64 services will be randomly allocated to a 12-month implementation intervention. The remaining 64 services will be allocated to a usual care control group. The intervention will consist of a number of strategies to facilitate childcare service implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices. Intervention strategies will include implementation support staff, securing executive support, consensus processes, staff training, academic detailing visits, performance monitoring and feedback, tools and resources, and a communications strategy. The primary outcome of the trial will be the prevalence of services implementing all healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices targeted by the intervention. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, telephone surveys with nominated supervisors and room leaders of childcare services will be conducted at baseline and immediately postintervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee.

More than 60% of Australian children aged 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years attend preschool or long day care.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In New South Wales, preschools provide centre-based care for 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;h/day and enrol children aged between 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;years. Long day care services provide centre-based care for eight or more hours per day and usually enrol children aged from 6&#x02005;weeks up to 6&#x02005;years. Both types of services provide specific programmes for children aged 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years that include educational and developmental activities to assist children in their preparation for school.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Across Australian states and territories, the role and function of preschools and long day care services are similar and licensing and accreditation requirements regarding healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices are identical.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Physical activity policies and practices are similar across both service types.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In 2012, there were over 250 centre-based childcare services in the study region. A current list of all childcare services in the region provided by the New South Wales Ministry of Health will serve as the sampling frame for the study. Services catering exclusively for children requiring specialist care will be excluded from the trial (representing less than 1% of services in the region), as will services that provide on-site meals to children (representing approximately 30% of services in the region). Government funded, Department of Education services (representing approximately 3% of services in the region) will also be excluded as ethics approval has not been obtained from the relevant government department.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Nominated supervisors and room leaders</title><p>Within participating childcare services, nominated supervisors and room leaders will be invited to participate in CATI surveys to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. The nominated supervisor is the person responsible for the management of the service and will be asked to report on the implementation of whole-of-service policies and practices. The room leader caring for 3&#x02013;5-year-old children is the head teacher of the classroom and will be asked to report on the implementation of specific healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices within their room. Where there are more than one nominated supervisors or room leaders within a service, a member of the research team will randomly select one staff member to be invited to participate by requesting the staff member with the most recent birthday. There are no exclusion criteria for nominated supervisor or room leader participation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>In order to maximise service participation in the study, a recruitment strategy will be employed based on a review of effective recruitment practices within the school setting<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> which has also been successfully executed in childcare settings by the research team.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref> Specifically, one member of the research team will act as a dedicated recruitment coordinator. The coordinator will manage the recruitment of services into the trial and monitor consent rates. Services will be provided with the direct phone number of the coordinator for enquiries regarding the research. Study information will be mailed to childcare services inviting participation in the study. Nominated supervisors will be invited to provide consent for their service participation in the study, consent for their participation in a CATI survey and consent to contact a room leader to participate in a CATI survey. Two weeks after receipt of the information, nominated supervisors and room leaders will be telephoned by a research assistant who will confirm eligibility, invite study participation and schedule a time to conduct the baseline CATI surveys. To minimise attrition, prior to follow-up data collection, services will receive letters thanking them for their participation to date and reminding them that they will be telephoned again to participate in follow-up data collection.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Random allocation of childcare services</title><p>Following the completion of baseline data collection, childcare services will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition using a computerised random number function in Microsoft Excel. Allocation of services will be undertaken by a statistician who will have no other involvement in the trial. The random allocation of childcare services will not be stratified, given previous studies have found only slight differences in implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices by service type (preschool or long day care service), size or the socioeconomic or geographic characteristics of the service locality.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Services will be randomised in a 1:1 (intervention:control) ratio. Owing to the difficulty in blinding services to their group allocation, this trial will be an &#x02018;open&#x02019; trial and services will not be blind to study allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Implementation intervention</title><p>The intervention was designed by an expert advisory group of health promotion practitioners, psychologists, dietitians, behavioural scientists and physical activity experts, in consultation with nominated supervisors from local childcare services.</p><p>The intervention will seek to increase service implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices.

<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>: On three occasions following each training workshop, implementation support staff will conduct academic detailing visits with childcare service staff at their service. The visits will draw on the principles of academic detailing outlined by Soumerai and Avon<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and will involve support staff observing childcare service staff implementation of practices targeted by the intervention. During the visits, implementation support staff will provide immediate feedback based on observations of practice regarding policy or practice implementation, provide further advice or support as required and reinforce observed practice improvements.

<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>: Performance feedback will be delivered by implementation support staff to nominated supervisors and childcare service staff members. Data for the performance feedback will be compiled initially using information collected via the baseline CATI and thereafter project records maintained by implementation support staff.
