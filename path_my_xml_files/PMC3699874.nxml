crossover study explored whether viewing different scenes prior to
a stressor altered autonomic function during the recovery from the
stressor. The two scenes were (a) nature (composed of trees, grass,
fields) or (b) built (composed of man-made, urban scenes lacking natural
characteristics) environments. Autonomic function was assessed using
noninvasive techniques of heart rate variability; in particular, time
domain analyses evaluated parasympathetic activity, using root-mean-square
of successive differences (RMSSD). During stress, secondary cardiovascular
markers (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) showed
significant increases from baseline which did not differ between the
two viewing conditions. Parasympathetic activity, however, was significantly
higher in recovery following the stressor in the viewing scenes of
nature condition compared to viewing scenes depicting built environments
(RMSSD; 50.0 &#x000b1; 31.3 vs 34.8 &#x000b1; 14.8 ms). Thus, viewing nature
scenes prior to a stressor alters autonomic activity in the recovery
period. The secondary aim was to examine autonomic function during
viewing of the two scenes. Standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDRR),
as change from baseline, during the first 5 min of viewing nature
scenes was greater than during built scenes. Overall, this suggests
that nature can elicit improvements in the recovery process following
a stressor.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>es305019p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>es-2012-05019p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the 19th century,
the natural environment has been considered important for ensuring
a greater level of physical and mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Theories suggest that, due to our hunter&#x02013;gatherer past, present
day humans have an innate affiliation with nature and living things.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Consequentially, nature is conducive to involuntary
attention and does not require our directed attention, allowing recovery
from mental fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> and facilitating attention
restoration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> In the past decade, epidemiological
studies in The Netherlands have identified a positive correlation
between improved health outcomes and amount of surrounding green space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Subsequently, the diverse health benefits that maybe engendered
by nature have become a focal point for research.</p><p>Two recent
systematic reviews have concluded that exposure to nature is associated
with improved mental well-being in comparison to indoor environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> and synthetic or built environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Further support of these conclusions has been
found in single studies where improvements in self-esteem,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> positive and negative mood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> anxiety levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> and
feelings of calmness and comfort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> have
been observed. Similar findings have also been observed using simulated
environments in controlled laboratory conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> The studies reviewed by Thompson-Coon et al. did not report
physiological variables, and Bowler et al. found only limited evidence
for physiological changes. Both systematic reviews conclude that investigation
regarding physiological changes during experiencing nature is lacking.
However, there are individual studies investigating exposure to nature
that identify changes in physiological health markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> including decreased heart rate (HR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and decreased systolic (SBP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and diastolic blood
pressure (DBP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Further, changes in endocrine
markers such as reduced adrenaline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> noradrenaline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and cortisol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> as well as
enhanced autonomic control (indirectly measured using heart rate variability,
HRV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> have also been reported. These findings
have also been observed in a controlled and simulated environment
indoors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> where potential
confounding factors such as weather, climate, sounds, and smells are
eliminated. The physiological changes that are noted are all suggestive
of potential systemic relaxation. There is, however, a lack of rigorous
research providing empirical evidence of the physiological mechanisms
that exist with exposure to nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Thus,
the impact of environment on cardiovascular health needs to be explored
further using controlled environments and outcome measures which reflect
such physiological changes, e.g., autonomic control.</p><p>HRV provides
a measure of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and can be used to explore physiological changes
associated with nature exposure. The ANS is important in controlling
many bodily functions, and alterations are prevalent during relaxation
and arousal. HRV is an easy to obtain, established noninvasive scientific
and clinical measure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and has prognostic
value regarding cardiovascular health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> It requires the measurement of interbeat differences in HR using
either electrocardiogram (ECG) or mobile R-R interval monitors. The
analysis of HRV reflects ANS function by assessing the parasympathetic
and sympathetic contributions to sino-atrial node regulation of HR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> A higher HRV suggests an increased adaptability
of the ANS and is associated with better health. Previous work that
has observed HRV indicates that there is a tendency for higher HRV
when nature is viewed in situ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> or simulated
using projected images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p><p>The ANS
plays a central role in governing the response to stress and how the
body recovers following a stressor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Indeed,
Lane and Thayer utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
to examine the hypothesized heart&#x02013;brain connection and found
concurrent associations between vagal influenced HRV and changes in
blood flow through areas of the brain known to be involved in emotional
responses, attention, and working memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Additionally, the prefrontal cortex has been observed to play a
role in the top-down regulation of HRV, as demonstrated using direct
current stimulation of the dorsolateral area of the prefrontal cortex
during viewing of negative images compared to neutral images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> (images of nature were not used in this study).
The relaxation and restorative effect of nature might help combat
the rising incidence of psychological stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> by providing a potential resilience tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Previous analysis of the restorative effects of nature suggest that
participants recover faster from induced stress (in terms of HR) when,
during the recovery, they view nature through a window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> or view projected scenes of natural environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> HR recovery in the latter study was purported
to occur due to, in part, an enhanced recovery of parasympathetic
activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> It is, however, unknown whether
the benefits of nature on cardiovascular reactivity continue to occur
after exposure has ceased.</p><p>It is further unknown whether a longer
exposure to nature elicits greater responses during the exposure.
During nature exposure, the first 5 min elicits the greatest improvements
in mood and self-esteem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Physiological
alterations in HRV also occur during the first 5 min of viewing slides
simulating nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> To date, there is
no evidence to suggest that longer exposure times elicit better physiological
responses and in particular greater changes in HRV during nature exposure.
This time course is important to establish; nature could be potentially
used prior to a stressor and thus alter physiological outcomes in
recovery from a stressor without the need of exposure to nature during
the recovery period; i.e., nature could improve cardiovascular reactivity
following a stressor by speeding the recovery process.</p><p>The primary
aim of this study was to investigate the effect that prior viewing
of nature scenes had on ANS function during recovery from a stressor.
The hypothesis was that viewing nature scenes (composed of trees,
grass, fields) prior to a stressor will lead to higher HRV in recovery
when compared to viewing scenes of built environments (composed of
man-made, urban scenes lacking natural characteristics). A secondary
aim was to compare ANS function during the first and second 5 min
of a 10 min exposure to nature images to see if HRV changes were sustained.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials
and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Participants and Design</title><p>Ethical approval from the University
ethics committee was granted, and participants (<italic>n</italic> = 25, 7 males, 18 females) were recruited from University support
staff who were independent from the research group conducting the
study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants who ranged
in age from 19 to 65 years (mean &#x000b1; SD, 36.08 &#x000b1; 10.42), with
stature 169.05 &#x000b1; 7.33 cm (mean &#x000b1; SD) and mass 71.66 &#x000b1;
13.11 kg (mean &#x000b1; SD). Due to a technical problem, data were not
recorded for two participants (1 female, 1 male) during the stressor
segment. Therefore, they are not included in further analysis of data.
The participants remaining (<italic>n</italic> = 23) were aged 36.91
&#x000b1; 11.09 years (mean &#x000b1; SD), with stature 168.35 &#x000b1; 7.52
cm (mean &#x000b1; SD) and mass 70.38 &#x000b1; 12.42 kg (mean &#x000b1; SD).
The study was a within-subject randomized crossover design with all
participants visiting the laboratory on two occasions one week apart.
Visits were at the same time of day to eliminate any effect of circadian
rhythm on the dependent variables. Participants were free from symptoms
of disease and were not using medication that would affect the cardiovascular
or ANS.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Protocol</title><p>Laboratory environmental conditions were kept
consistent throughout both visits. Room temperature was set at 21
&#x000b0;C; artificial lighting was used, and blinds were drawn to avoid
direct sunlight entering the room. Noise disturbance was kept to a
minimum.</p><p>Each visit consisted of viewing one of two different
groups of slides before being exposed to a mental stressor. Participants
were randomly assigned an order to either view the built scenes first
or the nature scenes first. On arrival, participants completed a battery
of psychological questionnaires (described below). Following this,
participants were told to rest for 15 min in the semisupine position,
allowing HR and blood pressure (BP) measures to stabilize. The participants
remained in this position for the duration of the protocol. Following
the period of rest, participants viewed a set of slides (either nature
or built environment scenes) for a 10 min period. Participants were
then required to partake in a 5 min mental stressor. Immediately poststressor,
a further 5 min of physiological data were recorded to capture recovery.
After recovery, participants completed the same set of psychological
questionnaires. At the next visit, a week later, participants repeated
this protocol and viewed the other set of slides.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Scenes of Nature
and Built Environments</title><p>The slideshows depicting scenes of
nature and built environments involved still photographs representing
each of the environments. The photographs were chosen from a central
pool of photographs used within the research group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The photographs (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) depicting natural
environments included natural elements, e.g., trees, grass, or plant
life, and were devoid of any man-made structures, e.g., buildings,
vehicles, roads. In contrast, the photographs depicting built environments
contained man-made structures, e.g., houses, flats, office buildings,
brick walls. A critical element of the scenes of built environments
was the lack of natural features. Twenty photographs were selected
and collated in a Microsoft PowerPoint slideshow, with each slide
being shown for 30 s. Each slideshow lasted a total of 10 min, and
photographs were shown in the same order for every participant. Before
viewing the slideshow, participants were given the instructions to
try and imagine they were in the environment depicted on the screen.
The term &#x0201c;condition&#x0201d; will be used from this point to
describe the viewing of either the nature or built area slide sets.
The two slide sets will be referred to individually as the nature
condition and built condition.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Examples of images used in the slideshows

socio-evaluative threat and was designed specifically to elicit cardiovascular
stress responses. A series of six numbers were displayed on a screen
in front of the participant. Each number was shown individually for
one second. After each series of six numbers, the participant had
10 s to write the numbers down in the correct order. The test is cognitively
demanding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> and was designed to cause a
stress response by adding a socio-evaluative component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> which has previously been reported to cause
a stress response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> To ensure a socio-evaluative
threat, participants were informed that they would be carefully monitored
during the test by the experimenter and a buzzer would sound when
an incorrect answer was given.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> The buzzer
was used twice in each session in order to achieve consistency irrespective
of whether the participant had provided an incorrect answer. Participants
were informed at the end of the study that this was the case. They
were asked if they were aware that they had in fact got the answer
correct. All participants reported that they could not be sure that
they had and had assumed they had answered incorrectly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Physiological

question, changes from baseline values were first calculated to explore
if the expected short-term effect during the first 5 min of viewing
is repeated in the second 5 min. Data were not normally distributed
(assessed by Kolomogorov-Smirnov test for normality); therefore, the
Friedman&#x02019;s test was performed with posthoc Wilcoxon tests to
explore significant differences. Repeated measures ANOVA was also
used to examine whether the stress response (HR and BP only) compared
to baseline differed between conditions. To assess if breathing frequency

majority of research exploring the impact of nature on ANS mechanisms
has included an exercise component which limits the conclusions drawn
about the contribution of the &#x0201c;nature&#x0201d; component.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> As exercise has such positive
effects on health parameters, it is often hard to isolate the effects
solely from the nature component. Therefore, this study looks at the
nature contribution to ANS function without complicating the effects
by combining it with exercise.</p><p>The main finding of this study
was that HRV as a marker of ANS function increased during stress recovery,
if nature scenes were viewed prior to a stressor, compared to built
scenes. This is the first study to suggest that simply viewing scenes
of nature prior to a stressor enhances recovery of ANS function poststressor.</p><p>The interaction of nature and recovery from stress has been studied
previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> However, previous research has
assessed the restorative effects of viewing or interacting with nature
during the actual recovery period following a stressor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> For example, viewing video footage
of nature scenes for 10 min directly after being exposed to a film
of stressful images increased heart period (i.e., decreased HR), suggested
to be due to enhanced parasympathetic system activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Viewing nature through a window during a 5 min
rest period following cognitive tasks was also more effective at reducing
HR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Both authors postulate that these
observations are a consequence of cognitive recovery or attention
restoration occurring while nature scenes are viewed. The results
of the present study suggest greater HRV during viewing nature scenes
as contributed to by both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.
It is only during the recovery period that parasympathetic activity
alone is greater in the nature views condition. Therefore, viewing
nature scenes may encourage future healthy stress responses and recovery
patterns and could act as a vital tool in preventive health.</p><p>The secondary research question relates to the duration of the nature
dose. Research shows that a 5 min dose of nature offers the greatest
increases in self-esteem and mood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Physiologically,
5 min of viewing images of nature is known to increase HRV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> However, it is unknown whether an additional
5 min would enhance the initial changes that occur in the first 5
min dose. Within a laboratory setting, it appears that the second
5 min of exposure is less effective in inducing HRV changes. The strength
of the current study is the use of 5 min segments for HRV analysis
which is recommended in short-term analysis, i.e., less than 24 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, the division of exposure to nature
images into 5 min segments enabled the observation of increased HRV
as anticipated in an initial 5 min dose, thus supporting previous
work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Comparisons in the current study
suggest an additional 5 min of exposure to nature does not enhance
the greater HRV seen during the initial 5 min dose.</p><p>In agreement
with previous research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> the current study observed
improvements in self-esteem with exposure to nature. This finding
suggests enhanced self-esteem associated with viewing nature shows
robustness against exposure to a mild stress. In the current study,
there was no change in mood associated with condition although this
has been shown in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> The changes in mood observed in these studies were
measured using the profile of mood states (POMS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> POMS contains 5 subscales associated with
negative mood and 1 subscale for positive mood. This restricts POMS
to predominantly reflect changes of negative mood rather than positive
mood. In the current study, negative affect, measured using PANAS,
showed negative mood improved irrespective of condition, therefore
not replicating previous observations using POMS. The use of positive
affect scores from PANAS was to ascertain if changes in positive mood
occur that may not be so clearly identified using POMS. Positive mood
did not differ between conditions nor did it change over time. In
contrast, a meta-analysis of five studies did observe improvements
in positive affect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> suggesting the manipulation
in the current study was not strong enough to elicit positive changes.
The use of PANAS in laboratory research of this nature might not be
appropriate.</p><p>Previous literature lacks discussion as to the
potential mechanisms behind observed changes in physiological function
while viewing nature. One potential mechanism to explain alterations
in physiological measures could be attributable to the restorative
properties of the nature scenes. The concept of attention restoration
occurring after exposure to nature has previously been demonstrated
by way of improved performance in attention related cognitive tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Viewing scenes of nature for 10 min, following a period of mentally
fatiguing tasks, improved performance in a backward digit-span memory
task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> In the current study, there were
no such observations of altered cognitive ability, i.e., performance
in the mental task, with different viewing conditions. This may be
attributable to the lack of a mentally fatiguing task prior to the
intervention, but the nature scenes acted as an effective buffer to
ANS function during recovery.</p><p>To date, there are only a handful
of studies that have measured or inferred changes in the ANS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> associated with nature. We suggest that the different
components of the environmental stimulus, e.g., visual, cognitive,
emotional, and restorative properties, induce changes in the regulation
of different areas throughout the brain thus altering ANS function.
The findings of this study, alongside previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> suggest a top-down mechanism originating in higher
centers of the brain. Evidence for this was in part obtained from
a study which utilized fMRI while viewing urban scenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> The urban scenes caused increased activity in
the amygdala compared to viewing nature scenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> This action is likely to cause alterations in ANS control
such as those seen in the current study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> through changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic outputs. Inhibition
of the parasympathetic nervous system arises from the frontal cortex,
and the pathways pass through the amygdala and then to the <italic>nucleus tractus solitarii</italic> and <italic>nucleus ambiguus</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The prefrontal cortex is prominent
in threat-avoidance situations, causing inhibition on HR via the vagus
nerve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> Therefore, during periods of threat,
parasympathetic activity is decreased (increasing HR). The results
of the current study suggest the absence of threat during nature viewing,
without decreases in parasympathetic activity, while during built
views overall variability decreased in the first 5 min. This interaction
may be primarily due to alterations in both the frontal cortex and
the amygdala.</p><p>Visual properties of an image may also play a
role, as the composition of a picture can alter activity in the visual
cortex. Images of nature are less aversive and uncomfortable when
examining their spectral properties compared to built images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> Indeed, recent research suggests that the primitive
characteristic of color, in particular the &#x0201c;greenness&#x0201d;,
of a nature image is associated with improved mood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Through color perception and reduced impact on the visual
system, images of nature may evoke lower activity in the amygdala
and visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> culminating in increased
parasympathetic activity as seen in the current study.</p><p>It is
unknown how long the physiological changes that nature evokes are
maintained, but it will be vital to explore this further, especially
if nature is to be considered as a therapy. In the current study,
unlike previous studies, nature exposure was experienced 10 min before
the stressor, not during the stressor or immediately following the
stressor. The evidence from this study suggests that there does indeed
appear to be a buffering effect of nature. A stronger stimulus, i.e.,
within the environment itself, may prolong the buffering effect and
also induce greater changes in cardiovascular measures. This may also
be the case when nature is combined with exercise (&#x0201c;green exercise&#x0201d;).
Exercising while viewing nature reduces BP in the 5 min following
the exercise period in comparison to viewing built images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> These effects again may be even greater following
&#x0201c;real&#x0201d; exposure to nature. Indeed, recent research suggests
that adrenaline, noradrenaline, and BP still remain reduced in the
evening following a daytime walk in a forest field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Interestingly, forest walking increases natural killer
cell activity for a period of 30 days in males and 7 days in females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup></p><p>This study has some limitations that should
be addressed in future research. The impact of individual beliefs
on the regulation of emotions when viewing the different environments,
and how this effects physiological modulations, is unknown and could
pose a mediating factor to the effectiveness of viewing nature on
improving stress recovery. In order to quantify individual relationships
with nature, the nature relatedness scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> could be used to indicate experience, beliefs, and contact with
nature. Complementary information could be gained by noting home postcode,
and thus, the surrounding area could be assessed in terms of land
usage to explore the potential impact it may have on participants&#x02019;
perception of nature. The present study collected postcode data but
does not have a sufficient population size to draw conclusions about
all potential subsets. The majority of studies to date, including
the present study, use extreme examples to depict natural and urban
environments in order to examine the influence of nature. Investigating
a greater variety of environments (including more urban green spaces)
would add population level validity to the results and account for
individual landscape preferences. The restorative properties of nature
(images or within the location itself) may evoke different psychological,
cognitive, and physiological responses. Further studies would benefit
from the inclusion of a questionnaire to assess how restorative the
scenes or places are perceived to be, as suggested by Hartig, Mang,
and Evans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> in combination with physiological
and psychological responses to these different images.</p><p>The current
study suggests that nature itself may evoke physiological responses,
which may be in part driven by psychological reactions and restorative
properties of nature. Furthermore, the increase in parasympathetic
activity in the recovery from a stressor may help to counteract a
buildup of psychological stress and thus reduce the impact of stress
on physical and mental health. This would likely occur by nature images
encouraging a healthier stress recovery pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> If nature increases autonomic recovery to stress and thus
is an effective coping mechanism, this provides an argument for the
need for more nearby nature. A green view through a workplace window,
small pockets of greenspace in the home and workplace, and accessible
local parks could be effective tools in altering ANS control of the
heart. The buffering effect of nature could have particular relevance
for the workplace where it may be beneficial to utilize nature during
the lunch break, prior to a stressful afternoon, to help enhance recovery
of autonomic function.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="NOTES-d446e1080-autogenerated" notes-type="conflict-of-interest"><p>The authors declare no competing
