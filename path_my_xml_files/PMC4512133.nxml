Exercise training in patients with T2DM has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, glycemic control, and other metabolic parameters (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, the interrelationship between training-related changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and improvement in glycemic control and other metabolic parameters is not well understood. Previous studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) have observed significant heterogeneity in the magnitude of change in measures of cardiorespiratory fitness in response to exercise training. Recent analyses from the Dose Response to Exercise Training in Women (DREW) trial (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) showed that 30% of the study participants had no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness after 6 months of supervised, moderate-intensity exercise training. It is unclear whether the metabolic benefits of exercise training are limited to those patients who improve their cardiorespiratory fitness. In this study, we examined the impact of exercise training on hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels and other metabolic parameters among fitness nonresponder and responder participants in the Health Benefits of Aerobic and Resistance Training in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes (HART-D) study. We hypothesized that exercise training would be associated with significant improvements in glycemic control in fitness responders as well as nonresponders.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>The current study was performed as a secondary analysis of the HART-D trial. The full design and methodology of the HART-D study has been published previously (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Briefly, the HART-D study was a 9-month randomized, controlled exercise-training trial comparing the effects of different modalities of exercise training on HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in sedentary participants with T2DM. Exclusion criteria for the study included a BMI &#x0003e;48 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, age &#x0003c;30 or &#x0003e;75 years, blood pressure &#x02265;160/100 mmHg, fasting triglyceride levels &#x02265;500 mg/dL, use of insulin pump, urine protein levels &#x0003e;100 mg/dL, history of stroke, and advanced neuropathy or retinopathy or any serious medical condition that prevented adherence to the study protocol or the ability to exercise safely. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to screening. The study protocol was reviewed and approved annually by the Pennington Biomedical Research Center institutional review board. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center institutional review board also approved the present substudy.</p><p>The HART-D study recruited 262 participants who were randomized to one of four groups: <italic>1</italic>) a nonexercise control group, <italic>2</italic>) aerobic training only, <italic>3</italic>) resistance training only, and <italic>4</italic>) a combination of aerobic and resistance training. The nonexercise control group was offered weekly stretching and relaxation classes, and was asked to maintain their baseline activity levels during the 9-month study period. All training sessions were performed under staff supervision in an exercise-training laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Exercise Intervention</title><sec id="s5"><title>Aerobic Training</title><p>Participants exercised 3&#x02013;5 days/week at an intensity of 50&#x02013;80% of their maximum cardiorespiratory fitness for a total dose of 12 kcal/kg/week. The caloric dose was adjusted on a weekly basis based on the changes in body weight. American College of Sports Medicine equations were used to estimate caloric expenditure rates and, therefore, the time required per session (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Resistance Training</title><p>Participants exercised 3 days/week, with each session consisting of two sets of four upper-body exercises (chest press, lateral pull-down, military press, and seated row), three sets of three lower-body exercises (leg press, leg extension, and hamstring curl), and two sets of abdominal and back exercises. Each set consisted of 10&#x02013;12 repetitions. The prescribed weight was increased when the participant was able to complete 12 repetitions of a final set of each exercise on two consecutive sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Combination Training</title><p>Participants had aerobic exercise training at a dose of 10 kcal/kg/body wt/week and two sessions of resistance training per week, with each session consisting of one set of each of the aforementioned nine exercises. The resistance training sessions used a similar progressive resistance program, as described above. The training regimen for the combination training group was consistent with federal physical activity guidelines and ensured equal time commitment among all exercise groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Exercise Testing</title><p>Among the HART-D study participants, cardiorespiratory fitness was measured as peak absolute oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>, in liters per minute) at baseline and at study completion using a treadmill test (TMX425; Trackmaster Treadmills, Newton, KS) protocol, as previously described (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Participants self-selected a walking pace at a level grade, and the grade increased by 2% every 2 min at a constant treadmill speed until they reached volitional exhaustion. Breath-by-breath respiratory gases were measured using a TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measurement Cart (Parvo Medics, Salt Lake City, UT). The same treadmill speed was used at the baseline and the end-of-study testing.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Outcome Assessment</title><p>Baseline and post-training blood testing was performed after at least a 10-h fast. HbA<sub>1c</sub> level was analyzed with a UniCel DxC 600 Pro (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). HbA<sub>1c</sub> level was also assessed at the monthly visits with the diabetes educator using a finger-stick sample analyzed by an automated glycosylated hemoglobin analyzer (DCA 2000; Bayer, Dublin, Ireland). Both HbA<sub>1c</sub> assays are certified under the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program. Weight was measured on a GSE 450 electronic scale, and height was measured with a standard stadiometer. Waist circumference (WC) was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm just above the iliac crest while the subject was at minimal expiration. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry with a QDR 4500/A whole-body scanner (Hologic, Bedford, MA). Diabetes medication type and dosage were assessed by detailed questionnaire with visual confirmation of prescription bottles. Participants were categorized as having increased use of, decreased use of, or no change in use of diabetes medications based on baseline and follow-up medication dosages.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>For the present analysis, we have included all control participants and all exercise-training participants who had fitness test data available at baseline and follow-up, and had &#x0003e;70% adherence to exercise training. Cardiorespiratory fitness response was assessed as the change in measured VO<sub>2peak</sub> (&#x00394;VO<sub>2peak</sub>, in liters per minute) from baseline to follow-up. For the present analysis, a &#x02265;5% increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> from baseline to follow-up was defined as a clinically meaningful cardiorespiratory fitness response (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and the exercise-training participants were categorized as fitness nonresponders (&#x0003c;5% increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub>) or fitness responders (&#x02265;5% increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub>). Baseline clinical, demographic, and anthropometric characteristics were compared among the study groups (control, fitness responders, and fitness nonresponders) using the Wilcoxon rank-sum trend test for all continuous variables and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> trend test for categorical variables.</p><p>The primary outcome for the present analyses was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels from baseline to completion of training. Changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, anthropometric measures, and exercise test parameters were assessed among the study groups using linear mixed-effect models for repeated measures over time. The models were adjusted for baseline values, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and duration of diabetes. For HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements, monthly data were available, whereas exercise test parameters and anthropometric measures were available only at baseline and trial completion. For participants with missing HbA<sub>1c</sub> data at the 9-month follow-up, the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> level was calculated based on the difference in finger-stick&#x02013;measured HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at baseline and at the last recorded monthly visit. Results are presented as least squares&#x02013;adjusted means with 95% CIs. Sensitivity analyses were performed among exercise-training participants after excluding resistance training&#x02013;only participants to compare the changes in metabolic parameters with exercise training between fitness responder and nonresponder groups.</p><p>The association between continuous changes in fitness and change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels from baseline to post-training was further characterized using multivariable adjusted linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> level, diabetes duration, baseline fitness, baseline BMI, change in fitness, and change in the percentage of body fat.</p><p>Concomitant reductions in hypoglycemic medication use and reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were assessed as an additional secondary outcome using a composite dichotomous outcome variable. Individuals who decreased diabetes medication or reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> level by &#x02265;0.5% without increasing their use of medications were defined as successfully achieving the HbA<sub>1c</sub>-diabetes medication composite outcome. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis models were constructed to determine the likelihood of achieving the composite secondary outcome in the study participants with exercise training after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> level, diabetes duration, baseline fitness, baseline BMI, change in fitness, and change in the percentage of body fat. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Windows (release 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s11"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 202 participants (mean age 57.1 &#x000b1; 7.9 years, women 62.9%) were included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

First, a substantial proportion of participants with T2DM have no significant improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness in response to exercise training. Second, exercise training is associated with significant improvement in glycemic control among both fitness responders and fitness nonresponders. Third, exercise training&#x02013;related improvement in glycemic control among fitness nonresponders is associated with a significant reduction in central obesity and percentage of body fat. Taken together, these findings suggest that exercise training improves metabolic parameters in patients with T2DM independent of changes in cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p>The prevalence of fitness nonresponse among T2DM patients observed in the current study is greater than that previously reported among healthy adults (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This is particularly significant since the dose of exercise used in the current study was similar to that recommended by the National Institutes of Health (10&#x02013;12 kcal/kg/week) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The high fitness nonresponse rate observed among the exercise-training participants could be related to multiple factors. Patients with diabetes have increased prevalence of chronotropic incompetence, left ventricular hypertrophy, and adverse remodeling, all of which are associated with a greater risk for fitness nonresponse (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Also, previous studies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) have shown that patients with diabetes have slowed muscle perfusion kinetics and slowed oxidative phosphorylation that could lead to a relatively blunted improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness with exercise training.</p><p>Our study findings have important clinical implications for exercise counseling provided to sedentary middle-aged adults with T2DM. The current public health recommendations (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) suggest that such individuals should accumulate a minimum of 30 min of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of a week with a goal to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. However, it may not be feasible to achieve this target in a significant proportion of patients with coexisting conditions such as obesity, older age, and cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The current study suggests that improvements in metabolic parameters are observed among exercise-training participants independent of their change in cardiorespiratory fitness. This highlights the importance of sustained exercise training even in individuals who do not demonstrate improvement in measures of cardiorespiratory fitness. Furthermore, this study suggests that exercise-training programs should target and assess for improvement in metabolic parameters such as glycemic control, WC, and percentage of body fat among individuals with T2DM.</p><p>Response to exercise training has been traditionally expressed in terms of improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, physiological adaptation to exercise training is a complex and heterogeneous process affecting multiple organ systems (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Favorable effects of exercise on cardiac output and peripheral oxygen use mediate training-related improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Nonresponsiveness of cardiorespiratory fitness represents a failure of just one potential adaptation to exercise training. It is plausible that fitness-nonresponsive participants undergo favorable adaptations in other physiological pathways independent of fitness change. Small longitudinal studies (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) from the 1980s reported a lack of association between the magnitude of improvement in VO<sub>2peak</sub> and aerobic performance among recreationally active participants who underwent short-term endurance training. More recently, Vollaard et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) showed significant adaptations associated with metabolic control and aerobic performance even among exercise-training participants who had minimal improvements in VO<sub>2peak</sub> after training (low responders). However, these prior studies assessed participants without T2DM or other metabolic disorders. The current study provides further evidence in support of this notion among participants with T2DM, and shows that fitness nonresponders have significant improvement in metabolic parameters such as HbA<sub>1c</sub> level and adiposity, changes that are not significantly different from those in fitness responders. Thus, lack of improvement in one specific phenotype, specifically in VO<sub>2peak</sub>, does not negate other potential benefits of exercise and highlights the importance of assessing training response in a broader clinical context.</p><p>Recent studies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) have identified fitness improvement in response to exercise training as a significant predictor of improvement in glycemic control among participants with T2DM. However, these studies used estimated METs, derived from the maximal speed and grade reached during a treadmill test, as a measure of fitness. The impact of changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub>, the gold standard measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, on metabolic outcomes in exercise-training trials is not well understood. While some studies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) have identified an increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> as a significant predictor of improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, others have failed to observe this association. Brennan et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) evaluated the association between changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub> and insulin sensitivity among 60 participants with T2DM who underwent aerobic training for 3&#x02013;4 months, and reported that exercise-induced changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub> do not mediate changes in insulin sensitivity. In the current study, we have confirmed this lack of association between changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub> and improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in a much larger study population with a significantly longer duration of exercise training. In contrast, Larose et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) showed that change in VO<sub>2peak</sub> was a significant predictor of HbA<sub>1c</sub> change in response to exercise training. This discrepancy between the study findings could be due to the different parameters used as a measure of fitness change in the two studies. While change in VO<sub>2peak</sub> (in liters per minute) was used as the measure of change in fitness in the current study, Larose et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) used the change in oxygen uptake scaled to body mass (in liters per kilogram per minute) as the measure of change in fitness. A significant reduction in body weight with exercise training was observed by Larose et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and, as the unit of indexation, influenced the estimated VO<sub>2peak</sub> independent of changes in absolute VO<sub>2</sub> (in liters per minute) not scaled to weight. In that study, weight changes were significantly associated with improvement in VO<sub>2peak</sub> scaled to body mass as well as with HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and could explain the observed association between changes in fitness (oxygen uptake scaled to body mass) and glycemic control. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the analytical approach (per group in Larose et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] vs. combined in HART-D) and dose of exercise training (lower dose of training in the HART-D study) used in the two studies that could also have contributed toward the discrepant study findings.</p><p>The lack of association between change in cardiorespiratory fitness and improvement in glycemic control is likely due to differences in the underlying adaptive mechanisms that result from exercise training. Improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness in response to exercise training is associated with central cardiovascular adaptations, physiological cardiac remodeling, and improvement in stroke volume (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In contrast, training-associated changes in glycemic control are more related to improvement in insulin sensitivity secondary to peripheral adaptations in the adipose and skeletal muscle tissue (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Previous studies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) have identified changes in measures of central adiposity as significant predictors of improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and glycemic control. Similarly, the present observations suggest that reduction in the percentage of body fat is associated with significant improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, though whether it is causal or even contributory remains unclear. Supporting a contributory role, it is notable that the magnitude of reduction in WC and the percentage of body fat with training was similar among fitness responders and nonresponders, which were associated in both groups with demonstrable improvements in glucose metrics.</p><p>Our study has important limitations. First, the participants of the HART-D study had relatively well-controlled diabetes with an average HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 7.6. It is possible that among individuals with worse glycemic control, fitness responders may have a greater improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> level with exercise training compared with nonresponders. Second, we do not have a standard measure of insulin resistance that could have helped us to better understand the mechanism of improvement in glycemic control among fitness nonresponders. Third, we used a cutoff of &#x02265;5% change in VO<sub>2peak</sub> as a clinically meaningful fitness response based on previous studies and consensus in the literature. The threshold for meaningful improvement in fitness in these sedentary patients with T2DM could be different. However, we observed similar results using a more lenient definition for fitness improvement (change in VO<sub>2peak</sub> &#x0003e;0 L/min, data not shown). Furthermore, we did not observe any association between continuous change in fitness and change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> level in linear regression analysis, suggesting that our observations are insensitive to the threshold of fitness response. Finally, a food frequency questionnaire was used at baseline and follow-up to assess changes in diet, which limits our ability to identify changes in caloric intake and diet composition.</p><p>In conclusion, exercise training is associated with significant improvement in glycemic control and measures of adiposity among participants with T2DM independent of their change in cardiorespiratory fitness. Further studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms by which training improves metabolic parameters among fitness nonresponders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Funding.</bold> The HART-D Study (NCT00458133) was supported by grant DK-068298 from the National Institutes of Health.</p><p><bold>Duality of Interest.</bold> D.K.M. reports receiving honoraria for trial leadership and consultation with GlaxoSmithKline, The Medicines Company, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, Orexigen, Cubist, Janssen, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck, Regeneron, Lexicon, and Eisai.
