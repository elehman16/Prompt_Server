In a section entitled, "Noninfectious, Nonallergic Rhinitis," the ARIA Report states: "Our knowledge in this area is poor. The response to H1-antihistamines in patients who have sneezing as a predominant symptom points at histamine as an important mediator, but H1-antihistamines are generally ineffective in most patients." Why then a review of the role of antihistamines in the management of vasomotor or nonallergic rhinitis?</p><p>The reason for the inclusion of antihistamines as a potentially beneficial therapeutic agent in vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) is a seminal study by Banov et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] demonstrating that azelastine was effective in managing this disorder. The Banov article was published in the same year as the ARIA guidelines (2001), and, thus, was not included in the ARIA document. This article changed our perspective on the potential use of antihistamines, at least those administered intranasally, in the treatment of VMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, a suggestion that oral antihistamines might be helpful in the treatment of VMR was generated by Purello-D'Ambrosio et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The Purello-D'Ambrosio study compared loratadine + flunisolide to flunisolide + placebo in patients suffering from a subcategory of nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia (NARES). The loratadine + flunisolide treated group fared better than the flunisolide + placebo group. Improvements were noted in sneezing and rhinorrhea, prompting the authors to conclude that loratadine "improves the effectiveness of flunisolide in treatment of NARES." Thus, there clearly is justification for a review of antihistamine therapy in the management of VMR.</p></sec><sec><title>Some Putative Mechanisms of Action of Antihistamines in the Treatment of VMR</title><p>The proposed mechanisms by which antihistamines might be effective in the therapy for VMR are include:</p><p>1. "Classic" H1 antagonist (reverse agonist) activity as believed to be responsible for their beneficial effects in allergic rhinitis</p><p>2. Antagonism of other histamine receptors, most probably via the H2 and, perhaps, H3 receptors</p><p>3. Other "anti-inflammatory/antiallergic" actions</p><p>A discussion of each of these potential mechanisms of action can shed some light on the observations, noted above,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] that antihistamine treatment may have a salutary effect on the symptoms of VMR.</p><sec><title>Potential Benefit via H1 Receptor Antagonism</title><p>Histamine has 4 receptor types (H1, H2, H3, and H4), which are all G protein-coupled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Antihistamines used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis all have as their most prominent activity, antagonism (reverse agonism) of the H1 receptor. The characteristics of the H1 receptor are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The difficulty in postulating a role for H1 antagonism in the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis is the scant evidence that histamine plays a role in this disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, it is unlikely that the demonstrated effects of antihistamines on VMR symptoms are related to H1 receptor antagonism (reverse agonism).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Histamine and Its Activities</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Receptor</th><th align="center">H<sub>1</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Signal conduction through</td><td align="center">G<sub>q/11 </sub>and others</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Location of receptors</td><td align="center">Multiple sites throughout the body including: Smooth muscle bronchi and gastrointestinal tract, cardiac tissue, blood vessels, sensory nerves, endothelium, central nervous system</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Chromosome location</td><td align="center">3p25, 3p14-21</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Signal conduction induces</td><td align="center">Increased cyclic GMP, increased intracellular cytosolic calcium, activation of phospholipase C, activation of guanyl cyclase, nitric oxide production</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Antagonists (reverse agonists)</td><td align="center">Over 40 exist.

There is some evidence that H2 receptors mediate dilation of nasal blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Wood-Baker et al showed that stimulation of the H2 receptor can cause nasal obstruction presumably because of vasodilatation. Subjects were pretreated with oral cetirizine or ranitidine in a double-blind, randomized manner after which histamine was applied to the nasal mucosa. They measured the concentration of total protein and albumin in nasal lavage fluid and nasal airway resistance before and after histamine challenge. Ranitidine reduced the maximum increase in nasal airway resistance, but this effect was only significant when combined with cetirizine. The increase in nasal lavage protein and albumin was almost completely abolished by cetirizine; ranitidine had far less effect. They concluded that H2 receptor antagonism had little, if any, effect on vascular permeability but did seem to have some effect on nasal obstruction.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>H2 Receptor Antagonists</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Receptor</th><th align="center">H<sub>2</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Signal conduction through</td><td align="center">G<sub>s</sub></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Location of receptors</td><td align="center">Widely expressed including: Mucosa of stomach, cardiac tissue, uterus, smooth muscle vascular bed, epithelium of mucosa of nose, submucosal glands in nose, central nervous system, immune cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Chromosome location</td><td align="center">5q35.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Signal conduction induces</td><td align="center">Increase in cyclic AMP, activation of adenyl cyclase</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Antagonists (reverse agonists)</td><td align="center">Burimamide, cimetidine, dimaprit, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine, and others (it should be noted that a number of different H1 antagonists also show affinity for the H2 receptor</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Activities</td><td align="center">Increased gastric acid secretion; increases vascular permeability producing a fall in blood pressure, flush, headache, and reflex tachycardia; stimulate mucus production in the lungs; direct chronotropic effect on atrium and inotropic action on ventricle; relaxation of esophageal sphincter; stimulation of suppressor T-cells; decrease in neutrophil and basophil chemotaxis and activation; proliferation of lymphocytes; activity of NK cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Nasal symptoms produced</td><td align="center">Antagonism of the H2 receptor could potentially reduce the effect of histamine on nasal airway swelling, producing nasal decongestion</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Further evidence was found for a role of H2 receptor stimulation in the production of symptoms of rhinitis via an investigation by Shelton and Eisor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These investigators applied histamine, a specific H1 receptor agonist (betahistine, and a specific H2 receptor agonist) impromidine, to the nasal mucosa of 11 normal subjects and 4 patients with rhinitis. Sneezing, nasal irritation, and hypersecretion were induced only by histamine and the H1 receptor agonist, betahistine. Nasal airway resistance was increased by all 3 agents, with histamine being the most potent effector and with the H2 receptor agonist, impromidine, producing a greater effect than the H1 receptor agonist, betahistine. Thus, this study clearly showed a role for H2 receptor stimulation in the production of nasal congestion.</p><p>A number of H1 antagonists demonstrate H2 receptor binding. For example, Sharif et al compared the activity of several H1 antagonists on the H2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Taylor-Clark et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] investigated the mechanisms by which histamine produced nasal blockage. They applied histamine and specific histamine receptor agonists intranasally in healthy human subjects and assessed their effect on airway congestion by acoustic rhinometry. Oral pretreatment with cetirizine had only a partial effect on nasal blockage. Dimaprit, an H2 agonist, produced nasal congestion that was reversed by ranitidine. A combination of cetirizine and ranitidine caused greater inhibition of nasal blockage than cetirizine alone. An H3 agonist, R-alpha-methylhistamine, produced nasal blockage that was not inhibited by cetirizine or ranitidine.</p><p>The H3 antagonist, thioperamide, reversed the R-alpha-methylhistamine induced nasal blockage. Thioperamide alone had no effect on nasal blockage caused by histamine, but in the presence of cetirizine, thioperamide further reduced the histamine-induced nasal blockage. They concluded that nasal congestion because of the application of histamine to healthy nasal mucosa results from activity at H1, H2, and H3 receptors.</p><p>Therefore, there is a third potential means by which antagonism of histamine could favorably affect nasal congestion. However, again, for this therapy to be effective, histamine would have to play a role in producing congestion in VMR, and H1 antagonists would have to show some promiscuity, being active at the H2 and H3 receptors as well.</p></sec><sec><title>The H4 Receptor</title><p>The H4 receptor (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>) is mentioned only for the sake of thoroughness.

There is no evidence that H1 antagonists act at the H4 receptor.

These effects have been well documented and have been demonstrated for many different molecules including those administered orally and by intranasal application. Some of the in vitro effects may be of very little clinical importance because, in many instances, the concentration of antihistamine necessary to produce the effects are higher than those commonly achieved by oral administration of recommended doses. However, in some instances, for intranasally administered antihistamine, the concentrations achieving an "anti-inflammatory effect" are obtained at recommended doses. This may explain the fact that the only antihistamine to date approved for use in VMR in the US is azelastine, which is administered intranasally. Some of the presumably most important "anti-inflammatory/antiallergic" activities of antihistamines are noted in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref> and summarized below.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>"Anti-inflammatory/Antiallergic" Activities of Antihistamines</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Prevent mast cell degranulation</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Downregulate expression of adhesion molecules</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Downregulate chemotaxis</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Eosinophils</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Neutrophils</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Enhance inflammatory cell apoptosis</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Reduce inflammatory cytokine expression</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Decrease neurogenic enhancement of inflammation</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Prevention of Mast Cell/Basophil Degranulation</title><p>Perhaps the most well studied anti-inflammatory/anti-allergic effect of antihistamines is related to their ability to inhibit mast cell and basophil mediator release. This effect has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Both preformed mediators and newly synthesized mediator release can be prevented by antihistamines. This effect has been shown not only for IgE-mediated release, induced by both allergen and anti-IgE, but also for secretagogues including compound 48/80, substance P, concanavalin A, and calcium ionophore A23187.</p><p>In general, all second-generation antihistamines show some inhibition of inflammatory mediator release from mast cells and basophils in vitro, but there is a great deal of heterogeneity between activity of these drugs in terms of the concentration required, the experimental conditions employed, and the degranulation stimulus.</p><p>For example, Okayama et al studied the effects of terfenadine, ketotifen, and cetirizine on human lung, tonsil, and skin mast cells stimulated immunologically with anti-IgE, and found varying results depending on the drug studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Both azelastine and olopatadine have clearly been shown to diminish basophil and mast cell degranulation. Azelastine has been shown to inhibit the release of histamine from both human and animal mast cells induced by various stimuli including anti-IgE, antigen, calcium ionophores, and compound 48/80. In vivo this agent has been demonstrated to prevent synthesis and/or release of mediators including leukotrienes, tosyl arginine, methyl esterase, oxygen free radicals, platelet activating factor, and superoxide anion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Olopatadine has also shown mast cell stabilizing activity inhibiting the release of histamine, tryptase, tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, and prostaglandin D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Perhaps more important, because of the greater clinical applicability, is the ability of antihistamines to reduce the expression of ICAM-1 and the subsequent inflammatory cell infiltration in the eyes and nose in vivo. Azelastine, levocabastine, cetirizine, oxatomide, terfenadine, fexofenadine, mizolastine, olopatadine, and loratadine have all been shown to diminish ICAM-1 expression on either nasal and/or conjunctival epithelial cells.

Ito, et al, reported a case of hypereosinophilic syndrome in a 9-year-old, in which the administration of azelastine significantly reduced peripheral eosinophilia while simultaneously markedly diminishing the serum interleukin 5 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction of the Inflammatory Cytokine Expression</title><p>As with the other anti-inflammatory/antiallergic effects noted above, antihistamines have been shown to diminish the expression of a number of different cytokines, both in vivo and in vitro.

It has been shown that at least some patients with VMR demonstrate inflammatory infiltrates in the nasal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to assume that inhibition of the inflammatory activity resulting in these infiltrates could be responsible for the improvement in VMR symptoms shown in at least one double-blind placebo-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>Based on a summation of the above information, there is little doubt that antihistamine therapy could be potentially effective in the treatment of VMR, especially through anti-inflammatory/antiallergic effects. However, there has been a dearth of clinical confirmation of the efficacy of antihistamines, especially oral antihistamines, in VMR.</p><sec><title>Oral Antihistamines</title><p>Trials of oral antihistamines are scarce and have yielded, in general, inconsistent and for the most part, disappointing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Two of these studies evaluated an antihistamine as adjunctive therapy either with a decongestant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or a topical steroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Broms and Malm found that phenylpropanolamine alone in a dose of 100 mg reduced nasal airway resistance, but that this drug in a dose of 50 mg combined with an oral antihistamine had no effect on nasal airway resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Purello-D'Ambrosio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] found loratadine added to the beneficial effect of flunisolide. Two other studies looked at antihistamines as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Mullarkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported that topical steroids were superior to antihistamines in the treatment of patients with NARES; Rinne et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] came to a similar conclusion in a long-term study comparing topical budesonide to cetirizine in NARES patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Intranasal Antihistamines</title><p>The only antihistamine currently approved in the US for use in VMR is azelastine, an agent with broad-based pharmacologic activities in addition to its H1 receptor antagonist action. Food and Drug Association (FDA) approval was based on 2 pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrating efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Another multicenter, double blind, randomized, parallel-group study by Gehanno et al confirmed the efficacy of azelastine in VMR,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and 2 large open-label studies employing patient questionnaires demonstrated the beneficial effect of azelastine in patients with allergic rhinitis, mixed rhinitis, and VMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>There is also a study employing topical levacobastine in a small number of patients, some with allergic rhinitis and some with VMR. Levocabastine was found to be superior to placebo for symptoms of nasal discharge and sneezing but not for congestion in the VMR group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A Closer Look</title><p>Because the FDA approval of azelastine for the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis was granted based on 2 studies, as noted above, by Banov, et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] it would be of value to take a closer look at these investigations. Both studies were multicenter placebo-controlled trials of azelastine for the treatment of nonallergic VMR, and both used identical protocols. More than 200 patients were evaluated; the response rates were between 82 and 85%. It is of note that the response to placebo in these studies was quite high, 73%. This is not unexpected because placebo saline nasal spray has shown to exert some beneficial effect in this disorder.</p><p>All of the patients in these trials had experienced symptoms of VMR for at least one year, had negative skin tests to a mixed panel of seasonal and perennial allergens, and had no eosinophils as evaluated by nasal cytology. After a 1 week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, patients who met the symptom severity qualification criteria were randomized to receive either azelastine nasal spray or placebo. Patients recorded the severity of their symptoms on diary cards each morning and evening, using a 4-point symptom rating scale. The primary efficacy variable was the overall reduction from baseline in the total VMR symptom score over the 21 day, double-blind, treatment period.</p><p>In both trials, azelastine was superior to placebo in reducing VMR symptom score from baseline (study 1, <italic>P </italic>= 0.002; study 2, <italic>P </italic>= 0.005). Significant improvement occurred within the first week. In addition, of note is that azelastine was superior to placebo in all 4 symptoms measured, including nasal congestion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Data are sparse regarding the effects of antihistamines on the symptoms of VMR. Nonetheless, there is theoretical rationale, based upon the activities of antihistamines (especially their anti-inflammatory/antiallergic activities) to support the hypothesis that they may be effective agents in treating VMR. This hypothesis was confirmed in a study of azelastine in the treatment of this disorder. However, to date there is no convincing evidence that oral antihistamines are helpful, in general, as monotherapy and only inconsistent and sparse data supporting their use as adjunctive treatment given with topical coticosteroids or decongestants.</p></sec><sec><title>End Note</title><p>Dr. Lieberman discloses that he is a consultant, or on an advisory board or the speakers bureau for GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Schering Plough Corporation, Meda Pharmaceuticals, and Alcon Laboratories.</p><p>Presented at a roundtable conference held in December 2008 in Washington, DC.
