The safety of lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets was investigated in a randomized, blinded, parallel-group design study in healthy Beagle puppies starting at 8&#x000a0;weeks of age.

Sixteen male and 16 female healthy 8-week-old puppies, weighing ~1.5 to 3.0&#x000a0;kg, were randomized among four groups to be untreated controls or to receive lotilaner at dose rates of 43&#x000a0;mg/kg (1&#x000d7;), 129&#x000a0;mg/kg (3&#x000d7;), or 215&#x000a0;mg/kg (5&#x000d7;) on eight occasions - every 4&#x000a0;weeks over 8&#x000a0;months. The control group was sham-dosed. Study dogs were fed within 30&#x000a0;min prior to treatment.

Members of the isoxazoline class have been shown to kill insects and acari by interfering with neuromuscular and central nervous neurotransmission through binding to receptors that activate ligand-gated chloride channels (&#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid- and glutamate-gated chloride channels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The safety of these compounds in mammals is due to their significant selectivity for neurons that are present throughout the insect central nervous and neuromuscular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Formulated as a flavoured chewable tablet, in recently fed dogs lotilaner (Credelio&#x02122;) is rapidly absorbed, achieving peak blood concentrations within 2&#x000a0;h after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Lotilaner has a half-life of approximately 30&#x000a0;days, so that insecticidal and acaricidal blood levels are sustained for at least 1&#x000a0;month following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Laboratory studies have indicated that lotilaner will be a valuable drug for veterinarians and dog owners in the management of flea and tick infestations, but before wide-scale use could be recommended, it was important to demonstrate safety in the target canine population following repeated administrations of the highest recommended dose rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">A Target Animal Safety study was initiated with the objective of evaluating the safety of lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets in 8-week old Beagle dogs when administered orally as tablets, once every 4&#x000a0;weeks for 8&#x000a0;months. The recommended (minimum) monthly dose rate of lotilaner is 20&#x000a0;mg/kg. Since the tablets are recommended for a weight band, the dose rate range is 20&#x02013;43&#x000a0;mg/kg to be administered once a month orally.

Furthermore, for both wet and dry food consumption, there were no statistically significant treatment-related effects. It was therefore concluded that the test article had no significant effect on body weights or food consumption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Physical/neurological examinations</title><p id="Par48">No clinically relevant abnormalities attributable to the treatment were detected during scheduled physical/neurological examinations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Electrocardiographic evaluations</title><p id="Par49">All ECG readings were qualitatively and quantitatively within normal limits. When absolute group mean values were evaluated statistically and compared to interval-matched control values, the QRS duration of the data pooled for both sexes in the 43&#x000a0;mg/kg dose was longer than the control group at the terminal interval. As the difference was mild and noted only following the low dose, the difference is not considered treatment-related. The QTc interval in males in the 43&#x000a0;mg/kg group was shorter than in control group at the terminal interval when comparing the pooled QTc interval data from all phases of the study. As the difference in the QTc interval was noted in only one sex and following the low dose, the difference is not considered to be related to treatment. There was no effect of oral administration of lotilaner on qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Clinical pathology</title><p id="Par50">There were no lotilaner-related effects on haematology, plasma chemistry, coagulation profiles, or urinalysis parameters at any dose level. Any statistically significant changes from baseline were not considered meaningful, based on their small magnitude, lack of dose response, maturation and growth of the dogs during the study, and/or relationship to pre-test and expected historical ranges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Organ weights and gross and microscopic examinations</title><p id="Par51">There were no lotilaner-related macroscopic findings at terminal necropsy and no toxicologically meaningful organ weight changes in males or females. Any statistically significant differences between any of the treated groups, relative to controls, were not considered toxicologically meaningful because there were no microscopic correlates to the weight changes, no dose&#x02013;response relationships, and/or opposite effects were present in males and females. Similarly, there were no definitive lotilaner-related microscopic findings. Occasional findings of vasculitis/perivasculitis are consistent with spontaneous/background vasculitis previously described in Beagle dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and microscopic findings in the reproductive tissues were considered to be associated with the maturation and growth of the dogs during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis</title><p id="Par52">The low variability of lotilaner in Cmax and AUC<sub>0-672h</sub> between animals and months throughout the study demonstrates consistent and adequate exposure of all treated dogs. Mean systemic exposure and Cmax values increased with increasing dose in a less than dose proportional manner, especially in the 5&#x000d7; group which was approximately 3-fold instead of 5-fold (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). No gender effect was observed. As reported with other isoxazolines, a moderate degree of accumulation (from single treatment to steady state) is expected and for lotilaner can be considered a normal consequence of the relatively long half-life, which in turn provides assurance that efficacy will be sustained over the entire month following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mean lotilaner whole blood concentration-time profiles following eight consecutive monthly oral administrations of 43 (1&#x000d7;), 129 (3&#x000d7;), and 215 (5&#x000d7;) mg/kg</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13071_2017_2468_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">Careful clinical examinations, clinical pathology assessments and macroscopic/microscopic examinations in this rigorous safety investigation found that eight consecutive monthly lotilaner treatments, at dose rates of up to 215&#x000a0;mg/kg, beginning when puppies were 8&#x000a0;weeks of age did not cause any effects of toxicological concern. The results therefore show that lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets have a wide safety margin when administered at monthly intervals to puppies and dogs, male or female, at the highest dose band rate of 43&#x000a0;mg/kg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
