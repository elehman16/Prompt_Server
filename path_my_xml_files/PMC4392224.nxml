At week 24, patients who achieved the primary endpoint of Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission at both weeks 20 and 24 stopped study treatment and continued in the study until week 52.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 194 patients (CZP=96; placebo=98), &#x0003e;90% had moderate disease activity at baseline. Significantly more CZP patients met the primary endpoint than placebo patients (week 20 and 24 CDAI remission rates: 18.8% vs 6.1%; p&#x02264;0.05). At week 24, 63.0% vs 29.7% of CZP versus placebo patients (p&#x0003c;0.001) achieved LDA. Disease activity score (ESR) based on 28-joint count and Simplified Disease Activity Index remission rates were also significantly higher with CZP versus placebo (19.8% vs 3.1%; p&#x02264;0.01 and 14.6% vs 4.1%; p&#x02264;0.05). CZP patients reported improvements in physical function versus placebo (mean Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability-Index change from baseline: CZP, &#x02212;0.25 vs placebo, &#x02212;0.03; p&#x02264;0.01). During the period following withdrawal of CZP or placebo, only 3/17 prior CZP patients and 2/6 prior placebo patients maintained CDAI remission until week 52, but CZP reinstitution allowed renewed improvement. Adverse and serious adverse event rates were comparable between CZP and placebo groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Addition of CZP to non-biologic DMARDs is an effective treatment in RA patients with predominantly moderate disease activity, allowing low-disease activity or remission to be reached in a majority of the patients. However, the data suggest that CZP cannot be withdrawn in patients achieving remission.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT00674362.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rheumatoid Arthritis</kwd><kwd>Anti-TNF</kwd><kwd>Disease Activity</kwd><kwd>DMARDs (biologic)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate (MTX), are standard therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While some patients have only a minimal response, continuing to show high-disease activity (HDA), and others attain remission, the majority achieve significant improvement but continue to have low to moderate disease activity (MDA).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> MDA is associated with a significant burden for patients and society regarding quality of life, productivity, comorbidities and costs when compared with remission.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> Furthermore, patients with MDA are likely to experience joint damage progression and loss of function with conventional DMARD therapy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Recently, the definition of remission in RA has now been updated by ACR and EULAR, using Boolean- and index-based criteria; the latter employ the remission definitions by the simplified and clinical disease activity indices (Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)).</p><p>Few randomised clinical trials have specifically investigated RA treatments in patients with low disease activity (LDA)/MDA, although data from post-hoc analyses, open-label studies and registries suggest that anti-TNFs are efficacious.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> Furthermore, there is little information regarding treatment adjustment once stringent remission is attained.

mostly MDA, addition of CZP, compared with addition of placebo, to non-biologic DMARDs led to significantly higher rates of sustained remission or LDA as assessed by CDAI (almost two-thirds of patients) and other scores. In CERTAIN, the CDAI remission rates at weeks 20 and 24 (the primary endpoint) were similar to SDAI/CDAI remission rates at a comparable time point in the Prospective, Randomized Etanercept Study to Evaluate Reduced dose Etanercept + MTX v. full dose Etanercept + MTX v. MTX alone for efficacy and radiographic endpoints in a moderate RA population (PRESERVE) study, which indicates that in patients with long-standing disease duration achievement of stringent remission is difficult. Indeed, this finding supports the notion of the Treat-to-Target and EULAR recommendations that suggest use of LDA rather than remission as a treatment target in patients with established disease.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Disease activity in patients receiving placebo (continuing non-biologic DMARDs) increased to week 24 by CDAI and SDAI, with over one-third of patients moving to an HDA state. This contrasts with decreases in disease activity in placebo-treated patients usually seen in clinical trials as a consequence of the &#x02018;placebo effect&#x02019;. Thus, in these patients, CZP addition not only led to more frequent good clinical states but also prevented disease worsening by inhibiting progression to HDA. This novel finding is aligned with observations that early RA patients with persistent MDA experience functional deterioration.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Rapid and sustained improvements in CDAI, SDAI and DAS28(ESR), from the first time point at 4&#x02005;weeks, were observed following CZP initiation, with the majority of response observed within 12&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>Results were consistent across secondary endpoints, including SDAI and DAS28(ESR) remission, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, CDAI, SDAI and DAS28(ESR) values and patient-reported outcomes over the entire 24-week treatment period. The low number of baseline tender and swollen joints may have contributed to lower ACR responses than observed in other CZP studies: 79% of CZP-treated and 86% of placebo-treated patients had baseline TJC or SJC&#x02264;3 and therefore could not achieve an ACR70 unless having 0 TJC and SJC by week 24.</p><p>CDAI and SDAI are considered the appropriate composite measures for definition of remission by ACR and EULAR.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The primary endpoint of CERTAIN was CDAI remission at two consecutive time points at the end of the initial observation period, a stringent definition of remission. As CDAI does not include measures of acute phase reactants (APR), it is often more useful in routine clinical care.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Unlike CDAI and SDAI, DAS28(ESR) is strongly influenced by absolute values and changes of APR levels,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The alternative target of LDA was attained in almost two-thirds of CZP patients at 6&#x02005;months in the CERTAIN study. Interestingly, patients achieving remission had shorter disease duration and fewer prior DMARD therapies, indicating that remission is more difficult to achieve in patients with more refractory disease. Also, baseline HAQ-DI scores tended to be lower among remitters despite similar SDAI, CDAI and DAS28 values, in patients assigned to both CZP and placebo, consistent with the PRESERVE study.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> These may represent potential predictors for achievement of remission.</p><p>Current EULAR recommendations suggest considering withdrawal of biologic DMARDs in patients in stable remission.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, this study reveals that, upon stopping CZP therapy, most patients were unable to maintain remission, in line with observational studies in established RA<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref> and from the PRESERVE trial, where termination of etanercept in stable LDA resulted in a lower likelihood of maintaining LDA than continuing etanercept.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, unlike in CERTAIN, comparisons between patients receiving etanercept and those who only continued prior non-biologic DMARD treatment could not be ascertained in PRESERVE due to the open-label nature of the run-in period that only included etanercept therapy and no placebo control.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In the CERTAIN study, somewhat more frequent flares were seen after anti-TNF withdrawal than in the PRESERVE study; this is likely a consequence of the requirement of achieving the clinical target for at least 6&#x02005;months before withdrawal in the PRESERVE study compared with at least 4&#x02005;weeks in the CERTAIN study; moreover, the treatment target was more stringent in the CERTAIn study (CDAI remission vs DAS28 LDA). In contrast to CERTAIN and PRESERVE studies, the Optimal Protocol for Treatment Initiation With Methotrexate and Adalimumab Combination Therapy in Patients With Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (OPTIMA) study assessed early RA patients and revealed that most of them were able to maintain DAS28 LDA upon stopping adalimumab and continuing MTX; only a relatively small number of patients would have benefited from continuing or reinstituting adalimumab.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This difference suggests that, contrasting with early disease, biological therapy should not be stopped in established disease once an acceptable disease activity state has been attained, in agreement with observational studies.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Alternatively, a longer remission state may be necessary prior to stopping biological therapy.</p><p>In line with observational studies on retreatment with biologics<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and contrasting with DMARD retreatment,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> among patients receiving CZP retreatment after flaring to MDA/HDA, almost half (4/10) of the prior CZP-treated patients re-achieved remission, and the remaining 6 LDA; thus, all these patients showed response to retreatment. Such retreatment was not assessed in PRESERVE or OPTIMA studies.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, only a small number of patients were included in the follow-up since fewer patients than expected achieved remission, presumably a consequence of long-standing disease and stringent remission criteria. At the time of study design, there were no prior data available from patients with MDA or LDA and so the actual proportions of patients achieving sustained remission indicate that this trial was not adequately powered, which is a limitation of the study; however, despite this underpowering, the differences between the treatment arms were significant. Also, in a recent analysis from an observational prospective RA database, patient's global assessment of disease activity was often the limiting factor to reach remission;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> this may also have contributed to the low CDAI remission rates in this study of patients with long-standing RA, and, indeed, the greatest mean contribution to the CDAI in patients not reaching remission at week 24 on certolizumab pegol came from the patient's global assessment (data not shown). Second, retreatment upon flaring was not performed in a placebo-controlled manner but as an open-label exploratory analysis; nevertheless, it is unlikely that we observed a placebo effect upon retreatment since disease activity increased also in the placebo arm and patients remained masked to the initial double-blind period. Third, we did not assess dose reduction or interval increase once patients achieved remission, a strategy reported effective in maintaining LDA in the PRESERVE trial.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The results presented here reveal that CZP addition to non-biologic DMARDs in patients with long-standing, mostly MDA is associated with increased remission and LDA rates, prevention of worsening and improvements in physical function, quality of life, work productivity and daily activities. Remission was lost upon discontinuation of CZP treatment, although response was regained by reinstitution of CZP. Taken alongside the level of overall impairment in persistent MDA<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and the low likelihood of these patients achieving LDA/remission with DMARD treatment alone,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the data suggest that RA patients with LDA/MDA are a relevant population to treat with TNF inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-204632-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1378" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge &#x02018;Matladi Ndlovu, PhD, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium, for publication management and Costello Medical Consulting for editorial and administrative support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JSS has received grants from and provided expert advice to UCB Pharma.
