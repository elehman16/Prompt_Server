The &#x02018;Girls Active&#x02019; secondary school-based programme, developed by the Youth Sport Trust, aims to increase PA in adolescent girls. This paper explores the effectiveness of the &#x02018;Girls Active&#x02019; school-based PA programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A random sample of girls aged 11&#x02013;14 from 20 secondary schools (Midlands, UK) participated in a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial. Ten schools received Girls Active and 10 continued with usual practice. Measurements were taken at baseline, seven- and 14-month follow-up. Primary outcome: wrist-worn accelerometer measured moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA). Secondary outcomes: overall PA, light PA, sedentary time, body composition, and psychosocial outcomes. Generalised estimating equations, adjusted for school cluster and potential confounders, were used and A priori subgroup analysis was undertaken. Micro-costing and cost-consequence analyses were conducted using bespoke collection methods on programme delivery information. Outcomes for the cost-consequence analysis were health related quality of life measured by the Child Health Utility-9D and service use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Overall, 1752 pupils participated, 1211 (69.1%) provided valid 14-month accelerometer data. No difference in MVPA (mins/day; 95% confidence intervals) was found at 14&#x000a0;months (1.7; -0.8 to 4.3), there was at seven months (2.4; 0.1 to 4.7). Subgroup analyses showed significant intervention effects on 14-month in larger schools (3.9; 1.39 to 6.09) and in White Europeans (3.1; 0.60 to 6.02) and in early maturers (5.1; 1.69 to 8.48) at seven months. The control group did better in smaller schools at 14-months (-4.38; -7.34 to -1.41). Significant group differences were found in 14-month identified motivation (-0.09; -0.18 to -0.01) and at seven months in: overall PA (1.39&#x000a0;m<italic>g</italic>/day; 0.1 to 2.2), after-school sedentary time (-4.7; -8.9 to -0.6), whole day (5.7; 1.0 to 10.5) and school day (4.5; 0.25 to 8.75) light PA, self-esteem. Small, statistically significant, differences in some psychosocial variables favoured control schools. Micro-costing demonstrated that delivering the programme resulted in a range of time and financial costs at each school. Cost-consequence analysis demonstrated no effect of the programme for health related quality of life or service use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Compared with usual practice, &#x02018;Girls Active&#x02019; did not affect 14-month MVPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">

Adolescent females have been highlighted as a particular group at risk of declining PA with recent data showing that only 16% and 9% of girls aged 11&#x02013;12 and 13&#x02013;15&#x000a0;years, respectively, are sufficiently active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the decline in PA may begin prior to the transition between primary and secondary (high) school, and occurs in both boys and girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], there is a need to identify ways to stem the decline in PA in girls once they enter secondary schools as the decline is steeper and faster in girls than boys. Schools have been highlighted as a setting to tackle the inactivity crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] using a variety of strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Effects are generally small and short-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, potential mediators of physical activity changes (i.e. to help explain effectiveness) are not robustly or routinely assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Reviews have identified that much of the evidence comes from the US, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and there is an absence of robust &#x0201c;proven&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;promising&#x0201d; practice within the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In an effort to tackle youth inactivity the Youth Sport Trust (YST; the largest non-profit organisation focussing on youth sport and activity in the UK) have developed programmes designed to support schools in engaging girls in PA. &#x02018;Girls Active&#x02019; is one such programme which uses peer leadership and marketing to empower adolescent girls to influence school decisions, develop themselves as role models, and promote PA to peers. Schools are provided with training and resources to review the their PA, sport and physical education (PE) provision, culture and practices to girls and to create action plans for how they will implement changes.

Following baseline measurements, schools were randomised by an independent statistician to one of two groups stratified by school size (pupil median: &#x0003c;&#x02009;850, &#x02265;850) and percent black and minority ethnicity (BME) pupils (median: &#x0003c;&#x02009;20%, &#x02265;20%). Sequentially numbered sections within a folder were used to implement the group allocations. The investigator team were not aware of the sequence until after randomisation. Measurement team members, except the team lead for the day, were blinded to group randomisation. The trial statistician was not blinded. However, the statistical analysis plan was signed off prior to database lock and any deviations from the analysis plan are reported herein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Stakeholder involvement</title><p id="Par29">Girls Active is built on over 10&#x000a0;years of work by the YST that includes consultations with school senior leaders, teachers, young people, national agencies and corporate partners. This extended to consultations with adolescent girls and their teachers in order to refine the programme prior to this evaluation study. The research team consulted with two groups (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;8 and <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;6) of adolescents and PE teachers (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;3) at local schools in Leicester City ahead of the funding application. This informed the decision around outcome measures: i.e. preference of a wrist worn accelerometer over one worn on the hip or the thigh, economic evaluation cost diaries and process evaluation themes and questions. Key stakeholders were involved in the study as two lay members sat on the trial steering committee (TSC). Lead teachers co-designed their own school reports so that anonymised baseline data specific to their school could be used within their schools. Further dissemination will be undertaken to the study participant through a further anonymised school level report as well as a briefing event for school leads and other personnel involved in education, sport and physical activity decision making. Stakeholders were not involved in decisions around study design, recruitment or conduct of the study and the burden of the programme was not assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants and school clusters</title><p id="Par30">All state (government funded) secondary schools in Leicester City, Leicestershire and Rutland (LLR), UK (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;56) with a Key Stage 3 (KS3: age 11&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years) were eligible and were sent a letter of invitation to the study. Of these, 25 agreed to come to a briefing event about the study, 15 attended of which 14 obtained consent from the school principal for their school to participate. In tandem, a further 26 state schools that were geographically close to LLR but in neighbouring counties were approached and 6 of these consented to participate. Schools provided the research team a list of all eligible girls between the ages of 11 and 14&#x000a0;years and in years 7, 8 and 9. All eligible pupils were provided with an information pack that contained a separate participant and parent/guardian information sheet and opt out consent form as well as an invitation letter. Pupils had two weeks to return the opt out consent form. Using a random number generator, 90 girls from each school were chosen at random (split between year groups).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par31">This study was designed to provide adequate power to detect a meaningful group difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in MVPA of 10 mins/day assuming a standard deviation of 18 mins/day in MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], a power of 90%, a significance of 0.05, a cluster size of 56 girls and an intra-class correlation of 0.1.

The aim of Girls Active is to provide a support framework for schools to review and change their PA, PE and school sport culture and practices with the support of the YST and a hub school. Teachers completed a school self-review and attended an initial training day delivered by a YST national tutor. At this day, teachers discussed the programme elements (including establishing a peer leader group) and started developing their school action plan. They received a folder of case studies and electronic versions of marketing materials for promotion within their school. One of the key elements to the programme was the formation of a girls leadership and peer marketing group to empower girls to influence PE, sport and PA in their school, develop as role models, and promote and market PA to other girls. Over the course of the programme, resources for lead teachers were uploaded to an online file sharing system. School leads attended a peer review day to share practice with other teachers facilitated by the development coach and a hub school teacher. Lead teachers were offered in-person or phone support through the hub school or development coach. Lead teachers were free to implement the programme flexibly in whatever way they wished but were encouraged to set up a peer leader group who were to market PA to their peers and help prioritise PA decisions within their school. Teachers were encouraged to identify pupils that are not necessarily the sporty pupils but those who bring a range of perspectives and could communicate with, and motivate their peers. They were provided with two &#x000a3;500 capacity funding instalments to coincide with action plan submission. The programme was delivered in the same manner as would have been done in the real-world setting and, in theory, Girls Active has the potential to continue on in schools if implemented with sustainability and embedding in mind. The elements of the &#x0201c;off-the-shelf&#x0201d; programme which was originally developed without specific reference to theory were mapped to constructs in social cognitive theory post-hoc by the academic team (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Seven core components of Girls Active were identified: submission of the first self-review and action plans; attendance of lead teacher at initial training; use of package of resources or use of an alternative; engagement of young people as peer leaders; use of online, in person or phone support of hub and/or development coach; lead teacher attendance at peer review day; and submission of the second mission analysis.

Briefly, micro-costing methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was applied to calculate the costs of delivering the programme over a whole school year for the intervention arm schools. This provides a mean cost per school. Money and time spent on delivering Girls Active were self-reported by lead teachers using two types of bespoke cost diaries and a questionnaire and, if needed, these were followed up with a phone call for clarification. The cost-consequence analysis was conducted from a public sector, multi-agency perspective. Health related quality of life measured by the Child Health Utility-9D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was used as the measure of effect. Use of GP and school based services (school nurse and school counsellor) were used as the measure of costs. These were all self-reported by participants at each timepoint.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par43">The results are reported according to the CONSORT statement for cluster RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Primary and secondary outcome analyses were based on a complete case analysis. Intention to treat (ITT; all schools and recruited pupils were analysed in the group they were randomised to) and per protocol analyses were also undertaken for the primary outcome as sensitivity analyses. The per protocol population included schools that engaged with 70% of the seven core components (as detailed above) of the programme over the 14&#x000a0;months and had complete data for the analysis concerned on &#x02018;by analysis&#x02019; basis. In the control arm, the per protocol population included all schools/pupils randomised to that arm.</p><p id="Par44">Generalised estimating equations, accounting for school level clustering, and adjusting for baseline MVPA, stratification factors of school size (&#x0003c;&#x02009;850, &#x02265;&#x02009;850) and % of non-White pupils (&#x0003c;&#x02009;20%, &#x02265;&#x02009;20%), %FSME and participant year group, were employed. Subgroup analyses involved within subgroup stratification and between subgroup interactions effects between the intervention arm and pre-specified subgroups: baseline school (social deprivation and size) and pupil (ethnicity, maturation status, year group, PA level) characteristics. Sensitivity analyses explored the effect of the number of valid accelerometer days and the season of data collection. All analyses were performed using Stata (v.14.0), with statistical significance set as <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

In particular, how peer leaders identified and the groups established and run; the positive feelings lead teachers and pupils had about the programme; the challenges and opportunities to implementing a flexible programme within the current educational landscape and school-level constraints to implementation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par54">Girls Active was designed by the YST to be, and is being delivered as, a flexible programme for UK schools. This paper investigated the effectiveness of the programme in impacting MVPA of adolescent females. PA of this population is of significant public health interest. The complete case, intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses found no evidence of a sustained intervention effect on MVPA between intervention and control groups after 14&#x000a0;months (primary outcome). At the shorter follow-up of seven months, significant differences in MVPA were observed between groups in the complete case, intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, but the differences in change were small: 2.4, 2.3 and 3.1 mins/day, respectively. When observing MVPA changes in the per-protocol analysis it would seem that implementation of more of the seven core components (as presented in the methods) of Girls Active prevented the MVPA decline i.e. control schools declined by 6.2 mins/day while the intervention schools declined by 1.9 mins/day between baseline and seven months. Due to the flexible nature of the programme lead teachers spent a wide range of time and money on delivering and implementing Girls Active within their schools. The cost-consequence analysis showed no effect on health related quality of life or service use (typical measures utilised in health economic analysis).</p><p id="Par55">The pre-specified subgroups analysis found that the intervention was effective at 14&#x000a0;months in larger schools (+&#x02009;3.9 mins/day) but caused an MVPA decrease in smaller schools (-4.4 mins/day). This warrants consideration when designing programmes for roll-out at scale. Although the relative success in larger schools makes intuitive sense, findings from the process evaluation of this study will provide information of the perceived challenges and opportunities in intervention schools. Different strategies within a programme, not necessarily different programmes, may be needed for non-White European girls and late maturing girls based on the findings of the sub-group analysis at seven months.</p><p id="Par56">We saw some differences between groups at seven months for accelerometer variables in favour of the intervention group, but again these differences were relatively small. Little evidence of any changes in potential psychosocial mediators during the course of the programme were found. Process evaluation data will map out timelines of programme activity to help explain these findings.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Comparison with extant literature</title><p id="Par57">School-based PA interventions targeting adolescents have shown limited success on objective measures of PA, particularly for older adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Recent evidence from school-based trials with a primary outcome of objectively measured MVPA from the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] has emerged. Of these, two were aimed at adolescent girls in secondary schools, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and only one reported a significant effect on objective MVPA but in males only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Other studies are currently underway in UK secondary schools which capitalise on influential pupils, mentors, or in-class peer leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">The findings of this study add to evidence from well-designed, adequately powered trials on the lack of effectiveness of school-based PA programmes on objectively assessed PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. When there is a significant effect, it is &#x02018;small&#x02019; (a standardised mean difference&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.49) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] highlighting the challenges with intervening on adolescents&#x02019; PA within the school setting. Although small effects are seen multi-component programmes and those underpinned by theory may be more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Extensive support may be required to show significant but modest intervention effects (e.g. PA4E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]).</p><p id="Par59">This was an evaluation of a programme currently implemented in UK secondary schools so addressing the limitations to the Girls Active programme itself was beyond the scope of this study. Accompanying process evaluation and cost-effectiveness papers will underscore barriers to implementing school-based PA programmes and also demonstrate what resources were actually used to implement the programme, which will be highly valuable for future research and roll-out at scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par60">The strengths of this evaluation study include a fully powered cluster RCT design. The sample was multi-ethnic, incorporating diverse schools. A random sample of 90 girls/schools were included in the evaluation to ensure it was not the &#x0201c;most active&#x0201d; girls who would sign-up. The baseline PA levels would shows that meeting PA levels are low (2.3%) the IQR of MVPA of 29.9&#x02013;57.0 mins/day would suggest pupils with a wide variety of activity levels were included in this study. Overall, 25.9 to 78.2% of all KS3 girls/school (mean 37.2%) were included making our results generalisable to a whole school population in this age group. However, this may have also acted as a limitation in that over a 14&#x000a0;month period Girls Active is likely to only have had a modest reach, meaning our sample may have not been fully exposed to the intervention. A targeted evaluation sample may have yielded different results. Objective measurement of MVPA as the primary outcome was in line with public heath priorities and meets the need for &#x0201c;objective and comprehensive evaluation&#x0201d; methods for evaluating programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Although flexible programme such as Girls Active may benefit from more pragmatic study designs, from a research methods standpoint the RCT design was well received by partners, schools and pupils. Overall, 24% of the schools that were contacted entered the trial (20 out of 82) and schools and pupils were recruited to target. There was good compliance with the accelerometer, low levels of missingness from questionnaires, and participant loss to follow-up was in line with other studies. A full economic analysis was also completed for the Girls Active trial. Based on best-practice, the methods used with schools were designed for this study and the methods used and results found add to the literature on the costs of delivering programmes in the school setting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par61">At 14 months, our primary measure of effectiveness was change in MVPA at 14 months. No difference in change in MVPA between Girls Active control and intervention schools was found. At seven months there was less of a decline in MVPA in the intervention schools compared to the control schools. Differences in sub-groups may mean the programme has potential in certain types of schools or pupils. Process evaluation and complete and detailed economic analysis papers will give context and detail of the delivery of such a flexible programme.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APHV</term><def><p id="Par6">Age at peak height velocity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BME</term><def><p id="Par7">Black and minority ethnicity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par8">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par9">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSME</term><def><p id="Par10">Free school meal eligibility</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p id="Par11">Intra-class correlation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMD</term><def><p id="Par12">Index of multiple deprivation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par13">Intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KS3</term><def><p id="Par14">Key Stage three</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLR </term><def><p id="Par15">Leicester City, Leicestershire and Rutland</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p id="Par16">Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p id="Par17">Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PE</term><def><p id="Par18">Physical education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par19">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par20">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p id="Par21">Socioeconomic status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p id="Par22">United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YST</term><def><p id="Par23">Youth Sport Trust</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank all the pupils and lead teachers who took part in the Girls Active evaluation study.
