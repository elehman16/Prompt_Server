This retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed registry evaluated treatments/outcomes in node-positive breast cancer patients who were Recurrence Score-tested through Clalit Health Services from 1/2006 through 12/2011 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;709). Medical records were reviewed to verify treatments/recurrences/survival. Median follow-up, 5.9 years; median age, 62 years; 53.9% grade 2; 69.8% tumors&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;2&#x02009;cm; 84.5% invasive ductal carcinoma; 42.0% N1mi, and 37.2%/15.5%/5.2% with 1/2/3 positive nodes; 53.4% Recurrence Score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18, 36.4% Recurrence Score 18&#x02013;30, and 10.2% Recurrence Score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;31. Overall, 26.9% received adjuvant chemotherapy: 7.1%, 39.5%, and 86.1% in the Recurrence Score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18, 18&#x02013;30, and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;31 group, respectively. The 5-year Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates for distant recurrence were 3.2%, 6.3%, and 16.9% for these respective groups and the corresponding 5-year breast cancer death estimates were 0.5%, 3.4%, and 5.7%. In Recurrence Score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18 patients, 5-year distant-recurrence rates for N1mi/1 positive node/2&#x02013;3 positive nodes were 1.2%/4.4%/5.4%. As patients were not randomized to treatment and treatment decision is heavily influenced by Recurrence Score, analysis of 5-year distant recurrence by chemotherapy use was exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously: In Recurrence Score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18, recurrence rate was 7.7% in chemotherapy-treated (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) and 2.9% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;352); <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.245. In Recurrence Score 18&#x02013;30, recurrence rate in chemotherapy-treated patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;102) was significantly lower than in untreated patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;156) (1.0% vs. 9.7% <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019); in Recurrence Score&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;25 (the RxPONDER study cutoff), recurrence rate was 2.3% in chemotherapy-treated (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;89) and 4.4% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;488); <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.521. In conclusion, our findings support using endocrine therapy alone in ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer patients with micrometastases/1&#x02013;3 positive nodes and Recurrence Score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Genetic testing: Gene panel guides treatment for node-positive patients</title><p id="Par2">Women with breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes do well on anti-hormone treatment alone if they score under 18 on OncotypeDX. Salomon Stemmer from Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikvah, Israel, and colleagues conducted the first analysis of a large prospectively designed registry in which patients with breast cancer cells in the underarm lymph nodes have taken the 21-gene expression analysis known as OncotypeDX to guide their treatment. Among the 709 women with node-positive, ER-positive, HER-negative disease, patients with test scores under 18 did just as well if they received chemotherapy or not in addition to anti-hormone treatment, whereas those with scores of 18 to 30 had significantly lower recurrence rates if they received both therapies. The findings suggest that only women with OncotypeDX scores under 18 can safely forgo chemotherapy.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The 21-gene Recurrence Score&#x000ae;(RS) assay (Oncotype DX&#x000ae; Breast Recurrence Score assay, Genomic Health Inc), is incorporated in major international guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and is widely used to guide treatment decisions in estrogen receptor (ER)+ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative node-negative breast cancer. The prognostic/predictive abilities of the RS assay in this population were first validated using a prospective&#x02013;retrospective study design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> More recently, the RS was further validated as a prognostic indicator in the TAILORx and West German Study Group (WSG) PlanB phase 3 trials in which patients were treated based on their RS results, and in the prospectively designed analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, which was complemented with the RS results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, we previously reported findings from an analysis of a prospectively designed registry including 2028 N0/N1mi ER+ breast cancer patients who were tested through Clalit Health Services (CHS, the largest health maintenance organization in Israel),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> which complemented the TAILORx, WSG PlanB, and SEER studies by providing both rate of recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality in a cohort of patients where decision making incorporated the RS in real-life clinical practice.</p><p id="Par4">Withholding chemotherapy in ER+ HER2-negative node-positive breast cancer patients remains controversial even in the presence of data from such studies as the ATAC, ABCSG 6, and ABCSG 8 trials, which have demonstrated that many patients with 1&#x02013;3 positive nodes do well on endocrine therapy alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> To further help identify patients who can safely forgo chemotherapy, RS testing is increasingly used in patients with up to three positive axillary lymph nodes. Similar to the approach used for the node-negative population, the initial validation of the prognostic/predictive abilities of the RS assay in the node-positive population employed a prospective&#x02013;retrospective study design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> However, unlike the node-negative population, at present, the additional evidence supporting RS testing in the node-positive population is limited to the aforementioned WSG PlanB study in which all patients with RS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;11 received chemotherapy, and to a secondary analysis of the SEER registry in which only breast cancer-specific mortality has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Prospective evidence from the phase 3 RxPONDER (SWOG S1007) trial evaluating endocrine therapy alone vs. chemoendocrine therapy in patients with 1&#x02013;3 positive nodes and RS&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;25 is anticipated in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par5">In Israel, CHS approved reimbursement of the RS assay for node-negative patients in 1/2006 and extended its coverage to include node-positive patients in 1/2008. Since its initial reimbursement approval by CHS and through November 2016, 5483 node-negative, and 1850 patients with N1mi/1&#x02013;3 positive nodes have been tested through CHS. The focus of the current CHS registry analysis is on the latter population. This analysis was designed to evaluate, in real-life clinical practice, the relationship between the RS results, adjuvant treatments received, and clinical outcomes in patients with N1mi or 1&#x02013;3 positive nodes who were RS-tested more than 5 years ago and had their RS results incorporated into clinical decision making. Notably, this study complements another study focusing on node-negative patients who were RS-tested through CHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>

Analysis was also performed on clinicopathological subgroups, as well as within the intermediate RS group (18&#x02013;25, 26&#x02013;30), using a cutoff of 25 as in the RxPONDER trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> As exploratory analysis, 5-year KM distant recurrence estimates and 95% CI by chemotherapy use within RS risk categories as defined by Paik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and within the intermediate group (18&#x02013;25, 26&#x02013;30) were examined. A 2-degrees of freedom log-rank test was used to compare distant recurrence rates across RS groups. Survival curves are presented through 7-years, though all observed events and follow-up are utilized for statistical tests. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association of RS group (&#x0003c;18, 18&#x02013;30, &#x02265;31), age (50&#x02013;69 vs. &#x0003c;50; &#x02265;70 vs. &#x0003c;50 years), size (&#x0003c;2, &#x02265;2&#x02009;cm), grade (1&#x02013;3), and nodal status (N1mi vs. 1&#x02013;3 positive nodes) with distant recurrence. RS and tumor size were also included as continuous variables. Univariate analysis identified a set of prognostic baseline factors, and a full multivariable model was fit. Non-significant covariates were removed from the multivariate analysis. Proportional hazards assumptions were assessed and met in the final model. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for the analysis. <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par25">All relevant data are available upon request from the corresponding author.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
