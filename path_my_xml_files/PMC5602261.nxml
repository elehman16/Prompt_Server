Tracheal extubation is always associated with hemodynamic changes because of sympathetic discharge due to epipharyngeal and laryngeal stimulation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This increase in sympathetic activity may result in hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The increase in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) is transitory, variable but unpredictable and is more hazardous to the patient with preexisting hypertension, myocardial insufficiency, or cerebrovascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hypertension can result in increase of brain edema or intracranial hematoma formation which may give rise to herniation. The occurrence of hypertension during emergence has been reported to be more than 90% in neurosurgical patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Thus, to prevent and control the hemodynamic response to nociceptive stimuli is of utmost importance to preserve cerebral homeostasis in these patients. Airway irritation appearing during tracheal extubation may cause cough or difficulties in breathing. Smooth extubation requires the absence of straining, movement, coughing, breath holding, or laryngospasm.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Various techniques and antihypertensive drugs are available to reduce airway and circulatory responses during extubation, but none have been completely successful.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Attempts have been made to oppose the hemodynamic response by the use of drugs such as narcotic analgesics,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] deepen the plane of anesthesia by inhalation agents,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] vasodilator agents,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] local anesthetics[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and adrenoceptor blockers. Studies have been carried out with the use of lignocaine,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] esmolol,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] nicardipine,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] labetalol,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] diltiazem,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] opioids,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] clonidine[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as single dose, or in comparison with each other. Among the anesthetics, propofol has been shown to be very effective in attenuating the sympathetic response to tracheal extubation in cardiac patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a potent, highly selective alpha-2 receptor agonist that has sedative, analgesic, anxiolytic, and amnesic effects without causing significant respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It also has a sympatholytic effect, similar to clonidine, causing decrease in the concentration of norepinephrine. This in turn decreases the BP and the HR. It may thus be theoretically appropriate for reducing airway and circulatory reflexes during emergence from anesthesia. It has also been studied as been given as single bolus dose to attenuate airway, circulatory reflexes, and recovery responses during tracheal extubation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] According to the mathematical model of drug pharmacokinetics, infusion of a drug at a constant rate produces a steady-state drug concentration which is more uniform than the bolus administration of the same drug. Thus, we hypothesize that the infusion of dexmedetomidine may produce more stable hemodynamics during tracheal extubation as compared to boluses.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Primary objectives</title><p>

The patients who required postoperative mechanical ventilation, those with difficult airway or having second- or third-degree atrioventricular blocks and pregnant/nursing woman or morbidly obese patients were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Information pertinent to the preoperative history, physical examination, investigations was recorded. Demographic data (age, sex, weight, ASA status, and diagnosis) were noted. After the standard fasting protocol, these patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscular, before shifting them to the operation theater. Monitoring in the operation theater included an electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, systolic, and diastolic arterial BP.</p><p>General anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg followed by propofol 1.5&#x02013;2 mg/kg and rocuronium 1 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. All patients were mechanically ventilated at a fresh gas flow of 2 L/min to maintain an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> of 32 &#x000b1; 2 mm Hg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide and 40% oxygen mixture targeting a minimum alveolar concentration value of 0.8&#x02013;1.2. Vecuronium in a dose of 0.02 mg/kg was given every 30&#x02013;40 min for muscle relaxation. Arterial pressure was monitored using a 20 G cannula placed in the left or right radial artery. The values for HR, systolic, diastolic, and mean BP obtained just before the administration of study drug was considered baseline. Both groups received fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and for an increase in HR or systolic BP 20% above the preincisional value sustained for 1 min. HR &#x0003c;50 beats/min sustained for 1 min was defined as bradycardia and atropine 0.6 mg was given to treat it. Systolic arterial pressure &#x0003c;20% from baseline sustained for 1 min was defined as hypotension which was treated with fluid bolus or mephentermine 6 mg. A computer-generated randomization chart was used, and patients were allocated to different groups using a sealed opaque envelope method. The three study groups were, Group D<sub>0.2</sub> &#x02013; dexmedetomidine 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusion diluted to 50 ml, Group D<sub>0.4</sub> &#x02013; dexmedetomidine 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusion diluted to 50 ml, and Group P (Placebo) &#x02013; 0.9% normal saline 50 ml.</p><p>All patients in the intervention groups D<sub>0.2</sub> and D<sub>0.4</sub> received a loading dose of dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg diluted to 10 ml before the start of infusion over a period of 10 min, at the beginning of dural closure. The patients in Group P received an equivalent volume of saline both as loading and infusion doses. These infusions continued up till tracheal extubation. Study drug infusions were prepared by varying the drug dilution of dexmedetomidine in the 50 ml syringe according to the patient's body weight by an anesthesiologist who was a part of the study but not involved in the anesthetic management or assessment of the patient. All the infusions ran at a standard rate of 4 ml/h. Thus, the attending anesthesiologist was blinded to the study drug concentration and the actual rate of infusion according to body weight of the patient. The hemodynamics including the HR and MAP were recorded just before the loading dose of the study drug and then were recorded every 5 min till the infusion was stopped at tracheal extubation. At the last skin suture, inhalation anesthetic was discontinued. On return of spontaneous efforts, nitrous oxide was discontinued, and neuromuscular block reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. The maximum rise of HR and MAP was noted during tracheal extubation. Hemodynamic variables were noted every minute for 10 min posttracheal extubation. Emergence and extubation times were noted which were defined as emergence time &#x02013; time interval between discontinuing of anesthetic and patient following verbal commands and Extubation time &#x02013; time interval between cessation of anesthetics and tracheal extubation. Delayed emergence was defined as emergence time more than 15 min after discontinuing anesthetics and reversal of neuromuscular blockade.</p><p>A decrease of SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264;92% was defined as desaturation and holding breath for 20 s or more as breath-holding any episode of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, or desaturation was recorded. Any other immediate postoperative complications which include bradycardia, hypotension, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and restlessness were noted. Modified Aldrete Score was recorded for recovery in postanesthesia care unit and grading of cough[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was noted as a measure for recovery response. Postoperative sedation was assessed using Ramsay sedation scale. A structured Brice interview[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for detecting awareness under anesthesia was recorded from these patients 24 h postsurgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A total of 90 patients (30 in each group) were calculated at 80% power and Type-1 error of 0.05 using hemodynamics (HR and MAP) as primary outcome measure from a previous study done by Turan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] on dexmedetomidine used in intracranial surgeries.</p><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using STATA 11.2, (StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA).

Modified Aldrete score and Ramsay sedation scale were also comparable in the three groups suggesting that dexmedetomidine could be safely used in neurosurgical patients without affecting the sensorium.</p><p>In neurosurgical patients, the use of agents that relax vascular smooth muscle to control the increase in arterial pressure at extubation should be avoided, as the resultant cerebral vasodilatation may increase cerebral blood volume and thus intracranial pressure. Various drugs which are alpha and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists have been advocated in such patients. Dexmedetomidine is a highly specific and selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist with sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic effects.</p><p>Turan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] examined the effects of dexmedetomidine given at the end of procedure to prevent hyperdynamic responses during extubation and to allow a comfortable and high-quality recovery. Forty ASA I&#x02013;III patients having elective intracranial surgery were included in the study. They found that dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg administered 5 min before the end of surgery stabilized hemodynamics, allowed easy extubation, provided a more comfortable recovery, and early neurological examination following intracranial operations. Our findings are in accordance to the study by Turan <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Lawrence and De Lange[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] investigated the effect of a single preinduction intravenous dose of dexmedetomidine 2 &#x003bc;g/kg on anesthetic requirements and perioperative hemodynamic stability in 50 patients undergoing minor orthopedic and general surgery. Patients were anesthetized with nitrous oxide/oxygen/fentanyl, supplemented if necessary with isoflurane. The mean intraoperative isoflurane concentration was lower in the dexmedetomidine-treated patients than controls (0.01 [0.03]% compared to 0.1 [0.1]%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) although six of the 25 treated patients required isoflurane at some stage. The hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and extubation was reduced in the dexmedetomidine group which was comparable to our study as was intraoperative HR variability; postoperative analgesic and antiemetic requirements, and perioperative serum catecholamine concentrations were lower in the dexmedetomidine group.</p><p>Guler <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] studied the effect of a single bolus dose of dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg as bolus intravenously over 60 s in comparison to a placebo in 60 ASA I&#x02013;III patients undergoing intraocular surgery. Five minutes before the end of surgery, they were randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg or saline intravenously over 60 s in a double-blind design. The blinded anesthetist awoke all the patients, and the number of coughs per patient was continuously monitored for 15 min after extubation; coughing was evaluated on a 4-point scale. Median coughing scores were 1 (1&#x02013;3) in dexmedetomidine group and 2 (1&#x02013;4) in placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but there were no differences between the groups in the incidence of breath holding or desaturation. The HR, systolic, and diastolic arterial pressures increased at extubation in both groups, but the increase was less significant with dexmedetomidine. The time from tracheal extubation and emergence from anesthesia were similar in both groups. Their findings suggested that a single bolus dose of dexmedetomidine before tracheal extubation attenuated cough and hemodynamic responses during extubation which was comparable to our study.</p><p>In 54 patients undergoing surgery for supratentorial brain tumors, Tanskanen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] demonstrated that the decrease in the hypertensive response to extubation was related to dexmedetomidine dose. Dexmedetomidine plasma target doses of 0.2 and 0.4 ng/ml were compared to placebo. Dexmedetomidine decreased the hemodynamic responses caused by stimuli during anesthesia; a higher dose was more effective than a lower dose which was in accordance with our study findings. In addition, the perioperative systemic infusion of dexmedetomidine at 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h reduced patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) bolus consumption, prolonged the time for first request of rescue analgesia through the PCEA pump, and postoperative pain scores without severe side effects.</p><p>Our study also revealed that postextubation cough is effectively suppressed by both the infusion doses (0.2 and 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) of dexmedetomidine which was significantly lower than the control group. This may be due to the sedative action of dexmedetomidine and also because it relaxes the bronchial smooth muscle and prevents airway irritation. It may be advantageous as it decreases the postoperative hoarseness and irritation due to tracheal tube. Further studies may be required to assess these airway-related complications and their relation to get suppressed effectively by varying the doses of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Another important concern which our study highlighted was emergence as it is of utmost importance to conduct a neurological examination as early as possible postemergence. Our study revealed that dexmedetomidine infusion in a dose of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h did not delay emergence as compared to the placebo group though it did alleviate the stress and airway responses by effectively suppressing the cough and hemodynamic pertubations. However, as the infusion dose, was increased to 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h; there was a delay in the emergence which was statistically, but not clinically significant. Further dose response studies may be required to determine the optimal infusion dose of dexmedetomidine in neurosurgical patients.</p><p>Shukry <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] studied effects of infusions of dexmedetomidine (0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) during surgery on the incidence of emergence delirium in 50 children aged 1&#x02013;10 years scheduled for sevoflurane-based general anesthesia. Following inhalation induction, the children were randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine or placebo groups, respectively. The infusion of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h dexmedetomidine or equal volume of saline was started after securing the airway. The authors found that the incidence of emergence agitation decreased from 61% to 26%. In this study, the time to extubation and eye-opening were not different with dexmedetomidine versus placebo which was similar to our study.</p><p>Many studies have shown that dexmedetomidine, such as all other alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists, has very little effect on ventilation, and there is no difference in respiratory function in patients who received dexmedetomidine compared to ones who received placebo following extubation.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Our study also did not reveal respiratory complications or any difference in ventilation and respiratory function in the three study groups following extubation.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>The only limitation of our study was that the patient population was not uniform as to various neurological ailments. The patients who underwent epilepsy surgery were also included in the study population who were on multiple antiepileptic drugs. These antiepileptic drugs are known to cause sedation and prolong the emergence time which could have altered the results of our study. However, in our study, none of the patients who underwent epilepsy surgery had a delayed emergence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Our study in 90 patients undergoing craniotomy for various neurosurgical indications, demonstrates that dexmedetomidine infusion in doses of 0.2 and 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, effectively suppresses cough and attenuates hemodynamic responses to tracheal extubation without delaying emergence when compared to placebo.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nishina</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Mikawa</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Maekawa</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Obara</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Attenuation of cardiovascular responses to tracheal extubation with diltiazem</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1995</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>1217</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7762855</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fujii</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Saitoh</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Toyooka</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Combined diltiazem and lidocaine reduces cardiovascular responses to tracheal extubation and anesthesia emergence in hypertensive patients</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>1999</year><volume>46</volume><fpage>952</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10522582</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mikawa</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nishina</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Maekawa</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Obara</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Attenuation of cardiovascular responses to tracheal extubation: Verapamil versus diltiazem</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1996</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>1205</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8638792</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Warner</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Sokoll</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Maktabi</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hindman</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Scamman</surname><given-names>FL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A prospective, comparative trial of three anesthetics for elective supratentorial craniotomy.
