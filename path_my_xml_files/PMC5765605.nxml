This pilot study aimed to assess the effects of a 12-week school-based peer-led brisk walking programme on levels of school-time PA post intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Female participants, aged 11&#x02013;13 years, were recruited from six post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. Participants were randomized by school (cluster) to participate in regular 10&#x02013;15-min peer-led brisk walks throughout the school week (the WISH study) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;101, two schools) or to continue with their usual PA (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;98, four schools). The primary outcome measure was school-time PA post intervention (week 12), assessed objectively using an Actigraph accelerometer. Secondary outcome measures included anthropometry, cardiorespiratory fitness and psychosocial measures. Changes in PA data between baseline (T0) and end of intervention (week 12) (T1) were analysed using a mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance with one between (group) and one within (time) subjects factor, with two levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Of 199 participants recruited (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6&#x000a0;years, 27% overweight/obese), 187 had valid accelerometer data for inclusion in subsequent analysis. A significant interaction effect was observed for changes in light intensity PA across the school day (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003), with those in the intervention increasing their light intensity PA by 8.27 mins/day compared with a decrease of 2.14 mins/day in the control group. No significant interactions were observed for the other PA measures across the intervention. Intervention effects on school-time PA were not sustained four months post intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The intervention increased daily light intensity PA behaviour in these adolescent girls but did not change moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). These findings suggest that a school-based brisk walking intervention may be feasible and can change PA behaviour in the short term, but it is possible that the self-selected walking speeds determined by a peer-leader may not be sufficient to reach MVPA in this age group. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential of school-based brisk walking to contribute to MVPA in adolescent girls.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02871830">NCT02871830</ext-link>.

Within the UK, approximately half of children aged seven years are failing to meet the current physical activity (PA) guidelines of at least 60&#x000a0;min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Children from Northern Ireland were the least likely to meet the recommendations, with 43.4% of children achieving 60&#x000a0;min per day of MVPA compared with the UK average of 51% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The problem of physical inactivity appears more prevalent among girls, who consistently spend less time engaged in MVPA compared to boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, girls also tend to participate in fewer sports compared with boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Given the health benefits of regular participation in PA on young people&#x02019;s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the promotion of PA behaviours during youth is suggested as an important method for halting the decline in PA that occurs in the transition to adulthood. Participation in PA during adolescence can be an important contributor to levels of PA in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with evidence highlighting that PA behaviours track reasonably well from childhood to adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adolescence represents a period of transition, with the move from primary to secondary education shown to influence young people&#x02019;s PA behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A number of studies have identified barriers to PA participation in this age group, with commonly cited factors including lack of time due to academic commitments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and a desire to spend free time engaged in activities that are not physically active, for example, socialising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Other commonly cited barriers include off-putting uniforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and cost and access to resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is a strong need to develop interventions that address these barriers and provide opportunities for this group to be active with friends in an environment that is fun and informal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The provision of extra-curricular PA within the school environment often reflects the content of the physical education (PE) curriculum, i.e. team-based, structured sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Provision of PA within schools which promotes activities likely to be sustained into adulthood may be more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with evidence suggesting that both the type of PA individuals engage in during adolescence and the duration of participation can have an influence on PA behaviours in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Given the relatively small contribution such team-based, structured sports make to PA in adulthood as compared with walking and other activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it is important that other forms of PA are promoted among children and adolescents.</p><p id="Par15">Walking is the most natural form of PA, requiring no specialist skills to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and can provide a practical, inexpensive option for children and adolescents to meet current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Brisk walking, accumulated in short bouts can contribute to the MVPA guidelines in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To date, research on walking to increase PA in children and adolescents is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Findings from studies evaluating the impact of active commuting on PA have been inconsistent; a walking school bus intervention produced significant differences in MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], while other interventions demonstrated little or no effect of active commuting on overall PA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Although the contribution of walking to and from school on total PA should not be overlooked, given that this is unlikely to result in 60&#x000a0;min of MVPA, it is important to consider other ways to increase PA across the school day. A 15-week school-based accumulated brisk walking intervention in children (aged 5&#x02013;11 years) resulted in increased objectively measured mean daily PA levels during school hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of school-based walking interventions to increase PA among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, there is limited objective evidence on the effectiveness of PA interventions delivered during school recess (break and lunchtime), particularly in adolescent populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The majority of recess-based interventions involved in the use of playground markings and equipment to promote PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which may not be as suitable in the post-primary school environment.</p><p id="Par17">Social support, including logistical support, encouragement and role modelling have all been positively associated with levels of PA participation in young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Peer modelling, through the use of fictional characters, has been shown to change dietary habits in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and, more recently, PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, despite the level of evidence highlighting the relationship between PA and social support and modelling, there is limited evidence on the use of real-life peer modelling to promote PA in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of peer-led brisk Walking In ScHools intervention (the WISH study) and to investigate the impact of participating in a 12-week school-based walking programme on school-time PA and sedentary behaviour post-intervention (week 12) and at follow-up (six months). The secondary aim was to examine the effects of the intervention on a range of health-related outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par19">WISH was a pilot study of a school-based clustered randomised controlled trial (RCT). Following completion of baseline measurements, participants were randomly allocated by school, using a computer-based random number generator to either receive the intervention or to act as controls. Each school was given an anonymous code and randomly allocated to one of two study arms until all six schools had been assigned a study arm. The procedure was performed by a researcher at the University, independent of the project. The study arms relating to each randomly allocated number were written down by the individual before randomisation and concealed in an envelope until all enrolled participants completed all baseline assessments and it was time to allocate the intervention. The individual responsible for randomisation then notified the research team. Given the nature of the intervention, blinding of schools and participants was not possible following randomisation. The researcher responsible for subsequent data collection and analysis was not blinded to group allocation. There were no variations to the methods after the trial had commenced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility and recruitment</title><p id="Par20">A convenience sample of schools in Northern Ireland were invited to take part in the study. Following permission from school principals, invitational letters were sent to parents/ guardians of all female pupils aged 11&#x02013;13 years attending six post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. Pupils were eligible to participate if they were free from any medical condition that would limit their participation in a brisk walking intervention.</p><p id="Par21">Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Ulster Research Ethics Committee (REC/11/0236). Written informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians and written assent was obtained from adolescents before randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par22">The WISH study was delivered over a 12-week period (March to June 2014) to participants attending schools randomly allocated to receive the intervention. Participants were provided with the opportunity to attend a number of structured 10&#x02013;15-min walks spread across the school week before the first bell, at mid-morning break and at lunch time. These walks were led by older pupils (aged 15&#x02013;17 years) trained as walk leaders. Walk leader training ensured that the leaders considered all possible safety concerns and emphasised the importance of the walks being performed at a brisk pace, i.e. at a pace sufficient to elicit moderate intensity PA in participants. To ensure that the walks were performed at a moderate intensity, walk leaders were taught to recognise the physiological indicators of moderate intensity, for example, feeling warmer, noting an increase in heart rate, breathing harder, yet still able to carry on a conversation. The content of the walk leader training was informed by a PA co-ordinator from a local Health and Social Care Trust. The training was facilitated by a member of the research team and delivered to walk leaders at a lunchtime session. All walk leaders were provided with a copy of the training manual.</p><p id="Par23">Risk assessments were performed by a member of the research team alongside a member of school staff for each predetermined walking route. Two walk leaders facilitated each walk; one walking at the front of the group and one at the back to maintain the pace. Walk leaders were supported in their role through an online private social media group moderated by the researcher, where they were provided with advice and tips on facilitating the intervention.</p><p id="Par24">The intervention content was developed using social cognitive theory (SCT) and exposed participants to a number of influences on self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], e.g. observing peer leaders and other participants taking part in the walking sessions exposed participants to vicarious experiences. Participants were provided with timetables of the planned group walks, detailing the start time and meeting location for each walk, and given weekly verbal reminders to attend the walking sessions from school staff and walk leaders. Participants were also provided with prompt cards from the research team containing general tips and advice in relation to brisk walking and information on setting goals. Schools were instructed to provide at least two walking sessions for participants to attend each day. Participants were initially instructed to attend at least three walking sessions per week (of 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min in duration) and to increase the number of sessions that they attended to at least five walking sessions per week by week 12 of the intervention.</p><p id="Par25">To ensure intervention fidelity, the researcher visited each intervention school on a fortnightly basis to monitor the duration and intensity of the peer-led walks and to ensure that the intervention was standardised across intervention schools. To encourage adherence to the intervention, each participant was provided with a &#x02018;reward card&#x02019;, which was stamped by a walk leader each time they completed a walk. Participants were able to accumulate stamps for each completed walk and once reward cards were completed (indicating attendance at six walking sessions), participants were entered into a draw to win small tokens, e.g. cinema vouchers, water bottles and stationery. Walk leaders were also required to keep a log of participants attending each walk. School staff assisted the walk leaders by monitoring attendance logs and ensuring the study protocol was adhered to.</p><p id="Par26">During the intervention period, participants in the control group were instructed to continue with their normal PA habits. Following completion of the intervention, all control schools were provided with study resources to implement their own school-based brisk walking program. All study participants were provided with a certificate to acknowledge their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participant assessments</title><p id="Par27">Measurement periods were standardised across all schools and were completed at three time points. All measurements were conducted within the classroom setting at each participating school. Recruitment and baseline measurements were undertaken between January and March 2014 (T0). The first follow-up measurements were taken during week 12 of the intervention (T1) and the second follow-up (T2) was conducted after six months, during the first term of the following school year (September &#x02013; October 2014).</p><p id="Par28">The primary outcome measure was school-time PA, assessed objectively using the Actigraph GT3 accelerometer (Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA). Participants were instructed to wear the device during all waking hours for seven consecutive days (including weekends), removing it only for bathing, taking part in water-based activities, such as swimming, and when asleep. To encourage compliance to the accelerometer protocol, participants were provided with reminder sheets to place in a prominent area within the home and a diary to log wear time and record periods of non-wear. Distribution and collection of monitors was during face-to-face meetings between the researcher and participants in the school.</p><p id="Par29">A sampling epoch of 15&#x000a0;s was employed during data collection. All data were downloaded and analysed using Actigraph software V.6.5.4 (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL, USA).

The Evenson Actigraph cut-points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] were used to estimate time spent in sedentary behaviour and light, moderate and vigorous intensity PA.</p><p id="Par30">A school-time filter was applied during data analysis to assess the impact of the intervention on school-time PA. The filter was applied to capture any PA during 08:30&#x02013;16:00 on weekdays that participants were due to attend school (this wear time filter was based on an average timetabled school day). PA data were analysed for mean time spent in sedentary behaviour and light, moderate and vigorous intensity PA, and for total daily PA.</p><p id="Par31">Height (cm) and weight (kg) were measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm and 0.1&#x000a0;kg, respectively, using a freestanding stadiometer (Leicester Height Measure), and digital scales (Seca 877). Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), with cut-points used to define weight category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Waist circumference (cm) was measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm, using an anatomical measuring tape.</p><p id="Par32">Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using the Queens College Step Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Participants wore a heart rate monitor (Polar series, Polar Electro Inc, Kempele, Finland) during the step test, with heart rate recorded at baseline, and at 10&#x000a0;s, 15&#x000a0;s and 20&#x000a0;s following completion of the step test.

The WISH study increased light intensity PA across the school day (08:30&#x02013;16:00) with moderate effect size observed, highlighting the effectiveness of a 12-week school-based brisk walking intervention in eliciting changes in PA in this population. Light intensity PA increased by 8.3&#x000a0;min/day across the school day for the intervention group, compared with a decrease of 2.1&#x000a0;min/day within the control group. Based on these findings, a school-based walking programme may have the potential to increase light intensity PA by 45&#x000a0;min across the school week and subsequently reduce time spent in sedentary behaviours.</p><p id="Par44">The increases observed in PA across the school day resulted from an increase in daily light intensity PA among intervention participants compared with controls.

Given that light intensity PA can contribute up to 30&#x02013;40% of total daily PA, and that the activities that contribute to light intensity PA are likely to be more habitual in nature and less structured than moderate to vigorous activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], interventions that increase light intensity PA during the school day may be promising in efforts to halt the age-related decline in PA, particularly among adolescent girls who are at higher risk of being physically inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, participation in light intensity PA may have beneficial associations with a number of cardio-metabolic biomarkers in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The present intervention failed to increase levels of moderate intensity PA, with slight decreases observed in moderate and vigorous intensity PA at 12-week and six-month follow-up. Within the present study, the walk leaders were responsible for ensuring the walks were performed at a brisk pace, i.e. to elicit moderate intensity PA from participants. The findings from the present study suggest that the self-selected walking speeds of these peer leaders may not have been of sufficient pace to help adolescent girls achieve moderate intensity PA. Previous interventions provided heart rate monitors to participants to ensure walks were at least moderate intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To ensure future interventions engage adolescents in levels of MVPA, heart rate monitoring or pedometers could be used to enable a real-time checking of exercise intensity. Previous walking studies targeted at adolescents have either failed to report outcomes in relation to walking intensity or have shown no changes in MVPA&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]; however, MVPA was measured using a self-report instrument within this study, making comparisons with the objective measures used within the present study difficult. Furthermore, the limitations involved in asking children to accurately recall exercise intensity should be noted, given their reduced ability to recall time and intensity compared with adults&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. School-based walking interventions have been previously shown to increase objectively measured levels of MVPA in children, through the implementation of walking school buses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], highlighting that walking can be an effective means of increasing MVPA in youth. Increasing levels of MVPA in youth is of particular importance given the associated substantive health benefits produced by activity performed at moderate intensity&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">The changes in light PA observed at 12&#x000a0;weeks were not maintained among intervention participants at four-month follow-up, highlighting that exposure to a 12-week walking programme was not sufficient to elicit longer-term behaviour change in this population. Although the WISH study provided adolescent girls with an activity that overcomes many of the issues associated with participating in competitive, team-based or vigorous activity in front of peers, increases in walking behaviour were not maintained once the intervention period ended. This may be attributable to a number of factors, e.g. the absence of walk leaders and/or structured walking sessions to attend post intervention. A lack of evidence on the longer-term effectiveness of PA interventions has been cited as a limitation of studies to date in children and adolescents&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A school-based structured walking intervention targeted at primary school children observed similar findings to the present study, within increases observed in mean daily PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] across the school day. The study did not include a longer-term follow-up; thus, it is unclear whether these increases were sustained. Given the differences that exist between primary and secondary education, for example, in relation to teaching provision and flexibility of the school day, it is difficult to draw comparison between walking interventions in children to the outcomes observed within the present study. To date, the follow-up times for other walking interventions targeted at adolescents have been in the range of 5&#x02013;12 weeks (end of intervention measurements) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and not included longer-term follow-up. Consequently, there is a paucity of evidence on the longer-term effectiveness of walking interventions to increase PA in adolescents.</p><p id="Par48">Unlike previous studies which have targeted walking behaviours on the commute to and from school, the WISH study aimed to provide extra opportunities for adolescent girls to be active at break and lunchtime. The limited number of intervention studies considering the impact of recess-based interventions makes it difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of this approach compared with others, with no other structured walking interventions evidenced in adolescent girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Few studies to date have targeted PA during school recess and have mostly focused on the use of playground markings and games equipment to promote PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Given the lack of studies targeted at adolescents, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the suitability of such recess-based interventions on PA within this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The present study highlights the feasibility of incorporating peer-led walks within the provision of a school&#x02019;s extra-curricular PA. Peers can play a key role in influencing PA in children and youth, with evidence suggesting that young people model their PA behaviour on what other peers and friends are doing&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Developing peer support strategies, for example, encouraging strong friendships and having peers facilitate physical activities, may improve the outcomes of PA interventions targeted at inactive groups, e.g. adolescent girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Within the present study, older pupils volunteered to act as peer leaders and in turn, provided younger pupils with potential role models to encourage them to participate in increased PA. Peers have previously been identified as key role models among adolescent girls&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and it is important that role models are incorporated within interventions targeted at this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The peer-led aspect of the present study targeted at an adolescent population is novel; evidence to date has shown the use of fictional peer modelling to be effective in change intake of fruit and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and more recently PA behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in children. There is limited evidence on the use of peers to facilitate PA and how social groups within school can influence PA, owing in part to the focus on children&#x02019;s studies within the literature, which tend to focus on interventions supervised and managed by teachers&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Within the WISH pilot study, increases in the mean score for social support from friends, but not from male or female parents/guardians, were observed for intervention participants, highlighting that the role of friends and other classmates may have been integral to participants&#x02019; engagement with the walking intervention. Previous research examining social support for PA in youth found that support from friends was the only source of support for lunchtime PA and was consistent across age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Parents and friends have both been previously cited as key influences on current PA participation by adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with parental support correlated with PA in children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Parental encouragement has been previously significantly associated with lunchtime PA for junior school students only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] but not for older pupils (aged 16&#x02013;18 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], suggesting that the influence of parents decreases as pupils move through adolescence and place more emphasis on the influence of peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Further research is needed to explore the role components of social support play in promoting PA behaviours among adolescent females&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and future interventions should incorporate exposure to the multiple sources of social support within their design&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">In the present study, participants in the intervention group wore the accelerometer for fewer days and fewer minutes per day than control participants. A number of approaches were employed to encourage adherence to wearing the accelerometer, for example, reminder phone calls, reminder leaflets to be placed in a prominent area of the home and provision of a diary for participants to log when they wore and removed the device&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. While studies have reported that wearing accelerometers may be acceptable to most young people&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], a number have identified issues that may explain problems with compliance in this age group, e.g. adolescents may not view the monitor as &#x02018;stylish&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Further strategies to improve compliance may include rewards for both wearing and returning the monitor or employing other technologies, e.g. smartphones to monitor PA behaviours.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p id="Par52">The WISH study is the first school-based brisk walking intervention targeted at adolescent girls. The pilot study was delivered in the normal school setting, which increases the ecological validity of the study, and was delivered by peers trained as walk leaders. The use of older peers to facilitate the intervention is novel. The intervention was low-cost and required few resources to implement within the school setting. PA-related outcomes were assessed objectively and a longer-term follow-up was included to assess the effectiveness of the WISH study once the intervention period had ended, which has been a limitation of previous studies in this population.</p><p id="Par53">Although widely accepted, the use of accelerometers to measure PA in children and adolescents is not without its limitations; accelerometers cannot accurately measure certain activities, e.g. cycling and water-based activities&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and wearing of accelerometers is not permitted in certain sports, for example, competitive team games or dance performances. Such limitations can lead to underestimations when using accelerometers to measure PA&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Furthermore, poor adherence to the accelerometer wear protocol was a limitation within the present study. Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes did not account for the clustering randomisation that took place at the school level; therefore, the results of this pilot study should be interpreted with caution. As this was a pilot study, further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of this intervention within a fully powered RCT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">The WISH study demonstrated that levels of light intensity PA throughout the school day can be increased by participating in a brisk walking programme facilitated by older pupils trained as walk leaders. The positive intervention effects on light intensity PA are promising and may help offset the age-related declines in PA commonly observed among adolescent girls. Future research should examine the effects of walking during the school day on levels of MVPA in adolescent girls, which would help this population move towards meeting the PA guidelines. The findings of this study are of significant relevance to schools and policy-makers, indicating that the delivery of a low-cost walking intervention, requiring few resources to implement, is feasible within the school setting and indeed during the school day.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par6">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p id="Par7">Moderate to vigorous physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p id="Par8">Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PE</term><def><p id="Par9">Physical education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p id="Par10">Social cognitive theory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WC</term><def><p id="Par11">Waist circumference</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the participating schools, teachers and children for their involvement in the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par55">AC was supported by Vice Chancellor&#x02019;s Research Scholarship from the University of Ulster, UK.
