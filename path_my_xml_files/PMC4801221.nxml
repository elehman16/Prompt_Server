If antibiotic-impregnated CVCs were adopted for children, it is likely that they would be bulk-purchased and used for all children requiring CVCs in PICU. Decisions on whether to purchase antibiotic-impregnated CVCs therefore need to take into account 1) the generalisability of trial results to all children who need a CVC, and 2) the overall budget-impact of purchasing the more expensive impregnated CVCs.</p><p>Firstly, in terms of generalisability, children recruited in CATCH might have different risks of BSI than children receiving impregnated CVCs outside the trial setting: Children in the trial were expected to require a CVC for three or more days, and would therefore have a higher risk of BSI than those staying for short periods of time; background BSI rates may now be lower than in the trial, as rates have been steadily decreasing over the past decade following the introduction of CVC care bundles and on-going improvements in infection control.[<xref rid="pone.0151348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151348.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Secondly, in terms of budget-impact, impregnated CVCs are approximately twice as expensive as standard CVCs, but these additional costs could be outweighed by the reduction in healthcare resources due to fewer BSIs with the antibiotic-impregnated CVCs.</p><p>We determined the generalisability of the CATCH trial by deriving BSI rates for all children expected to require CVCs, based on a linkage study using data from a number of PICUs across the NHS.[<xref rid="pone.0151348.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We determined the budget- and cost-impacts of adopting antibiotic-impregnated CVCs for all children expected to require a CVC in PICU by synthesising the following evidence:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>the risk of BSI using standard CVCs (data linkage study)</p></list-item><list-item><p>the number of BSI potentially averted by using antibiotic-impregnated CVCs (CATCH trial results);</p></list-item><list-item><p>the additional costs of purchasing impregnated CVCs for all children (PICU survey data);</p></list-item><list-item><p>the value of the healthcare resources associated with each BSI (trial economic analysis).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics, consent and permissions</title><p>The CATCH trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry (reference 34884569) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01029717).

Types of CVCs used for emergency and elective admissions at each PICU were captured in responses to a PICU practice survey sent to a designated consultant at each PICU in 2009.[<xref rid="pone.0151348.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Where no response was obtained or the PICU was not included in the survey, we assumed that standard CVCs were used.</p><p>CVC use is not routinely captured for all admissions in PICANet, so we estimated the probability of CVC use for all admissions based on a subset of individual-level audit data from two hospitals, where CVC use was recorded. The subset of children most likely to have required a CVC was identified using multivariable logistic regression based on predictive variables in PICANet (use of vasoactive agents, length of stay and other clinical factors). BSI rates were then based on this subset of admissions.

We accounted for clustering of admissions within PICUs by including a random effect for PICU. Appropriateness of the Poisson model was verified using a goodness-of-fit test based on the deviance statistic. For comparisons between units and over time, rates were adjusted for risk-factors identified as being significant (p&#x0003c;0.05). Likelihood-ratio tests were used to identify significant interactions between risk-factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Number of BSI averted using antibiotic CVCs</title><p>The number of admissions requiring CVCs in all 23 PICUs in England was derived by combining the admission data in PICANet with PICU survey responses on the percentage of emergency and elective admissions requiring CVCs in 2012.[<xref rid="pone.0151348.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The BSI rate that would have occurred with antibiotic CVCs in place of standard CVCs was derived by applying the relative treatment effect (rate-ratio) for all BSI from the trial to the BSI rate using standard CVCs.

The total budget-impact of a policy to switch to antibiotic CVCs was calculated by multiplying the number of CVCs required by the maximum additional cost per CVC, i.e. &#x000a3;36.

However, antibiotic CVCs would likely be bulk-purchased for all children (including those with a lower risk of BSI than those participating in the trial). By estimating the number of BSI potentially averted using antibiotic CVCs for all children, we showed that the additional cost of purchasing antibiotic CVCs is lower than the value of resources associated with excess BSIs using standard CVCs.</p><p>We assumed that the relative treatment effect found in CATCH would be the same regardless of the baseline rate of BSI, i.e. that the effect would be the same for children who would have been ineligible for the trial because they were expected to stay &#x0003c;3 days in PICU. We reasoned that the biological mechanism through which antibiotic CVCs work is the same for low and high-risk patients (antibiotic-impregnated CVCs reduce the chance that bacteria track internally or externally along the CVC from the insertion site) and there was no a priori reason for an interaction. Randomised controlled trials of impregnated CVCs show similar results for long- and short-term CVCs, suggesting that effect is not modified in groups with different baseline risk or length of stay.[<xref rid="pone.0151348.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In CATCH, the event rate was low and there was limited power to assess variation in the treatment effect according to the duration of CVC. In reality, 72% of children recruited in CATCH required a CVC for 3 or more days.</p><p>There are a limitations to this study. Firstly, although Public Health England request that only clinically significant isolates are reported to the national surveillance system, the data used in the linkage study could have included BSI that should have been considered as contaminants. Secondly, BSI rates using standard CVCs were estimated using a predictive model as it was not possible to identify which children in PICANet had a CVC. We also relied on the assumption that for children likely to have required CVCs, CVCs would remain in place for the entire PICU stay. There is no clear direction of bias as we may have over- or under-estimated CVC-days, but our assumptions are reasonable based on the subset of CATCH participants. Finally, we relied on survey responses to derive the number of CVCs required in PICU, but we addressed this and uncertainty in other parameter estimates by performing sensitivity analyses.[<xref rid="pone.0151348.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151348.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that the benefits of using antibiotic-impregnated CVCs apply even for PICUs with low rates of BSI. These finding are consistent with systematic review evidence on the cost-effectiveness of impregnated CVCs in adults, which indicates that implementation of impregnated CVCs would be cost-effective for a range of relative risks and for baseline incidence of BSI as low as 0.2%.[<xref rid="pone.0151348.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] CATCH is the first trial to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic-impregnated versus standard CVCs in children, and the results of this generalisability study add to strong evidence in adults. Furthermore, as our cost estimates only consider use of hospital resources, the true cost of BSI and the benefits of antibiotic CVCs may be even greater when longer term outcomes of BSI are taken into account.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151348.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Predictive model identifying children most likely to require CVCs in PICU.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151348.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151348.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Survey results on type of CVC used prior to CATCH and percentage of admissions requiring CVCs.</title><p>Shaded boxes correspond to the 12 NHS Trusts participating in CATCH (14 PICUs). *no data in linked dataset.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151348.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151348.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Independent predictors of central venous catheter use in CVC audit data (basis for the predictive model).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151348.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151348.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Characteristics of admissions during the 23-month trial period (December 2010 to November 2012) in all PICUs in England.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151348.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Angie Wade and Harvey Goldstein who made substantial contributions to the original data linkage study.
