The checklist was piloted to enable a method to compare self-management support delivered in intervention and control sites that could be used in a larger trial.

In order to adjust for age, a multilevel regression model was fitted to each clinical outcome. This is a common approach to cluster-randomised clinical trials, and utilises all data, even if a participant is missing some. Group allocation was purely on the basis of site, forming an intention-to-treat analysis. Interparticipant variability was represented as a random intercept, and age, time and group allocation were included as fixed effects. Group differences were quantified at 6 and 12&#x02005;weeks, and a composite null hypothesis that both were equal to zero was assessed by Wald tests. This represents no mean difference between groups in how the outcomes change over time. These analyses were conducted in Stata V.11.2 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA), using command &#x02018;xtmixed&#x02019;.</p><p>Sample size calculations for a future trial were calculated using Stata software (command &#x02018;sampsi&#x02019;), assuming SDs observed in this study for NEADL and SAQOL, 80% power requirement and a range of putative minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs): NEADL from 2 to 5 in steps of 0.1, and SAQOL from 0.1 to 0.5 in steps of 0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>To estimate the resources involved in delivering stroke rehabilitation in each site, data were collected at individual patient level from therapist records on the number of CSR sessions, and face-to-face contact time in minutes.

Items included contacts with general practitioner (GP), practice nurse or other professionals, social care, and help from family and friends. The purpose was to explore if use of SMP reduced demands on other services, compared with the control group. EuroQol (EQ-5D) health state utility weights, using a published transformation<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> of the SF-12 profile measure of quality of life, was to be tested for deriving quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Intervention fidelity and acceptability</title><p>Overall, 63 occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, and rehabilitation support workers, received training.

The checklist was feasible to use and identified whether CSR incorporated behaviours and activities relating to core self-management principles. Clinicians in the intervention sites showed use of between five and seven self-management principles, whereas those in the control site showed evidence of using two or less.</p><p>A consecutive sample of patients (n=23) were interviewed and focus groups were carried out with all clinicians (n=34) including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, and rehabilitation support workers across sites, at the end of the trial, to explore intervention feasibility and acceptability.

Participant recruitment occurred between July 2012 and August 2013, 138/317 patients (44%) were eligible to participate across four sites. Recruitment took 14&#x02005;months, which was longer than the anticipated 10&#x02005;months. This was due to restructuring of some community services and a requirement for further training for new staff. Of those eligible and invited to participate, 78/138 (56%) consented and were recruited to the trial (at a rate of 5.57/month). Control sites recruited n=38 compared with n=40 in intervention sites. The main reason for non-eligibility was patients not requiring six rehabilitation sessions or more (58%), and patients with cognitive and communication impairments (17%).

Sites in this study were similar for NEADL apart from one site, which had a lower mean (but this seems to have been driven by just two participants); therefore, we are not able to make a precise estimate of intraclass correlation for future studies, though it appears to be small.

There were relatively few missing data items. The only services used by more than 10% of respondents were GPs, nurses, and hospital outpatient and emergency departments (data not shown); all other services, including social care, were not accessed by more than 90% of participants. Comparisons between sites of total costs of other service utilisation revealed no significant differences between any pair of sites. However, when only stroke-related service use was considered, the other health and social service costs of patients in the low-cost intervention site were higher than in all the other sites (&#x000a3;1291 vs &#x000a3;514 in the high cost intervention site, and &#x000a3;529 and &#x000a3;898 in the two control sites).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to test the feasibility of conducting a cluster-randomised controlled trial into the effectiveness of a stroke SMP integrated into post-hospital rehabilitation. Overall, the design, using a nested process evaluation, was found to be feasible and the intervention was delivered according to predetermined markers of fidelity.</p><p>Recruitment rate at 25% was higher than previous research (18%).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> But patients who required fewer than six sessions were the main reason for exclusion (58%). This is a limitation of this study and our previous research, but was chosen following discussion with CSR teams based on the premise that patients requiring less than six sessions would be less likely to have ongoing rehabilitation needs and would usually be managed by assessment and one-off advice. However, further research to adapt self-management interventions to be delivered in fewer number of sessions while delivering the same impact, such as that developed by Harwood <italic>et al</italic>, are now warranted.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Participants with aphasia and other cognitive impairments were also recruited at a lower rate and previous research using provider-based stroke SMPs has included low numbers of people with aphasia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Participants were also excluded due to low mood, not engaging in therapy and social issues, and 12 potential participants were excluded with no clear reason other than they were less compliant or more challenging. We suspect there were issues of potential gate keeping and selection of &#x02018;model&#x02019; participants for the trials illustrated in another study,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> which highlights the need for training to include methods and practical solutions of extending the SMP to more patients.</p><p>Outcomes measuring functional capacity (NEADL) and self-efficacy (SSEQ) showed most sensitivity to change in the intervention compared with control sites. This provides some validation of the aims of Bridges stroke SMP, which uses self-efficacy principles to facilitate a change in functional capacity and self-management. Functional capacity and mood have been shown to be closely associated with self-efficacy post-stroke, but the causal relationship has not been established.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, we suggest a measure of functional capacity such as the NEADL as a primary outcome with secondary measures of mood, quality of life and self-efficacy, is warranted in future self-management trials. At least 18 clusters would be required recruiting 20 participants per site to evaluate effectiveness of this stroke SMP in a full trial.</p><p>A number of economic findings were relevant to a full trial. In particular, the resource implications of the intervention appeared very different in the two sites. The composition of teams, particularly the ratio of professional to support staff also require further evaluation. The tool for collecting data on other service use worked well, but the burden on participants might have been reduced by concentrating on services (including GP, nurse, A&#x00026;E, nurse inpatient) used most frequently, and only on those that were stroke-related. The SF-12 scores were not significantly different between groups, so QALYs were not calculated, although a larger trial may identify differences.</p><p>The quality of training given to clinicians in the intervention sites was central to the delivery of the SMP as intended, but was more labour intensive than expected due to high staff turnover. However, compared with recent large-scale trials of provider-based SMPs,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref> clinicians from the intervention sites engaged in training, and enacted behaviours aligned with predetermined markers of self-management support. Nonetheless, training costs are a major consideration for SMP implementation, and less costly methods of training, such as online resources and peer learning utilising SMP champions, could be employed in a full trial.</p><p>Overall, the study was completed with minimal data lost to follow-up, and the trial design could be replicated in a larger definitive trial. By reducing the number of sessions required, addressing accessibility of the workbook and adapting the intervention for people with cognitive impairments, recruitment rates could increase further. Given these recommendations, our results support the need for conducting further research in this area, and provide data to support the design of a definitive trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the input from our stakeholder reference and expert advisory groups; support from the Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) South London; Professor Charles Wolfe for his help with early drafts of this paper, and Dr Stefan Tino Kulnik for his help with final drafting.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors designed the study.
