Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) constitute an endogenous vascular repairsystem, protecting against atherosclerosis development. Erythropoietin (EPO) treatment may have beneficial effects by mobilizing EPC from the bonemarrow. Our objective is to determine EPC levels and effects of EPO therapy on EPC levels in CRS patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Open-label randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Part of the EPOCARES-trial, conducted in Utrecht (Netherlands).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with CRS and anaemia and healthy controls were included.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients were randomized to receive EPO therapy (50&#x02005;IU/kg/wk) for 52&#x02005;weeks or no EPO therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Main outcome measures</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC, cultured EPC outgrowth and function at baseline, after 18&#x02005;days and after 52&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients showed lower CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-cell numbers compared to controls (6(12) vs. 19(19) cells/10<sup>5</sup> granulocytes; p=0.010), despite increased levels of stromal cell-derived factor-1&#x003b1;; (3.1(0.8) vs 2.6(0.3) ng/ml; p=0.001). EPC outgrowth and function were not different between patients and controls. EPC levels did not change after 18&#x02005;days with or without EPO treatment. CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-cells significantly declined after 52&#x02005;weeks in the non-treated group (p=0.028).

Over a one-year follow-up period a marked 68% further reduction in EPC levels was observed in the patient group without EPO treatment. In spite of promising experimental studies, our longitudinal, randomized study did not show significant influence of either short- or long-term EPO therapy on reduced EPC levels in CRS patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Renal disease</kwd><kwd>atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients with the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)&#x02014;ie, chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), often accompanied by anaemia&#x02014;have high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> Endothelial dysfunction and impaired endothelial regenerative capacity play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Bone marrow (BM) derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) constitute an endogenous vascular repair system that may protect against atherosclerosis development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Reduced EPC availability or function may contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD.</p><p>Disease conditions with high cardiovascular risk, including end-stage renal disease, have been associated with reduced EPC levels and function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> Others have not observed such inverse relations or even reported a positive relation between EPC number and vascular risk factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> In CHF, a negative correlation between cultured EPC and functional New York Heart Association (NYHA) class has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> However, others have found higher levels of EPC in mild CHF with increased levels of EPC mobilising factors, whereas EPC in severe disease were decreased, despite similar increases in stromal cell-derived factor-1&#x003b1; (SDF-1&#x003b1;) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> This suggests a protective compensatory response to the vascular risk burden in mild CHF, but exhaustion or suppression of BM progenitor cells in advanced CHF. We hypothesised that in CRS, the combined presence of even mild stages of CHF, CKD and anaemia is associated with impaired levels of circulating EPC, due to accumulation of uremic toxins, decreased nitric oxide availability and increased inflammation.</p><p>Enhancing circulating EPC may enhance vascular protection and reduce the progression of CVD.

The effects of EPO treatment were evaluated in an open-label, randomised design. Patients received EPO treatment (50&#x02005;IU/kg/week; Neorecormon, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Woerden, Netherlands) or standard treatment without EPO for one year. Short-term effects of EPO (n =30) versus no EPO (n =15) were evaluated after 18&#x02005;days (3&#x02005;days after third EPO injection), when EPO treatment was not yet expected to result in a haematopoietic response. Long-term (52&#x02005;week) effects of EPO were assessed in a subgroup of EPO-treated patients, who were allowed to increase haemoglobin (Hb) levels up to 8.5&#x02005;mmol/l for men and 8.3&#x02005;mmol/l for women (n =13), and a non EPO-treated group (n =13).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma measurements</title><p>Serum EPO levels were measured by sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (IMMULITE 2000 platform, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Breda, Netherlands). Endothelial dysfunction, EPC mobilising factors and inflammation markers were measured using ELISA (E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), interleukin (IL)-6, VEGF, SDF-1&#x003b1; (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) and thrombomodulin (Diaclone, Stamford, Connecticut, USA)) or multiplex immunoassay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (Bio-Rad Laboratories,Hercules, California, USA)). High sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) was determined by particle-enhanced immunonephelometry (standard Cardio-Phase hsCRP for BNII, Dade Behring Holding, Liederbach, Germany). N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was measured using electrochemiluminescense immunoassay (Cobas CA6000, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Samples were measured in duplicate and averaged for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Circulating EPC levels</title><p>Circulating EPC were defined as cells positive for haematopoietic stem cell marker CD34 and endothelial marker kinase insert domain receptor (KDR; ie, VEGF receptor-2). This CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC has previously shown clinical importance by predicting cardiovascular events and death in cardiovascular risk populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Blood (100&#x02005;&#x003bc;l) was incubated with anti-CD34-FITC (BD Pharmingen, California, USA), anti-KDR-PE (R&#x00026;D Systems) and anti-CD45-PE-Cy7 (BD Pharmingen) antibodies for 45&#x02005;min. Erythrocytes were lysed and analysed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, California, USA). Circulating HSC and EPC were identified as CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup> cells in the lymphocyte region of the forward/sideward scatter plot. Cell numbers were quantified relative to 10<sup>5</sup> granulocytes, identified as CD45<sup>+</sup> cells with a typical granulocyte distribution. Measurements were performed in duplicate and results were averaged. Isotype-stained samples served as negative controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Outgrowth of EPC in culture</title><p>EPC outgrowth from mononuclear cells (MNC) was assessed as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> In brief, MNC were isolated from blood using Ficoll density gradient separation (Histopaque 1077, Sigma, St Louis, Missouri, USA). To evaluate EPC outgrowth in culture, 10<sup>7</sup> MNC/well were seeded on a human fibronectin (Sigma) coated 6-well plate in EGM-2 (Cambrex, Baltimore, Maryland, USA), supplemented with accompanying aliquots, 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), 100&#x02005;ng/ml recombinant VEGF-165 (R&#x00026;D Systems) and antibiotics. Medium was changed after 4&#x02005;days to wash non-adherent cells away. After 7&#x02005;days, cultured EPC in selected wells were placed on serum free medium (EBM-2 with hEGF, hydrocortisone, GA-1000, R<sup>3</sup>-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, heparin and antibiotics) overnight. Conditioned medium was stored for functional experiments and cultured EPC were detached by trypsin and cell scraping, and automatically counted using a haemocytometer.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro scratch wound assay</title><p>The potential of EPC outgrowth to excrete paracrine factors that stimulate endothelial cell migration was assessed by in vitro scratch wound assay.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> In brief, EPC outgrowth medium was placed on a mechanically scratched confluent human microvascular endothelial cell layer. After 6&#x02005;h, the extent of scratch closure relative to the starting width was compared between study groups using light photography. Each sample was measured in two separate wells and two picture fields per well were examined. Results were averaged for data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS V.15.0 for Windows. Data distribution was tested by the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD for parametric data and as median (IQR) for non-parametric data. Differences between groups were analysed using Student's t test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test. Fisher's exact test was used to analyse whether proportions of categories varied by group. Multiple group comparisons were performed using ANOVA with LSD post-hoc testing for which non-parametric data were log-transformed. Correlations were measured by Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficient where appropriate. Multivariate determinants of log-transformed progenitor cell counts were identified by stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. A value of p &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> summarises baseline characteristics.

In cardiorenal patients not treated with EPO, we observed a marked reduction in CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC levels after one year compared to baseline. Long-term, 52&#x02005;weeks EPO therapy did not significantly affect this reduction in CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC levels.</p><p>Our study is the first to report reduced circulating progenitor cells in patients with CRS.

Plasma levels of NT-proBNP may be influenced by renal dysfunction, but remain a powerful reflection of cardiac status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> At tissue level EPC recruitment depends on ischaemia or endothelial injury induced up-regulation of SDF-1&#x003b1;. In our study, SDF-1&#x003b1; levels correlated with renal function, heart function and endothelial dysfunction markers, indicating that signals for progenitor cell mobilisation are intact. However, this did not result in an efficient EPC increase in CRS. This may be explained by impaired EPC production due to uraemia and other cardiovascular risk factors and/or increased homing to injured endothelium. In agreement with previous results,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> in CRS patients with mild CHF, increased SDF-1&#x003b1; levels were associated with higher CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC levels, suggesting that in milder CHF stages SDF-1&#x003b1; can lead to EPC mobilisation. In contrast, in severe CHF the association between SDF-1&#x003b1; and EPC levels disappeared or even reversed, suggesting an impaired EPC mobilising response to SDF-1&#x003b1; in this stage. This is consistent with the biphasic response reported in severe CHF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and may relate to exhaustion of haematopoietic progenitors at the BM level or inflammatory factors exerting BM suppression in advanced CHF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> Indeed, our data show a significant inverse relation between IL-6 levels and CD34<sup>+</sup>-HSC numbers. Inflammatory cytokines are known to exert a suppressive effect on erythropoiesis. Consistently, in our patients with mild anaemia we observed lower Hb levels when hsCRP levels were higher. We observed no correlations between serum EPO levels and either Hb levels or endothelial progenitor cell counts. Interestingly, CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC levels correlated positively with Hb levels, suggesting a common BM suppressive effect on both EPC production or mobilisation and erythropoiesis.</p><p>In our study short-term EPO administration did not influence HSC or EPC levels. This contrasts with previous reports in CKD or post-myocardial infarction patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> In part this discrepancy may be explained by differences in EPO dosage, as EPC response to EPO has been shown to be dose-dependent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> Since the potential clinical problems caused by long-term EPO are presumably dose-related,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> our patients received a relatively low, currently recommended, EPO dosage (50&#x02005;IU/kg/week). This was sufficient to enhance reticulocyte levels. It could be that our CRS patients were not able to increase EPC levels in response to EPO due to exhaustion or suppression of these progenitors at the BM level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> In line with this hyporesponsiveness of EPC on EPO, we observed no relations between serum EPO and EPC levels, whereas endogenous EPO levels were reported to be positively associated with EPC levels in CHF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> or CKD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref></p><p>To our knowledge, no previous randomised trials have reported on one-year follow-up of EPC or HSC levels in a high CVD risk population. In patients not treated with EPO, we observed a 68% reduction in CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC levels after one year compared to baseline, whereas HSC levels remained unchanged compared to baseline. This discrepancy may be related to the fact that CRS is associated with impaired NO availability, and that NO and the NO producing enzyme eNOS are essential for EPC mobilisation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> Our finding that EPC reduced over time whereas HSC were not affected seems consistent with the observation that NO supported mobilisation of EPC but not of HSC in a mouse model.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> Long-term EPO treatment showed a minor and non-significant effect on preserving EPC levels over one year. One previous study reported no difference in EPC levels between EPO and non-EPO treated CHF patients after 2.5&#x02005;years follow-up. However, this observation may be confounded by the cross-sectional study design and retrospective matching of the control group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>In contrast to circulating CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC, EPC outgrowth and function were not different between CRS patients and controls. It could be that CRS affects mainly the &#x02018;true&#x02019; progenitor cells in the haematopoietic/endothelial lineage as it affects progenitors in the erythropoietic lineage in BM. CD34<sup>+</sup>KDR<sup>+</sup>-EPC represent a defined subset of true BM-derived progenitor cells with the ability for clonal expansion into endothelial cell colonies from single cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> Cultured EPC are mostly derived from CD34-negative cells, and can adopt an endothelial phenotype after culture, but are not able to clonally expand.

Over a one-year follow-up period a marked 68% further reduction in EPC levels was observed in the patient group without EPO treatment.
