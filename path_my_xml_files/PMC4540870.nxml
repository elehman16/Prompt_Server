function in long-term male smokers in their twenties. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-eight
healthy males between 20 and 29&#x02005;years of age were randomly divided into an experimental
and a control group (14 members each). The experiment was conducted during 30&#x02005;min
sessions, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The experimental group performed diaphragm
respiration exercises and the control group performed exercises using MOTOmed. Pulmonary
function (tidal volume, breathing capacity, inspiratory reserve volume, inspiratory
capacity, and expiratory reserve volume) was evaluated and analyzed before and after the
experiment. [Results] Our results revealed significant increases in tidal volume,
inspiratory reserve volume, inspiratory capacity, and breathing capacity in the
experimental group. These increases were greater in the experimental group than in the
control group. [Conclusion] In our study, the experimental group which performed diaphragm
respiration exercises showed a greater improvement in pulmonary function compared with the
control group. It is hypothesized that greater improvement in pulmonary function is
expected if diaphragm respiration exercises are implemented taking into account the age of
the smokers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Diaphragm respiration exercise</kwd><kwd>Smoking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>According to predictions by the World Health Organization, the number of smokers who will
die from cigarette-related diseases will surpass the number of people dying from AIDS,
traffic accidents, suicide, and murder combined by 2020<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to the presence of various harmful substances in cigarettes,
smoking can cause many diseases. Nicotine&#x02014;which is one of the major constituents of
cigarettes&#x02014;causes arteriosclerosis, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and other problems that result not only in low cardiopulmonary function<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> but also in relatively diminished daily
living ability and endurance in smokers compared with that in non-smokers<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it is common knowledge that
smoking is very highly correlated with occurrence of respiratory diseases. Diaphragmatic
breathing is a good technique for respiration and relaxation of the lungs because it enables
sufficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is reported to be effective in (1)
improvement of ventilation efficiency, dyspnea, and activity ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>; reduction of metabolic acidosis; alleviation of back
pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>; spine correction<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>; abdominal strengthening<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>; and improvement of body composition and
flexibility<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our current social
climate, the number of male smokers in their twenties is rapidly increasing and this trend
is becoming a social problem. Our study attempts to verify the effects of diaphragm
respiration exercises on respiratory function in long-term male smokers in their
twenties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All research subjects were 40 male students between 20 and 29&#x02005;years of age enrolled at
University P, located in Gyeongbuk, Korea. They were randomly and evenly divided (14 members
per group) into a diaphragm respiration exercise group and a control group. We conducted
interviews with every subject and recorded individual measurements for each weight, body fat
percentage, smoking history, smoking amount, smoking habit, drinking habit, diet, disease
history, and family history. Only subjects who were not receiving medical treatment for
respiratory diseases and who had a clean family medical history and personal habits were
selected. Among smoking habits, those who smoked cigars other than filtered cigarettes or
tobacco pipes were excluded. Only subjects who have been smoking for 1 to 3&#x02005;years were
included. We ensured that the research subjects fully understood the research project and
signed consent was obtained from each participant. Our study was approved by the Committee
of Clinical Testing at Korea Nazarene University and was screened according to the ethical
standards of the Helsinki Declaration. General characteristics of study participants are
summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General participant characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG (n = 14)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG (n = 14)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.1 &#x000b1; 1.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.8 &#x000b1; 0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">173.7 &#x000b1; 5.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">175.2 &#x000b1; 3.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.5 &#x000b1; 4.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.7 &#x000b1; 5.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Smoking period (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0 &#x000b1; 0.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SD.

for 4 weeks. The exercise involved subjects lying in the supine position with the researcher
placing his or her hand on the upper part of the subject&#x02019;s rectus abdominis, (i.e.,
immediately below the frontal costal cartilage), and the subject breathing in deeply and
slowly out through the nose. Simultaneously, the shoulder was maintained in relaxed position
and the upper chest was fixed so that only the abdomen was allowed to rise. Afterward, using
controlled exhalation, the subject was told to slowly release all of the air outward<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the control group, each participant performed a cycling exercise using MOTOmed
(RECK-Technik GmbH &#x00026; Co, Betzenweiler, Germany), which allowed for regular and
repetitive training without affecting respiration. The strength of the training was
controlled so that the heart rate of the participants did not exceed 20% of the heart rate
reserve<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If a subject complained of fatigue or dizziness during the respiration exercise, a break
was taken and exercise resumed some time later. Prior to the experiment, the tester taught
each subject the proper method for the respiration exercise 2 or 3 times to ensure that the
subject was comfortable performing it.</p><p>Pulmonary function of the participants was measured in a sitting position using a tool
called Fitmate (COSMED, Sri, Italy). To ensure accurate measurements, the tester explained
and demonstrated the exercise to each subject beforehand. Both the experimental and control
groups were instructed to use the mouthpiece and to block the nostrils during the
measurement so that air was neither inhaled nor exhaled through the nose. Starting from
exhalation, subjects slowly exhaled to maximum level following the tester&#x02019;s signal and then
slowly inhaled; tidal volume (TV), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve
volume (ERV), inspiratory capacity (IC), and volume capacity (VC) were measured at this
time<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three measurements were made
for each pre-test and post-test value, and the average of the 3 values was used as the final
value. Each subject was given a 5-min break after each measurement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>When comparing the breathing capacity of the experimental and control groups before and

teens and twenties. In all likelihood, this population is at a greater risk of developing
respiratory diseases in future. Respiration training in addition to psychological and
medical treatments should be an active intervention in any anti-smoking program; however, in
reality, the approach to professional respiration training is very limited and depends on
simple respiration exercises. Hence, it is important to implement professional respiration
training as a means of recovering the decreased breathing ability of current smokers and of
lowering the smoking rate. The effectiveness of direct treatment by therapists specializing
in respiration training has already been proven<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study implemented diaphragm
respiration training that improved breathing ability, along with lung window setting of the
thoracic cage, by improving diaphragmatic function, which is the major factor that affects
the efficiency of breathing. We examined the impact of diaphragm respiration training on
pulmonary function of normal males in the age range of 20 to 29&#x02005;years. In order to
ameliorate subject muscle fatigue and efficiently increase muscle strength, exercise
repetition number, sustained time, and resting time should be properly standardized<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known that the experiment is most
effective when implemented for 4 to 12 weeks, 2 to 5 times per week, with each session
lasting no longer than 20 to 30&#x02005;min. Taking this fact into consideration, we opted for
30-min exercise sessions performed 5 times per week for 4 weeks.</p><p>Pulmonary function tests were conducted 4 weeks after the experiment concluded. The
experimental group showed significant increases in TV, IRV, IC, and VC after the experiment,
while there was no significant increase in ERV. Meanwhile, the control group showed no
significant increase in any parameter. Examining the changes in the experimental and control
groups after the experiment, the experimental group showed more increases than the control
group in every section; however, only VC revealed a significant increase. It is hypothesized
that repetitive training of reinforcing the strength of the diaphragm muscle against
therapist resistance improved the subjects&#x02019; inspiratory muscle function. This subsequently
increased thoracic mobility, thereby resulting in improved breathing ability.</p><p>In a study conducted by Enright et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, normal people who had undergone high frequency inspiratory muscle
training registered significant increases in breathing capacity, total breathing capacity,
inspiratory muscle strength, and inspiratory endurance. In a study conducted by
Townsend<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, normal people who had
undergone respiration training exhibited large differences between the resultant inspiratory
volumes and expiratory volumes. Jones et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that under normal conditions, TV increased among COPD
patients after diaphragmatic breathing exercises. Moreover, pursed-lip breathing exercises
contributed to increased final IC and instant ventilation volume<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> in these patients. Decreased final expiratory capacity and
increased final IC were observed among COPD patients who performed the pursed-lip breathing
exercise<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies that
examined the effect of respiration exercises on normal people like those in this study or on
COPD patients showed results consistent with or similar to this study.</p><p>We believe that data that are more objective can be obtained by comparing breathing between
different age groups through a study on smokers from different age groups, in addition to
those in their twenties. In addition, we consider it imperative to implement diverse
exercise programs aimed at improvement of breathing, especially among smokers.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Department of
