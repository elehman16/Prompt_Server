After a first treatment failure, young patients without tonic-clonic seizures, with a normal CT/MRI scan and failing their treatment because of unacceptable adverse events, had the highest likelihood of 12-month remission. Approximately 50% of patients who failed a first treatment also failed their second.

Currently, there is only limited evidence regarding the likely outcome after a first treatment failure in epilepsy. Following the International League Against Epilepsy classification of refractory epilepsy,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> there have been studies attempting to identify risk factors for drug resistance<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>; however, they do not provide estimates that are easily applied to a specific individual, or stratified for groups of similar individuals.</p><p>Prognostic models are rare in epilepsy and include those derived from the National General Practice Survey of Epilepsy,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> the MRC Antiepileptic Drug Withdrawal Study,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> the Multicentre Study of Early Epilepsy and Single Seizures,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and models for patients with focal and generalized epilepsy derived from the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drug (SANAD) trial.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>SANAD arm A recruited 1,721 patients (89% focal epilepsy) who were randomized to treatment with carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, or oxcarbazepine. SANAD arm B recruited 716 patients (66% generalized, 27% unclassified) who were randomized to lamotrigine, topiramate, or valproate. Data from the SANAD trial therefore provide a unique opportunity to investigate outcomes after a first treatment failure and clinical factors that influence these outcomes.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Outcomes.</title><p>Outcomes are time to 12-month remission and time to second treatment failure, both measured from date of first treatment failure due to inadequate seizure control or unacceptable adverse events. Twelve-month remission is defined as time to 365 days of continuous seizure freedom. Second treatment failure is defined as withdrawal of a treatment, or addition of a drug, which may be due to inadequate seizure control, unacceptable adverse events, or both.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Patients and procedures.</title><p>The methods for the SANAD trial have been published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In summary, patients were eligible for inclusion if, in the previous year, they had a history of at least 2 clinically definite unprovoked seizures and they were at least 5 years old. Patients were recruited into SANAD arm A if the recruiting clinician considered carbamazepine to be the optimal standard treatment option. Patients were then allocated to start treatment with carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Patients were eligible for inclusion in arm B if the recruiting clinician regarded valproate the standard treatment option. Participants were randomly allocated to valproate, lamotrigine, or topiramate. One protocol was used for both arms A and B.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Prognostic modeling.</title><p>Our approach was similar to that published previously,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and our list of potential prognostic factors included the following: sex, history of at least one febrile seizure (associated with fever but without evidence of intracranial infection or defined cause), first-degree relative with epilepsy, age at first treatment failure, time on randomized (first) treatment, neurologic insult, total number of tonic-clonic seizures ever at first treatment failure, reason for first treatment failure (inadequate seizure control or adverse effects), seizure type, epilepsy type, EEG result at entry into the SANAD trial, and CT or MRI result at entry into SANAD. Randomized drug was also considered as a prognostic factor to determine whether the outcomes were influenced by first drug.</p><p>Patients were classified as having neurologic insult if they had learning disabilities (a history of requiring a remedial or additional teacher in more than 2 subjects, or who underwent a &#x0201c;statement of their education needs,&#x0201d; or attended a special school) or neurologic deficit (localizing neurologic signs resulting in functional impairment). EEG was classified as normal, not done, nonspecific abnormality, or epileptiform abnormality (focal or generalized spikes or spike and slow-wave activity). Seizure types were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy seizure classification.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Epilepsy type was classified as focal, generalized, or unclassified with the unclassified category representing uncertainty between focal-onset and generalized-onset seizures.</p><p>Analyses, adjusted for multiple variables using Cox proportional hazards modeling, determined variables associated with a greater likelihood of achieving the outcomes. Variable centering was used to diminish multicollinearity: binary independent variables were coded +1/2 and &#x02212;1/2 rather than 1 and 0; categorical independent variables were &#x0201c;dummy-coded&#x0201d; as usual, but instead of coding each response as 1 and 0, the values 1 &#x02212; 1/m and &#x02212;1/m were used, where m is the number of categories.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Parsimonious multivariable models were produced with variable selection via backward elimination with Akaike Information Criterion.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The full model included all factors listed above.</p><p>All continuous variables were investigated using log and fractional polynomial transformations; selection was made via the Akaike Information Criterion.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Continuous variable results are presented as post hoc defined categorical variables with categories chosen according to knot positions for a spline model fit to the data.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Schoenfeld<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> residual plots and incorporation of time-dependent covariate effects were used to investigate the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model.</p><p>Kaplan-Meier curves were produced to show the unadjusted time to 12-month remission and time to second treatment failure after a first treatment failure. The discriminatory power and predictive accuracy of the models were assessed, as a method of internal validation, by the C statistic. This measures the proportion of patient pairs in which the predictions and outcomes are concordant.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> To assess the effect of factors on the different reasons for second treatment failure, subgroup analyses were performed: factors that predict the failure outcome were considered for patients whose first treatment failed due to inadequate seizure control and for patients whose first treatment failed due to unacceptable adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.</title><p>The SANAD trial received appropriate multicenter and local ethics and research committee approvals, and was managed according to the Medical Research Council's Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

The model is able to stratify patients, and the estimates for 12-month remission rates could be used in routine clinical practice to inform likely outcomes.</p><p>The model published here has a number of similarities to the model for time to 12-month remission from randomization in SANAD.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Unsurprisingly, reason for first treatment failure is of prognostic importance as is duration of first treatment. Early treatment failure is more likely to be due to adverse effects, so duration of first treatment and reason for first treatment failure are likely to be correlated, but nonetheless, both factors were included in the multivariable model.</p><p>While broad epilepsy type (focal vs generalized) was not included in the multivariable model, this was, in part, accounted for by seizure type, which was included. Also, the occurrence of tonic-clonic seizures (focal or generalized in onset) on first treatment was prognostic as was age.</p><p>The EEG result was not associated with 12-month remission, which is surprising because EEG abnormality was found to be associated with seizure recurrence risk in other studies.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The most likely explanation is that the EEG data used were collected at entry into SANAD. Future studies assessing outcome after a first treatment failure need to undertake EEGs at that time point to assess their prognostic importance.</p><p>We also found that 12-month remission was more likely in men than in women, which was also established when the SANAD arm A data were modeled for time to 12-month remission from initiating treatment (randomization).<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This finding remains mostly unexplained because there was no significant difference in the way men and women were dosed, and it is unclear whether this finding represents differences in the way that men and women are managed, or whether this represents an underlying important biological difference between the sexes that influences drug response. A study in children also found sex to be significant; the authors showed that discontinuation of AEDs in seizure-free children was less likely to succeed if the patient was female, had an abnormal neurologic examination, seizure onset of less than 120 months, and had focal seizures.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>It is important to note that first AED was not included in the model, highlighting that clinical factors have a more important impact on outcome than choice of first drug. This should not be surprising because differences found among drugs have been small and drug development programs have retreated to finding noninferiority as opposed to superiority for new treatments.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>For time to second treatment failure after a first treatment failure, we have produced 3 models. The first examines time to a second treatment failure irrespective of the reason for a first treatment failure. The models assessing subgroups according to reason for first treatment failure give quite different results.</p><p>The SANAD trial was not designed to address the question considered here. Although patients were followed up regardless of outcome, it is possible that data collection for the outcomes examined in this report may not have been as complete or accurate as for the primary outcomes in the trial. Some have criticized the fact that SANAD recruited a heterogeneous group of patients rather than specific seizure types or epilepsy syndromes<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>; however, the strength of this approach is illustrated in this report and in our previous reports modeling data from SANAD.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>SANAD was an unblinded trial, which could have influenced outcome assessment; for example, decisions as to whether a treatment had failed, although examination of dosing data indicates that reasonable doses were tried before a decision was made that treatment had failed. While randomized controlled trials are the best methodology for assessing treatment effects, they might recruit a selected population, which might bias estimates of prognosis.</p><p>Participants were seen predominantly by neurologists experienced at identifying and classifying seizures, but a further challenge in outpatient-based studies of seizures and epilepsy is that seizures are reported to the clinician by the patient and it is possible that patients underreport the occurrence of seizures. Validating patient reporting in an outpatient population with infrequent seizures is difficult and to date has not been done.</p><p>The predictive ability of the models presented within this report is low, as illustrated by the low C statistics for each model. While there is increasing interest in stratified medicine and pharmacogenetics, it remains unknown as to whether genetic factors might account for some of the unexplained variability in our predictive models. In the future, they may help to improve the predictive accuracy of the models.</p><p>The models presented here are the first to consider chance of remission and risk of second treatment failure after a first treatment failure. While we have presented a number of models that may inform patient counseling and treatment decisions, ideally these models require validation in other similar datasets, although few such datasets exist. In addition, the mechanisms by which the clinical factors identified in this report influence outcome remain poorly understood and require further assessment.</p><p>This article presents the first report of prognostic modeling for time to 12-month remission and time to second treatment failure, both after a first treatment failure. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of outcome in epilepsy and the complex interplay among the factors that influence it. Patients with differing risks of 12 months of remission and treatment failure could be identified at the point in time when the initial AED treatment failed. Results will improve outcome prediction for patients, and allow better stratification of patients, including the identification of patients more likely to have poor treatment outcome for whom more intensive follow-up may be required. Similarly, the models may also aid in the identification of patients with poorer seizure control outcomes who might be eligible to participate in future trials of new treatments, for example surgical treatments such as deep brain stimulation, which might carry greater risk than drug treatment.</p></sec>
