In Alberta, the preterm birth rate was 8.7% in 2015, the second highest among Canadian provinces. Approximately 20% of preterm infants are born before&#x000a0;32&#x000a0;weeks gestation (early preterm), and require care in a Level&#x000a0;III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); 80% are born moderate (32&#x000a0;weeks and zero days [32<sup>0/7</sup>] to 33<sup>6/7</sup> weeks) and late preterm (34<sup>0/7</sup> to 36<sup>6/7</sup> weeks), and require care in a Level&#x000a0;II NICU. Preterm birth and experiences in the NICU disrupt early parent-infant relationships and induce parental psychosocial distress. Family Integrated Care (FICare) shows promise as a model of care in Level&#x000a0;III NICUs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate length of stay, infant and maternal clinical outcomes, and costs following adaptation and implementation of FICare in Level&#x000a0;II NICUs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We will conduct a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in ten Alberta Level&#x000a0;II NICUs allocated to one of two groups: FICare or standard care. The FICare Alberta model involves three theoretically-based, standardized components: information sharing, parenting education, and family support. Our sample size of 181 mother-infant dyads per group is based on the primary outcome of NICU length of stay, 80% participation, and 80% retention at follow-up. Secondary outcomes (e.g., infant clinical outcomes and maternal psychosocial distress) will be assessed shortly after admission to NICU, at discharge and 2&#x000a0;months corrected age. We will conduct economic analysis from two perspectives: the public healthcare payer and society. To understand the utility, acceptability, and impact of FICare, qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subset of mothers at the 2-month follow-up, and with hospital administrators and healthcare providers near the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Results of this pragmatic cRCT of FICare in Alberta Level&#x000a0;II NICUs will inform policy decisions by providing evidence about the clinical effectiveness and costs of FICare.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02879799">NCT02879799</ext-link>.

The preterm birth rate in Alberta, 8.7% in 2015, is the second highest among Canadian provinces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These rates may be attributed, in part, to delayed childbearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and assisted reproductive technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Approximately 20% of preterm infants are born before 32&#x000a0;weeks gestation (early preterm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and require care in a Level&#x000a0;III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The remaining 80% are born moderately preterm (32&#x000a0;weeks and zero days [32<sup>0/7</sup>] to 33<sup>6/7</sup> weeks gestational age [GA]) and late preterm (34<sup>0/7</sup> to 36<sup>6/7</sup> weeks GA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Alberta, 6.6% of live births, or approximately 3500 infants annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], require care in a Level&#x000a0;II NICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Compared with their full-term counterparts, preterm infants who survive are at higher risk for short-term morbidities including respiratory problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], hyperbilirubinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes including cognitive delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], visual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and hearing impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and behavioral problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Further, as GA decreases, the risk of chronic health problems and developmental delays increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cost of preterm birth</title><p id="Par15">The costs associated with preterm infants are greater than for term infants because of increased (1) hospital length of stay (LOS), (2) resource utilization, (3) readmissions, and (4) need for additional health, education, and social services in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In 2010, care of preterm infants represented the largest category of Alberta&#x02019;s expenditures for pediatric health care at 8.45%, with a total cost of approximately $35 million Canadian Dollar (CAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Similar to health consequences of preterm birth, there is a reverse economic gradient associated with GA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. That is, the lower the GA, the greater healthcare system and out-of-pocket expenses for parents of preterm infants. In Canada, recently estimated <italic>costs per infant</italic> to age ten years were $67,467 CAD for children born before 28&#x000a0;weeks GA, $52,796 CAD for those born between 28 and 32&#x000a0;weeks GA, and $10,010 CAD for those born between 33 and 36&#x000a0;weeks GA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Financial consequences for parents include reduced workforce participation and lost earnings, as well as the cost of developmental supports for the infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Unquantifiable costs are associated with psychological distress, marital distress, and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although effective psycho-educational interventions for mothers of preterm infants exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], evidence is generally limited to the extremely preterm infants and cost-effectiveness data are lacking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Level&#x000a0;II neonatal intensive care for preterm infants and their families</title><p id="Par16">Level&#x000a0;II NICUs are technological, critical care environments where healthcare providers (HCP) often unintentionally marginalize parents in the pursuit of optimal clinical care of preterm infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The unexpected birth of a preterm infant may leave parents feeling anxious, depressed, isolated, and unprepared to interact with, and care for, their infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Preterm birth and experiences in the NICU may disrupt breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and the early parent-infant relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] that are critical for early brain and biological development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventions for parents of preterm infants suggest that psycho-educational approaches increase maternal self-efficacy, reduce anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and increase human-milk feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], with consequent improvements in child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, many of these interventions predate evidence of the importance of early parent-child relationships to life-long health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">A new model of care, Family Integrated Care (FICare), shows promise as an intervention to improve outcomes for early preterm infants cared for in Level&#x000a0;III NICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Based on these promising results, FICare is being evaluated in two cluster randomized controlled trials (cRCTs): one is a 26-site international (Canada, Australia, New Zealand) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and one a 6-site trial in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Another Canadian study using a pre-test/post-test design in Level&#x000a0;II NICUs is currently in progress. None of these studies focus on health system impact, nor include an economic analysis. Thus, a pragmatic cRCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] is critical to inform health service decisions about clinical effectiveness and costs of FICare for moderate and late preterm infants admitted to Level&#x000a0;II NICUs and their families.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p id="Par18">The objective of this study is to adapt FICare for implementation in Level&#x000a0;II NICUs across Alberta, and evaluate its clinical effectiveness and costs. We hypothesize that FICare will empower parents with the knowledge, skill and confidence to care for their infant(s), and prepare the family for earlier discharge with a concomitant decrease in NICU LOS (primary outcome). Secondarily, we hypothesize that FICare will (1) reduce infant morbidities during hospitalization and the risk of developmental delay at 2&#x000a0;months corrected age (CA), (2) increase rates of human-milk feeding by discharge and at 2&#x000a0;months CA, and (3) reduce parental psychological distress by discharge and at 2&#x000a0;months CA. To understand the utility, acceptability, and impact of FICare, qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subset of mothers at the 2-month-old follow-up, and with hospital administrators and HCP near the end of the study. The specific objectives of the economic analysis are three-fold: (1) to estimate the implementation costs of FICare, (2) to compare public healthcare payer costs of FICare against standard care, and (3) to compare societal costs during hospitalization for parents of FICare against standard care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par19">The proposed study employs a pragmatic, parallel-group, superiority cRCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] with convenience sampling. A cRCT will avoid contamination between groups, particularly in smaller cities that have only one Level&#x000a0;II NICU. The study design and adaptation of the FICare intervention for Alberta Level&#x000a0;II NICUs were co-developed by a provincial, multidisciplinary stakeholder group. We adhered to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines in the design of the protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A qualitative component will describe maternal, hospital administrator, and HCP experiences of FICare, the process of implementation itself, and implementation quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par20">We will conduct the study in ten Level&#x000a0;II NICUs (five intervention and five control sites) across the province of Alberta, which is located in Western Canada. Alberta&#x02019;s population of four million is typically younger with higher income, and a greater proportion of women in their childbearing years than the Canadian average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Alberta has a single, publicly funded health services delivery system (Alberta Health Services [AHS]), which offers advantages for multicenter studies in terms of standardization of many structures and processes across hospitals in the province. All hospitals serve a demographically diverse population that is generally representative of the care of childbearing women in Alberta. AHS HCP must be registered members under the provincial Health Disciplines Act (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/H02.pdf">http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/H02.pdf</ext-link>).

Study coordinators will liaise daily or weekly, as needed, with study nurses to ensure that recruitment targets are being met, data collection is accurate and timely, and fidelity to their group allocation is maintained.</p><p id="Par22">All study nurses (registered or licensed practical nurses) will be employees of AHS, and will receive 4&#x000a0;h of specialized training about (1) the purpose of the FICare study, (2) consenting participants, and (3) data collection. We will provide training &#x0201c;booster doses&#x0201d; when fidelity checks warrant them. For the intervention sites only, we will use a &#x0201c;train-the-trainer&#x0201d; model to provide education about FICare to all HCP at the site. To facilitate study nurses to deliver training at the FICare intervention sites, we will provide an additional 8&#x000a0;h of training about the Alberta Level&#x000a0;II NICU FICare model. All HCP in Level&#x000a0;II NICUs in this study are generally aware of the principles of patient and family centered care prior to implementation because that is a pillar of care for AHS. However, HCP do not receive specialized training in either family centered care or FICare.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Eligibility criteria for clusters</title><p id="Par23">All ten Level&#x000a0;II NICUs (clusters) across six cities in Alberta were eligible and agreed to participate in the trial. The loss of a cluster would jeopardize completion of this study. To decrease potential loss of sites, we will ensure frequent and effective communication between the coordinating and local sites. To prevent loss of clusters due to: (1) lack of resources, the study will provide a proportion of the salary for a FICare study nurse to each site to support study activities, and (2) resentful demoralization, we budgeted to provide training to control clusters at the end of the study if FICare is effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Eligibility criteria for individual participants</title><p id="Par24">We will include mothers and their preterm infants born between 32<sup>0/7</sup> weeks to 34<sup>6/7</sup> weeks GA with a primary admission, or transfer within 72&#x000a0;h, to one of the Level&#x000a0;II NICUs. Thirty-two weeks and zero days is the minimum GA for an infant admitted to a Level&#x000a0;II NICU; otherwise the infant should be admitted or transferred to a Level&#x000a0;III NICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

We adapted the Alberta Level&#x000a0;II NICU model of FICare from a four-pillar model established for Level&#x000a0;III NICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The four-pillar model consists of: (1) staff education and support, (2) parent education, (3) NICU environment, and (4) psychosocial support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Given that (1) preterm infants admitted to a Level&#x000a0;II NICU are more mature than infants admitted to a Level&#x000a0;III NICU and have a shorter LOS, and (2) because provincial health services are delivered through two providers (Alberta Health Services and Covenant Health), there were questions about the goodness of fit. Following consultation with provincial stakeholders, we reconceptualized the FICare four-pillar model to better fit the Level&#x000a0;II NICU population and context for the current cRCT.</p><p id="Par26">FICare for Alberta Level&#x000a0;II NICUs is a dynamic, psycho-educational intervention with three main components: (1) information sharing (during one-to-one relational communications and bedside rounds), (2) parent education (one-to-one and group sessions) supported by technology and defined learning pathways, and (3) parental support from professionals (formal) and veteran parents (informal). Veteran parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] are those who have had previous experience with their own moderate or late preterm infant in a Level&#x000a0;II NICU. The goal of FICare is a change in culture and practice that permits, encourages, and supports parents in their parenting role while their infant is receiving care in a Level&#x000a0;II NICU. Underpinned by developmental neuroscience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], relational communications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and adult learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] theories, FICare empowers parents to sequentially build their knowledge, skill, and confidence so that they are well-prepared to care for their infant long before discharge. This model is dynamic whereby parents and HCP use relational communication skills to negotiate mutually equitable roles during the infant&#x02019;s NICU stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Thus, roles change dynamically with the infants&#x02019; progress and as parents learn to provide care. For example, at admission nurses may provide 90% of the infant&#x02019;s care and parents provide 10%; nearer to the time of discharge, parents provide 90% of the care and nurses provides 10%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Standard care control group</title><p id="Par27">Mothers and their infant(s) in the control group will continue to receive standard care. Because this is a pragmatic trial conducted in a progressive and dynamic health system, we will carefully track any changes to policy and practice that may influence outcomes of the FICare study. For example, a secondary outcome of this study is related to frequency of administering incorrect human donor-milk. To reduce donor-milk errors, AHS recently implemented a bar-coding system in several NICUs, including two control and one intervention clusters. We recorded the dates of training and implementation for bar coding and will consider the new procedure when interpreting the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Contamination of intervention</title><p id="Par28">There are three Level&#x000a0;II NICUs in each of the two larger cities, and at least one of the hospitals in each city was randomized to the FICare intervention group. Thus, there is a risk of contamination in the larger cities because casual and part-time nurses and physicians may work at more than one site. We will include nurses in FICare training based on the primary site of their employment. We will ask administrators and HCP in the FICare group not to discuss the study outcomes with colleagues in the standard care group. We will tell families of infants the purpose of the study (to compare different models of care) and requirements to participate, but not give details about FICare.

Given the desire to have the randomization stratified to ensure balance of standard of care (control) or intervention (FICare) in each stratum, we conducted a simple random sampling within stratum. Given the small sample size in each stratum (four small and six large centers), there was no possibility of creating random-sized blocks to try to do a better allocation concealment or to be able to reduce predictability. Each study group has an equal number of small and large clusters. Group allocation was unknown to any other team member prior to an announcement to provincial stakeholders by LP-D during a telehealth meeting.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par30">The FICare intervention cannot be blinded; therefore, group allocation cannot be concealed.

<italic>Economic evaluation</italic>: the economic evaluation will compare direct and indirect costs between the FICare and standard care groups. Direct cost refers to health system costs: nursing time, clinical supplies, medications, hospitalizations, and physician visits additional to the recommended pediatric health surveillance visits in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The average hospital LOS for infants admitted to a Level&#x000a0;II NICU in Alberta is 16&#x000a0;days, with an average per diem cost of $788 CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In 2014, it cost Alberta approximately $43,459,776 CAD (3447 infants&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;$788 per day&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16&#x000a0;days) to provide Level&#x000a0;II NICU care for moderate and late preterm infants. If FICare can reduce the hospital LOS by 10% (1.6&#x000a0;days), this would reduce costs to $39,113,798&#x000a0;CAD, which would be a cost saving of $4,345,978 CAD per year. This cost saving does not include hospital readmissions, emergency department, or physician visits additional to the recommended health surveillance visits (data for estimations not available at the time of grant submission). While direct healthcare system costs are of key importance to the health system, the indirect (out-of-pocket) costs of preterm birth have an impact on parents and other siblings in the family. For example, parents must pay out-of-pocket for parking, transportation, household support, and childcare for siblings while the infant is in hospital. In addition to time lost from work, parents may need to travel long distances to be near their hospitalized infant(s), and pay for food and accommodation. We will continue to capture direct healthcare system costs (e.g., hospital readmissions, emergency department visits) until the 2-month CA follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data collection, management, and analysis</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par41">We define the primary outcome (LOS) as the time in days from birth (admission) to discharge.

In theory, an ordinary least-squares model produces unbiased estimates even if the data are skewed; however, different estimation methods (e.g., generalized linear models) and different uncertainty methods (e.g., non-parametric bootstrapping) will facilitate careful investigation of the impact various assumptions have on our conclusions. We will conduct a separate regression analysis for each perspective (public payer and society). In addition, we will use a net benefit regression framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] to compare the cost and effect of the FICare model against the standard of care with effect being the LOS after birth. This analysis would produce an incremental net benefit of the FICare model when compared to the standard of care at various willingness-to-pay values. Findings from the economic analysis of the FICare model may assist decision- and policy-makers in the delivery of health services to this important and specific population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data monitoring</title><p id="Par50">We did not establish stopping guidelines or a data monitoring committee for this trial because FICare will be the standard of care at intervention sites, and is expected to enhance existing care, not cause harm. In addition, we did not power the study for interim analysis of the primary outcome.</p><p id="Par51">Clinically, investigators have a professional responsibility to provide referrals for mothers who score at risk for postnatal depression (i.e., scored 13 or greater on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), or rated item #10 as 1,&#x000a0;2 or 3 points to indicate suicidal ideation). We check the database several times per week for EPDS scores in the clinical range. If a mother scores in the clinical range, the first author (KB) or a research associate with counseling psychology training will contact the study nurse if the infant is still in the NICU, or contact the mother at home if the infant(s) has/have been discharged. The contacts will include a brief explanation of the meaning of the EPDS score, and referral using the relevant path for the mother in hospital (typically, referred to social worker) or community (typically, referred to public health or family physician) for second-level screening, assessment and treatment, as appropriate. Similarly, for infants who screen at risk for developmental delay, we will contact mothers with a brief explanation and inquiry about how the infant is doing.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">Our proposed pragmatic cRCT assesses an adapted version of FICare that will be implemented with moderate and late preterm infants admitted to Level&#x000a0;II NICUs in Alberta. The results will inform policy decisions by providing evidence about the clinical effectiveness and costs of FICare. To accomplish knowledge translation (KT) goals, we will use both integrated and end-of-grant KT strategies. Integrated KT strategies require the inclusion of clinical and administrative leaders in the development and implementation of the intervention and the study. We will focus on strategies to embed components of FICare into existing structures and processes. For example, for the FICare nurses, we will identify aspects of the study that can be used to demonstrate learning to maintain annual nursing licensure. We will provide enhanced education sessions at intervention sites to ensure that changes in staff and competing priorities do not interfere with study implementation. We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] to thoughtfully consider the barriers and facilitators that are unique to each intervention site. This work will enable our team to create a more fulsome user&#x02019;s manual to support scale and broad implementation, should FICare prove to be effective. Our final integrated KT strategies focus on the inclusion of policy decision-makers in our large team meetings where we seek advice and guidance about the current initiatives in the healthcare system and alignment of our results with current directions. As the results from the study emerge, we will carefully observe for synergistic effects of FICare with other initiatives, as well as spin-offs such as proposals to adapt and implement FICare component in other populations and settings. Finally, our end-of-grant KT will include traditional strategies such as manuscripts and conference presentations. Requirements for authorship are outlined in our approved FICare Team Handbook, and follow the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines. Given the interest in the FICare study, and engagement with policy decision-makers at multiple levels in the healthcare system, we have already been invited to share the progress of our study with key stakeholder groups at provincial and national meetings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par53">On the date of manuscript submission, 352/659 mother/infant dyads were enrolled in the trial.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par61">
