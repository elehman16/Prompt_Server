The complexity of balance control mechanisms, the lack of medical expertise, and the absence of specialised equipment contribute to the delayed or incorrect diagnosis and management ofthese patients. Advances in computer science have allowed the development of computer systems that support clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions based on individualised patient data. The aim of the EMBalance decision support system (DSS) is to support doctors facing this clinical challenge, to make a definitive diagnosis and implement an effective management plan. The EMBalance study will determine the accuracy of this supportive tool when used by non-specialist doctors. This study is funded by the European Union&#x02019;s Seventh Framework Programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>EMBalance is a proof-of-concept study designed as a non-commercial, international, multi-centre, single-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial to be carried out at four clinical sites in the United Kingdom, Germany, Greece and Belgium. The study is comprised of three stages: internal pilot, phase I (diagnosis) and stage II (management). For this purpose, 200 patients presenting with persistent dizziness (&#x0003e;3 months&#x02019; duration) to primary care services will be randomised to either the intervention group (diagnostic assessment with the DSS) or a control group (diagnostic assessment without the DSS). Patients allocated to the intervention group will be assessed by a doctor with the support of the EMBalance DSS, while patients allocated to the control group will receive a visit as per standard practice. Ultimately, all patients&#x02019; diagnoses and management plans will be certified by a consultant in neuro-otology.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>EMBalance is the first trial to test the accuracy of a DSS in both the diagnosis of and the management plan for vestibular disorders across the healthcare systems of four different countries. The EMBalance study is the result of a combined effort of engineers and physicians to develop an accurate tool to support non-specialist doctors, with no risk for the patient. This trial will provide reliable information about the benefits of implementing DSSs in primary care while supporting the feasibility of testing the EMBalance algorithms in further research.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02704819">NCT02704819</ext-link>.

Balance depends on integration of vestibular, vision and proprioceptive sensory input within the central nervous system and generation of appropriate motor and other responses that support stance, locomotion and orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dizziness and imbalance symptoms are amongst the most common reasons for visits to a doctor and affect up to 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% of the population by 60&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Healthcare service provision to address vestibular disorders remains inadequate and is regarded as a low priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Non-specialist physicians may feel overwhelmed when faced with a patient complaining of &#x02018;dizziness&#x02019;, owing to the vagueness of this symptom and the plethora of underlying pathologies. Narrowing the symptom to the causative system (e.g., cardiovascular, neurological, otological) or as being iatrogenic (e.g., a drug-related adverse reaction) is a challenging process. Unsurprisingly, in both the United States and the United Kingdom, patients require an average of 4.5 visits with their healthcare providers before receiving a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The complexity of balance control mechanisms, the lack of medical expertise, and the absence of specialised equipment can be contributory factors to this late diagnosis and the resulting mismanagement of patients with balance disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This has a considerable socio-economic impact on the affected individual and the individual&#x02019;s family and exerts a high burden on society and the health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Misdiagnosis and mismanagement lead to increased personal burden on the patient and a wide-scale burden on health economics and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Advances in computer science and artificial intelligence have allowed the development of computer systems that support clinical diagnosis or therapeutic and treatment decisions based on individualised patient data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Decision support systems (DSSs) in particular are aimed at codifying and strategically managing biomedical knowledge to handle clinical challenges using mathematical modelling tools, medical data-processing techniques, and artificial intelligence methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, a review of existing DSSs used in medicine demonstrated that there are but few successful integrated software systems or stand-alone tools which address the early diagnosis and effective management of balance disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Current DSSs mainly target diagnosis, but none provide management and/or rehabilitation support. There is also limited information in the time domain (follow-up visits) and very limited literature on detailed balance-related models, while there are no vestibular models currently integrated into a DSS or used in clinical practice, and no patient-specific models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>EMBalance is a European project funded by the European Union&#x02019;s Seventh Framework Programme for Research. Its aim is to develop a DSS to support clinical decision-making, facilitate accurate diagnosis and advise on efficient treatment of balance disorders. The final outcome of the EMBalance project will be an Internet-based platform provided to primary and secondary care physicians across specialties, all levels of training, and with no geographical boundaries, with the objectives of early diagnostic evaluation and effective management of balance disorders.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The EMBalance decision support system</title><p>The EMBalance DSS is a multilanguage platform that consists of three modules: the database, the back end and the graphical user interface (GUI):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The database of the system is the implementation of the repository.

MySQL Workbench was also used for the administration of the repository. In total, the EMBalance repository is composed of 48 entities, including instance tables (actual clinical data collected from 1100 patients&#x02019; records), and type tables, which are the values used to populate an attribute of the instance tables (e.g., patient occupation).

However, 200 participants should provide sufficient power for the analysis. Participants will be equally distributed in the 4 countries; that is, 50 patients will be recruited in each country. Regarding physicians, each country site will collaborate with 2 overseeing experts and 10&#x02013;15 non-specialist doctors. The number of patients recruited per centre will be determined by the number of non-specialist doctors available at each site. This is because non-specialist doctors are expected to learn from the EMBalance DSS, as the system will guide the doctors through the diagnostic procedures with access to supportive learning material, such as video tutorials on diagnostic manoeuvres. To minimise the contamination effect that this might have on non-specialist doctors&#x02019; decisions, each clinician will be expected to see a maximum of six patients.</p><p>Competitive enrolment programs will not be implemented. This decision was adopted in accordance with recent evidence which suggests that competitive enrolment practices have not proved a significant effect in study recruitment, while posing ethical dilemmas and compromising the study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>The recruitment strategy was adjusted to the characteristics of each participating centre. Potential participants will be identified when they contact the research clinic. The staff member who serves as the point of contact will ask the patient whether he or she experiences dizziness or vertigo. A patient who confirms these symptoms will receive a study information leaflet to consider participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Randomisation sequences have been created for each centre using Research Randomizer v4.0 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Eligible patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio (100 participants in each group). In accordance with the random allocation sequence, a note containing the allocation group will be placed inside an opaque, sealed envelope which will be given to the non-specialist doctor at the time of recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Allocation concealment</title><p>The allocation sequence will be concealed from the researcher by enrolment of participants via sequentially numbered envelopes. Additionally, a patient identification trial number will be assigned to each envelope, which will permit retrospective monitoring of patient allocation. The research nurse will be instructed to strictly follow this sequence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Blinding</title><p>The EMBalance trial is a single-blind study. The clinical research nurse responsible for patient recruitment and overseeing experts will be blinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data collection</title><p>Non-specialist doctors and patients will enter the data in bespoke case report forms (CRFs) in paper format, and the CRF data will be transferred into a purpose-built electronic database. CRFs were designed and will be completed with reference to the Joint Unit Guide for the Design, Use and Completion of Paper Case Report Forms. The completion of CRFs will be signed off by the chief investigator (CI) or a delegated authorised individual. A blank hard copy of the CRF was submitted for review by the REC and the sponsor. A copy is also included within the trial master file.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis will be performed using SPSS version 16.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and the StatXact statistical software package (Cytel, Cambridge, MA, USA). Statistical significance will be set to 0.05. Descriptive statistics will be calculated and presented. Comparisons which will be made include the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Proportion of correct diagnosis by specialists to non-specialists and treatments with and without DSS use according to the overseeing expert&#x02019;s diagnosis and treatment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comparison of the number of laboratory investigations prescribed with and without DSS use</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comparison of the number of investigation referrals with and without DSS use</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comparisons of improvement according to the patient at baseline and after 3&#x000a0;months of follow-up, based on the following tool scores: Dizziness Handicap Inventory, EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L Questionnaire, visual analogue scale scores before and after treatment in the DSS vs. non-DSS user groups</p></list-item></list></p><p>For categorical values (e.g., referral rate), the chi-square test will be used for comparisons between groups. The Bonferroni correction will be used in cases of multiple comparisons. Normality will be tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If normality is met, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test will be used. If not, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test will be used instead. For comparisons before and after treatment, a paired <italic>t</italic> test will be used regarding numeric data (e.g., questionnaire scores) after normality testing.</p><p>Because of the close monitoring of all study participants, the proportion of missing data is not expected to be substantial. In the unlikely event that more than 10&#x000a0;% of values corresponding to primary outcome measures are missing, recruitment will be extended to collect additional data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Monitoring and auditing</title><p>Adherence to the protocol, procedures for reporting adverse events, and adequate data quality will be supervised by the sponsor. In addition, a trial steering committee composed of independent experts was established for examining legal, ethical and data protection as well as privacy and security issues related to the research activities during the whole project life cycle. The CI will inform the sponsor should she have concerns that arise from monitoring activities and/or if there are problems with oversight and/or monitoring procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>Patient anonymity is protected and maintained by using a unique identification trial number. No personal data will be collected as part of the study, although sensitive information such as ethnicity and physical condition could be collected. Participants will be informed about the transfer of this information to the study office and will be asked to consent to this. At all research sites, staff share the same duty of care to prevent unauthorised disclosure of personal information. All personal information obtained for the trial will be held securely, treated as strictly confidential and managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, the NHS Caldicott guardian, the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, and REC approval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Archiving</title><p>During the course of the study, all records are the responsibility of the CI and will be kept in secure conditions. When the trial is complete, the CI will confirm that the study master file will be archived for 20&#x000a0;years, as stipulated in line with all relevant legal and statutory requirements. For this purpose, the master file will be transferred to an approved long-term repository.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The EMBalance project combines the efforts of experts from the fields of bioengineering and medicine to create a tool to support non-specialist doctors in their decision-making. The EMBalance DSS was developed to aid healthcare professionals in primary care while enabling clinicians to undertake the final decision about the management and treatment of the patient. The design of this protocol has been a challenge for the authors due to the need to conceive of a harmonised protocol suitable for all clinical settings (e.g., composition of a non-specialist doctors group). The present document establishes the key requisites to obtain a unified set of data from all participating countries while taking into account the potential benefits derived from both doctors&#x02019; and patients&#x02019; participation.</p><p>From the patient&#x02019;s perspective, the use of the EMBalance platform is a minimally invasive intervention which is accompanied by multiple advantages: (1) better and earlier diagnosis and treatment for the balance disorder, (2) review of the participant&#x02019;s case by a renowned expert and (3) improvement of the patient&#x02019;s quality of life. Despite the support of the EMBalance DSS, however, non-specialist doctors are asked to exercise their clinical judgement, which ultimately will be compared with an expert&#x02019;s opinion. Although at first glance this could negatively affect doctors&#x02019; willingness to participate in the trial, it will benefit their participation by providing guidance for the diagnostic procedure of the &#x02018;dizzy&#x02019; patient, access to supporting learning material, and a unique chance to receive feedback from national and international experts in neuro-otology.</p><p>The use of a computer-aided system has been shown to create some disruption of the patient-doctor relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The design of the DSS interface, ease in entering patient data and increased appointment time given to consultation are some preliminary measures taken to reduce this limitation and patient discomfort. Furthermore, a special section in the users&#x02019; manual is dedicated to informing users regarding this issue and suggesting ways to reduce this risk. The latter includes increasing the efficiency of entering data, keeping within the time constraints of the consultation and maintaining eye contact to promote a good patient-doctor relationship, and further emphasis is placed on the DSS as an auxiliary tool and not a requirement. In the same line, the EMBalance DSS has been reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which determined that, in its current state, the EMBalance DSS does not meet the definition of a medical device defined within Article 1 of Directive 93/42/EEC. This verdict was based on the fact that the EMBalance DSS is a supportive tool and is not intended to be a substitute for the clinician&#x02019;s decision-making capacity.</p><p>The EMBalance trial has been designed to gather, and will be conducted with the ultimate aim of obtaining, further evidence on the development of a DSS that will lead to lower socio-economic costs and foster equality of access to high-quality services for diagnosis and management of vestibular disorders. This proof-of-concept study will determine the feasibility of implementing the EMBalance platform in primary care settings across Europe and will provide a realistic prospect of the accuracy of this innovative tool in addressing the early diagnosis and effective management of balance dysfunctions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started in March 2016, and it is expected to continue until September 2016.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec28"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1568_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT checklist.
