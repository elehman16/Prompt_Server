Randomization was performed at the unit level. Participants were recruited between November 2014 and July 2016. All patients admitted to both units were screened by a senior rehabilitation physical therapist. Potential participants were included if they had reduced mobility post-hemorrhagic or infarct stroke of recent onset (less than six months), with a clinician-assessed capacity for improvement in mobility. Participants of any level of mobility were included. These potential participants were excluded if they had either severe receptive or expressive dysphasia which impacted their ability to communicate with the research staff or provide consent, marked cognitive impairment as determined by the screening clinician and the ability to follow two step commands, medical condition that precluded exercise, a severe visual impairment, or an anticipated length of stay of less than five days. All participants provided written informed consent. Ethical approval for this study was received from the Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H0013769). This trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Network (ACTRN12614000427673) and the protocol of this trial has been published.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>All participants attended two measurement sessions: one on entry into the study (baseline and prior to randomization) and one after the 8-week period (post-test) or immediately prior to discharge if discharged before eight weeks. The assessors were physical therapists blinded to group allocation at both time points. Allocation into iMCR intervention or control group used a computer-generated random number schedule with variable block sizes of two to six. The randomization sequence was generated by a researcher not involved in recruitment or assessment. Group allocation was concealed using consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelopes, opened after completion of baseline assessment in the presence of the participant.</p><p>The primary outcome of standing balance was assessed by observing participants&#x02019; ability to reach forward with the less affected arm using the Functional Reach Test.

A mix of upper limb function, balance, and gait measures were used as secondary outcomes. The Upper Arm Function component of the Modified Motor Assessment Scale was used to reliably measure progression of proximal arm strength<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and gross uni-manual dexterity was assessed using the timed Box and Block test.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Both are valid measures in the stroke population.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The ability to maintain a static sitting position unsupported was assessed using the four-point rating scale and the Sitting Balance Test.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Dynamic standing balance ability of side to side reach was measured using the Lateral Reach Test<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> to both sides.

Both groups received individually prescribed physical therapy targeting functional outcomes on a daily basis. For the control group, the second session, participants received individualized prescription of repetitive exercises (functional retraining, strength, balance, and endurance). Each participant worked through the exercises at their own pace with guidance and supervision for the more challenging exercises as required. Exercises were performed in both seated and standing positions. These were delivered in group sessions on unit A (short stay rehabilitation unit) or by individual session with a rehabilitation assistant on unit B (longer stay rehabilitation unit) for up to 1&#x02009;hour per day on weekdays, depending on the endurance of the participant. The intention was to dose match the iMCR intervention and the control groups. For the iMCR intervention arm, the second session consisted of an individualized prescription of repetitive exercises using software from the Jintronix Rehabilitation System&#x02122; (JRS WAVE) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jintronix.com/">http://www.jintronix.com/</ext-link>). These game-based activities aimed to enhance standing and sitting balance, functional retraining, upper and lower limb strength, and endurance, as relevant to each client and were based on their clinical assessments. The iMCR intervention, lasting up to 1&#x02009;hour in duration on weekdays, was dependent upon the endurance of the participant. Specifically, the iMCR intervention included arm activities targeting the more affected side and bilateral arm tasks to bring both hands to the midline, sitting and standing tasks that move the center of mass over the base of support and toward the limits of stability, and seated and standing leg activities to promote directional stepping and gait. Assistance was available to participants during balance-challenging activities.</p><p>The iMCR intervention replaced either the group sessions on one unit (unit A) or individual therapy supervised by rehabilitation assistants on the second unit (unit B). Each participant worked through their program at their own pace, using gestures with their less affected side to progress through the pre-set program with spotting or supervision as required to ensure safety. Functional and repetitive exercise programs for all study participants were reviewed daily in order to optimize rehabilitation potential.</p></sec><sec id="section11-0269215517720790"><title>Analysis</title><p>A priori sample size calculation was based upon previously published data on the Functional Reach outcome measures (baseline mean (standard deviation) data of 25.6 (7.4)&#x02009;cm).<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> A clinically relevant between-group difference of 3.7&#x02009;cm required a sample size of 63 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, power 80%).

Clinically meaningful improvements in standing balance across both groups were not accompanied by improvements in usual and fast walking velocity. Across the two units, where the iMCR intervention was delivered by a physical therapist in one unit and a rehabilitation assistant on the other unit, no differences in functional outcomes between the two delivery modes were observed.</p><p>While this study was powered to detect differences between the iMCR and control groups and found none, we cannot assume that improvements of similar magnitude across both groups indicate exact equivalence. While improvements of similar values for the primary functional outcome were observed, there were large, although non-significant, differences in these values at baseline. These differences provide additional impetus to suggest that replication in a larger study is required. This study provides valuable data for calculating the sample size for such a study in a similar population.</p><p>The frequency and duration of the iMCR intervention and control groups were designed to be dose-matched and pragmatic, reflecting research in practice, with the dose set between 8 and 40 sessions. The mean number of sessions was quite low (14), reflecting the current reality of short duration hospital stays due to planned early discharge. The low number of actual sessions may be another reason why between-group differences were not seen in this study. A larger dose over a longer intervention period may potentially produce a different result. Future research aimed at novel iMCR interventions in subacute rehabilitation should address the issue of short stays in care and include investigation of continuation of rehabilitation at home.</p><p>While the delivery of an iMCR intervention in a subacute inpatient setting is novel, this setting and population may be further reasons for the lack of between-group differences reported in this study. In the subacute setting, there is a large degree of variability in the functional level of participants at study entry, as evidenced by the range of SD values recorded in this study. This impacts the ability to determine between-group differences. As well, the natural recovery of participants at this short time period following stroke may further hamper detection of these differences.</p><p>This study demonstrates rehabilitation assistants can supervise established iMCR programs which are monitored and progressively modified as required by a physical therapist. As monitoring and progression can be done remotely, there is potential to meet the needs of clients in rural or remote sites, who may not have access to a full-time physical therapist. The cost-effectiveness of this model of rehabilitation delivery is worth investigating, especially as this potentially adds another therapy option for people undergoing rehabilitation.</p><p>Technology can be used to engage clients in specific, targeted practice in rehabilitation. The visual feedback from the screen provides encouragement to improve movement quality and performance; this biofeedback is identified as helping to induce neuroplasticity.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> As repetitions of part practice or functional tasks are the focus of subacute rehabilitation, clients interacting with technology can become engaged in the activity, thereby promoting higher levels of active participation,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0269215517720790" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> concentration, and repetitions while being less aware of the number of repetitions already completed. As well, using gestures from the non-affected side to control the pace of their exercise program may encourage more independence within a therapy session. Future research is needed to guide clinicians in identifying the types of clients that prefer and benefit most from using this technology in rehabilitation.</p><p>There are some limitations. In the subacute setting, participants had a wide range of capabilities at entry to the study. This influences the ability to find statistical significance between the groups in the results as the variability was larger than the data the sample size calculation was based on. The sample size then was not adequate to detect inferiority in either arm and subsequently provides a need for replication with a much larger group. The lack of any long-term follow-up prevents us from determining if one or other arm of this trial is more effective. Some improvements in function, that is, changes in gait aids used for clinical walking tests, have not been captured in these results.</p><p>Interactive, motion capture-based rehabilitation for mobility-limited people with stroke in subacute rehabilitation produced improvements in functional outcomes that were not superior to usual stroke rehabilitation. Clients can perform targeted functional activities designed by physical therapist using iMCR but supervised by rehabilitation assistants, using gesture control to set the pace of their exercise program. This has implications for service delivery, expanding the effective interventions delivered under the supervision of physical therapists or rehabilitation assistants. Replication of this study, with a long-term intervention providing a home-based component and follow-up, is recommended to determine whether technology-assisted rehabilitation produces sustained improvements in functional outcomes and engages clients to participate actively and independently in their rehabilitation.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215517720790" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical Messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-0269215517720790"><list-item><p>Interactive motion capture-based rehabilitation can be delivered by physical therapists and rehabilitation assistants.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study found the clinical change associated with it was similar to and not superior to the change associated with routine care.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this study was provided by the National Stroke Foundation, Australia.
