Although most physical symptoms can be managed by medication, psychosocial stressors may complicate survival and hamper quality of life. Mindfulness and Qigong, two kinds of mind-body exercise rooted in Eastern health philosophy, has been found effective in symptoms management, improving mental health, and reducing stress. With these potential benefits, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is planned to investigate the comparative effectiveness of mindfulness and Baduanjin intervention on the bio-psychosocial wellbeing of people with colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/ design</title><p id="Par2">A 3-arm RCT with waitlist control design will be used in this study. One hundred eighty-nine participants will be randomized into (i) Mindfulness, (ii) Baduanjin, or (iii) waitlist control groups.

Although most physical symptoms can be managed by medication, psychosocial stressors may complicate survival and hamper quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. People with colorectal cancer, especially those with colostomy, often experience psychosocial distresses such as depression, fear of relapse, altered self-image, and loss of social functioning and connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent study proposed reciprocity between physical symptoms and psychosocial stresses in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Studies in psycho-immunology have suggested that many cancer patients also have depressive symptoms and experience sleep disturbance, the latter of which can be a risk factor for depression and disease progression among cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, a survival study highlighted the connection between survival and depression, anxiety, and quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given the potential effects of psychosocial well-being on colorectal cancer survivorship, there is a need for psychosocial support that targets the reciprocal mind-body relationship in these patients.</p><p id="Par6">The past two decades have witnessed the proliferation of rigorous empirical testing of cancer-related psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapies, psycho-educational interventions, social support groups, and mindfulness-based programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Mind-body practices, such as relaxation training, meditation, qigong (also known as Chi-Gong), yoga, taiji (also known as tai chi), and biofeedback have been found to improve functioning; reduce treatment-related nausea, vomiting, and physical pain; and improve mood and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Mindfulness and qigong practice in particular have become increasingly popular because they are coupled with marked evidence pertaining to safety, feasibility, and effectiveness on various aspects of health in cancer patients.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mindfulness and qigong as mind-body practices for cancer</title><p id="Par7">The practice of mindfulness focuses on the development of awareness of emotions and sensations, the nurturing of a nonjudgmental mindset, and self-acceptance through practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The here-and-now orientation of mindfulness has been found to be effective in moderating cancer-related stressors, such as attribution of cancer, regrets about past life decisions, suffering of pain, loss, and grief regarding one&#x02019;s own impending death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial, the participants in the mindful meditation-based program resulted in less mood disturbance, tension, stress, and depressive symptoms and improved sleep and gastrointestinal symptoms after the intervention and at the 6-month follow-up visit, when compared with the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Mindfulness meditation was also found to be effective in altering cortisol and immune patterns consistent with lower stress with sustainable effects at the 1-year follow-up visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Local studies on the application of mindfulness in a cancer population are rare, but the results of studies on the effects of mindfulness on chronic pain, psychiatric symptoms, and functioning are promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Similar to mindfulness practice in its emphasis on practicing breath-centering techniques and developing awareness of emotions and sensations, qigong is a mild form of muscular activity accompanied by introspective and proprioceptive focus and an awareness of the flow of intrinsic energy, which is essential in the pursuit of health and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Of all types of qigong practices, Baduanjin is the most popular. The practice of Baduanjin comprises eight movements and requires relatively little cognitive and physical effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which makes it a popular form of exercise for people who are physically weak, including older adults and cancer patients during rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In support of its positive effects in cancer patients, a systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials concluded that the practice of qigong improves cancer-specific quality of life, fatigue, and immune functioning; alters cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; and alleviates sleep disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which is also a common issue among cancer patients.</p><p id="Par9">Although they share the common components of breath-centering practice, mindfulness and qigong represent two very distinct approaches to mind-body practices. Mindfulness meditation is a technique used to cultivate the mind&#x02019;s ability to influence bodily functions and symptoms by means of focused-awareness training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], whereas qigong capitalizes on movement and attention to foster the mind-body connection via the physical body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The foregoing review suggests how most studies on mindfulness and qigong have examined their effects independently, which calls for comparative intervention research to elucidate how such similar, yet contrasting, approaches to mind-body practices compare in terms of their psychosocial and physiological benefits and patient compliance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Diurnal Cortisol rhythm and cancer</title><p id="Par10">There is a physio-psychological basis for the prognosis of colorectal cancer.

Understanding the changes in cortisol profiles after mindfulness and qigong practices can further elucidate the link between mind-body practices and patients&#x02019; total well-being.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par11">To explore the comparative effectiveness of mindfulness meditation and Baduanjin qigong practice, this study will adopt a three-armed randomized-controlled study design with two experimental groups and a waitlist control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Research objectives and study hypotheses</title><p id="Par12">The first main objective of this study is to independently examine the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation and Baduanjin qigong in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer compared with controls regarding cancer-related symptoms and symptom distress, mental health, quality of life, biomarkers, and mindfulness level.

Traditional analytic techniques such as analysis of variance adopt traditional deletion or substitution methods and may not yield precise estimates in the presence of missing data. Latent growth modeling flexibly analyzes the overall population trajectories using nonlinear modeling such as quadratic growth and the between-person variation in outcome variables, thus allowing analysis of all available data via full information maximum likelihood under missing-at-random assumption. This matches the standard intent-to-treat analytic approach of clinical trials with missing data. The level of statistical significance (p) will be set at 0.05, and <italic>p</italic> values greater than 0.05 but less than 0.10 will be considered to indicate marginal significance.

Cortisol levels will be determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Salimetrics, Inc.) in the HKU Clinical Oncology Lab. The assay sensitivity is 0.193&#x000a0;nmol/l, and the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation are 3 and 10%, respectively. Due to the skewed distribution of salivary cortisol data, a natural logarithm will be used to transform the raw cortisol data to yield an unskewed distribution for analysis. The mean of the five daily cortisol levels will be used, and the total cortisol level will be measured by the area under the curve. To explore the individual trajectories of changes in the cortisol level over time and the complex relationships between different variables, a two-level individual growth curve model using Mplus software will be adopted as cortisol measures at five daily time points are nested within participants. This method is a variant of multiple regression modeling that is appropriate for the nested structure of our data.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par45">Despite the growing family of mind-body practices, few studies juxtaposed their differential outcomes, magnitude and pace of change and post-intervention compliance. Therefore, using a comparative randomized-controlled trial, this study is set out to further establish mind-body practices in psychosocial oncology by exploring the contrasting approaches with which qigong and mindfulness meditation exert their influences. This study will measure both physiological and psychological outcomes which offer a comprehensive understanding on the mental and bodily changes before, during, after each approach and their maintenance. Examining the effects of mind-body practices on circadian cortisol rhythm may shed light on the homeostatic effect of mind-body practices on the dysregulation of the HPA system. Better understanding on culturally popular interventions, in particular, the common and unique effectiveness of different approaches are crucial, as patients and qualified healthcare professionals can select or provide practices which will produce maximum benefits, satisfaction, adherence, and sustainability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the volunteer teachers of Li Fai Centre of Tai Chi for their provision of support for this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par46">This study is funded by the General Research Fund, Research Grants Council (GRF/ HKU 17611615).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par47">Not applicable.
