In a simple classification, ventilation modes are divided into volume control, pressure control or both.</p><p>Recently, many changes have been occurred in treating patients under intensive care, such as providing new methods of anesthesia as well as special techniques of ventilation (respiration modes suited for rapid weaning); these methods have, in a way, affected intubation time, reduced the length of stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and also reduced complications as well as costs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In the last decade, ventilation time has been the subject of discussion in papers and scientific communities, so that early extubation is an already ordinary phenomenon in various surgeries such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is natural that negative impacts can be effectively decreased by reducing the time needed for mechanical ventilation. In a study on the effects of early extubation on cardiopulmonary function have found that increase in the left ventricular filling, improvement of ventricular function and consequently increase in cardiac output are the positive results of early extubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the other hand, this procedure has some positive effects on the respiratory system, including reducing the risk of nosocomial pneumonia and damage to lung tissue. The advances in patients&#x02019; comfort, reduction of complications, ease of control and treating patients and saving costs, patients&#x02019; discharge from hospital and ease of doing activities, which prevents many complications of physical inactivity, are among those advantages which Peterson <italic>et al</italic>. have accounted.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition to clinical benefits, one should not ignore economical benefits of early extubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Yet, extubation techniques, the type and mode of equipment and variables related to personnel and physician are probably involved in this issue.</p><p>Despite the benefits of early extubation, in many surgical centers of Iran, while patients have access to clinical criteria for extubation, they remain under mechanical ventilation for a many hours without the need for ventilator. Thus, it seems that determining some variables related to extubation time as well as choosing a useful method of ventilation, effectively help patients in ICU with open heart surgery.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Now, there are two different methods of extubation including synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and adaptive support ventilation (ASV). ASV is a new method which is recommended due to its simplicity. This method has been examined in several studies; however, the number of its use in CABG is limited, in which the time of extubation has been reported to be in different ranges, however, it has been mostly noted that this method expedites the extubation time. ASV is a control mode ventilation that is a closed loop, and it is regulated by ASV of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation (mv) as well as respiratory activities of the patient.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Changes in respiratory conditions increases or decreases the level of pressure support without interference. Previous studies were conducted on the effects of ASV during anesthesia in thoracic and abdominal surgeries, in such a way that in a study on 27 medical patients with ventilation, ASV considerably reduced the time of ventilation with equipment, and led the patient toward weaning.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Although several studies have emphasized that whether ASV can be viewed as a preventative chronic state for after surgery patients, or those who are chronically under ventilation; there are concerns for the lack of synchronization of ventilators with patients due to the lack of knowledge about the underlying mechanism of respiratory distress, which can possibly worsen the patient's condition, and ASV should be evaluated in randomized controlled studies, so that its role in clinical operation become clear.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>ASV mode in ventilation separation in the diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and end-stage renal disease has not been done yet and setting 120% is not a known mode in Iran, so this study can be considered necessary in this field. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the differences in duration of the time needed for mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic changes and length of stay for recovery in ICUs using two methods of ASV: ASV mv: 110% and ASV mv: 120%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This is a single-blind clinical trial study which was approved by research office of medical school of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
