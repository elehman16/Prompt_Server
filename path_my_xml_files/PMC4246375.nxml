fluoride-containing restorative materials associated with fluoride gels, on root
dentin.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A randomized complete block design was used to test the effects of the restorative
systems, fluoride regimes and the interactions among them at different distances
from restoration margins. Standardized cavities were prepared on 240 bovine root
specimens and randomly assigned to 15 groups of treatments (n=16). Cavities were
filled with the following restorative materials: Ketac-Fil (3M-ESPE); Vitremer
(3M-ESPE); Dyract/Prime &#x00026; Bond NT (Dentsply); Charisma/Gluma One Bond (Heraeus
Kulzer) and the control, Z250/Single Bond (3M-ESPE). The specimens were subjected
to a pH-cycling model designed to simulate highcaries activity. During the cycles,
1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride, 2.0% neutral sodium fluoride or
deionized/distilled water (control) was applied to the specimens for 4 min. The
surface Knoop microhardness test was performed before (KHN<sub>i</sub>) and after
(KHN<sub>f</sub>) the pH cycles at 100, 200 and 300 mm from the margins. Dentin
microhardness loss was represented by the difference in initial and final values
(KHN<sub>i</sub> - KHN<sub>f</sub>). Data were analyzed by Friedman's and
Wilcoxon's tests, ANOVA and Tukey's test (&#x003b1;=5%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The interaction of restorative systems and topical treatments was not significant
(p=0.102). Dentin microhardness loss was lowest closer to the restoration.
Ketac-fil presented the highest cariostatic effect. Vitremer presented a moderate
effect, while Dyract and Charisma did not differ from the control, Z250. The
effects of neutral and acidulated fluoride gels were similar to each other and
higher than the control.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Conventional and resin-modified glass ionomer cements as well as neutral and

preventive interventions have all contributed towards a longer retention of natural
teeth in old age. Exposed root surfaces are common in adults and older populations,
generally due to gingival recession, which is associated with anatomical factors,
microbially induced periodontal diseases, surgical periodontal therapies, orthodontic
movement of the teeth and various forms of trauma<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Exposed dentin on root
surfaces becomes more susceptible to caries than enamel because of its low mineral
content and its higher critical pH for dissolution<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>Preventive management of primary root caries lesions has a better long-term prognosis
than restorative treatment. Monitoring noncavitated lesions and reinforcing prophylactic
programs must be always the choice for stopping caries progression<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, when the dental anatomy and function are involved, is
necessary to institute restorative treatments using materials with adequate strength,
esthetics, adhesive and cariostatic effects<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Secondary caries has been shown in studies worldwide to be the most common reason for
the replacement of all types of restorations, regardless of the material used<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Secondary caries occur mainly at the cervical margin of
restoration, where optimum hygiene conditions are difficult, and restorative techniques
are sensitive and complicated by the lack of an excellent adhesion to dentin<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>Conventional glass ionomer cements (GICs), resin-modified GICs (RMGICs) and
fluoride-releasing composite resins could be indicated for the restoration of root
caries cavities<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Previous studies have suggested that the release of
fluoride from a fluoride-containing material may prevent the formation of wall lesions
and prevent caries at the margins of restorations<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The
mechanisms involved in the anticariogenic effects of fluoride include the reduction of
demineralization, the enhancement of remineralization<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, the interference of pellicle and plaque formation and
the inhibition of microbial growth and metabolism<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated the synergic effect of restorative
materials in association with topical fluoride rinses or dentifrice to prevent caries
adjacent to the restorations<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Professional topical fluoride has been
widely used to control the activity of caries lesions. A fluoride therapy based on daily
use of fluoride gels during teeth-brushing has been suggested, especially for the
treatment of caries-active patients. This could add the benefit of a product with
anticariogenic abilities, to the low cost and short operational time of self-applied
procedures<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that there may be an
additional effect of fluoride at high concentrations on the loss of dentin microhardness
around fluoride-containing restorative materials. This <italic>in vitro</italic> study
compared the cariostatic effects of 5 restorative materials &#x02013; a conventional GIC, a
RMGIC, a polyacid-modified composite resin, a resin composite with fluoride, and a resin
composite without fluoride - associated with the use of neutral or acidulate fluoride
gels on artificial secondary caries on root dentin. This study investigated whether
there was any difference in dentin microhardness loss around fluoride-containing
restorative materials, associated with topical fluoride treatments, at different
distances from the restoration margins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Experimental Design</title><p>A randomized complete block design was used to evaluate the cariostatic effects of
fluoride-containing restorative materials associated with use of fluoride gels on
root dentin. Blocking was a strategy used to control the variability of the dentin
substrate. By using this design, the specimens formed a more homogeneous experimental
unit on which to compare the treatments<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. "Randomized complete" indicates that each block contains all of
the treatments, applied according the randomly determined order.</p><p>The factors studied were: restorative material at 5 levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>), topical treatments at 3 levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) and distance from the restoration margins at 3 levels
(100, 200 and 300 mm). The experimental units were 240 bovine root specimens randomly
assigned to 15 groups of treatments (n=16). Each block contained each one of all
possible combinations of 5 (restorative system) x 3 (fluoride regime) groups of
treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). The control group of
restorative system was a composite resin without fluoride (Z250, 3M ESPE Dental
Products, Sumar&#x000e9;, SP, Brazil). Control group of topical treatments was
distilled/deionized water. Acidulated fluoride gel, neutral fluoride gel and water
were applied to the restoration and adjacent dentin to test the associated effect of
restorative materials and gels.</p><table-wrap id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The restorative materials and topical treatments applied to the specimens</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Restorative system / Topical treatment</bold></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Manufacturer</bold></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Batch number</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ketac-Fil</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3M ESPE Dental Products</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Powder: 142152</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glass-ionomer cement</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Sumar&#x000e9;, SP, Brazil)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Liquid: 135132</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vitremer</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3M ESPE Dental Products</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Powder: 20011019</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Resin modified glass-ionomer</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Sumar&#x000e9;, SP, Brazil)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Liquid: 20011025</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primer: 20010928</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glaze: 20011031</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcdcde"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dyract-Prime &#x00026;

manner, according to each restorative material:</p><p>Ketac-Fil (3M ESPE): 10% polyacrylic acid was spread over the cavity for 10 s, rinsed
for 30 s, and gently air-dried for 5 s, avoiding desiccation. Ketac-Fil powder and
Ketac-Fil liquid were dispensed at 3.2:1 by weight, hand-mixed within 60 s, loaded
into a syringe (Centrix, DFL Ind. e Com. SA, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil), and
injected into the preparation. Then, the surface was covered with a polyester strip

extrude any excess. Seven minutes after the beginning of the mixture, the strip was
removed and a surface protector (Ketac Glaze, 3M ESPE) was immediately applied and
light-cured for 20 s.</p><p>Vitremer (3M ESPE): Vitremer primer was applied to the cavity preparation for 30 s,
air-dried for 15 s and light-cured for 20 s. Vitremer powder and Vitremer liquid were
dispensed at 2.5:1 by weight, hand-mixed within 45 s, loaded into a Centrix syringe,
and injected into the preparation. Then, the surface was covered with a polyester
strip and a glass slab and pressed with a weight of 1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 s
to extrude any excess. The restoration was light cured for 40 s, the strip was
removed and Vitremer finishing gloss was applied and light-cured for 20 s.</p><p>Dyract/Prime &#x00026; Bond NT (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE, USA): 35% phosphoric acid
was applied to the cavity for 15 s and rinsed for 30 s. Excess water was blotted
using absorbent paper. One coat of Prime &#x00026; Bond NT was applied to the cavity,
left undisturbed for 30 s, blown with air for 5 s, and light-cured for 10 s. Dyract

excess and light cured for 40 s.</p><p>Charisma/GLUMA One Bond (Heraeus Kulzer, Gonsennheumer, Mainz, Germany): 20%
phosphoric acid was applied to the cavity for 20 s and rinsed for 40 s. Excess water
was blotted using absorbent paper. Two consecutive coats of adhesive were applied,
gently air-dried for 5 s and light-cured for 20 s. The bonded cavity was bulk-filled
with Charisma, covered with a polyester strip and a glass slab and pressed with a
weight of 1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 s to extrude any excess. After removal of
the slab, the restoration was light-cured for 20 s.</p><p>Z250/Single Bond (3M ESPE): 35% phosphoric acid was applied to the cavity for 15 s

after blotting, 2 consecutive coats of adhesive were applied for 15 s with gentle
agitation using a fully saturated applicator. After removal of the solvent by brief
air-drying for 5 s, the adhesive was light-cured for 10 s. The bonded cavity was
bulk-filled with Z250, covered with a polyester strip and a glass slab and pressed
with a weight of 1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 s to extrude any excess. After
removal of the slab, the restoration was light-cured for 20 s.</p><p>The materials were light-cured using a halogen light-curing unit (XL300, 3M Dental

affect caries formation through a variety of mechanisms involving the reduction of
demineralization, the enhancement of remineralization, the interference of pellicle and
plaque formation and the inhibition of microbial growth and metabolism<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Fluoride release from restorative materials is related to their
matrices, setting mechanisms and fluoride content and depends on the environmental
conditions<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>After topical fluoride application (&#x0003e;100 ppm F), loosely bound fluoride or a calcium
fluoride-like material is formed. Depending on the pH of the plaque fluid, this
CaF<sub>2</sub> layer, which has a higher solubility than hydroxyapatite and
fluorapatite, will be dissolved, releasing fluoride to react with calcium and phosphate
ions. The products of these reactions may be fluorapatite crystals or CaF<sub>2</sub>
incorporated on tooth surface. This reservoir of fluoride ions is available to inhibit
demineralization and enhance remineralization<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this study, the differences on cariostatic effect could be attributed to the amount
of fluoride released from the restorative materials, as evaluated by dentin
microhardness loss at various distances from restoration margins. Although it was not
able to completely inhibit microhardness loss adjacent to the restoration, Ketac-Fil
exhibited the lowest loss due to its higher fluoride-releasing properties. GIC success
in reducing the production of caries-like lesions in the adjacent root surface
corroborates the results obtained by other <italic>in vitro</italic> studies<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Typical GICs
are materials comprised of a calcium fluoro-alumino-silicate glass powder and an aqueous
solution of a poly(acrylic acid-itaconic acid) copolymer containing tartaric
acid<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. It is well known that
the setting of these cements involves neutralization of the polyacid by the basic glass
and results in the formation of an ionically cross-linked polyacrylate matrix.
Initially, all of the fluoride is in the glass, but during the course of cement
formation, fluoride ions are released into the aqueous acid phase and become trapped in
the hardening gel matrix. Once the cement has set, the fluoride released may originate
from the remaining fluoride glass, the silica gel phase, the polysalt matrix or the pore
liquid in which fluoride is loosely bound and free to move<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, the erosion of GIC in an acidic environment
increases the release of fluoride, which induces the formation of an acid-resistant,
radiopaque, hypermineralized layer around the restorations<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>RMGICs consist substantially of GIC components (water-soluble polymeric acid,
ion-leachable glass and water) together with methacrylate monomers and their associated
initiation systems. These hybrid materials set partially by means of an acid-base
reaction and partially by means of a polymerization reaction that is initiated by
photochemical and/or chemical generation of free radicals. The action of 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (HEMA) as a cosolvent for organic and aqueous components affects the GIC
setting reaction because ions are reluctant to form in the organic medium. Additionally,
organic molecules are known to influence the conformation of the polyacrylic acid
molecule<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. RMGICs have the
potential to release fluoride in equivalent amounts to conventional cements, but this
capacity may be affected not only by the formation of complex fluoride compounds and
their interaction with polyacrylic acid, but also by the type and amount of resin used
for the photochemical polymerization reaction<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this study, under high cariogenic challenge, the ability of Vitremer to inhibit
artificial caries development was observed, as dentin microhardness loss was
statistically lower in this group than in the control along all distances. However,
Vitremer did not inhibit caries development as effectively as Ketac-Fil at 100 and 200
mm. The extent of the cariostatic effect provided by Ketac-Fil dropped at 300 mm and
became equivalent to Vitremer. Moreover, at 200 mm and 300 mm, Vitremer behaved in the
same way as Charisma and Dyract, in which fluoride release is expected to be low
compared to RMGICs. Hara, et al.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
(2002) demonstrated that the extent of cariostatic effects provided by conventional GICs
and RMGICs was estimated to be about 300 and 150 mm, respectively, in root dentin.</p><p>The polyacid-modified composite resin (Dyract) and the composite resin with fluoride
(Charisma) were shown to be ineffective in the inhibition of artificial caries lesions,
as both did not differ from the control group (Z250) at all the distances. These results
are in agreement with other <italic>in vitro</italic> studies<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Even though polyacid-modified composite
resins have no initial fluoride "burst" effect and release lower amounts of fluoride
than RMGICs, some cariostatic effect was expected for Dyract. This material does not
contain water in its formulation. With time, water must diffuse from the environment
toward the material before the process of glass dissolution and fluoride release can
begin<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The low concentration
of fluoride released by the ion-exchange mechanism and the short-term
de/remineralization regimen used in this study could explain why these materials were
not able to inhibit caries lesion progression around the restorations.</p><p>Obviously, in Charisma, a TEGDMA-Bis-GMA composite containing a Ba-Al-F-silicate glass
filler, there is no acid-base reaction. The only source of fluoride comes from the glass
filler particles, resulting in a slow diffusive release. Moreover, the polymer
composition of Charisma does not contain HEMA, which would increase the hydrophilicity
of the matrix and facilitate the transport of water and fluoride ions<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Composites have fluoride levels much
lower than the levels released from conventional GICs or RMGICs and also somewhat lower
than polyacid-modified composite resins<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>Under the <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation of high cariogenic challenge used in this
study, the fluoride-containing restorative materials did not completely inhibit dentin
microhardness loss around the restorations. As fluoride release from different materials
may drop to very low levels after a higher initial release of ions<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, fluoridation of restoratives with
fluoride gels could be an interesting strategy to maintain increased levels of fluoride
in surfaces with a high risk of developing caries. Some guidelines for the use of
topical fluoride in high-risk patients are available. In the present study, an intensive
therapeutic program was simulated with daily application of fluoride gel for 4
min<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. This could be applied
at home using a toothbrush or a custom-made tray, or it could be professionally
supervised for noncompliant home users.</p><p>The interaction of particular interest (restorative system x topical treatment) was not
significant at any of the distances studied. Hence, the analysis of the effect of
fluoride regimes is valid for all the materials tested. Neutral 2% NaF and 1.23% APF
gels promoted a similar protection against the progression of artificial caries lesions
on root surfaces. This effect is explained by the capacity of fluoride to precipitate a
calcium fluoride-like layer onto tooth surfaces, which serves as a reservoir for
fluoride when the pH drops<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have also shown that 1.23% APF gel is more
reactive than 2% NaF gel. CaF<sub>2</sub> formation increases in acidulate media with a
consequent increase in the superficial microhardness and acid-resistance of dental
structures<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, the
ppmF concentration of APF gel [12,300 ppm] is higher than that of 2% NaF
gel [9,040 ppm], with a higher formation of calcium fluoride-like
compounds in the former. The similar cariostatic effects of neutral and acidulated
fluoride gels were not expected. It is possible that the acidic pH of APF gel promoted
an initial microhardness loss in root dentin in spite of the higher calcium
fluoride-like compound formation.</p><p>The ability to carry out experiments under highly controlled conditions represents the
major advantage of <italic>in vitro</italic> experimentation<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. However, the pH-cycling model used to induce the
artificial caries lesions does not take into account the effects of loss of the dentin
organic phase during root caries, the effects of vital dentin reactions <italic>in
vivo</italic> or the activity of salivary enzymes, thus limiting its clinical
relevance. Nevertheless, the ability to quantify changes in mineral content in response
to fluoride-containing materials provided information of value in assessing their
potential to inhibit root caries<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> models for caries induction on root dentin can cause
superficial erosions that complicate microhardness analysis. Hara, et al.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (2002) suggested reducing the number of
de/remineralization cycles and the time of immersion in the demineralizing solution in
order to avoid superficial dentin erosion. In the present study, the model proposed by
Featherstone, et al.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (1986) and
modified by Serra and Cury<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (1992)
was adjusted to make it suitable for the microhardness test. Hence, the specimens were
immersed in remineralizing solution for 24 h prior to submission to three cycles of
de/remineralization.</p><p>The Knoop microhardness value evaluates mineral gain and loss over the course of the
de/remineralization process, taking into account the organic properties of the root
dentin. This is an advantage over other methods like microradiography that quantify the
mineral content of dentin and exclude the influence of the collagen matrix<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. However, dentin is more porous and less mineralized than enamel,
especially after multiple demineralizing cycles, confounding microhardness measurements.
The lack of indentation uniformity can also compromise the precision of microhardness
measures. Hence, to minimize the effects of the dentin substrate on surface
microhardness, a Knoop diamond with a 5 g static load was applied for 30 s<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> to imprint 9 initial and 9 final
indentations on a representative circular area of dentin around the restoration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Under the conditions of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, it was possible to
conclude that fluoride-containing restorative materials as well as fluoride gel
application inhibit the progression of caries-like lesions adjacent to restorations, but
are not able to prevent the formation of the lesion. Conventional GICs and RMGICs
reduced the microhardness loss related to artificial caries and could be recommended for
root caries control, primarily in high-risk patients. The use of neutral or acidulate
fluoride gels may benefit these patients, although the effects associated with
restorative materials have not been demonstrated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research study was based on a thesis submitted to the Federal University of Minas
