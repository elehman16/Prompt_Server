Psychological obstacles to recovery have been identified, but psychological and behavioural interventions have produced only moderate improvements. Reviews of trials have suggested that the interventions lack clear theoretical basis, are often compromised by low dose, lack of fidelity, and delivery by non-experts. In addition, interventions do not directly target known risk mechanisms. We identified a theory driven intervention (Contexual Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, CCBT) that directly targets an evidence-based risk mechanism (avoidance and ensured dose and delivery were optimised. This feasibility study was designed to test the credibility and acceptability of optimised CCBT against physiotherapy for avoidant LBP patients, and to test recruitment, delivery of the intervention and response rates prior to moving to a full definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised controlled feasibility trial with patients randomised to receive CCBT or physiotherapy. CCBT was delivered by trained supervised psychologists on a one to one basis and comprised up to 8 one-hour sessions. Physiotherapy comprised back to fitness group exercises with at least 60 % of content exercise-based. Patients were eligible to take part if they had back pain for more than 3 months, and scored above a threshold indicating fear avoidance, catastrophic beliefs and distress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>89 patients were recruited. Uptake rates were above those predicted. Scores for credibility and acceptability of the interventions met the set criteria. Response rates at three and six months fell short of the 75 % target. Problems associated with poor response rates were identified and successfully resolved, rates increased to 77 % at 3 months, and 68 % at 6 months. Independent ratings of treatment sessions indicated that CCBT was delivered to fidelity. Numbers were too small for formal analysis. Although average scores for acceptance were higher in the CCBT group than in the group attending physiotherapy (increase of 7.9 versus 5.1) and change in disability and pain from baseline to 6 months were greater in the CCBT group than in the physiotherapy group, these findings should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CCBT is a credible and acceptable intervention for LBP patients who exhibit psychological obstacles to recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN43733490">ISRCTN43733490</ext-link>, registered 15/12/2010.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12891-015-0594-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Feasibility trial</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Chronic back pain</kwd><kwd>Fear avoidance</kwd><kwd>Contexual cognitive behavioural therapy</kwd><kwd>Acceptance and commitment</kwd><kwd>Sub-groups</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Acceptability &#x00026; credibility</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Low back pain continues to be a major cause of disability worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Psychological obstacles for recovery have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and psychological interventions, primarily based on cognitive-behavioural approaches (CBT), have been tested in many trials. There are several systematic reviews of such trials in musculoskeletal pain populations, and in LBP specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The findings across reviews suggest that CBT is marginally superior to treatment as usual, but the effect sizes for key outcomes are small (around 0.2) and the clinical significance of these effects remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Several explanations have been suggested for the disappointing findings. These include diluted interventions, in which psychology is offered by non-psychologists who are untrained or trained only for the purposes of the trial; psychology offered at minimal doses; the inclusion of heterogeneous groups and the failure to select and target sub-groups who would benefit from psychological interventions; and the failure to apply theoretically-driven interventions that directly address mechanisms or processes theoretically identified and demonstrated as necessary in producing positive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Fear avoidance, catastrophic thinking and emotional distress have all been identified as factors contributing to poor outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] indicating sub-groups with high risk. The principle of stratified care, in which patients are screened to identify sub-groups, and referred to matching interventions, has been shown to improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However the interventions, based on CBT approaches, have been less effective for high-risk groups with complex psychological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other psychological interventions, developed specifically to address these risk factors include exposure-based interventions. While case studies of exposure based methods have appeared promising, RCTs including these methods have appeared more limited in their success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The model underlying these treatments has been criticised as missing key therapeutic elements, such as specifically identified therapeutic processes, and an approach to positive goals and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Exposing patients to feared movements does not appear to generalise to everyday activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Optimal treatment for these patients remained unknown.</p><p>A model that may be more adequate for addressing fear avoidance, catastrophic thinking, and other emotional factors, and that includes specific therapeutic processes and an approach to goals and motivation, is the psychological flexibility model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Treatment approaches based on this model include Acceptance and Commitment Therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and can be more generically referred to as Contextual Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CCBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The current study was designed to overcome the limitations associated with previous trials, by selecting patients for evidence-based risk profile and offering a theoretically-based intervention, previously untested in LBP in a full RCT, which explicitly aims to target this risk profile. The intervention was designed to full integrity, delivered by experienced psychologists extensively trained and supervised, on a one to one basis and to sufficient dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Credible control conditions have also been highlighted as an area for improvement in trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The current study included a control arm of best practice as recommended by guidelines, by offering physiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The primary objectives of the study were to test the credibility and acceptability of offering CCBT to patients with high fear avoidance who had been referred to physiotherapy, assess recruitment processes and study uptake, assess the burden of measurement tool completion at baseline and follow-up time points, and test whether psychologists inexperienced in CCBT could be trained to deliver CCBT to integrity. The secondary objectives were to measure changes in Quality of Life outcomes relating to mood, pain, disability and functioning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a feasibility RCT comparing CCBT with physiotherapy in four NHS Musculoskeletal / Physiotherapy Services in England between September 2010 and December 2013 (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] for details). The study was approved by The National Health Service ethics committee, and at university level at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Participants experiencing chronic low back pain, suitable for physiotherapy-led treatment, classified as &#x0201c;avoidant&#x0201d; (defined via meeting set thresholds by endorsing at least one of the items measuring catastrophic beliefs, depression and fear avoidance on the Targeted Treatment for Back Pain (STarT Back) Screening Tool and scoring above 38 on the 17 item Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) were eligible for recruitment. The recruitment process was as follows: all referrals made to the musculoskeletal / physiotherapy services involved in the study were triaged by physiotherapy researchers. Those patients suitable were sent a screening questionnaire, and replies included consent to be contacted by the researcher. The Researcher contacted patients to further clarify eligibility and if eligible, invited the patient to attend a Physiotherapy Assessment and a face-to-face meeting with the Researcher. The Physiotherapy Assessment excluded sciatica or any other progressive disorders that may require a different clinical pathway. Eligible patients then meet face to face with the Researcher, and provided written informed consent. Baseline data were collected prior to randomization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>Consenting participants were randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive either CCBT or physiotherapy.

Session content was not structured, and at the discretion of therapists, included any features of CCBT they thought were appropriate at the point with that patient. The first session is dedicated to building a good relationship with patients and setting their expectations about the content and rationale of subsequent treatment. Subsequent sessions included a mixture of techniques based on enhancing acceptance through experiential, exposure-based, and mindfulness-based methods, using a present-moment focus, directed awareness, and values-based action. The number of sessions required by each individual patient was agreed between the patient and therapist.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Physiotherapy was delivered as usual within services, with the stipulation that it included at least 60&#x000a0;% exercise and comprised group sessions (in total not exceeding 8 sessions), with an allowance of up to 3 individual sessions at the start of treatment if required. This was a pragmatic trial, and physiotherapy reflected the variability within the service. The general goal of physiotherapy was to encourage re-activation. We monitored the content through self-report by the physiotherapists in short forms and observation sessions by a physiotherapist expert (AM) to ensure fidelity. However the exact content of the physiotherapy sessions could vary between therapists and patients, as is typical in the real world.</p><p>Both interventions were monitored for fidelity of treatment content and delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were collected from participants at baseline via researcher interview, and via 3 and 6&#x000a0;months postal and telephone questionnaires post-randomisation.

Analyses conducted were mainly descriptive and focussed on confidence interval estimation, rather than hypothesis testing, to provide estimates of the key trial parameters to determine whether to proceed to a larger definitive RCT. All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis with participants being analysed according to their randomisation allocation. Data were analysed at the end of the study when all data collection, entry and validation was completed. A-priori criteria to proceed to a larger definitive trial were established upfront in consultation with the Trial Steering Committee and are detailed below.</p><p>Credibility and acceptability scores were summarised by group. To assess credibility, mean scores and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals were calculated overall and by randomised group for the first two questions of the Borkovec and Nau expectation and satisfaction questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] (details in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To assess acceptability, mean scores and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals of each of the five Borkovec and Nau questions were calculated by randomised group. ANCOVA (adjusting for baseline value as a covariate) was also used to calculate the change from baseline to three month scores for the first two Borkovec and Nau, together with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals. In addition, treatment dropouts, the number of participants missing treatment sessions and withdrawing (from treatment, follow-up or both) in each arm was summarised.</p><p>To further assess acceptability, qualitative analyses were conducted independently by two researchers on the participant three-month interviews (TP &#x00026; JH). Directed content was used to explore consensus, and present the analysis backed by verbatim quotes to illustrate main points. Errors, omissions and commission were discussed and resolved between the researchers. Information from interviews with practitioners at the end of the trial was discussed and synthesised with data from patients, where appropriate.</p><p>Recruitment and follow-up strategies were measured by summarising eligibility, consent and randomisation rates both overall and by centre. The acceptability of measurement tool completion was assessed by summarising follow-up response rates overall and by arm at all time-points, by assessing the level of missing data (for individual items and for entire outcome measures) and via responses provided during the three-month participant interview.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Proof of principle and secondary analyses</title><p>Proof of principle was measured by change from baseline to three and six months on CPAQ Total score, summarised by point estimated and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals.

The mid-point response was considered sufficient in consideration that patients would have been referred to physiotherapy, and were expected to therefore have higher expectations for physiotherapy.</p><p>An acceptable level of treatment completion was set at 90&#x000a0;% of randomised patients completing allocated treatment. This definition does not take into account the number of sessions attended, because individual patients may have required different doses of treatment. Completion was therefore defined as cases where both therapist and patient agreed that treatment was completed.</p><p>To proceed to a larger trial, at least 3&#x000a0;% of all those referred should be recruited and at least 20&#x000a0;% of patients completing a screening questionnaire should be recruited.

Recruitment between centres differed: two centres relied on referrals from pain services and pain consultants, and did not recruit sufficient numbers into the trial (n&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5), so recruitment was suspended in these two centres. Exploration of the reasons for not recruiting suggested lack of equipoise and insufficient number of lower back pain referrals without further complications.

Therapists also reported that at times they felt introducing the concept of CCBT to patients was more difficult because patients knew they had been referred to physiotherapy, and therefore believed they required physiotherapy. Therapists would have preferred patients to receive some physiotherapy alongside CCBT.

In this study, credibility ratings were a little lower for CCBT than for physiotherapy as usual. A full trial that provided a combination of physiotherapy and CCBT against physiotherapy alone would probably achieve more equal ratings of credibility. In addition, despite the fact that small numbers did not enable inferential testing, changes in both acceptance and disability were greater in the group receiving CCBT than the control physiotherapy, suggesting that the intervention is promising.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>This study was designed to address limitations identified with current trials of psychological intervention for people with back pain. Our intervention was theoretically matched to known risk factors, and we attempted to combat the common practice of diluting the intervention by delivery from trained and supervised clinical psychologists, in one to one sessions, and at a credible dose. Despite this the study has limitations. This was a feasibility trial, and as such, was not powered to inform on the superiority of either of the interventions. The findings suggest that there is room to improve delivery (through inclusion of physiotherapy in conjunction with CCBT); methodology, especially in reference to collecting longer-term outcome data. The study findings are based on treatment delivery of CCBT by two therapists (although we trained four), in two centres, and therefore may not represent wider populations of patients and therapists.</p><p>Both qualitative and quantitative data suggested that some patients were well adjusted on entry to the study, despite our screening thresholds. Improvements on both screening and eligibility criteria are therefore indicated for a definitive trial, to ensure that the trial recruits the patients most likely to benefit from CCBT. For example, despite using fear-avoidance (38+ on the TSK), and a single item on the psychological sub-set of the STartBack Tool as entry requirements, therapists often reported that they considered patients to be reasonably adjusted. Considering the cost implications of providing one to one CCBT sessions, a more stringent cut point for high risk may be more useful. For the sample in this study, 8 sessions were not needed, and most patients successfully completed treatment with only 2&#x02013;3 sessions. This may not be sufficient for a population with more severe adjustment problems, and considering the criticism of other trials compromising psychological interventions by reduced dose, the dose offered in a definitive trial will need careful consideration.</p><p>Our findings suggest that the best placed centres to recruit to a definitive trial are centres in which there is a steady referral from general practices to physiotherapy, rather than recruitment through pain services in secondary care. In reference to lower than expected response rates, the findings suggest that this is a particular risk for a definitive trial, possibly because of the complexity of the target population. We devised strategies to increase the response rate to an acceptable level at three months and close to acceptable levels at six months, through maximising the use of reminders, phone calls and incentives.</p><p>Although we succeeded in monitoring fidelity through audiotaping in this pilot study, this method is unlikely to be practical in a large trial. Audiotaping sessions during training is probably a useful practice, but routine monitoring of delivery in a definitive trial might need to be done through form completion by therapists and analysis of exit interviews, accompanied by a small sample of audiotaped sessions.</p><p>Finally, around half of the participants in the current study reported leaving school before age 16. This might have impacted on their ability to grasp and use some of the more cognitive content of the CCBT intervention. We note, however, that the experiential nature of the CCBT approach would be more suitable than other interventions that rely more heavily on intellectual and verbal input.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Fit with other studies</title><p>CCBT belongs within interventions that are largely based on psychological flexibility model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], of which the most common label is Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT). ACT, which formed the basis for our intervention, has been tested with several other groups of patients, and continues to show promise. ACT is now recommended as a priority for research in several guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, a review of the evidence suggests that the need for a definitive trial in low back pain populations remains a priority: We identified 14 RCTs in other pain populations including pilot studies: 3 large (n &#x02265;100), 5 medium (100&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;n &#x02265;50) and 6 small (n &#x0003c;50). Overall, reviews of trials that include ACT-related interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] conclude that acceptance-based interventions appear to be beneficial in chronic pain conditions, although currently the evidence is limited. Most recommend conducting well-designed large-scale trials to ascertain the effectiveness. The information from the RCTs suggests acceptance-based interventions, such as ACT, have some benefit for chronic pain, however, there is a lack of high-quality quality evidence and further large-scale RCTs are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Implications</title><p>These findings, together with other evidence, help direct future trials. We should now build on our knowledge that we need to a) empower patients to make sustainable lifestyle changes within a biopsychosocial framework, b) tailor our treatments to the needs of the individual, and c) combine the expertise of physical therapists and psychologists- not just a single professional discipline - working together.</p><p>This means targeting outcomes that are applicable to daily living and easily generalise across life-spheres, screening patients and matching interventions to their specific needs, and creating cross-disciplinary synergies to deliver theoretically-fused interventions with agreed goals. Specifically, our findings suggest that a definitive trial of optimised behavioural treatment for patients with LBP who are high risk could offer CCBT, but should include a synthesis of physiotherapy and CCBT delivered by highly skilled clinicians.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from this study suggest that CCBT is credible, acceptable and promising for people with LBP who are also experiencing high levels of avoidance and distress. There is a need for a definitive trial using CCBT or related interventions, optimised by delivery, but combined with physiotherapy, to test improvements long term against credible controls.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12891_2015_594_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
