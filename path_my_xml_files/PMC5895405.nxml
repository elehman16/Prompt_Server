Three hundred patients who came for screening mammography were randomized for this study. A questionnaire with 2 parts was used: the first had questions that concerned the patient identification, and factors related to the pain during mammography; and the second asked about the scale of discomfort (no discomfort; uncomfortable; very uncomfortable; intolerable), and the pain (analogical linear scale) during the mammography. Each patient received 1000&#x0200a;mg of paracetamol, or placebo. Afterwards each patient filled out the second part of the questionnaire. Six patients were excluded from the analysis; this resulted in 149 in the paracetamol group, and 145 in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>The 2 groups were homogenous concerning the mean of the ages, weight, height, and breast size.

In previous studies, this practice was associated with more conservative treatments, and reduction of mortality due to breast cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>However, mammographic examination frequently causes pain, and discomfort while being performed.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> These complaints result from compressing the breast so that the woman is exposed to radiation for as little time as possible, and to improve the image quality.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> It has also been determined that the pain during the examination may be related to various factors such as the time within the menstrual cycle, anxiety, caffeine use, and previous history of mastalgia.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>One of the possible interventions aimed at soothing any pain, and discomfort felt during mammographic examination is analgesia, which can be achieved by using paracetamol. This drug is indicated for symptomatic treatment of pain, and fever, and it is considered one of the safest analgesics.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> For this purpose, it acts predominantly, by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the nervous system, and, to a lesser extent, by peripherally, blocking pain generation.</p><p>Thus, the present study was conducted with the aim of studying the possibility of diminishing the pain, and discomfort when performing mammography, by means of the use of paracetamol.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to test the use of paracetamol for diminishing the pain, and discomfort while performing mammography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design, and distribution of patients into the groups.

Sample rejection of up to 10% was taken into consideration, along with exclusion criteria. Two-tailed analysis, with a power of 80%, and the <italic>P</italic> value set at .05 were predefined. Thus, 300 patients were included in the study, distributed randomly, between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Women with a prior indication for mammography who were over 40 years old were included. These patients would undergo their radiological examination at the university hospital of the Federal University of Goi&#x000e1;s.

Each patient was signed a free, and informed consent statement form. The same member of the study team was then available for clarifying any possible queries that the patients might have. After that, the patient received an envelope containing 2 capsules of 500&#x0200a;mg of paracetamol (totaling 1000&#x0200a;mg), or 2 capsules of placebo.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Randomization</title><p>The randomization was performed by means of computer generation sequencing. Neither the investigators nor the patient knew how the group allocations were organized. The record book remained in the hands of the pharmacist of the study who, in turn, did not have any contact with the patients, or with the interviewer.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Preparation of the medication</title><p>The Farm&#x000e1;cia Artesanal (Artesanal Pharmacy), a compounding pharmacy that is duly licensed and certified by the official regulatory agencies of the city of Goi&#x000e2;nia (Goi&#x000e1;s, Brazil), and that possesses the appropriate analytical, and quality assurance certificates, formulated the medications (placebo or paracetamol).</p><p>The pharmacist of the study, in the laboratory, was responsible for organizing the study medications by means of standard procedures, and quality control. The medications were prepared as follows: active group, with 500&#x0200a;mg of paracetamol per capsule for gastric degradation; and placebo group, with 350&#x0200a;mg of starch per capsule for gastric degradation.</p><p>The external appearance of the capsules for the 2 groups was identical.

A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risks for pain, and discomfort during mammography. The nullity hypothesis was rejected if there was a difference with significance greater than 95% between the groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a; .05).

Thus, 294 patients were analyzed. The paracetamol group consisted of 149 women, while the placebo group had 145 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The randomization of the patients between the groups made it possible for the groups to be homogenous, such that all the control variables were statistically, similar between the two groups, including the factors that could possibly, interfere with the intensity of the pain while the mammography was being performed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of the demographic variables between the 2 groups: paracetamol and placebo.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e0261-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The mean of pain experienced during the examination, according to the VAS, was 3.5 for the paracetamol group, and 2.9 for the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; .12).

Some studies that found low frequencies of reports of pain were based on questions asked by the professional team at the time of performing the mammography.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Other studies that also reported low frequencies of pain were based on investigations carried out sometime after the mammography was performed.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the amount of pain reported depends greatly, on the way in which the question is asked.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>It should be noted that the pain measurement can be performed by several quantitative questionnaires, and methods.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In this context, despite some criticism as the non-linearity of the painful representation,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> the VAS remains the main tool in clinical studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the current study, there was no difference in mean score of VAS among the groups. However, the evaluation of pain intensity divided by subgroups revealed benefit of paracetamol in the reduction of mild pain during mammography. Thus, the use of paracetamol as premedication can benefit most women who reported pain during mammography, due to the prevalence of mild pain among those who reported pain symptoms.</p><p>In addition to the technical variations relating to the manner, and timing of asking the questions, there are also individual variations that cause some women to feel pain more than others do. These variations are generally evaluated in relation to demographic variables (age and education), or individuals&#x02019; medical histories (smoking, caffeine use, menstrual cycle, and menopause). However, these variables may not be consistently, associated with the degree of pain during mammography.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> In the current study, none of the analyzed factors significantly, associated with the frequency of pain, or discomfort during the exam. Still, this information can help to identify specific subgroups, which might have higher probability of experience pain, and discomfort, such as women with previous history of mastalgia.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Such knowledge allows a customized patient approach avoiding breast discomfort, and pain.</p><p>Currently, despite the evolution of mammography equipment, and ongoing training of health professionals,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> the prevalence of breast discomfort remains frequent in mammography screening programs.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In the current study, the presence of pain, or breast discomfort was observed in most women studied, which is in accordance with other similar studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> These data reinforce the need for strategies for the control of pain, and breast discomfort during mammography.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only 2 other attempts have been made to administer medication prior to mammography with the aim of reducing the pain, and discomfort. In one study, acetaminophen was used prior to the mammographic examination, and was compared with placebo, with no observed reduction in breast discomfort among women who used the medication.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> In another study, women were randomized to use paracetamol, ibuprofen, and/or lidocaine gel. Only premedication with lidocaine gel significantly, reduced discomfort during mammography.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>Among the limitations of the study, it should be emphasized the subjective measurement of breast discomfort, considering the absence of validated scales for this evaluation. The quality of the mammography in the 2 groups was not evaluated because the medication did not interfere in the image acquisition process.</p><p>We are now trying out new alternatives for medications to reduce the complaints relating to mammography. The possibility of using agents with greater analgesic power may be a good strategy for reducing this problem that affects millions of women worldwide. Considering the safe profile, and clinical benefit in the evaluation by subgroups, paracetamol can be used as a premedication before mammography, and would be included in new clinical research trials for the control of pain, and breast discomfort.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of paracetamol before performing mammography reduces the mild pain caused by the radiological examination, and combined with its safe profile should be used as a premedication before mammography. The study design, and the homogeneity obtained validate the results, although new clinical trials should be conducted with the aim of seeking a solution for women that experience more intense discomfort, and pain during mammography.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> A.A.
