Secondary healing requires more attention than primary healing. Basically, two things, <italic>shodhana</italic> (making free from undesirable healing factors) and <italic>ropana</italic> (closure of wound), are desirable for proper healing. Many drugs have been described in classics for healing, but none of them is capable of healing the wound individually. Hence, to fulfill the aim, <italic>manjishthadi ghrita</italic> was prepared with the help of 7 drugs having <italic>vrana ropana</italic> effects and was evaluated clinically for its healing properties in this study. It was used topically in postoperative wounds, mostly of ano-rectal cases, twice a day, for 21 days. The follow-up period was 1 month to observe the healing as well as <italic>vaikritapaham</italic> (reduced deformity) properties and any untoward effects of the drug. A randomized control clinical trial was done. Out of 45 patients, 24 patients in group A were treated with &#x0201c;<italic>Manjishthadi Ghrita</italic>&#x0201d; (treated group), while 21 patients in group B (standard group) treated with povidine iodine ointment. Better result was observed in the treated group in comparison to the standard group. No adverse effect was observed in any patient. <italic>Manjishthadi ghrita</italic> can be prescribed as a local healing agent for common wound.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Manjishthadi ghrita</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>ropana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>shodhana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>vaikritapaham</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>vrana</italic></kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Ayurveda</italic> is an applied science and time-tested health system with vast scope of trials to prove certain principles as well as therapeutic effects of the medicines, which is the need of the hour to make the <italic>Ayurveda</italic> more acceptable globally. Classics of <italic>Ayurveda</italic> have emphasized at various places to take care of wounds which occur due to vitiated <italic>doshas</italic> or any trauma. Sushruta, an eminent surgeon of his era, was much ahead of his time in expounding and practicing the beautiful concept of <italic>vrana ropana</italic> (wound healing). The <italic>Shalya chikitsa</italic> brings out very clearly that <italic>vrana</italic> (wound) is the most significant surgical entity and the knowledge of its effective management for a surgeon is the basic skill required on which the outcome of surgery revolves. There is a constant need to deal with the inflammation as well as problems in healing in different surgical disorders. The process of wound healing is almost same at the terminal stages, whereas at initial stages it shows some differences and includes a number of cellular and molecular phases till the process of healing is completed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Since time immemorial, it has been an ongoing process to search out better remedy in order to overcome the previous drawbacks.</p><p>Exposure to infection and prolongation of inflammatory phase plays the prime role to delay the healing process, whereas creating the favorable conditions that allow the wound to heal properly is the ultimate aim of any surgeon. There are many measures to create favorable conditions for wound healing, such as use of antiseptic solutions and antibiotics to combat the infection, inflammation and many agents to remove slough/dead tissues to shorten the inflammatory phase and thus promote the healing process.</p><p>But these measures have failed to achieve good cosmetic effect by not producing minimal and fine scar formation. This is why the search is still on to find out a drug or drug combination which can fulfill the optimal requirement. The healing activities have been attributed partially by very few active chemical constituents like berberine in <italic>Daruharidra</italic> (<italic>Berberis aristata</italic> DC), anthraquinones found in <italic>Manjishtha</italic> (<italic>Rubia cordifolia</italic> Linn.), etc. and studies reveal that it is difficult to achieve the complete aim of wound management with a single drug. Hence, there is a need to find out a rational and optimal healing compound for the wound management in a better way. Here, it is important to find out a single and effective formulation which possesses both <italic>vrana shodhana</italic> and <italic>vrana ropana</italic> properties. Many studies have been carried out regarding <italic>vrana ropana</italic> some of the studies are mentioned here: e.g., (i) Clinical and experimental study of <italic>karpoora ghrita</italic> in <italic>vrana ropana</italic>, Dr. Harshit Shah, 2002, I.P.G.T. and R.A., Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, Gujarat; (ii) Comparative study of <italic>durvadi taila</italic> and povidone iodine in the management of <italic>dushta vrana</italic>, Dr. Lalit Pankhaniya, 2008, I.P.G.T. and R.A.; (iii) Clinical and experimental study of <italic>Yashtimadhvadi</italic> compound in vrana ropana, Dr. Rakhee Gupta, 1995, I.P.G.T. and R.A.; and (iv) Role of <italic>Snuhiksheer</italic> and <italic>Apamarga kshara</italic> in the management of <italic>dushtavrana</italic>, Dr. Jahagirdar Parag Vilas, Banaras Hindu University, 2003. But none has focused on the <italic>vaikritapaham</italic> properties of the drugs. In the present study, in addition to <italic>vrana shodhana</italic> and <italic>vrana ropana</italic> effects, <italic>vaikritapaham</italic> (free from any marked deformity), which is also the prime need of today's cosmetic era, has been considered. The <italic>ropana</italic> action is one of the most important actions amongst the <italic>vranasya shashti upakramas</italic> of Sushruta. Though the herbal drugs are prescribed with high appreciation for healing purpose, they need scientific validation with proper study design. Keeping all these factors in view, a group of certain effective drugs has been selected after reviewing the literature and a compound formulation of 7 efficient drugs named &#x0201c;<italic>Manjishthadi Ghrita</italic>&#x0201d; has been prepared in which <italic>Manjishtha</italic> (<italic>R. cordifolia</italic> Linn.), <italic>Daruharidra</italic> (<italic>B. aristata</italic> DC), <italic>Mocharasa (Salmalia malabarica), Dhatakipushpa</italic> [<italic>Woodfordia fruticosa</italic> (Linn.) Kurz.], <italic>madhuka (Madhuca indica</italic> J.F. Gmel), <italic>Lodhra (Symplocos racemosa</italic> Roxb.) and <italic>Rasanjana (Extractum berberis)</italic> have been included. Hence, the above compound formulation &#x0201c;<italic>Manjishthadi Ghrita</italic>&#x0201d; having <italic>vrana ropana</italic> (wound healing) property has been selected for clinical evaluation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To assess the clinical efficacy of the <italic>Manjishthadi ghrita</italic> (trial drug) for wound healing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The work was carried out after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethical committee, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Drug contents</title><p>An innovative compound <italic>Manjishthadi ghrita</italic> of 7 reputed drugs having healing properties, described in the <italic>Sushruta samhita</italic>, was prepared with <italic>ghrita kalpana</italic> in the pharmacy of Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, Gujarat.</p><p>Among the three <italic>ganas</italic> (<italic>Priyangvadi, Ambashthadi</italic> and <italic>Nyagrodhadi gana</italic>),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] the following seven drugs were selected for this study:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="Ayu-32-95-g001.jpg"/></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Drug preparation</title><p>After identification of the raw drugs at the Pharmacognosy laboratory, I.P.G.T. and R.A., trial drug &#x0201c;<italic>manjishthadi ghrita</italic>&#x0201d; was prepared as per the classical reference of <italic>ghrita paka kalpana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] and finally physico-chemical analysis of the prepared drug was done in the pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory of I.P.G.T. and R.A.

Granulation, collagen maturation and scar formation are some of the other phases of wound healing which run concurrently but are independent of each other.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] <italic>Ropana</italic> is always associated with <italic>shodhana</italic> because a wound cannot be healed if it is not <italic>shuddha</italic>.</p><p>Hence, the drugs, <italic>Manjishtha, Daruharidra, Mocharasa, Dhatakipushpa, Madhuka, Lodhra</italic> and <italic>Rasanjana</italic>, having both the properties, i.e., <italic>shodhana</italic> and <italic>ropana</italic>, had been selected for this study. After studying their properties, an innovative compound drug had been prepared and named &#x0201c;<italic>Manjishthadi Ghrita</italic>&#x0201d; on the basis of <italic>Manjishtha</italic>, used as a prime healing drug described in ayurvedic literatures. An attempt was made to explore the <italic>shodhana</italic> and <italic>ropana</italic> properties of the trial drug scientifically. <italic>Vrana ropana</italic> involves <italic>shodhana</italic> followed by <italic>ropana</italic>; two stages happen practically, i.e., subsiding local <italic>shotha</italic> by removal of local <italic>dhatu dushti</italic>, followed by initiation of <italic>ropana</italic> process, i.e., contraction and covering of wound by epithelial layers.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Removal of local <italic>dhatu dushti</italic></title><p>The grading of <italic>shuddha</italic> wound depends on the amount of <italic>dushti</italic> present in local <italic>dhatu</italic>, i.e., <italic>twaka</italic> and <italic>mamsa</italic> with <italic>rakta dhatu</italic>. The trial drugs contained <italic>lekhana</italic> (scraping), <italic>shoshana</italic> (absorptive) <italic>sthambhana</italic> (coagulation/contraction) and <italic>rakta shodhaka</italic> (blood purifier) properties, along with <italic>samshodhana</italic> (detoxifying, cleansing) which provided the desired effect. The <italic>ropana</italic> of <italic>vrana</italic> (wound) could have been possible after <italic>shodhana</italic> (medical debridement) due to removal of <italic>dhatu dushti</italic> with the help of <italic>Yogavahi</italic> (catalytic) properties of <italic>go-ghrita. Yogavahi</italic> (catalytic) properties of <italic>go-ghrita</italic> which removed and clean <italic>dhatu dushti</italic> as well as carried out the <italic>shodhana</italic> (medical debridement) at the site of vrana would have been acted and promoted the <italic>ropana</italic> of <italic>vrana</italic> (wound).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Effect on the clinical features</title><p><italic>Ropana</italic> (healing) of any <italic>vrana</italic> (wound) cannot occur without the reduction of the clinical features of <italic>shotha</italic> (inflammation). Though it is necessary for <italic>ropana</italic> (healing) of <italic>vrana</italic> at early stages, it delays the healing if persists for a longer duration. As stated earlier, the <italic>rasa, guna</italic>(s) and <italic>karma</italic>(s) of the trial drug helped to check the clinical features of the <italic>vrana</italic>.</p><p><italic>Prinana</italic> (nutrition), <italic>dhatuvardhana</italic> (tissue growth) <italic>poshana</italic> (nourishment)-all activities must be performed by <italic>madhura rasa</italic> and it helps to contract the wound size by promoting fibrosis and epithelialization. <italic>Vatahara</italic> due to <italic>snigdha</italic> and <italic>guru guna, shothahara</italic> and <italic>dahashamana</italic> (anti-inflammatory) effects was observed due to <italic>sheeta guna</italic> and <italic>kashaya rasa</italic> which helped to reduce the inflammation and thus relieved the pain and tenderness. <italic>Rakta shodhana</italic> (purification of blood) was done by virtue of <italic>tikta</italic> and <italic>kashaya rasa. Pittashamana, varnya</italic> (coloration) and <italic>twaka prasadana</italic> (to make skin healthy) actions aided to improve the skin color by improving the local blood circulation. <italic>Stambhana</italic> karma was done by <italic>shoshana guna</italic> of <italic>kashaya, tikta rasa</italic> and <italic>vishada guna</italic> along with <italic>kledahara, raktasthambhana</italic> and <italic>chhedana</italic> activities, followed by <italic>krimighna karma</italic> (antimicrobial action) which led to prevention of discharge and secretions. <italic>Lekhana, kledahara, chhedana</italic> and <italic>raktashodhaka</italic> properties of <italic>vishada guna</italic> of <italic>kashaya rasa</italic> played important role in scraping out the debris and slough of the <italic>vrana</italic>. Infection was checked by the <italic>krimighna</italic> and <italic>vishaghna</italic> properties of the <italic>go-ghrita</italic> of the compound drug. Ultimately, normal scar tissue was observed with minimal size, near to normal skin color, smooth, even and regular surface with normal consistency. <italic>Balya</italic> and <italic>poshana karma</italic> of <italic>madhura rasa</italic> helped in promotion of healing by <italic>dhatuvardhana</italic> (growth of the tissue) leading to healthy and desired scar formation. <italic>Varnya, twaka prasadana, raktaprasadana</italic> properties of the <italic>madhura rasa</italic> with <italic>snigdha guna</italic> led to coloration of scar tissue similar to that of skin. <italic>Snigdha</italic> and <italic>balya</italic> properties of <italic>madhura rasa</italic> of the individual drugs as well as <italic>go-ghrita</italic> produced normal, even and smooth scar. Qualities of <italic>kashaya rasa</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] <italic>snigdha</italic> and <italic>laghu guna</italic> of the drug led to even and regular consistency of scar formation without any complications. Phytosterols, the chief components of <italic>ghrita</italic>, are known to be good emulsifiers, the property of which was assumed to facilitate the penetration of drug into the tissue. Tannins and anthraquinones are known antioxidants and blood purifiers with anti-inflammatory actions. As the oxidation process hampers the wound healing, antioxidants protect the tissue from the oxidative damage. Tannins also reduce the secretions, whereas palmitine and berberines both have bactericidal action and glycosides have anti-infective activity which combated the infection and thus prevented infections in the wound. Tannins, anthraquinones, berberine, and phytosterols &#x02013; all are anti-inflammatory and thus prevented the prolongation of the initial phase and reduced the pain as well as tenderness, redness, swelling like features, which led to progress of the wound toward healing. Tannins and phytosterols promoted the healing process by wound contraction with increased capillary formation and fibroblast proliferation, followed by enhanced rate of epithelialization. Glycosides accelerated the healing process and reduced the scarring, as the proposed mechanism of action involves the regeneration of skin through stimulation of stem cells that allowed healing without substantial scar formation. Ascorbic acid is an important requirement for collagen connective tissue synthesis which leads to wound contraction and scar maturation by cross-linking of collagen fibers. Vitamin &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; is essential for epithelialization which lessens the pigmentation and improves the condition of the scar. Fecal contamination of an anal wound gives rise to major local or systemic sepsis,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and as majority of the cases were of postoperative ano-rectal wounds, it can be assumed that the drug was able to prevent any such conditions of infection and thus helped in the healing process.</p><p>The statistical data revealed that highly significant results were obtained in size, floor, color, and margin as well as in features of the pain. Significant results were obtained in discharge and unhealthy granulation tissue formation in the wound in all the cases of both the groups, except one case in group A, which was due to irregular reception of the treatment [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Effect of therapy on different signs and symptoms in patients of group-A (<italic>Manjisthadi Ghrita</italic> group)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-32-95-g006"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Effect of therapy on different signs and symptoms in patients of group-B (Povidone Iodine group)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-32-95-g007"/></table-wrap><p>Average number of days required for wound healing was lesser in group A as compared to group B.
