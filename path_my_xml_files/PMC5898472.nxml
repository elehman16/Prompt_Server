Many people complement this practice with additional methods of hygiene <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Cleaning interproximally with floss or a brush, removing detritus from the tongue with a brush or a scraper, using an oral irrigator, and/or rinsing with mouthwash can all help reduce plaque, manage halitosis, and avoid tooth decay <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">While the efficacy of certain aspects of oral hygiene, such as toothbrushing, has been well established, there are less data on the virtue of other facets of dental self-care. For example, there is strong evidence to show that daily brushing with a dentifrice containing fluoride prevents more dental caries than using a non-fluoride toothpaste <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Studies also affirm that toothbrushing combined with flossing may reduce dental plaque, with concomitant reductions in gingivitis, more than brushing alone <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. There is also data to support the idea that children who use a fluoride mouthrinse in addition to brushing their teeth with a fluoride toothpaste have fewer dental caries than children who use fluoride toothpaste alone <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, a review of five previously conducted clinical trials found that subjects who only brushed their teeth showed less improvement in halitosis than those who brushed in addition to using mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, or chlorine dioxide and zinc <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">In the present study, we hypothesized that patients who brushed with fluoride-containing toothpaste in addition to rinsing with a fluoride- and alcohol-free mouthwash containing 0.075% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) would show greater reduction in dental plaque organisms than those who used fluoride toothpaste alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="p0040">This was a double-blind, two-treatment, parallel design, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at a single site. At the screening appointment conducted at the School of Dental Medicine, University of Buffalo, male and female volunteers between 18 and 70 years of age completed an informed consent form, a health screening form, and a demographic questionnaire. They were then evaluated by a dentist for oral soft and hard tissue health and underwent whole-mouth evaluations assessing six sites per tooth for gingival inflammation (Loe-Silness Index) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, gingival bleeding, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and dental plaque <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Subjects who met the following criteria were eligible for participation in the study: (1) good general health, (2) ability to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form; (3) willingness to comply with study procedures and sampling schedules, (4) at least 20 uncrowned permanent natural teeth, (5) gingival index&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;1.0<sup>10</sup>, and (6) plaque index&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;1.5<sup>12</sup>. Subjects were excluded from the study if they (1) had a history of significant adverse effects caused by oral hygiene products, (2) had allergies to personal care products or their ingredients, (3) had gross dental caries or extensively restored facial or lingual tooth surfaces, (4) had fixed or removable orthodontic appliances, (5) had removable partial dentures, (6) had a history of, or current, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, heart disease, alcoholism, recreational drug use or other serious medical conditions or transmissible infectious diseases (such as hepatitis or AIDS); (7) required antibiotics prior to dental treatment, (8) used antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, or anticoagulants in the prior month; (9) had significant oral pathology (including, but not limited to, gingival enlargement, severe gingivitis, moderate to severe periodontitis including&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;one periodontal pocket&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;mm); (10) had participated in a clinical study involving oral care products in the prior month; (11) reported currently being pregnant or breast-feeding, or (12) had lip or tongue piercings.</p><p id="p0045">The details of the study were explained to each eligible subject, who were given the opportunity to ask for any needed clarification. They acknowledged their consent and their willingness to comply with study procedures and sampling schedules by signing the informed consent form. The clinical protocol and consent forms were reviewed and approved by the University at Buffalo Health Sciences Institutional Review Board with the study conducted at the School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo.</p><p id="p0050">Subjects were instructed to refrain from oral hygiene for 12&#x000a0;h and from food, drink or smoking for at least 4&#x000a0;h before the baseline, two-week and four-week examinations. At the baseline and four-week examinations, the subjects underwent whole-mouth evaluations at six sites for clinical parameters. Clinical evaluations included assessments for gingival inflammation (Loe-Silness Index) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, gingival bleeding, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and dental plaque <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and full-mouth pocket probing depths using a University of Michigan probe <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Supragingival dental plaque was collected at the baseline, two-week, and four-week examinations for microbiological analysis of bacteria. At each examination, plaque samples for microbiological analyses were randomly collected from either the upper right or left quadrants.</p><p id="p0055">After the baseline examination and dental plaque sampling conducted by a dental professional, the subjects were randomly assigned to test or control groups using a computer-generated assignment sequence by a study co-ordinator. Subjects assigned to the test group were instructed to brush twice daily (morning and evening) with a commercially available regular fluoride toothpaste (Colgate Dental Cream, Colgate Great Regular Flavor, Colgate-Palmolive Company New York, NY) and soft-bristled toothbrush (Colgate Extra Clean, Colgate-Palmolive Company New York, NY). After brushing, subjects were instructed to rinse for 30&#x000a0;s with 20&#x000a0;ml of a fluoride- and alcohol-free mouthwash containing 0.075% CPC (Colgate Total, Colgate-Palmolive Company New York, NY). Subjects assigned to the control group were instructed to brush twice daily (morning and evening) with a commercially available regular fluoride toothpaste (Colgate Dental Cream, Colgate Great Regular Flavor, Colgate-Palmolive Company New York, NY). All products were overwrapped, coded and supplied by Colgate-Palmolive Company, New York, NY with subjects and dental examiners blinded to treatment assignment. Subject recruitment commenced in March 2013 and the study completed in July 2013.</p><p id="p0060">Supragingival dental plaque samples obtained at the baseline, two-week and four-week examinations were dispersed by sonication and then serially diluted by tenfold in phosphate-buffered saline. Undiluted samples and sample dilutions 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> were distributed in duplicate (Spiral Systems Autoplate 4000 Spiral Plater) on enriched trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep blood (ETSA). The inoculated media were incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02013;7 days under anaerobic conditions. Viable counts for each sample was recorded as mean colony-forming units (CFU)/ml from duplicate cultures from dilutions demonstrating at least 20&#x000a0;colony-forming units.

Viable counts from the bacterial cultures were calculated as the mean colony-forming units (CFU)/ml of duplicate cultures from dilutions demonstrating at least 20&#x000a0;colony-forming units. The viable counts were log transformed (log<sub>10</sub>) for analysis. Mean scores were computed for gingival index, bleeding index and plaque index scores at the baseline and four-week whole mouth examinations. Demographic results between the two treatment groups were compared by a chi-square analysis. Clinical and microbiological data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired t-tests, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). All statistical tests of hypotheses were two-sided and employed a level of significance of &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05.

Microbiological changes were measured after two weeks and four weeks of product use while clinical efficacy measured as gingival inflammation, gingival bleeding, dental plaque, and pocket depth was measured after four weeks of product use.</p><p id="p0115">We have previously demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Those studies examined the <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial effects of commercially available 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse on strains of oral bacteria found in health, dental caries, gingivitis, halitosis and periodontitis as well as non-oral microorganisms and yeasts sometimes found in the oral cavity. Oral strains of Actinomyces, Campylobacter, Moraxella, Veillonella, periodontal pathogens including <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> and <italic>P. nigrescens</italic>, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and non-oral species including <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were inhibited by cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> antimicrobial testing of human supragingival dental plaque samples in that study&#x02013;reflecting a spectrum of cultivable dental plaque microorganisms&#x02014;showed a greater than 90% reduction in the number of supragingival plaque bacteria cultivable on media containing 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride. The negative control exhibited significantly less antimicrobial activity. Those studies, therefore, provide a biological basis for the present clinical study that demonstrates the efficacy of a fluoride- and alcohol-free cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse in reducing supragingival plaque and plaque-associated gingivitis.</p><p id="p0120">Results in the present study are consistent with the reductions in dental plaque and gingivitis noted in previous research that also included the use of a CPC mouthrinse for oral hygiene. Allen et al. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> reported that subjects using 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses had more significant reductions in clinical evaluations for supragingival dental plaque than subjects using a fluoride rinse. The mean percent reduction in anaerobic bacteria for subjects using cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse was 57.9% after fourteen days of use compared to subjects using the fluoride mouthrinse. Hernandez-Cott et al. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> examined subjects using a 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse compared to subjects using a mouthrinse without cetylpyridinium chloride and found that, after seven days of product use and 12&#x000a0;h after rinsing, the 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse group exhibited statistically significant greater reductions in whole-mouth plaque, interproximal plaque and in plaque index scores. Lotufo et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> reported that after seven days of product use and 12&#x000a0;h after rinsing, mean plaque levels for subjects who brushed their teeth for 1&#x000a0;min, rinsed their mouths with water after brushing, and then rinsed for 1&#x000a0;min with 15&#x000a0;ml of a 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse twice daily were statistically significantly lower (29.3%, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) than the control group, who followed the same protocol but used a mouthrinse without 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride.</p><p id="p0125">A recent six-month study of the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> reports similar findings as the present study regarding reductions in the number of anaerobic plaque bacteria. In that study, subjects were instructed to brush three times a day followed by rinsing with a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse or vehicle control without cetylpyridinium chloride. Three- and six-month evaluations were performed two to 3&#x000a0;h after toothbrushing and rinsing. In the cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse group, the number of anaerobic bacteria in pooled supragingival plaque and unstimulated saliva samples was reduced two to three times (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) after six months (1.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/ml) compared to baseline (4.7&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/ml), but the number of anaerobic bacteria was not reduced in the control group after six months (3.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/ml at baseline vs 1.6&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/ml after six months). There were also significant reductions in clinical measures of dental plaque but not in clinical measures of gingival bleeding.</p><p id="p0130">Independent use of a cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse can have significant benefits for overall health. Jeffcoat et al. <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> found that pregnant women with periodontal disease who rinsed twice daily for 30&#x000a0;s after regular toothbrushing with 20&#x000a0;mL of an alcohol-free antimicrobial mouthrinse containing 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride had a lower incidence of preterm low birthweight compared to control subjects who were instructed to rinse with water. Subjects in the 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinse group had babies with significantly higher gestational age and birthweight compared to the control group.</p><p id="p0135">This study recruited adults of either gender from the general population who were from the local community but were not seeking any dental or medical care. Subjects with gingivitis and a complement of natural teeth who qualified for other study criteria were enrolled but study population did not include those with periodontal disease or other oral conditions. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to a test group and provided instructions for use of assigned treatments with all of these steps conducted using standardized procedures. Subjects were instructed to perform oral hygiene with provided treatments twice daily and were reminded of these instructions at intervals over the study duration. To reduce the influences of other oral hygiene formulations or procedures, subjects were instructed to refrain from interdental cleaning, flossing or other commercial formulations unassociated with the study. Additionally, this study sought to reduce the influences of other subject features such as systemic diseases, prescription medications, pregnancy or any other chronic conditions by excluding individuals who reported any of these indications during their screening visit. These above steps and subject compliance reminders over the study period were designed to examine the effects of these treatments on community dwelling adults.</p><p id="p0140">In summary, the results from this double-blind clinical study demonstrate that after two weeks and four weeks of subjects' twice-daily brushing with a commercially-available regular fluoride toothpaste and rinsing with a commercially available fluoride-free and alcohol-free 0.075% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash, samples taken 12&#x000a0;h after oral hygiene had significantly greater reductions in the number of oral bacteria compared to those who only brushed twice a day with a commercially-available regular fluoride toothpaste. In addition, after four weeks of twice-daily brushing with a commercially-available regular fluoride toothpaste and rinsing with a commercially available fluoride-free and alcohol-free 0.075% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash, subjects' samples taken 12&#x000a0;h after oral hygiene had significantly greater reductions in gingivitis, dental plaque, gingival bleeding and probing depth compared to subjects who only brushed twice a day with a commercially available regular fluoride toothpaste.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Sources of funding</title><p id="p0145">This study was supported by <funding-source id="gs1">Colgate-Palmolive Company</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="p0150">Prem K.
