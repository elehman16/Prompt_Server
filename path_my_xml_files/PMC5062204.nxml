Parturient at term are susceptible for hypotension, especially in the supine position and with sympathetic blockade of SA; there is a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) causing a reduction in venous return, cardiac output, and dependent uterine blood flow. Various prophylactic measures are described such as traditional preloading or coloading with crystalloids/colloids to combat with vasodilatation or use of vasopressors to maintain vasoconstriction.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the review of clinical researches, it is observed that preloading helps to combat vasodilatation and decrease the incidence of hypotension immediately following SA, but due to conflicting results on the benefit of preloading, a concept of coloading with crystalloids has been found more safer and appropriate physiologically as it coincides with the period of spinal hypotension. However, a meta-analysis involving eight studies on 518 patients observed a similar incidence of hypotension and nausea/vomiting when compared preloading with coloading of crystalloids. Moreover, the efficacy of pre/co-loading of colloids was found similar to crystalloids in the prevention of postspinal hypotension so also the incidence of the requirement of rescue doses of vasopressors.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Since vasodilatation is the primary cause of spinal hypotension, it seems logical to use vasopressor like ephedrine which stimulates both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; adrenoreceptors to maintain normal cardiac output and uterine blood flow. There are ample studies for the use of pre/co-loading, timing of its administration, use of vasopressors, or combination of preload with vasopressors as prophylaxis to prevent hypotension. Currently, ephedrine or phenylephrine is used prophylactically or in rescue doses by intravenous (i.v.)/intramuscular route to control postspinal hypotension during cesarean section but with inconsistent results.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Ephedrine has been studied in different doses from 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg as prophylaxis to prevent hypotension.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] On comparison of three doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg of ephedrine, Ngan Kee <italic>et al</italic>. found the favorable vasoconstrictive effects with less detrimental effect on uteroplacental blood flow.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Lee <italic>et al</italic>. suggested larger doses &#x0003e;14 mg do not completely eliminate hypotension but causes reactive hypertension.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Based on various studies,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] we chosen a dose of 10 mg ephedrine bolus as prophylaxis and aimed to compare with the traditional crystalloid preloading of 15 mL/kg ringer lactate for hemodynamic stability in the mother as the primary outcome and neonatal effects in terms of Apgar score and cord blood pH values as the secondary outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this study, 115 parturient were enrolled for cesarean section during January 2012&#x02013;December 2014. After exclusion of 15 patients who did not meet the selection criteria, one hundred parturient of the American Society of Anesthesiologists grades I/II undergoing cesarean section under SA were included in the prospective, randomized, double-blind study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent were obtained.

Continuous monitoring started with heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), temperature, and urine output. Patients in Group P (<italic>n</italic> = 50) received ringer lactate infusion 15 mL/kg over 15&#x02013;30 min and in Group E (<italic>n</italic> = 50) received bolus dose of 10 mg of ephedrine i.v. within 1 min of SA. Under aseptic precautions with 25-guage Quincke's lumbar puncture needle, SA was given in left lateral position at L2&#x02013;L3/L3&#x02013;L4 space and 2 mL (10 mg) of heavy 0.5% bupivacaine was injected over 20 s.</p><p>Patients were given supine position with 15&#x000b0; leftward tilt. Another anesthetist who was blinded to the study groups observed the patient further. Sensory anesthesia was observed by pinprick method. Surgery started after the attainment of sensory block up to T5/T6 level. Intraoperatively, crystalloids were infused at 10 mL/kg/h. Oxytocin 20 units in 500 mL of crystalloid were given after delivery of the baby. Oxygen supplementation was given with oxygen mask done with 3&#x02013;4 L of flow until 30 min postoperative period. SBP, HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> recorded at baseline, 1, 5, 10, 15 min, and later every 30 min until 4 h postoperative period. Time of induction of SA to delivery of the baby (I-D), uterine incision to delivery of the baby (U-D), and total duration of surgical procedure were noted. After the delivery of the baby, Apgar score was assessed and noted at 1 and 5 min. The umbilical cord arterial blood gas analysis was done for pH estimation.</p><p>Any adverse events in hemodynamic parameters, nausea, vomiting, and chest discomfort were noted and managed accordingly.

The two groups were comparable for age, weight, height, duration of surgical procedure, time from induction to delivery of the baby (I-D), and surgical incision (U-D) to delivery of the baby. The upper level of sensory block was T5&#x02013;T6 in both the groups and no patient required supplementation with GA. After delivery of the baby, i.v. midazolam 1&#x02013;2 mg was given for anxiolysis.

However, two rescue doses of ephedrine required in nine (18%) and two (4%) patients in Group P and E, respectively, that was significant statistically (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025, &#x0003c;0.05). Thus, the incidence of hypotension was more in preloaded Group P than in ephedrine Group E. Ten babies in Group P had Apgar score &#x0003c;7 at one and 5 min, eight out of them improved after thorough oropharyngeal suction and bag-mask ventilation, while two improved after endotracheal intubation with intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. The differences in Apgar score of neonates in two groups were statistically NS at 1 and 5 min. Within 1 h postoperative period, five (10%) patients in preload group and two (4%) in Group E had risen in SBP &#x0003e;20%, but the difference was NS statistically. A significant tachycardia of &#x0003e;20% of baseline HR occurred in Group P 2 (4%), however these events were transient and did not require any medication. No incidence of bradycardia was observed in both the groups postoperatively. In the preload Group P, 13 patients had nausea and two patients had vomiting, whereas five patients had nausea, and no patient had vomiting in ephedrine Group E, and thus the difference in the incidence of nausea/vomiting was significant <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. The incidence of shivering was 12 (24%) in Group P and 4 (8%) in Group E which was significantly less in patients who received prophylactic ephedrine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023, &#x0003c;0.05).

Traditional fluid pre- or co-loading with or without vasopressors are the methods evolved over last few decades, but the use of prophylactic vasopressor is gaining popularity in the prevention of hypotension in cesarean delivery. Butwick <italic>et al</italic>. found in his review that i.v. crystalloid prehydration has poor efficacy, coloading with colloids is better, and pure &#x003b1; agonist phenylephrine is the preferred vasopressor to control hypotension.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Nagna Kee in his recent review observed the incidence of 71% of maternal hypotension following SA. The efficacy of fluid pre- or co-loading in the prevention of hypotension is questionable, and no fluid loading regime is 100% effective; in contrast, the use of prophylactic vasopressors has gained prominence for the control of hypotension by maintaining SVR, venous capacitance, and splanchnic venous tone, thus preventing fall in maternal cardiac output. Effects of aortocaval compression are also dependent on sympathetic vascular tone; hence, the current trend is toward the use of potent vasopressor such as phenylephrine to maintain BP, explains the relative ineffectiveness of i.v. hydration, and uterine displacement maneuvers.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] An effective management of hypotension with phenylephrine infusion along with coloading of crystalloids is well established and found minimal episodes of hypotension, less nausea/vomiting with better cord blood pH, and no adverse fetal effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Ephedrine has been a drug of choice for hypotension in parturient. Its sympathomimetic stimulant activity on &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; adrenergic receptors causes positive ionotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, maintains uterine blood flow, and relaxes uterine smooth muscles. However, its use should be avoided in patients with preeclampsia, thyrotoxicosis, and ischemic heart diseases for its hyper-reactivity. Efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg/kg i.v. ephedrine bolus along with 15 mL/kg of ringer's preloading have been studied by Kol <italic>et al</italic>. and found beneficial effects in prevention of hypotension, fewer rescue doses, less nausea/vomiting, and no adverse effects on a fetus with ephedrine bolus.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] We chose commonly available ephedrine in a dose of 10 mg i.v. as bolus for the study and in the primary outcome, we too observed the fewer incidences of hypotension and need of rescue doses of ephedrine as observed in other studies by Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>. and Ngan Kee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] As compared to 10 mg of ephedrine, higher doses of 20/30 mg were more associated with maternal hypertension and fetal acidosis was observed by Ngan Kee <italic>et al</italic>. and others.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Higher doses of vasopressors can jeopardize the fetal well-being due to uteroplacental vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow. Siddiqui <italic>et al</italic>. compared the effects of 100 &#x000b5;g of phenylephrine with 6 mg of ephedrine bolus for the control of maternal hypotension after neuroaxial block in one hundred cesarean deliveries and found it effective, as well as noted no significant difference in Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min in the babies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Chan <italic>et al</italic>. compared 20 mL/kg of crystalloid preloading versus 0.25 mg/kg of ephedrine for patients undergoing cesarean section under SA. He observed less incidence of hypotension, well-maintained umbilical arterial blood flow (measured by Doppler), and higher umbilical venous pH in group receiving ephedrine prophylaxis.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Ngan Kee <italic>et al</italic>. compared ephedrine in a dose of 5 mg/min with the traditional drug of choice metaraminol 0.25 mg/min and noted better control of maternal BP and higher umbilical arterial pH in patients receiving metaraminol infusion, but the Apgar scores were similar in both the groups.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study, as a secondary outcome, we also observed better Apgar score and no fetal acidosis when measured with pH estimation in patients receiving 10 mg of ephedrine bolus as observed by others.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, studies also report the higher incidence of fetal acidosis with ephedrine. On meta-analysis of twenty trials to find fetal acidosis with the use of ephedrine and phenylephrine found a better control on hypotension with both the drugs but decreased the risk of fetal acidosis with phenylephrine prophylaxis. BE values on blood gas analysis of umbilical arterial blood were significantly lower for ephedrine than phenylephrine. PCO<sub>2</sub> values did not differ in two groups, hence found no relation of pH depression with PCO<sub>2</sub>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Although ephedrine has a propensity for tachyphylaxis with repeated doses and it crosses the placental barrier, it does not affect the fetal outcome.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The increased incidence of nausea and vomiting is observed under neuroaxial blockade because of reduced perfusion of the chemoreceptor trigger zone leading to hypoxia and its stimulation. We noted significantly the fewer incidences of nausea/vomiting in ephedrine group as observed by others.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The incidence of shivering in ephedrine group was significantly lower than preload group in our study as observed by Chan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Thus, SA is the most accepted technique for cesarean delivery for its rapid action and satisfactory sensory and motor blockade with minimal complications in mother and fetus than with GA.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Jabalameli <italic>et al</italic>. studied the efficacy of three combinations of crystalloid with colloid and i.v. 15 mg ephedrine bolus with crystalloid or colloid. There were good maternal hemodynamic stability and neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min which were similar in all the groups. However, the use of crystalloid preload with ephedrine bolus was found to be more effective in reducing the incidence of hypotension.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Bhardwaj <italic>et al</italic>. compared bolus dose (E = 5 mg, M = 0.5 mg, <italic>P</italic> = 30 &#x000b5;g) followed by infusion (E = 2.5 mg/min, M = 0.25 mg/min, <italic>P</italic> = 15 &#x000b5;g/min) with ephedrine, metaraminol, phenylephrine, respectively, and observed maternal hemodynamics, umbilical blood gases, and complications. They concluded that all the three vasopressors are effective for control of hypotension without adverse effects in mother and neonate.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Moslemi <italic>et al</italic>. compared the effects of prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine (450 &#x000b5;g) versus ephedrine (45 mg) in 250 mL of normal saline as infusion over 30 min before SA and observed good maternal hemodynamic stability with both the agents, however better 5 min Apgar score and less fetal acidosis were observed in babies of parturients who received phenylephrine infusion.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Certain limitations in our study show that we have included low-risk pregnancies for cesarean section. A comparative study in high-risk pregnancies is needed to ensure the safety of prophylactic use of ephedrine in those parturients. There is a need to consider the effects on uterine arterial pulsation index before and after ephedrine injection. In our study, we observed 1 and 5 min Apgar and umbilical arterial pH estimation, but more evaluation of other factors of fetal blood gas analysis such as PO<sub>2</sub>, PCO<sub>2</sub>, BE, and lactates are required. Considering the changing trends in the use of vasopressors with or without preloading further study is needed to compare the effects with other vasopressors such as phenylephrine or vasopressin-II for the smooth control of maternal BP and neonatal effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To conclude, our study also supports that prophylactic i.v. bolus of 10 mg of ephedrine is more effective than crystalloid preloading for the maintenance of maternal BP near baseline, less adverse effects such as nausea/vomiting, shivering, and better neonatal outcome following cesarean delivery in healthy parturient under SA.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We thank D.
