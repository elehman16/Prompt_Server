Randomized trials suggest that probiotics significantly decrease the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the overall incidence of infection in critically ill patients. However, these studies are small, largely single-center, and at risk of bias. The aim of the PROSPECT pilot trial was to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger trial of probiotics to prevent VAP in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized blinded trial, patients expected to be mechanically ventilated for &#x02265;72&#x000a0;hours were allocated to receive either 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG or placebo, twice daily. Patients were excluded if they were at increased risk of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG infection or had contraindications to enteral medication. Feasibility objectives were: (1) timely recruitment; (2) maximal protocol adherence; (3) minimal contamination; and (4) estimated VAP rate &#x02265;10&#x000a0;%. We also measured other infections, diarrhea, ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, in 14 centers in Canada and the USA, all feasibility goals were met: (1) 150 patients were randomized in 1&#x000a0;year; (2) protocol adherence was 97&#x000a0;%; (3) no patients received open-label probiotics; and (4) the VAP rate was 19&#x000a0;%. Other infections included: bloodstream infection (19.3&#x000a0;%), urinary tract infections (12.7&#x000a0;%), and skin and soft tissue infections (4.0&#x000a0;%). Diarrhea, defined as Bristol type 6 or 7 stools, occurred in 133 (88.7&#x000a0;%) of patients, the median length of stay in ICU was 12&#x000a0;days (quartile 1 to quartile 3, 7&#x02013;18 days), and in hospital was 26&#x000a0;days (quartile 1 to quartile 3, 14&#x02013;44 days); 23 patients (15.3&#x000a0;%) died in the ICU.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PROSPECT pilot trial supports the feasibility of a larger trial to investigate the effect of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG on VAP and other nosocomial infections in critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01782755">NCT01782755</ext-link>.

Probiotics have been studied in randomized controlled trials in a variety of conditions in the community and hospital setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the intensive care unit (ICU), probiotics have been studied for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), potentially by enhancing intestinal barrier function and reducing the load of pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As the commonest nosocomial infection in the ICU, VAP is associated with a two-fold attributable risk of death, and an attributable cost of US$ 10,000&#x02013;13,000 per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>A recent meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials suggested that administering probiotics to critically ill mechanically ventilated patients is associated with a 25&#x000a0;% reduction in the incidence of VAP and an 18&#x000a0;% reduction in the incidence of all nosocomial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A subsequent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] of eight randomized controlled trials that enrolled 1083 patients in total and compared various single or combined probiotics to a control intervention (placebo, glutamine, fermentable fibre, peptide, chlorhexidine) suggested that probiotics might significantly decrease the incidence of VAP (odds ratio, 0.70; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, 0.52&#x02013;0.95). One high-quality randomized controlled trial compared a combination of oropharyngeal plus gastric <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</italic> with placebo in 146 patients who were expected to remain intubated for at least 72&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and found that those who received <italic>L. rhamnosus GG</italic> had lower rates of VAP (relative risk, 0.46; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, 0.26&#x02013;0.82). The three randomized controlled trials that reported diarrhea as an outcome found a trend toward a lower incidence with probiotics (odds ratio, 0.72; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, 0.47&#x02013;1.09; very low quality evidence); however <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> was not analyzed. There were no reports of nosocomial infections caused by the probiotic organisms in these trials. Although promising, these small (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50&#x02013;300), mostly single-center randomized controlled trials generate results that have uncertain internal and external validity. Therefore, while promising, current knowledge does not provide sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of VAP in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the context of a research program on probiotics in critical illness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we conducted a pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility of a large randomized controlled trials in critically ill patients, investigating whether orally ingested <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG prevents VAP and other nosocomial infections (Probiotics: Prevention of Severe Pneumonia and Endotracheal Colonization Pilot Trial, the PROSPECT pilot trial; NCT01782755). The criteria for feasibility were successful and timely pilot trial recruitment, high adherence to protocol, minimal open-label use of probiotics, and a VAP incidence of at least 10&#x000a0;%.

Analyses of feasibility outcomes were made on the full cohort of 150 patients rather than according to the two randomized groups to retain the blinding; thus, no comparison between groups was needed to analyze feasibility outcomes. The feasibility outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics as follows: (1) mean (standard deviation) number recruited across all recruiting centers per month; (2) overall proportion of doses received divided by total doses prescribed; (3) total number of patients who ever received open-label probiotics as a proportion of all randomized patients; and (4) the proportion of patients who developed VAP according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in a subgroup of 99 patients as assessed by five adjudicators, with disagreements settled by consensus.</p><p>No interim analyses or subgroup analyses were planned, owing to the short duration and sample size of this pilot trial.

In this cohort, many patients had nosocomial infections, and most were prescribed antimicrobials and developed diarrhea. No enrolled patients were lost to follow-up.</p><p>We found that this pilot trial was a worthwhile investment and that its completion will serve to enhance research efficiency. This pilot trial will maximize the chance that the future main trial is designed rigorously, conducted safely and efficiently, and completed as planned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Other strengths of this study include concealed allocation, and blinding of all possible parties (patient, family, bedside clinicians, research personnel, and biostatistician) which helped to avoid unequal co-interventions, ascertainment bias, outcome modification, and analytic bias.</p><p>The three PROSPECT substudies were also informative. We documented that research staff spent an average of 1&#x000a0;hour per day on enrolled patients, which is useful for personnel and budgetary planning. Additional specimen collection for a mechanistic substudy on serum markers of inflammation and the microbiome took 1&#x000a0;hour per day. The quality assurance substudy yielded reassuring results in that the bacterial content of probiotic capsules tested remained above the protocol threshold of 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG up to 2&#x000a0;years after the manufacturing date; however, we plan to continue performing quality control microbiological analysis, evaluating one capsule from every tenth capsule sheet (1&#x000a0;%) during the main trial.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the modest sample size to address clinical outcomes, although enough patients were enrolled to address our feasibility objectives. Accordingly, no significance testing between groups was needed for analysis to evaluate the feasibility objectives, thereby retaining the blinding. The estimated 19&#x000a0;% incidence of VAP was based on a sample of two-thirds of enrolled patients, not the entire cohort, as our fourth feasibility objective was only to ensure that the rate was at least 10&#x000a0;%.</p><p>The PROSPECT pilot trial will be an internal pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and patients will be rolled into the main PROSPECT trial. Indeed, beyond the pilot trial, we launched the PROSPECT vanguard phase to avoid complete study cessation and a hiatus between the pilot trial completion and the main PROSPECT trial start-up. That is, after the PROSPECT pilot trial enrollment ended at 150 patients, we analyzed the pilot trial results, and continued to enrol 250 patients. We are now poised to launch the main PROSPECT trial.</p><p>The clinical and economic burden of VAP remains high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the use of existing VAP prevention strategies is variable but disappointing in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; thus, a simple, inexpensive, and safe prevention strategy could further reduce VAP rates. VAP continues to be a key &#x02018;quality indicator&#x02019; for most hospitals in Canada (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.patientsafetyinstitute.ca/en/About/Programs/SHN/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.patientsafetyinstitute.ca/en/About/Programs/SHN/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>), and is emphasized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ihi.org/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.ihi.org/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>), which motivates identification of inexpensive strategies to prevent VAP that can be successfully implemented and that do not involve antibiotics, given the worldwide resistance problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Recently, a Markov cost&#x02013;benefit decision model determined that, from the hospital perspective, the VAP prevention strategy with the optimal cost&#x02013;benefit ratio included probiotics, a suction endotracheal tube, and the revised Institute for Healthcare Improvement bundle, which excludes oral care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our results suggest that a large randomized controlled trial of probiotics in critically ill patients would be feasible. Probiotics remain a promising method to prevent VAP and other infections in critically ill patients, with biologic plausibility, clinical promise, and apparent cost-effectiveness, based on data available to date. Also, probiotics might have other salutary effects relevant to the antimicrobial stewardship movement, such as decreased initiation of antimicrobials and decreased duration of antimicrobial therapy. Probiotics constitute a promising method to prevent infection in critically ill patients. The large trial that is required to inform the overall effects of probiotics on clinical outcomes is now underway (NCT02462590).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CLARITY, Clinical Advances through Research and Information Translation; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ICU, intensive care unit; PROSPECT, Probiotics: Prevention of Severe Pneumonia and Endotracheal Colonization; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1495_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>PROSPECT pilot center research ethics board information.
